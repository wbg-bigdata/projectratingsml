I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
1.01      Algeria's long-term development strategy has emphasized the rapid
establishment of a diversified and highly integrated industrial base within a
general policy of economic decentralization and regional development. Although
first priority continues to be given to the hydrocarbon sector as a means of
accumulating financial resources, the underlying strategy now is to: (i)
reduce the pace of investments in other industrial sectors in line with the
country's capacity to prepare and implement large scale projects; (ii) improve
and develop the non-industrial sectors especially housing, agriculture and
water development; and (iii) emphasize economic decentralization and balanced
regional development. Within this pattern of development, the transport
sector's supporting role is becoming increasingly critical for the country's
future economic growth.
1.02      The transport system, which was relatively well developed at
independence in 1962, was adequate to meet the demands of early development
policies. Its distribution closely reflected that of population and economic
activity. The shape of the transport system was dictated largely by topography
and particularly by the alternating mountains, valleys and plateaus which
parallel the coast. The northern region, with about 20% of the land area and
90% of the total population, comprises the narrow but fertile coastal strip
as well as the semi-arid valleys, rugged mountains of the Atlas chain and the
high plateaus. The southern region includes the vast desert that is part of
the Saharan tableland. The transport system is relatively well developed in
the northern region, whereas the southern region has only the main penetration
roads, of which the Transsaharan road, paved up to Tamanrasset, is the main
north-south axis. Because of difficult geography, especially in northern
Algeria, the most developed area, improvement of the existing transport routes
is difficult and costly.
1.03      In recent years the general development of the transport network has
failed to keep pace with the growth of commodity traffic, which has been buil-
ding up at an annual rate of about 12% as a result of increases in industrial
production combined with decentralization and regional development. During
past Development Plans (1970-73 and 1974-77) most investments were devoted to
industry and only modest investments to roads, railways and ports - about
5-7% of public expenditures. As a result, a substantial backlog has slowly
developed in modernization, rehabilitation and maintenance of basic transport
infrastructure. The transport system in general, and the road network in
particular, are now below standard for present and forecast traffic. Even
with the Government's revised policy of reduced growth in industrial invest-
ments, increased activity in the industrial sector is expected to maintain
traffic growth at about 8-10% for the next ten years.



B. The Transport System
1.04      The transport system currently consists of approximately 60,000 km
of classified roads of which 63% are paved, serving about 532,000 vehicles;
about 4,000 km of railways; eight major ports and one national shipping
company; four international and ten domestic airports and one national air-
line; and about 6,000 km of oil and gas pipelines (Map IBRD 12478R2).
1.05      Road transport accounts for by far the largest volume of both
domestic freight and passenger transport and its share of total demand has
been increasing steadily over the years. Roads carry about 73% of freight
traffic and 85% of inter-urban passenger traffic. Annual growth has been
rapid, namely an average of 16% for freight and 20% for passengers during the
period 1970-76. During the same period, annual growth of rail traffic has
been lower at 4% for freight and 5% for passengers (para. 1.07).
a. Highways
1.06      The highway subsector is discussed in Chapter II.
b. Railways
1.07      The railway system is operated by the Societe Nationale des Trans-
ports Ferroviaires (SNTF), a public enterprise responsible to the Ministry of
Transport (MT). The network consists of 2,700 km of standard-gauge track and
1,300 km of narrow-gauge track. Despite the implementation of a rehabilita-
tion program over the past five years, much of the network is still in poor
condition and extensive modernization is needed. The management of SNTF,
though adequate for present operations, needs to be strengthened with experi-
enced qualified personnel at all higher levels of management. Operational
efficiency has been poor, and this has been partly responsible for the rela-
tively slow growth in both passenger and freight traffic.

Source:  MT, October 1978
1.08      SNTF has drawn up an ambitious investment program which calls
for total investments of about US$2.7 billion equivalent over the next four-
year period normally described as 1978-81, but in fact relating more closely
to 1979-82, mainly for the construction of new lines in the eastern part of
the country and double tracking of some lines. Although consistent with broad
national policy, particularly its industrial location aspects, the economic
justification of the proposed program has yet to be established and the
alternatives in competing modes, particularly road transport and coastal
shipping, have not been fully analyzed. However, because of financial
restraints, the Government has kept actual budget allocations to the railways
through 1979 relatively mnodest, and investments are concerned primarily with
completing the backlog in track rehabilitation and equipment renewal.
c. Ports and Shipping
1.09      Algeria has eight main ports (Algiers, Annaba, Arzew, Bejaia,
Ghazaouet, Mostaganem, Oran and Skikda) and several small ones (MAP IBRD
12478R2). A new port is being constructed at Bethioua, partly financed by a
Bank loan (995-AL), mainly to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) and conden-
sate. Port operations are supervised by MT and infrastructure is the respon-
sibility of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). Responsibility for admin-
istration, operation and development of all ports lies with the Office National
des Ports (ONP) while the Societe Nationale de Manutention (SONAMA) has a
monopoly on cargo handling. A third enterprise, the Compagnie Nationale
Algerienne de Navigation (CNAN) which is the national shipping line, is



-4 -
responsible for berth allocation, towing, and cargo collection and forwarding
arrangements.
1.10      Imports, excluding hydrocarbons, increased from 1.8 million tons in
1965 to 10 million tons in 1977, an average annual increase of 15%, while
exports, excluding hydrocarbons and minerals, declined slightly. Exports of
minerals and petroleum products increased from 20 million tons in 1965 to 45
million tons in 1977. Algiers handles about one-third of all general cargo
traffic and Arzew handles about 50% of all petroleum traffic.
1.11      Algerian ports have a generally poor record and berth productivity
is low. The annual productivity of general cargo berths ranges from about
20,000 tons at Ghazaouet to 90,000 tons at Annaba with an overall average of
about 60,000 tons. The annual throughput at Algiers, where congestion causes
waiting lines of 20 to 30 ships, is about 80,000 tons per berth. The main
reasons for the overall low productivity of the ports lie in: (i) the low
labor productivity; (ii) poor coordination among the different agencies
responsible for port operations; (iii) lengthy customs formalities, particu-
larly for general cargo; and (iv) poor organization in the distribution and
collection of traffic. To improve port efficiency the Government is consider-
ing replacing the central agencies responsible for port operations--SONAMA and
ONP--by autonomous port authorities under the supervision of MT. Urban
congestion is also a factor which hinders the movement of traffic, particularly
at Algiers, where the Government is planning expansion of port facilities and
storage areas and improving access roads. Port capacity is adequate in the
western part of the country for present traffic as well as for that forecast
to 1985. Present congestion in the eastern ports of Annaba, Skikda and Bejaia
will be eased with the completion of a new port at Jijel (Bank loan 1427-AL)
and extensions to the Bejaia and Annaba ports. CNAN was given high priority
in recent Development Plans to support exports, particularly hydrocarbons.
Future investments in CNAN are expected to be relatively modest as the ship-
ping line is undergoing a period of consolidation rather than continued
expansion.
d. Civil Aviation
1.12      The air transport network includes four airports of international
standards (Algiers, Constantine, Oran, and Annaba), and ten domestic airports
served by Air Algerie, the national airline. In recent years, expenditures on
airport infrastructure have been made essentially for rehabilitation and
maintenance works at major airports to cope with the rapid growth in air
traffic. Future investments will be for completing the rehabilitation program
and improving terminal facilities. The share of domestic air travel in the
total transport market is small, but traffic is increasing at an average
annual growth rate of about 16%.
e. Pipelines
1.13      Algeria has an extensive network of pipelines for transporting
petroleum and natural gas from the Sahara to several Mediterranean ports.



-5-
Crude oil exports reached 52 million tons in 1976 and are expected to increase
to 60 million tons in 1981. Natural gas exports reached 8.5 billion m3 in
1976. The volume exported should increase rapidly to about 35 billion m3
during the early 1980s. A third pipeline for the transport of gas between
Rassi R'Mel and Arzew was completed in 1978 and further contracts were
recently let for two additional pipelines along the same alignment. With the
completion of these projects, total annual capacity for gas transport will
reach about 80 billion m3 which is adequate for the next decade. Total
installed capacity for crude oil transport is about 100 million tons per
annum and at present the Government has no further plans for expansion.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.14      The Government is expected to increase substantially transport
infrastructure investments under the Third Development Plan (1980-84) to
remedy the investment backlog accumulated over the years (para 1.03). Roads
and railways are the subsectors most in need of modernization, rehabilitation
and maintenance. The basic strategy in the sector will focus on improving:
(i) the main road network to meet increased transport demand together with
improved maintenance for all roads (para 2.03); (ii) railway operations,
modernization of infrastructure and renewal of the equipment (para 1.08); and
(iii) efficiency in port operations together with a plan for some expansion
of port infrastructure to relieve congestion (para 1.11). Investment budget
allocations for 1978 and 1979 have confirmed the shift in emphasis within the
sector towards the improvement of basic transport infrastructure in order to
support planned economic and regional development.
1.15      Several Ministries have basic responsibility for the main aspects
of the transport system. MT is responsible for the overall planning of all
transport sector investments in road, rail, port, and airport services; MPW
for planning, preparation, and execution of infrastructure works in roads,
ports and airports, and assistance for railway infrastructure; the Ministry
of Energy for pipelines. Overall sectoral planning is coordinated by the
Ministry of Planning and National Development. For road and rail services MT
acts through the Societe Nationale des Transports Routiers (SNTR) for road
freight, the Societe Nationale des Transports de Voyageurs (SNTV) for road
passenger traffic, and SNTF for railways. In addition, various state-owned
industrial enterprises also operate own-account road transport services under
the general administration of the Ministries of Energy, Heavy Industry and
Light Industry.
1.16      Coordination of investments for the transport sector is done by
MT on proposals submitted by the public enterprises and MPW. However, the
main concern of MT has been to reconcile the proposals submitted with overall
budgetary resources rather than to coordinate in an economic sense investments
for different modes. Like almost all sectors in the country, the transport
sector suffers from a shortage of qualified staff, resulting in weak sub-
sectoral planning and project preparation. The Government has started imple-
menting large scale training programs and has improved educational facilities



- 6 -
and is reviewing staff development opportunities to overcome this shortage.
In the meantime, however, the Government will have to continue to rely on
assistance from consultants for planning and project preparation. To improve
effective economic coordination of investments among modes, MT has recently
established a central transport planning unit.
1.17      The current structure of industry and trade in Algeria is such that
a relatively small number of public agencies and enterprises are shipping a
large volume of bulk commodities for which the railway is clearly the most
appropriate means of transport.  As the Government is largely responsible
for allocating traffic between road and rail transport, there is no major
problem of competition between modes. However, average rail tariffs are far
below average costs and, as commodity flows become more diversified, there is
an increasing risk of distortion in traffic assignment. A cost study is being
undertaken for SNTF by consultants and they are expected to recommend a
new tariff structure including substantial increases for passenger fares.
D. Previous Projects
1.18      In the transport sector, Algeria has received five loans from the
Bank, for a total amount of US$259 million, to finance two projects for roads,
two for ports and one for railways. The First Highway Project (Loan 912-AL)
has been substantially completed but not yet fully disbursed. The imple-
mentation of the Second Highway Project (Loan 1407-AL), approved in 1977,
is about one year behind schedule, because of an unsuccessful first round of
bidding for construction of the major component. New bids were received
in January 1979 and the contract is expected to be awarded end April 1979.
The Railway Project (Loan 996-AL), designed to support the railway's moderniza-
tion program within the 1974-77 Development Plan, consisted mainly of renewal
of motive power, rolling stock, rehabilitation of track and technical assis-
tance. The physical execution of the project is nearing satisfactory comple-
tion and procurement has proceeded on schedule. Several important studies,
however, were not completed at the scheduled closing date, which was extended
accordingly. The Bank also participated in financing a major port at Bethioua
(Loan 995-AL), designed for the export of LNG. Implementation of a Second
Port Project (Loan 1427-AL) has stsrted at Jijel; the new port would serve a
proposed new steel complex and provide additional capacity for general cargo
traffic. In general, project execution has been satisfactory.
1.19      Brief details of all transport projects are in Annex I.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The classified road network totals some 60,000 km of national roads
(Routes Nationales), regional roads (Chemins de Wilaya), and local roads
(Chemins Vicinaux Ordinaires) (Map IBRD 13997). About 63% of the classified
roads are paved and the remaining earth roads are maintained to all-weather
standards. Additionally, there are at least 20,000 km of unclassified feeder
roads and tracks, mainly located in the northern region and which are main-
tained on an ad-hoc basis.

Source: MPW, October 1978.
The network is concentrated mainly in the northern part of the country; three
major routes run parallel to the coast between Morocco and Tunisia; three run
southwards. The central route, of which the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road
section (para. 3.02) forms a part, runs southwards from Algiers through
Ghardaia to Tamanrasset, the most southerly town in Algeria (about 1,900 km
south of Algiers).
2.02      The road network was considered adequate and little investment
was allocated for roads during the 1960s and early 1970s. However, if the
network is to remain adequate, rapidly increasing traffic volumes following
industrialization and regional development call for the network's urgent
modernization, rehabilitation and improved maintenance. A large proportion of
the paved network is now in relatively poor condition due to a combination of
heavy traffic and inadequate maintenance since the early 1970s. Other roads,
particularly those crossing the mountain ranges between the coast and the
high plateau areas, have sinuous alignments, are inadequate for existing and
forecast traffic volumes, and are rapidly becoming bottlenecks in the network.
2.03      As a whole, the distribution of the network corresponds well with
the existing location of population and economic activity (para 1.02). In
relation to the agricultural areas, the existing classified all-weather
network provides an adequate density of about 1 km of road to each square km of
cultivated land. When account is taken of the unclassified feeder roads and
tracks, the density approaches 2 to 1, which is comparable to many areas in



-8-
Europe.  In most of the northern region, the average density of classified
roads is about 1.5 to 1, but in the high plateau areas it falls to 0.3 to 1.
These deficiencies of access in the plateau areas are dealt with through
special agricultural or integrated development programs. Also, with the
Government's current efforts to improve maintenance over the whole network,
including local roads, the level of service and accessibility provided
within agricultural areas is generally satisfactory. The main thrust for
rehabilitating the network remains with the national and regional roads.
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.04      The motor vehicle fleet has grown from about 172,000 in 1966 to
about 531,600 in 1977. About 39% of the fleet consists of heavy vehicles.
The development of the fleet during 1966-77 is shown below:

2.05      The level of motorization is one vehicle per 32 inhabitants, which
is low compared with countries with a similar per-capita income. The Govern-
ment controls the vehicle fleet by limiting imports and through the local
assembly of trucks and buses by public enterprises. Import controls, mainly
on passenger cars, made to limit foreign exchange expenditure, have resulted
in an important pent-up demand and very high resale values of used vehicles.



2.06      Most of the traffic is concentrated in the northern region and
particularly in the vicinity of the main cities such as Algiers and Oran and
in the Constantine - Skikda - Annaba triangle (Map IBRD 13997). Traffic
counts, carried out in 1976, indicate that national roads carry an average of
1,300 vehicles per day (vpd) with traffic volumes increasing to between 4,000
and 18,000 vpd near the main urban centers. Road traffic is expected to
increase at about 10% per year through the next Development Plan (1980-84)
and 8% thereafter.
2.07      Road transport is normally done by SNTR for freight and SNTV for
passenger traffic, but a large number of public enterprises also operate own-
account fleets (para 1.15). By law, private truckers may operate only one
vehicle of less than 5.5 ton capacity. Although relatively unrestricted,
private operators are limited mainly to local distribution as they are not
competitive with the larger SNTR trucks over medium and long distance hauls.
The distribution of traffic among carriers has developed as shown below:

2.08      According to Government policy, 50% of freight transport should be
left to SNTR. However, because of insufficient capacity the latter has
handled a declining share of total tonnage over the period 1970-75. It
maintained, however, its share measured in ton-km; 35% as compared to 17% of
the tonnage, thereby demonstrating the increasingly long-haul nature of SNTR
traffic. This developed as a result of the growth of own-account fleets,
which progressively took over short to medium-haul traffic. SNTR's capacity
increased considerably after 1974 and its fleet grew from 740 vehicles in 1970
to 1800 in 1976. Capacity increased over the same period from 14,000 to
36,000 tons with a 50% increase between 1974-75. In contrast, the 15 major
public enterprises with own-account fleets had about 6,500 vehicles in 1976
with a total capacity of about 66,000 tons. Total transport capacity is now
adequate for forecast long-haul transport demand, while excess capacity exists
for short-haul traffic.



- 10 -
2.09      About 90% of interurban public passenger traffic is handled by SNTV
with a total fleet of about 3,000 vehicles. In 1976 SNTV handled about 180
million passengers compared to 1C4 million in 1972, an average annual increase
of about 15%. The average length of haul is about 35 km. Following a three-
fold increase in its vehicle fleet over the period 1971-76, SNTV is now in a
sound position to meet the rapidly increasing road passenger transport demand.
C. Administration
2.10      Administration of the highway network is entrusted to the Direc-
torate for Road Infrastructure and Signalization (DR), which is part of MPW
as reorganized in February 1978 (Chart WB 19414). With the reorganization,
the activities of the highway subsector at central level are completely
separated from those of public buildings, housing and urban development and of
the other transport modes. MPW also has responsibility for port and airport
infrastructure and gives assistance to the railways for major bridges and
concrete structures. DR has full responsibility for design, construction and
maintenance of national roads but shares responsibility with the Ministry of
Interior for regional and local roads. Furthermore, DR provides technical
assistance to local authorities for maintenance of rural roads.
2.11      The headquarter staff of DR itself is small, but it operates in
the field through 31 provincial directorates, organizationally under the
regional governments. Unlike DR, the provincial directorates have maintained
responsibility for public buildings, housing and urban development, along with
that for roads. The Government is currently reviewing this set-up and expects
to separate responsibilities at the provincial level in 1980. The provincial
directorates, with their equipment pools, carry out construction and main-
tenance works on national and regional roads and provide assistance to local
authorities for maintaining local roads. DR ensures overall coordination,
provides technical assistance and supervises the operations of the provincial
directorates. The new set-up should result in better operations, especially
on low traffic roads in less developed areas; its efficiency, however, will
continue to suffer from a shortage of qualified staff, skilled manpower and lack
of maintenance equipment. All of these are being addressed under the proposed
project.
D. Planning
2.12      DR prepares road investment proposals, based on overall highway
development plans and projects requested by the provincial directorates. The
current highway development plan is largely based on a master plan and general
studies prepared by MPW's Office for Infrastructure (SETI) with the assistance
of consultants financed by the Bank under the First Highway Project. SETI was
dissolved when MPW was reorganized. Its functions were assumed by new plan-
ning divisions of MPW and especially by the Directorate for General Studies
and Regulations (Chart WB 19414).  Due to staffing problems, the MPW will have



- il -
to continue to rely on consultants services for project preparation and
planning; such services will be financed under the proposed project.
2.13      The main objectives of the current highway master plan relate to
the long-term pattern of the network. Specific studies to define a medium-
term investment program are proposed for financing under the project. These
studies would follow the general approach outlined in Annex III, which was
discussed and agreed with the Government during loan negotiations. Consul-
tants financed under the project would assist the MPW in preparing specific
studies within the general framework.
E. Financing
2.14      Until recently financing of capital and recurrent costs of all roads
was shared by central, regional and local governments. This arrangement was
not satisfactory and starting in 1979 MPW will assume responsibility for
financing of all national and regional roads and paved local roads. Local
governments will retain responsibility for maintaining unpaved local roads and
new construction of rural networks, within the framework of special agricul-
tural programs (para 2.03). For maintenance, planning, design and construc-
tion, DR will continue to provide assistance to the local governments through
the provincial directorates.
2.15      Total expenditures for roads have increased steadily since 1974;
budget allocations reached US$257 million equivalent in 1979, capital invest-
ments representing US$180 million equivalent and maintenance US$77 million
equivalent. Part of the capital investment budget allocations is currently
used for maintenance, for provincial maintenance organizations are poorly
equipped and inadequately staffed. As a result maintenance operations, even
routine maintenance, are often being entrusted to contractors, who in insuf-
ficient numbers and not interested in such works, carry them out at costs
which are three-fold over the same operations conducted by some of the
provincial directorates properly equipped and staffed.
2.16      Over the period 1980-81 total budget allocations in constant terms
would remain the same but the implementation of the improved maintenance
organization (para. 2.24) would allow the provincial directorates gradually
to assume more maintenance operations within the same amount of budget
allocations. These allocations, which are a function of the type of road,
traffic and climate, are adequate to maintain the network. In 1979, average
allocations for all paved roads amount to about US$2,100 per km.   Details of
highway expenditures are in the table below:

2.17      Government statistics on road user taxes and charges show that until
1976 revenues substantially exceeded expenditures. With increased budget
allocations for roads, revenues are now adequate to cover expenditures, and
would remain so in the future, as they are primarily a function of traffic
growth.

2.18      Foreign exchange financing of highway expenditures has been limited
to that provided under the Bank's First Highway Project, which accounted for
only 4% of total expenditures on national and regional roads over the period
from 1973-76. The share of Bank involvement will increase to about 10%-12% of
total expenditures with the implementation of the Second Highway Project and
the proposed Third Highway Project. With these two loans, the Bank would
finance about one-third of the foreign exchange cost of road expenditures
in Algeria.
F. Engineering
2.19      DR is responsible for the technical aspects of highway projects.
Feasibility studies are generally done by foreign consultants or by public
engineering firms operating in joint venture with foreign consultants.
Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the reconstruction of about
600 km of road sections were financed under Loan 912-AL (First Highway Project).
Other detailed engineering studies, mainly for the expressway network around
Algiers, were carried out by the public engineering firm, SATI, under the
supervision of MPW. During implementation of the First Highway Project, the
Government, assisted by consultants, drew up generai design standards for all
types of roads. These standards, which are satisfactory, were prepared for
the use of provincial directorates, to have uniform design and construction
standards applied throughout the country, and to facilitate the preparation
of budget proposals. The documentation consists of manuals for: highway
capacity; pavement design; design standards; stage construction; maintenance
operations; and construction costs.
G. Construction
2.20      Road construction is normally executed by means of unit price
contracts. The Algerian contracting industry consists of public, private,



- 14 -
and foreign firms. The Directorate for Supervision of Public Companies of MPW
(Chart WB 191:14) supe:rvises public road construction companies by:  (i)
defining their investment progrzms; (ii) controlling technical and financial
management; (i-, i) preparirg program contracts, w'nich because of large commit-
ments of the ccnstruc,'oni cnC-CsGtry uere never implemented; (iv) organizing
combined equipme-t and ma.teri½als purchases for several companies; and (v)
examining acnd organizing5 in collaboration with MT, transport needs for the
public coTmpanies. ?'FW has five public road construction companies under its
supervision.
2.21      Because of the low level of highway investments during earlier
development policies (para 102), the domestic highway construction industry
was hampared ir its grouth. Several major foreign construction companies,
at one t'me estcoli-'shed in Algeria, had their operations reduced and slowly
witndreu from the country.  To replace these companies the Government estab-
lished public companies supported by favorable financial arrangements.  How-
ever, overall leci 3f'- qualipfi.eci staLff hamper their efficiency and therefore
the Government decided that to implement most cost-efficiently its investment
plan, xtJhile allo2 ing time for :'1he development of the domestic industry, it
would rely on foreign contractors.  Msore technically complex investments are
therefore procured through international competitive bidding and the works
entrusted to foreign contractors. These are also projects for which sub-
stantial foreign exchange resou-ces are required and are most suitable for
international financial assistance.
2.22      In the meantime, less technically complex works, although also
procured for a substantial share through international competitive bidding,
are likely to be auarded to domestic contractors, public and private. Such
approach is expected to stimulate the domestic industry and allow time for
sound gro^uth and steady increase in capacity. The Government has taken steps
to assist implementation of foreign contractors and favor foreign-domestic
joint ventures, ease financial and administrative constraints, uhile also
addressing other problems such as limited supply of materials and personnel
and import related issues.  Public highway construction companies are not in
need of assistance from the Bank since their financial independence allows
them to hire expatriate qualified staff as to overcome in the medium-term
shortage of such staff. Government considers that avenues outlined above are
appropriate to foster grouth of the construction industry.
H.  Maintenance
2.23      The equipment pools of the provincial directorates carry out
maintenance of national and regional roads. At present, because of lack of
maintenance equipment and shortage of skilled manpower, the provincial direc-
torates rely heavily on contractors and rented equipment, both at a cost
substantially higher than the amounts allocated in the budget (para 2.15).
Maintenance, therefore, is not done on a regular basis, and the roads are
progressively deteriorating.



- 15 -
2.24      Following the recommendations of the maintenance studies carried
out in preparation of the proposed project, the Government has taken the fol-
lowing decisions to improve overall maintenance operations: (i) road main-
tenance operations financed from the maintenance budget and carried out
directly by specialized divisions of the provincial directorates need to be
extended; they should cover, not only routine maintenance, but also light
periodic maintenance - all other operations such as asphalt concrete periodic
overlays, pavement strengthening, realignment, rehabilitation, upgrading and
new construction will be done by contractors and financed from the investment
budget; (ii) the maintenance budget was increased to levels recommended by
detailed studies and based on the cost of the operations required, defined as
a function of traffic and climate; (iii) personnel should be increased two-
fold from the current 2,900 employees and more skilled manpower obtained
by implementing a comprehensive training program; (iv) equipment should be
increased two-fold as compared with present availability; and (v) within the
provincial directorates the road maintenance organization should be separated
completely from other activities to ensure that the maintenance budget,
personnel and equipment are exclusively assigned to maintenance operations.
The Government has already taken the necessary steps to standardize the
maintenance operations, and to increase the budget allocations. The proposed
project would assist in financing the reorganization of the maintenance struc-
ture; the implementation of a comprehensive training program for all staff;
and the purchase of additional maintenance equipment.
I. Training
2.25      MPW and Provincial Directorates' personnel comprise about 1,900
engineers, technicians, foremen, and overseers; 670 equipment operators,
drivers, mechanics, and skilled workers; and 330 administrative employees
(Table 1). Because of the low level of salaries, it is common for engineers
and the better trained technicians to transfer to public construction com-
panies where salaries are higher than in MPW. The yearly turnover of per-
sonnel is substantial, seriously affecting the operations and management of
MPW and the provincial directorates. The Government has started implementing
large scale training programs, improving educational facilities and is
reviewing staff development opportunities and compensation policies for
Government as well as for parastatal agencies. This review aims at achieving
equity and avoiding loss of Government personnel for more favorable employment
conditions in parastatal agencies.
2.26      MPW's Training and Tests Division, which operates within the
Directorate of Personnel and Training, is responsible for current training
activities which include: short courses to upgrade existing technicians and
foremen; and for training in Algeria and abroad with occasional fellowships to
engineers and, to a lesser extent, to technicians. Lack of local training
resources has made it impossible, so far, to carry out formal training
programs for skilled workers and low level supervisors on a systematic basis.
Five schools run by MPW offer two- and three-year courses for foremen and
technicians. The schools graduate a total of about 170 students each year,



- 16 -
half of whom are assigned to road operations. The systematic training,
retraining and upgrading of new as well as existing maintenance staff would
be an important objective of the project. Funds for training allocated under
the Second Highway Project (Annex I, para 4) provide the initial thrust for
an expanded and continuing training effort.
III. The Project
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would support the Government's policy to
improve the non-industrial sectors of the economy within a broad plan of
decentralization and regional development. Its objectives are to help:
(i) meet the backlog in modernization and rehabilitation
of the road network;
(ii)  improve road maintenance, particularly by establishing an
efficient road maintenance organization;
(iii) reconstruct inadequate road sections, which are bottlenecks
in the network, and could hamper regional economic develop-
ment;
(iv)  improve the institutional framework and the number and
qualifications of public works staff; and
(v) prepare road development plans and improve planning
capabilities.
B. Description
3.02      The project comprises:
(i) a two-year tranche of a five-year program for improving
road maintenance including purchase of highway maintenance
equipment to complete and expand, as necessary, the main-
tenance fleet for routine and light periodic maintenance;
(ii)  a two-year tranche of a paved roads pavement strengthening
program (Map IBRD 13997);
(iii) reconstruction and supervision of the 51 km La Chiffa-
Berrouaghia section of the National Road 1 linking
Algiers with the south (Map IBRD 13997);



- 17 -
(iv) training of maintenance personnel at all levels; and
(v) technical assistance to MPW for the preparation of
road development programs, feasibility and technical
studies for national, regional and local road sections.
Road Maintenance Program 1980-84
3.03        MPW, with the assistance of consultants, has prepared a five-year
improved maintenance program (1980-84), for which it has requested the Bank
to participate in the financing of a two-year tranche (1980-81). The first
two-year tranche of the improved maintenance program comprises the following
items:
(i) Capital Costs
(a)  additional road maintenance equipment and spare parts
for routine and light periodic maintenance;
(b) workshops and buildings for provincial maintenance
centers, warehouses and offices as needed;
(ii) Recurrent Costs
(c)  fuel, oils and lubricants for the existing and addi-
tional maintenance equipment;
(d)  materials and supplies;
(e)  equipment allocations, covering charges for full
maintenance, depreciation and renewal of existing
equipment; and
(f)  labor, administration and management of the main-
tenance program.
Besides the training (para. 3.15) recommended for the successful implementa-
tion of the maintenance program, the Bank's participation would consist of
the provision of the foreign exchange cost of all highway maintenance equip-
ment over the period 1980-81. A detailed list of items to be purchased was
discussed and agreed with the Government during loan negotiations.
3.04      The improved road maintenance program was prepared on the basis of:
(i) a detailed assessment of maintenance operations and needs; (ii) a recon-
naissance of about 6,000 km of road sections; and (iii) an analysis of opera-
tions of equipment pools. These studies, available in the Project File,
showed that, because of a shortage of maintenance equipment and skilled man-
power, 40% of the national roads and 75% of the regional roads are resurfaced
only every 10-13 years, which is too long an interval to maintain the roads
in satisfactory condition. With the proposed supply of maintenance equipment
and improved training, these long intervals would be reduced progressively to
about 5-6 years by 1984.



- 18 -
3.05      At present contractors carry out a substantial share of all road
maintenance operations. With the additional training and equipment, the
use of contractors for routine and light periodic maintenance would gradually
be phased out by 1984. Contractors would continue to carry out heavy periodic
maintenance and all new construction or rehabilitation works. The proposed
equipment would mainly go to the provincial directorates that were established
in 1974, and are insufficiently equipped.
3.06      All recurrent costs (items (c) - (f) of para. 3.03) will be pro-
vided from the general budget allocations of the Government to MPW for road
maintenance. These costs for the two-year time slice are estimated at US$113
million equivalent in constant 1979 prices or US$56.5 million annually over
the period 1980-81. The maintenance budget is expected to amount to US$77.4
million for 1979 (para. 2.15) and remain equal in constant terms for 1980 and
1981.
3.07      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that it will: (i) carry out the maintenance program in accordance with
a schedule setting forth physical targets and budgetary allocations agreed
with the Bank; (ii) provide all staff required for the carrying out of the
entire program; and (iii) renew or replace in a timely manner defective or
worn out maintenance equipment.
Paved Roads Pavement Strengthening Program
3.08      Roads will be rehabilitated by pavement strengthening and by rein-
stating the shoulders, embankment slopes and drainage systems. In some
cases, additional works (widening, realigning, improvement of shoulders, etc.)
may be necessary to provide an adequate level of service.
3.09      Under the proposed project the Bank will finance the foreign exchange
cost of rehabilitating about 270 km of road sections which represent the first
two years of a long-term program. These road sections were identified at
appraisal and their economic and technical feasibility established. Detailed
engineering and preparation of bidding documents was started by the Government,
with the assistance of consultants, immediately after appraisal, and detailed
engineering for about 170 km were available by loan negotiations for review
by the Bank. Bidding documents for these sections were prepared and advertis-
ing took place to allow for starting of construction immediately after loan
signing. The balance of the program would be prepared during project imple-
mentation and Bank financing would be on a program lending basis.
3.10      Pavement strengthening for these sections is based on the residual
strength of the existing pavement measured by the level of deflection and
traffic forecasts for a period of ten years. These strengthening operations
are proposed for road sections of adequate standards but inadequate pavement
structures.  Such strengthening cannot be met by periodic resurfacing, but
requires the construction of asphalt and bituminous concrete overlays.
Details on the technical and economic analyses, which are acceptable, are
recorded in the Project File. Some modifications to the two-year program



- 19 -
of 270 km identified so far may be made in view of priorities, but sub-
projects would be submitted to the Bank for approval before tendering of
the works. MPPW has shown that with the appropriate assistance of consultants,
it is able to develop a satisfactory rehabilitation program. Provision for
the consultants' services is made under the project.
3.11      The criteria for Bank appreval of road sections under the program
would be that:
(i)  the quality of the preparation and analysis of other road
sections is acceptable to the Bank (Annex II);
(ii)  the ER of the investment package is at least equal
to the opportunil:y cost of capital in Algeria (10%); and
(iii)  the implementation of an investment package will take
place at its optimal year.
During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government on
the methodology to be appl ed (Annex II) and on the criteria and procedures
required for Bank financing.
Reconstruction of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia Section of NR1
3.12      The 51 km La Chiffa-Berrouaghia section of NR1 is a critical part
of the major central north--south road (para. 2.01) which links the capital,
Algiers, with the region of the high plateaus and the south; it is located
where the NR1 crosses the Atlas mountains and climbs towards the high plateau
areas. Studies conducted under the First Highway Project indicated that
bottlenecks on this major section could hamper regional economic development
of the plateau areas and the south.
3.13      The existing road can only handle present traffic of 3,500 vpd,
including 20% trucks, at low service levels, although some improvements were
made over the years to attempt to meet increasing traffic demands.  The
deficiencies are: insufficient capacity for current traffic levels, sections
with narrow pavements (5.5 m) and shoulders, sharp curves, steep grades,
substandard sight distances, occasional flooding of a critical section. A
7 km section of the road follows the sinuous valley of the Chiffa river,
where the deficiencies are enhanced with even narrower pavement and shoulders,
sharper curves and occasional land slides.
3.14      The proposed construction would replace the existing road:  (i) on
the first 5.1 km section, with a modern two-lane highway with a strengthened
pavement; (ii) on 6.6 km of the second section through the La Chiffa valley,
with a two-lane highway with minimum characteristics to meet traffic require-
ments for about 20 years but at lower levels of service; (iii) on the re-
maining 17.1 km of this second section, with a modern two-lane highway with
climbing lanes and, on some sections, downgrade passing lanes because of
capacity constraints; and (iv) on the third and fourth sections, totaling
22.7 km, also with a two-lane highway with climbing and downgrade passing



- 20 -
lanes.  Details are available in the Project File.  Because of staff con-
straints, the Government has requested that the project provide for about
300 man months of consultants' services to assist MPW in supervising the
proposed construction.
Training Program
3.15      To strengthen MPW's capability to administer, control and manage
improved highway maintenance operations, the project includes a comprehensive
training program for staff and workers at all levels to be carried out in
training facilities partly financed under the project. Its aim is to improve
staff productivity and operational efficiency over the period 1979-82 through:
(i) training of 1,600 technicians, foremen, mechanics, and equipment operators;
and (ii) retraining or upgrading of 900 technicians, mechanics and equipment
operators. Table T-1 contains details on personnel needs of MPW.
3.16      To meet these aims, MPW would:
(i) convert part of two existing construction camps (Arzew
and Batna) into two permanent training centers, each
one with an adjacent mechanical workshop. The centers
would initially conduct short and long-term courses aiming
at better procedures and work methods required by new and
existing mechanics, equipment operators and drivers. (At a
later stage, the centers could also be used for workshop
seminars for low and middle-level staff);
(ii)  recruit expatriate specialist instructors to assist with:
(a) the implementation of training programs for both skilled
workers and intermediate level mechanical personnel;
(b) the training of Algerian instructors; and (c) the
upgrading of middle and high-level mechanical maintenance
staff such as chiefs of equipment pools, workshop supervisors,
and chiefs of brigades;
(iii) purchase the necessary training equipment for the workshops
of the training centers as well as heavy road equipment
for equipment operators; and
(iv)  organize periodic workshops and seminars on different
topics related to maintenance and equipment management for
the upgrading of middle and high-level maintenance staff
[(ii)(c)].
3.17      During loan negotiations the Government confirmed its intention to
strengthen the supervision agency of MPW and to carry out an in-depth study
of existing MPW schools to determine specific steps to strengthen their
present capability. Further, the Government also is carrying out a study, at
national level, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of current personnel
policies regarding recruitment, classification and remuneration (para. 1.16).
An effective personnel management policy is one of the major prerequisites
for the satisfactory implementation of training.



- 21 -
3.18      Details of the training programs were discussed and confirmed at
loan negotiations. Assurances were obtained from the Government that it will
make available a sufficient number of experienced Algerian technicians to be
trained as instructors, and ensure that the required number of personnel are
released from operational units for training in a timely fashion (para. 3.15).
These programs would be reviewed annually with the Bank and would take into
consideration any recommendations on training expected to be made by the
training specialists proposed under the project. The loan provides for
financing of all parts of the program. Under Loan 1407-AL (Second Highway
Project) provision was made for training and upgrading of middle- and high-
level supervisors.
Technical Assistance
3.19      The project would provide for technical assistance, consisting of
about 1,000 man-months of consultants services to assist MPW in preparing
comprehensive highway development plans, specific investment programs,
feasibility studies for about 800 km of roads, and detailed engineering for
about 500 km of priority roads. Technical assistance would be closely
integrated into MPW's planning capability. During loan negotiations terms of
reference (Annex III), in the framework of which these consultants services
would be used, were discussed and agreed with the Government.
C. Engineering
3.20      The maintenance program is based on:  (i) a general road maintenance
study by BCEOM (France), financed under the First Highway Project; (ii) a
study on equipment pools by OFFERMAT (France), financed from the Government's
own resources; and (iii) studies on equipment needs by MPW and the provincial
directorates. These studies were reviewed and discussed with the Bank and are
acceptable. Engineering for the pavement strengthening overlays was done by
Louis Berger International (USA) and BCEOM (France), financed under the First
and Second Highway Projects, and were based on the level of deflection and
present and forecast traffic levels. The methodology used for the pavement
strengthening was developed by the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees
and published in June 1978 by the Ministere des Transports (France) and is
acceptable. Engineering of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia section of NR1 was
0Læ -ied out by INGEROUTE (France), financed under the First Highway Project,
accirding to satisfactory design standards. All documentation on standards
and related studies are available in the Project File.

- 23 -
During loan negotiations project costs were discussed and confirmed with the
Government.
3.22      The cost of the maintenance program is based on the budget alloca-
tions for 1978-79 and the results of studies conducted by the Government and
consultants (paras. 2.24 and 3.20). Estimates for maintenance equipment are
based on current costs of similar equipment in Algeria. The cost of pavement
strengthening works is based on detailed studies carried out under the First
Highway Project for similar operations. The quantities were defined according
to the required pavement thickness determined by consultants. Construction
cost estimates for La Chiffa-Berrouaghia are based on quantities from detailed
engineering. Unit price estimates are based on a survey of 1976-78 unit
prices supplemented by detailed price analyses of the main construction items;
current unit prices for similar works were available resulting from bidding in
January 1979 for the Algiers-East expressway and for the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria
road financed under the Second Highway Project.
3.23      Cost estimates were updated at loan negotiations to take account
of: (i) the detailed list of maintenance equipment; (ii) detailed engineering
on about 170 km of road sections proposed for pavement strengthening; (iii)
detailed engineering for the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road section; and (iv)
current unit prices resulting from recent bidding.
3.24      The cost of the training program is based on consultants' proposals
and confirmed by the Government. The cost estimates for consultants' services
for highway studies are based on similar services being carried out under
lump sum contracts, on prevailing rates for feasibility studies and detailed
engineering, and on an average man-month rate of US$6,000.
3.25      Physical contingencies for civil works and consultants' services
are estimated at 10%; no physical contingencies are provided for maintenance
equipment and training since all items under these components are accurately
defined; contingency allowances for price escalation were estimated overall
at 16% (14% on foreign costs, 19% on local costs) on the basis of the imple-
mentation schedule (Annex IV).
3.26      The percentage of foreign exchange cost in total expenditures is
based on the likely blend of foreign and local participation. For pavement
strengthening the foreign exchange cost is estimated at 52% and for civil
works 40%. These percentages are based on detailed analysis of construction
costs, and reflect a declining trend in the foreign exchange cost of highway
projects in Algeria.
E. Financing
3.27      The proposed loan of US$126 million would cover the foreign exchange
cost of:



- 24 -
(i) road maintenance equipment and spare parts needed to
implement a start-up two-year slice of the improved
maintenance program;
(ii) a two-year time slice of the paved roads pavement
strengthening program;
(iii) reconstruction of the 51 km La Chiffa-Berrouaghia section
of NRI;
(iv) the improved training program, in particular equipment of
workshops, training equipment, vehicles and expatriate
training personnel; and
(v) consultants' services for construction supervision and
technical assistance.
3.28      The Government's contribution to the project and the maintenance
program would amount to US$243.7 million equivalent in current terms; it
would be composed of US$130.5 million equivalent provided under the regular
maintenance budget and US$113.2 million equivalent of capital investments.
During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that all
funds required would be made available for the proposed project.
F. Implementation
3.29      Annex IV shows the expected timing of project implementation, which
should be completed at the end of 1982; it was discussed and confirmed with
the Government during loan negotiations.
a. Responsibility for Project Implementation
3.30      MPW would have overall responsibility for project implementation;
through DR for the maintenance program, the pavement strengthening program,
construction of La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road and consultants' services for
construction supervision and studies; and through the Directorate for Per-
sonnel and Training for the training program. The provincial directorates
under the supervision of DR would conduct the maintenance operations and
supervise construction works in the field. The training program would be
organized and monitored by the Test and Training Division under the general
supervision of the Directorate for Personnel and Training.  Consultants would
be assigned to assist the provincial directorates in construction supervision.
During loan negotiations project implementation responsibility was discussed
with the Government and it was confirmed that provincial directorates are
under the full supervision of MPW.



- 25 -
b. Progress Reporting
3.31      Progress will be recorded and communicated to the Bank through
quarterly Progress reports. The Government will also be asked to prepare a
Project Completion Report within six months of the loan closing date. During
loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government on the progress
reporting procedures and the project completion report arrangements.
c. Procurement
3.32      Civil works will be carried out by contracts awarded through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement." Because of the difference in complexity of works, prospective
bidders for the construction works of La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road section will
be prequalified, while bidders for the simple works of pavement strengthening
will be post-qualified. The La Chiffa-Berrouaghia construction works will be
awarded in one lot to encourage foreign contractors to participate in bidding.
Pavement strengthening works are scattered all over the northern part of
Algeria and will be awarded by section or group of sections when distances
between sections would not cause delays in work. Bidders will be allowed to
bid for one or several sections in combination, although construction periods
will be concurrent.
3.33      Public companies, which are expected to participate in bidding, have
by law the following privileges: (i) they are not required to post bonds to
guarantee that the works will be completed satisfactorily, or to provide bank
guarantees to cover any advance payments made under the contract; and (ii)
they are entitled to a maximum advance payment of 15% while advance payments
for private companies are limited to 10%. For loan 1407-AL, Second Highway
Project, an adjustment formula was proposed by the Government for item (ii),
while item (i) has been specified in the bidding documents so that all
prospective bidders are informed. The Government guarantees works carried
out by public companies and therefore considers that bonds from public
companies are not needed, while private companies, which are not covered by
such guarantee are required to post bonds. During loan negotiations the
Government confirmed that it would provide: for item (i) a statement by
which it guarantees all obligation related to performance bonds or bank
guarantees for public companies; and for item (ii) an adjustment formula
acceptable to the Bank to be applied when comparing bids which include bids
from public companies and a difference in advance payments between public and
private companies is mentioned in the bidding documents.
3.34      The road maintenance and training equipment will be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement." Bidders will be postqualified and compete against minimum
specifications on the basis of cost, delivery time and reliability of subse-

H. Environmental Impact
3.39      Construction of roads to be financed under the project will take
place mainly on existing alignments and therefore will have minimum impact on
the environment.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The development of the highway network has not kept pace with the
rapid growth of road transport (para. 1.03). Heavy traffic volumes on roads
with inadequate design standards and insufficient maintenance have resulted
in high transport costs, unacceptable levels of traffic congestion and heavy
accident toll. Economic growth and regional development would be impeded if
improved maintenance operations, rehabilitation of pavement structures and the
elimination of bottlenecks in the network were not implemented.
4.02      The proposed project will provide improved accessibility throughout
the entire country, both regionally and locally. Reduced transport costs and
improved links between the coastal areas and the interior will facilitate the
Government's program of balanced regional development and growth in the
industrial and agricultural sectors. Through implementation of the improved
maintenance program, the maintenance organization will benefit from increased
efficiency and better management in its operations. Similarly, the proposed
pavement strengthening program will enable the best use to be made of existing
roads at minimum cost. Thus, in addition to transport cost savings in the
form of reduced wear and tear on vehicles and tires, the programs will result
in savings in highway expenditures such as costly rehabilitation or stepped-up
expenditures which would otherwise be necessary to maintain roads at accept-
able levels of serviceability. Last but not least, the proposed training and
technical assistance programs should considerably strengthen the organization
and administration of the road network throughout the country and help alleviate
the serious shortage of qualified staff at all levels.
4.03      The La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road represents an important section of
the main north-south route linking Algiers with the valleys and plateaus of
the northern region, with the Saharan oilfields, and with the extreme southern
part of the country via the Trans-Saharan road. The road will play a key
role in supporting the planned agricultural and industrial development of the
inland valleys and plateau regions, thus alleviating population migration
towards the coastal strip. Growing industrial centers at Medea and Berrouaghia
are directly served by the road while the important town of Blida liee im-
mediately to the north (Map IBRD 13997). The road constitutes an important
long-distance route, and through traffic, particularly trucks, accounts for
a substantial share of total traffic. The proposed upgrading and partial
reconstruction of the road, in an area of extremely difficult terrain, would
reduce vehicle operating costs and journey times, and would eliminate delays
and temporary detours related to the flooding of the existing road (para
3.13).
4.04      As the project covers the whole country, benefits will be spread
over a wide area and will affect a large proportion of total population. The
main direct beneficiaries of the project would be the public enterprises and
agencies involved in the trucking industry and private owners of cars, vans



- 29 -
and small trucks (less than 5.5 tons). However, benefits from reduced
vehicle operating costs accruing to public transport enterprises will be
passed on to road users in the form of lower costs than would otherwise
occur. Similarly, benefits accruing to other public enterprises should be
passed on to the general population by increasing their profits which are
transferred to the Treasury and through increased profit sharing by their
workers. Also, benefits accruing to private operators are expected to be
passed on to users because competition between private truck owners is keen.
Benefits from the maintenance and rehabilitation programs will accrue to the
Government in the form of savings in maintenance expenditures and in avoided
rehabilitation of many roads. As a whole, the project will result in sub-
stantial savings in foreign exchange which will follow from more efficient
use of existing resources.
B. Economic Evaluation
a.   Highway Maintenance Program
4.05      The economic evaluation of the improved highway maintenance program
has been undertaken by assessing the impact of improved maintenance levels on
the classified road network over a five-year period (1980-84). Existing
traffic volumes for the network were derived from nationwide counts and
surveys by MPW in 1976. Overall, traffic would increase with planned economic
development at 10% per year up to 1983 followed by 8% thereafter. The adop-
tion of average traffic growth rates for the network is not critical to the
economic evaluation. Benefits from the improved program include reduced
transport costs and savings in avoided rehabilitation which would ultimately
be necessary with the existing low level of maintenance. Details of the
evolution of the road network over the period 1976-84 by range of traffic
and pavement condition, with and without the proposed improved maintenance
program, are available in the Project File. Road user benefits for 1980-84
were established on the basis of the number of vehicle-km traveled in each
road category and the corresponding unit vehicle operating costs. The costs
of avoided rehabilitation were estimated separately.
b.   Pavement Strengthening Program
4.06      Existing traffic volumes on the various road sections analyzed under
the pavement strengthening program range from 1500 to 3000 vpd with an average
of about 2000 vpd including 25% heavy vehicles. Traffic growth on these major
roads is expected to be similar to the national average, consistent with
expected growth in GDP and manufacturing output. Benefits from the program
derive from the difference in vehicle operating costs on poor pavement sur-
faces over the ten-year evaluation period (1981-90) and initially excellent
surfaces which progressively deteriorate to poor; half of the total deteriora-
tion is assumed to occur in the last two years of the pavement's life.
Maintenance costs savings represent the difference between normal routine
maintenance and the stepped-up maintenance which would be necessary to keep
the existing roads at an acceptable level of serviceability if the pavement
were not strengthened. The Project File contains detailed estimates of the
benefits.



- 30 -
c. La Chiffa-Berrouaghia Road
4.07      The consultants' feasibility study for the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia
road reported fairly even 1977 ADTs over the road as a whole ranging from
about 3,000 to 3,500 vpd. Forecasts were based on a detailed analysis of
expected industrial and agricultural development within the broad influence
area served by the road and the effect of these developments on the long
distance and local components of traffic. On this basis, total traffic would
increase at 9% per year over the period 1977-81, at 7.5% up to 1986, and at
8.5% thereafter, reflecting the development of the valleys and plateau areas
of the northern region. For analytical purposes, as well as for subsequent
design and execution, the project road was divided into four main sections
(para 3.14) to take into account differences in volumes and composition of
traffic, terrain and construction costs. Table T-2 shows forecasts of normal
traffic for the four sections. Generated traffic has not been taken into
account, partly because traffic is considered to be rather insensitive at
present to reductions in transport costs in view of current controls on the
supply of vehicles and on the distribution of freight amongst carriers.
Traffic on the existing road in the narrow winding section where the road
traverses the Gorges of La Chiffa (Section 2A), will reach capacity levels
before the end of the 1980s and cause delays and serious congestion. Quan-
tifiable benefits from the upgrading of the road include savings in vehicle
operating, time and congestion costs. The savings result from improved
geometrical characteristics and increased capacity of the proposed road.
Additional benefits accrue from the elimination of delays and temporary
detours, caused by occasional flooding of parts of the existing road.
d.   Road Transport Costs
4.08      Road transport costs comprise vehicle operating costs and the value
of working time for vehicle occupants. Vehicle operating costs were derived
for six different classes of vehicles, some of which were subsequently com-
bined to reflect the traffic composition observed on the project road sections.
The six classes are: (i) light vehicles - passenger cars and taxis; (ii) small
vans; (iii) larger vans and trucks up to 5.5 tons capacity; (iv) 8-ton trucks;
(v) 12-ton trucks; and (vi) 20-ton trucks. Table T-3 shows road transport
costs. Vehicle wear and tear and tire costs in relation to pavement condition
were estimated by reference to Bank-assisted research in Kenya. On this
basis, the savings in vehicle operating costs between a poor paved surface and
a good one, amount to 30% for passenger cars, 14% for vans and 18% for trucks.
For the improvement of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road, unit savings in vehicle
operating costs in the opening year (1983) average about 20% for passenger
cars and vans and 15% for trucks (Table T-4). In the economic evaluation of
this road, passenger time savings were taken into account for working and
commuter trips which are valued at 50% and 25%, respectively, of representa-
tive hourly earnings. Time savings for leisure and tourist purposes have not
been taken into account.  Driver time savings for vans and trucks are included
in the vehicle operating costs for these vehicles.



- 31 -
e.   Alternative Improvements Considered
4.09      The improved maintenance program represents an optimal level given
the existing and short-term physical and administrative limitations of the
highway maintenance organization in Algeria (paras 2.10 and 2.11). However,
the effect of alternative levels of maintenance was considered by analyzing
the impact of: (i) immediate implementation of an improved program with
contractors undertaking about one-half of total maintenance requirements in
the initial stages; and (ii) a 20% decrease in the supply of equipment without
any change in the other components of the program. The first alternative
would effectively prevent any further deterioration in the road network but
its implementation would involve substantial financial and organizational
difficulties. A decrease in equipment availability would result in a more
than proportional deterioration in road surface condition, particularly in low
traffic roads, compared with the condition under the optimal level of main-
tenance. The alternative is however less favorable than the proposed program
because substantial benefits to the economy would be lost; the Net Present
Value (NPV) of this alternative program, discounted at 10%, is substantially
lower than that of the proposed improved level of maintenance.
4.10       Similarly, for the pavement strengthening program, two alternatives
were examined for each road section; (i) an overlay to support traffic over
five years (1981-85), later to be strengthened by a second layer for the next
five years; and (ii) an overlay for ten years (1981-90). For the economic
evaluation, both schemes were compared with the existing roads, with main-
tenance operations designed to keep an acceptable level of serviceability and
to avoid complete deterioration. The five-year scheme was found to have an
acceptable ER like the ten-year scheme, though its NPV discounted at 10% was
lower than that of the ten-year scheme. The additional cost of the five-year
scheme was not offset by any incremental benefits. The thickness and the
cost of the overlays are not directly proportional to the number of equivalent
axle passes and the cost of each five-year overlay is about 70% of that of
the ten-year scheme. Also, the five-year scheme would place a greater burden
on the administration than the ten-year scheme and therefore would not be
practicable.
4.11      Several alternative alignments were examined for the La Chiffa-
Berrouaghia road, but all presented topographical, geotechnical, and alignment
problems as encountered on the existing road. The population served by these
alternative alignments would be less than by the existing road. The analysis
of the alternatives was based on a detailed highway capacity analysis. Within
the valley of the La Chiffa River, the most difficult section of the existing
road, a more costly new two-lane road alternative was envisaged but not found
to be justified because only marginal improvements in geometrical characteris-
tics, capacity and serviceability were possible. As a result, the incremental
benefits over the proposed improvement were insufficient to justifiy the
extra cost of this alternative. The possibility of widening all sections of
the existing road to three and even four lanes was also considered, as were
the merits of stage construction of the road section in the Gorges, but were
found not to be justified. On the basis of these analyses, the Government
proposed the improvements under the project.



- 32 -
f.   Results
4.12      The improved maintenance program has an ER in excess of 200% and a
Benefit/Cost ratio (B/C) of 13 at a discount rate of 10%. The ERs on the
road sections analyzed in the pavement strengthening program vary from 10% to
50%. The improvement of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road shows an ER of 20% and
a First Year Benefit/Cost ratio (FYB) of 12% in 1983, its opening year. Even
under assumptions involving a 20% increase in costs and a 20% decrease in
benefits, the reconstruction of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia road would yield an
ER of 16%. If time savings, which represent 16% of total benefits, were not
taken into account, the ER would be 19% with a FYB in 1983 of 12%. The results
of the evaluation are summa ized below:
Best       + 20% Costs
Estimates      - 20% Benefits
Maintenance Program    ER (%)                        >200             >100

Pavement Strengthening ER(%)                         25-40             14-25
B/C                        1.8-2.4           1.2-1.6
La Chiffa-Berrouaghia  ER(%)                           20                16
FYB                           12                9
Ail Combined             ER(%)                         80               60
4.13      Each individual road section for pavement strengthening should have
an ER of at least 10%. The overall ER for all three quantifiable components
is evaluated at a minimum of 80%, maintenance accounting for 54% of total
expenditure under the project, 18% for pavement strengthening and 25% for La
Chiffa-Berrouaghia. This is a conservative estimate as many of the road
sections to be included in the pavement strengthening program have an ER
higher than 10%.
g.   Project Risk
4.14      Two main risks were identified at this stage.  First, in the event
not all equipment which is required to achieve optimal road maintenance
levels (para. 3.28) is timely available. This risk has been taken into
account by analyzing the impact on road network condition of a 20% shortfall
in equipment (para. 4.09). While an important part of the network could not
be adequately maintained or existing equipment would be used inefficiently,
the necessity for improved maintenance operations is such that the program
would still be justified even with a less than optimal volume of equipment.
Second, administrative shortcomings in Algeria, combined with the expected
heavy demand on the domestic construction industry (para 2.21), could delay
the civil works implementation of the La Chiffa-Berrouaghia section and
pavement strengthening programs. The Government's commitment to improve
the transport network (para 1.14) and its decision partly to rely on foreign
contractors for the implementation of its investment program (para 2.22)
can be expected to minimize this risk. Moreover, even if such delays were to
occur they would not reduce the economic returns on these works; the losses
to the economy would be in the substantial benefits that would be foregone
during the period of delay.



- 33 -
C. Other Project Elements
4,15      No attempt has been made to quantify the benefits expected to accrue
from the technical assistance component of the project, which accounts for
under 3% of total project costs. The technical assistance for the preparation
of road network development plans and feasibility and technical studies should
lead to better project selection and preparation and should strengthen the
planning and design capabilities of MPW, while the training program should
assist the MPW in implementing the improved maintenance program with greater
efficiency and achieve organizational improvements.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on various issues
referred to in the report, including the following matters of particular
significance. The MPW will:
(i) (a) carry out the maintenance program in accordance with a
schedule setting forth physical targets and budgetary allo-
cations agreed with the Bank; (b) provide all staff required
for the carrying out of the entire program; and (c) renew or
replace in a timely manner defective or worn out maintenancc
equipment (para. 3.07);
(ii) submit the technical and economic evaluation of rehabilitat-
ing individual road sections of the pavement strengthening
program for Bank's approval before tendering the works
according to agreed methodology, criteria and procedures
(para. 3.11); and
(iii) make available a sufficient number of experienced Algerian
technicians to be trained as instructors, and ensure that the
required number of personnel are released from operational
units for training in a timely fashion (para. 3.18).
5.02      Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this
report the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$126 million to the
Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for a 17 year
term, including a 4 year grace period.

ALGERIA
APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
Bank Group Activities in the Transport Sector
1. First Highway Project
(Loan 912-AL, 1973, US$18.5 Million)
The major components of this project included: (i) improvement and
construction of 10 sections of national and regional roads totalling about 67
km; (ii) consulting services to MPW for reconnaissance and inventory of about
7,000 km of principal roads, feasibility studies and detailed engineering of
about 600 km of principal roads, a maintenance study, and general technical
and economic studies of the road sector; (iii) technical assistance to the
National Road Laboratory; and (iv) purchase of road maintenance support
vehicles, spare parts and laboratory equipment. All project components have
been completed with the exception of some feasibility studies and detailed
-ngineerine, which are being conducted bv consultants in preparation of
the proposed Third and Fourth Highway Projects. All studies should be com-
pleted by May 1979 and the loan account disbursed by mid-1979. A Completion
Report is currently being prepared.
2. First Railway Project
(Loan 996-AI, 1973, US$49 million)
This project was designed to support SNTF's modernization program
under the Second Four-Year Development Plan 1974-77. The project provided
for: (i) complete renewal of 315 km of track; (ii) purchase of rolling stock;
(iii) track renewal equipment, automatic level crossing equipment and workshop
machinery; (iv) signalling, telecommunications, and remodelling of stations
and yards; (v) doubling or realigning short sections of track in the Annaba
and Aleiers industrial areas; and (vi) consulting services for economic,
technical, organization and tariff studies and a feasibility study of the
modernization of the mineral line in eastern Algeria. Physical execution of
the project is nearing satisfactory completion and procurement proceeded on
schedule. Several important studies, however, could not be completed by
December 31, 1978 and the Loan Closing Date has been extended to permit their
completion.
3.  First Port Project
(Loan 995-AL, 1974, US$70 million)
The project provided for assistance in the construction of a new
port at Bethioua, near Oran, for the export of LNG. The components included:
(i) the construction of three breakwaters, ten berths, and a shallow draft
basin; (ii) supporting facilities; (iii) dredging work; (iv) consulting



- 35 -
ANNEX I
Page 2
services for project preparation and execution; and (v) technical assistance
for improving port management, administration and operations and the prepara-
tion of a port master plan. Project execution has been satisfactory and
the project is substantially completed. The port came on stream ahead of
schedule with the start of export of LNG to the United States in February
1978. Disbursements are somewhat behind schedule because of unsettled claims
from contractors, and slow application for reimbursements by the Governnent.
Complete loan disbursement is expected by the closing date of June 30, 1979.
4. Second Righway Project
(Loan 1407-AL, 1977, US$41.5 million)
The project comprises: (i) the construction of the Boudouaou-
Lakhdaria section (40 km) of the NR 5; (ii) consulting services to assist
MPW in construction supervision and in implementation of recommendations on
maintenance and road planning; and (iii) training of MPW maintenance personnel.
Implementation of the project is about one year behind schedule, due to an
unsuccessful first round of bidding for the procurement of the major construc-
tion component. New bidding took place in early 1979 and the Government is
currently evaluating the bids. Nine bids were received ranging from 90% to
160% of appraisal cost estimates. The contract is expected to be awarded end
April 1979 and works to start June 1979. Because of the major reorganization
of MPW in February 1978, consulting services under the project have only just
begun. Part of the consultancy services provided for assistance in construc-
tion supervision were devoted to the evaluation of the first round of bidding,
while training of maintenance personnel, including the training abroad of
selected technicians, began in January 1979.
5. The Second Port Project
(Loan 1427-AL, 1977, US$80 million)
The project is primarily for the construction of a new port at Jijel
in eastern Algeria, which will serve a planned iron and steel complex and
provide additional capacity for general cargo traffic. The project provides
for: (i) the construction of two breakwaters, five berths for the steel
complex, and seven general cargo berths including two berthing facilities for
roll-on/roll-off and one container berth; (ii) supporting facilities in the
form of transit sheds, access road, and utilities; (iii) dredging of access
canal and basin; (iv) provision of equipment; and (v) consultants' services
for project preparation, construction supervision and technical assistance
for training of port personnel. Assistance to the port construction public
company, SONATRAM, is also included under the project. Prequalification
of firms for port construction has been completed and bidding procedures
are in process. Project implementation is about one year behind schedule
because of delays in preparation of the bidding documents and in bid evalua-
tion.

strengthening and rehabilitation. The Government will submit to the Bank a
technical and economic study in support of its request for financing under the
pavement strengthening program. The basic requirements for such a study and
the methodology for making the economic evaluation are outlined in the present
Annex.
B. Basic Requirements for Feasibility Studies
2.        The studies shall include sufficient basic data for the Bank to make
a meaningful review, and a duplication of the calculations. This should
include:
(i) a description of the road section: location, length, present
condition, pavement structure, geometric characteristics,
deflection measurements, soil tests, age, and number of
years since latest overlay or rehabilitation;
(ii) a description of the proposed pavement strengthening and
rehabilitation works: overlay or new pavement structure,
shoulder reconstruction; drainage, realignment, widening,
and other rehabilitation works;
(iii) traffic data by vehicle type: present traffic, expected
traffic growth, axle load data and trend;
(iv) unit costs and total costs of any improvement elements, with
and without taxes, and breakdown in local and foreign
exchange costs;
(v) data on basic user costs: basis on which they were developed,
and operating costs for typical vehicles; and

ANNEX Il
Page 2
(vi) current and estimated future road maintenance cost of the
road section.
3.        In addition to the technical and economic documentation, the study
shall comprise in annex: all information needed to make the analysis meaning-
ful; details about the pavement thickness calculations, technical surveys on
which the proposed rehabilitation works are based, and if available, bidding
documents, description of proposed bidding procedures, proposed advertising,
etc.
C. Economic Evaluation
4.        The determination of the economic viability of an investment requires
basically three steps: first, the analysis of possible alternative improve-
ments; second, the choice of the least cost alternative; and third, the
economic justification of the selected alternative.
a. Alternatives
5.        The Bank requires the analysis of possible alternative improvements
to evaluate proposed road rehabilitation projects. For pavement strengthening,
with or without other rehabilitation works, the following alternatives could
be considered:
(i) doing nothing, which means continuing current maintenance;
(ii)  increasing routine maintenance (patching, etc.);
(iii)  increasing the frequency of surface dressing;
(iv)  constructing an overlay to meet traffic requirements for a
five-year period;
(v) constructing an overlay to meet traffic requirements for a
ten-year period;
(vi)  widening and/or, realigning sections of the road combined
with 5 and/or 10 year overlays;
(vii) rehabilitating a substantial part of the road combined with
5 and 10 year overlays; and
(viii)  constructing a new road.
6.        All reasonable or reasonably possible solutions should be considered
unless certain simplifying assumptions are warranted. Not all need to be
evaluated in detail. Some can be eliminated, even after a cursory examina-
tion if, for instance, they would involve the utilization of significantly



- 38 -
ANNEX II
Page 3
greater amounts of economic resources than would an overlay without any
proportionate increase in benefits. The readily identifiable "do nothing"
alternative must always be considered, while other alternatives sometimes can
be omitted; for instance, if pavement strengthening is a physical requirement
if the roadway is to remain serviceable, increasing routine maintenance or
frequency of surface dressing would not normally be reasonable alternatives.
b. Economic Costs
7.        After the possible alternatives have been defined, their economic
costs have to be compared to arrive at the least cost alternative. These
costs fall into three categories. The first is the direct investment (design,
construction, supervision, etc.) the second is the maintenance cost and
the third, user costs. The least total cost will determine the preferred
alternative.
8.        The total cost must be examined in terms of the network and take
account of costs to traffic and costs on alternative routes (maintenance cost
increases or decreases) where traffic is diverted to and from. This is
because, we are not always comparing the same traffic when comparing alterna-
tives.  The "do nothing" alternative could involve, as road serviceability
further deteriorates, traffic diverting to other roads, or, disappear as costs
rise above various transport demand cost thresholds. The "rehabilitation"
alternative may involve traffic diverted to the improved section and even
generated traffic.
9.        Maintenance cost, also, will vary substantially from one alterna-
tive to another. In a "do nothing" alternative for pavement strengthening
projects, it should be assumed that in order to maintain the road in an
acceptable level of serviceability, maintenance costs will increase rapidly
over the period of the analysis. (In the absence of detailed information,
total cost over the period can be assumed equivalent to the cost of the cor-
responding rehabilitation.) This is to avoid that user costs increase beyond
transport demand cost thresholds, and result in diversion of a substantial
part of traffic.
c. Economic Benefits
10.       The next step is to evaluate the benefits which can be expected to
accrue from the selected alternative improvement. Benefits for this type of
improvements are generally measured as savings in wear and tear on vehicles                W
and in stepped-up maintenance costs, which would be necessary to maintain an
acceptable serviceability level. Traffic diversions, as the road deteriorates,
are to be accounted for.
d. Other Rehabilitation
11.      'In those cases where significant improvements such as widening,
realignment or even reconstruction of some road sections are proposed for
inclusion with the basic pavement strengthening, the improvements must also be



- 39 -
ANNEX II
Page 4
subject to the test of economic justification incrementally over and above the
basic pavement strengthening. Thus, the economic justification of the
selected least cost alternative should be established first, and then the
other rehabilitation works should be analyzed as an addition to this least
cost alternative. To establish this, additional costs for other rehabilita-
tion works have to be compared with the incremental benefits accruing from
them. If the incremental benefits exceed incremental costs at a discount rate
above the opportunity cost of capital, the proposed rehabilitation works are
justified, and should be incorporated in the project which may then be analyzed
as an entity.
e.   Analysis
12.       Once benefits have been calculated the Economic Return (ER) should
be developed as well as the Benefit/Cost Ratio (B/C).

APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
General Approach for Economic Justification of
Highways Sector Development
I. OBJECTIVES
1.        The purpose is to provide a conceptual framework for the preparing
of a global program to develop the highways sector, and which could serve as
the basis for a sector loan. The proposed Third Highway project includes
financing of consultants' services for the preparation work.
2.        A highway sector project would be prepared on the basis of the
following:
(i) an updated highway master plan, including an inventory of
the road network and long-term policy guidelines for its
development, traffic analyses, new construction programs,
rehabilitation and strengthening work, road maintenance
requirements and cost estimates;
(ii) a detailed investment and maintenance program for the
road network, including the ranking of projects according
to economic priorities;
(iii) a financing plan for this road improvements program taking
all available financial resources into account--central
budget, regional budget, special budget, external financial
resources, etc.;
(iv) an action plan for the execution of the road improvements
program; and
(v) a monitoring and evaluation system to ensure efficient
prepration and execution of the program, including annual
updating and the preparation of subsequent programs.
3.        The updating of the highway master plan and the formulation of the
road improvements program, the financing plan, the action plan and the moni-
toring and evaluating system shall be the responsibility of the Government,
assisted if need be by consultants engaged for specific purposes to be
established within the framework of this general approach. The financing of
consultants' services for feasibility studies for about 800 km of roads of
all categories and detailed engineering studies for about 500 km of roads are
included in the proposed Third Highway project.

ANNEX III
Page 2
II. PREPARATION OF THE PROGRAM
A. Highway Master Plan
4.        The highway master plan shall cover all types of roads but exclude
municipal roads except as required to ensure full realization of the benefits
from the improvements of the roads in the investment program.
5.        The updating of the highway master plan shall include:
(i) an examination of all available data on the existing road
network and, as appropriate, reconnaissance surveys and
detailed inspection of the road system so as to produce
an updated descriptive inventory of the network;
(ii) an analysis of existing highway traffic data and, if
necessary, traffic counts and origin-destination studies
to determine the nature of the traffic and the present
and future volume of freight and passenger movements;
(iii) a review of the development needs of the highway sector
in the context of the development of other sectors of
the economy as a whole and of other transport modes in
particular;
(iv) an evaluation of the highway master plan in the light of
the needs of the economy, including transport costs and
benefits and a consideration of possible alternatives;
in particular, a study of the balance of investments as
between national, regional and local roads;
(v)  so as to meet the needs of the economy as far as possible,
definition in the context of the highway master plan of
the construction, rehabilitation and strengthening work
required, as well as road maintenance needs, including
the relevant cost estimates (with a 30% margin of error);
cost estimates will include appropriate price and quantity
contingency provisions.
B. Road Improvements Program
6.        The detailed investment and maintenance program shall be drawn up
in the light of the master plan and of the list of roads whose construction
or improvement must be undertaken in the short run, i.e., beginning in 1983.
The program must be justified economically and technically and be consistent
with execution and financing capabilities. For the economic and technical
justification, feasibility and final design, studies shall be made following
a procedure acceptable to the Bank.



- 42 -
ANNEX III
Page 3
7.        The formulation of the program shall be an iterative operation
taking into consideration the results of the feasibility and detailed engi-
neering studies and the financial and execution constraints. To assist with
the ranking of the investments, highway sections will be classified according
to their economic priority as defined by the feasibility studies.
8.        The road improvements program shall include the following sub-
programs:
(i)  a construction program, including new construction,
widening, doubling, or reconstruction of existing roads,
etc.;
(ii)  a pavement rehabilitation and strengthening program,
including realignments, widening of some limited sections,
and other minor local rehabilitation works; and
(iii) a road maintenance program, including periodic overlays,
surface dressing, and all routine maintenance work.
C. Financing Plan
9.        The financing plan will be prepared in the light of domestic and
external resources. In particular the following points shall be examined:
(i) financial resources availability for the road improvements
program, both in local currency and foreign exchange;
(ii)  the means to overcome the shortage of these resources,
if any, with particular reference to high priority
projects;
(iii) comparison of the financing plan with the roads improve-
ment program, including the necessary adjustments; and
(iv)  current costs and those of preceding years in relation
to program estimates, reasonably phased over time in the
light of execution capability and work schedules.
10.       The roads improvement program and the financing plan shall provide
a general picture of estimated annual project costs and the corresponding
sources of finance.
D. Action Plan
11.       The action plan shall provide full details of the operations in-
volved in preparing and executing the road improvement program, by specifying:
(i) the objectives to be achieved;
(ii) the operations required to achieve these objectives;



- 43 -
ANNEX III
Page 4
(iii) the optimum schedule for each operation, from the prepara-
tion of terms of reference for the studies through comple-
tion of the works; and
(iv)  the designation of those responsible for each stage in the
schedule.
E. Monitoring and Evaluating System
12.       A monitoring and evaluating system will be established to ensure
efficient administration of program preparation and execution. This system
shall, among other things, cover:
(i) all the work required to update the master plan, specifi-
cally the collection of all available data on the road
network and traffic;
(ii)  interpretation of the new road network and traffic data;
(iii) program accounting and monitoring of its execution (costs
and benefits);
(iv)  information on the cost of the various operations required
to put the program into effect; and
(v) annual updating of the program in the light of the results
achieved, execution capabilities and financial resources.
III. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
13.       Of each project included in the roads improvement programs, the
economic feasibility shall be determined individually; for new construction
a suitable method of economic analysis shall be used; for rehabilitation and
strengthening programs, the method proposed for the strengthening program
shall be used; and for road maintenance programs, different maintenance
strategies shall be analyzed to establish the optimal strategy in the light
of administrative and technical constraints.
14.       The feasibility studies shall comprise:
(i) field investigations and preparation of preliminary en-
gineering to estimate costs and benefits with an accuracy
of 20%;
(ii)  an analysis of transport costs and an evaluation of the
savings and other economic benefits accruing from imple-
mentation of the project;



- 44 -
ANNEX III
Page 5
(iii) an economic appraisal comparing benefits with the capital
and recurrent costs of the project; and
(iv)  tests of the sensitivity of the results to changes in
costs and benefits.
15.       Road maintenance studies shall include:
(i) definition of reasonable alternative maintenance strate-
gies;
(ii)  the field investigations required to determine present
road conditions and the maintenance works required,
including cost estimates with an accuracy of 20%;
(iii) evaluation of the impact of these different strategies
on road network deterioration;
(iv)  evaluation of the impact of these different strategies
on road network investments and maintenance;
(v) evaluation of the impact of these strategies on transport
costs; and
(vi)  determination of cost/benefit ratios for the different
strategies, the net discounted benefit and the internal
rate of return, if possible.
16.       The detailed engineering shall include:
(i) all necessary field work and preparation of final design
to estimate costs with an accuracy of 10%;
(ii)  preparation of bidding documents and detailed design of
structures;
(iii)  bill of quantities and cost estimates divided into local
and foreign currency components; and
(iv)  breakdown of costs into the basic components such as labor,
materials, equipment, overheads, profits, etc.
