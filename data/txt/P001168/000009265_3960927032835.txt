MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANR FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A rORESTRY SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of CMte
d'Ivoire for an amount of US$80 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would carry the standard variable interest rate with a
maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, and would help
finance a Forestry Sector Project.
2.       Background.  The forests of C8te d'Ivoire have always played a
vital part in the economic development of the country. Their exploitation
has generated substantial foreign exchange earnings and employment in the
logging and timber processing industry. They have met the country's needs
for fuelwood and construction timber.   Most importantly,  they have
provided the fertile soils and the ecosystem needed for the development
of the country's main export crops (coffee, cocoa, rubber and pineapple)
and for the production of the food crops needed by a fast expanding
population. Deforestation has accelerated rapidly over the last 20 years
under increasing population pressures from about 14 million ha of tropical
rain forests at the turn of the century, only about 12 million ha remained
in 1960.  Today, it is estimated that only about 3 million are left (to
which must be added about 2.5 million ha of natural forests in the savanna
region). If present trends continue, most of the remaining high forest
will have disappeared by the year 2000. Timber production, which up to
the early 19808 amounted to 5 million m3 annually, would decline to less
than 200,000 m3. This would imply the disappearance of nearly 40,000 jobs
in the logging/wood industry and a loss in excess of US$400 million in
annual export earnings.   Of even greater concern, however,  are the
potential ecological consequences of widespread deforestation. Continued
deforestation would imply the total disappearance of irreplaceable
ecosystems and of the environment on which forest agriculture depends.
It would therefore have far reaching consequences for the country's
ecological balance and its agricultural and overall economic development.
3.       Deforestation is partly caused by logging valuable timber species
at levels well in excess of their growth rates, and by inappropriate
logging and fiscal policies: short-term, area-based logging permits have
encouraged the mining of forest resources through maximum extraction over
as short a period as possible; and the forest taxation system has excluded
rural communities from forest exploitation benefits, allowed private
interests to secure the largest share of the value of standing timber, and
brought about a considerable waste of raw material due to highly
inefficient processing at the local level.



4.       Deforestation,  however,  is  mostly  caused  by  agricultural
encroachment from a fast increasing population. The much higher potential
returns from forest agriculture have induced rapid migration of the
Sahelian population in the forest region of C6te d'Ivoire. Although the
conversion of the rain forest into timber and agriculture, in particular
valuable cash crops such as coffee and cocoa, has been the foundation of
the lvorian economic miracle," this conversion process is transforming
a relatively low yielding but sustainable resource--the rain forest--into
an agricultural production system with higher economic returns in the
short-term, but with a sustainability that may be lower in the long-term.
Indeed, under traditional farming systems, the increasing populatior.
pressure will result in shorter fallow periods which will not allow
sustainable cultivation. This will lead to large scale sol degradation,
to the abandonment of large tracts of unproductive land, and to grass and
shrubs of low economic value.  Moreover, large scale deforestation will
reduce the recycling of moisture in the environment; this will affect the
ecosystem not only of forest areas but also of areas north of the forest
region, which may then give way to a savanna ecosystem with substantially
lower agricultural productivity.
5.       In the past, the basic thrust of the Government's strategy for
managing the forestiagriculture interface was sound; it ensured (a)
protection of unique/fragile ecosystems within extensive (2 million ha)
national parks; (b) delimitation and rational exploitation of about
5 million of gazetted forests; and (c) gradual release of other forest
areas to agriculture according to rational land-use planning.   This
strategy, however, was overtaken by the large population migrations and
demographic pressure.  The Goverr.ent's awareness of the urgent need for
corrective measures began in tthe late 19709 when the extent of the
ecological damage became more and more evident. Police action was stepped
up to protect parks and gazetted forests, but it was strongly resisted by
farmers and therefore ineffective. By the mid-1980s, the Government was
convinced that only a global strategy combining measures to stabilize and
intensify agriculture, involve local populations in forest management,
and rationalize logging would ensure the protection of the country's
remaining tropical forests.
6.       In 1985, the Ivorian Government, with Bank assistance under a
Second Forestry Project, launched the preparation of a National Forestry
Plan (1988-2015) to define a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the
management of the forestry sector. The National Forestry Plan was issued
in 1987, together with an Emergency Action Program including an array of
measures to stop deforestation and improve the conservation of the
country's remaining forest resources.   On the basis of its Emergency
Action Plan, the Government requested the FAOIWorld Bank Cooperative
Program to identify a specific project for external financing. The Bank
approved a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to support detailed
preparation of the project and the implementation of urgent protection
measures for selected natural forests. The project was appraised in July
1988 with the participation of the Commonwealth Development Corporation



(CDC) and the Canadian International Develorment Agency (ACDI), and
negotiated in July 1989.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Past efforts to slow down the
destruction of Cote d'Ivoire's natural forests were narrowly based. The
comprehensive and integrated approach laiA down in the Government's
National Forestry Plan tackles for the first time all dimensions of the
problems    (a) the protection  and conservation  of natural  forests,
including wildlife and biodive.:sity; (b) the rational management of the
interface between agriculture and forestry; and (c) increased efficiency
of the public and private institutions operating in the sector, in
particular through the reform of the sector legal and fiscal framework.
The project, which would help implement this comprehensive strategy, is
essential to COte d'Ivoire's future social and economic development. As
the Bank played a major role in helping the Government formulate its
National Forestry Plan, its continued involvement is needed not only as
a major funding source but also as the catalyst for further external
financing to develop the sector.
8.       Proiect Description.  The project would be the first phase of a
long-term development program to implement the Government's National
Forestry Plan. It would support vhe activities of the Emergency Action
Program and specifically include:
(a) The demarcation and improved surveillance of 1.5 million ha of
gazetted forests; the preparation and implementation of
management plans (including the conservation of rare or fragile
ecosystems) for 700,000 ha of these forests, of which 500,000 ha
would be managed by private companies under long-term contracts;
the preparation of a detailed land-use and agricultural
development plan for the buffer zone of one gazetted forests and
incremental  agricultural  inputs  to help  farmers  intensify
agriculture in the buffer zones and to assist resettled farmers.
(b) The upkeep of about 55,000 ha of existing forest plantations and
the establishment of 9,000 ha of new plantations to complete the
planting program of the First and Second Forestry Projects (Loans
Nos. 1735-IVC, 1979 and 2496-IVC, 1985).
(c) Complementary infrastructure and protection measures for the
Comod National Park.
(d) Additional infrastructure for the Forestry Training Schools at
Bouafle and Banco, and their incremental operating costs.
(e) Research in natural forest management, industrial plantation
techniques, agro-forestry, regeneration of vegetative cover,
prevention of bush fires, the effects of deforestation on the
climate and secondary forest products.



-4-
(f)  The strengthening of the technical capabilities of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Waters and Forests (MINAGREF), the parastatal
responsible for plantations and natural forest management'
(SODEFOR), and the Directorate for the Control of Public Works
(DCGTx) tbrough technical assistance, training and equipment.
(g) The establishment of a unit in DCGTx to supervise, monitor, and
evaluate the project.
The project would also support government efforts in implemevting policy
reforms alied at improving the forestry tax regime, rationalizing the
system for logging and log exports, improving resettlement policies, and
restructuring public enterprises operating in the sector.
9.       Costs and Financing.   Total project costs are estimated at
US$147.8 million, including taxes and duties of US$35.3 million. Foreign
exchange requirements are estimated at US$58.8 million, or '3S of project
costs.   A breakdown of costs is shown in Schedule A, along with the
project financing plan. The project would be cofinanced by CDC, which
has already approved a loan of £6 miltion equivalent to support the
Industrial  Plantation  Component.    COte  d'Ivoire's  contribution  of
US$57.8 million would cover 202 of total project costs net of taxes, and
taxes and duties. Methods of procurement and disbursement, and the loan
disbursement schedule are presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events is given iA Schedule C and the status of Bank
Group operations and IFC investments in COte d'Ivoire is presented in
Schedule D. A map (No. 20968) showing the location of forest activities
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7421-RCI dated February
23, 1990 is being distributed separately.
10.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that the deposit of
requested counterpart funds in specific project accounts would be a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The effectiveness of CDC
loan to the Government of COt' d'Ivoire for the financing of the project's
Industrial Plantation CompontAt would be a condition of disaursement of
the Bank loan for this component.
11.      Benefits.  The main benefits of the project would be (a) the
preservation of an ecosystem essential for the long-term sustainability
of COte d'Ivoire's agriculture; (b) the protection of wildlife and
biodiversity of the country's remaining rain forests; and (c) the
maintenance of a sustainable production of hardwood logs for exports or
local processing through rational management of natural forests. It is
important to note that the project would not finance logging activities
or forestry penetration roads and that it would lead to an expansion of
the area under forest.  In addition, the project would increase the
production potential of tropical hardwood through the establishment of new
industrial plantations on fallow land and better maintenance of existing
plantations. Research programs would enhance knowledge of environmental
issues and develop policies and techniques to protect and manage natural
forests and industrial plantations. Finally, the project would strengthen



- 5 -
the policy-making and implementation capacity of the institutions involved
in the sector.   The economic rate of return on the project's Natural
Forest Component is estimated to be at least 10 before taking into
account non-quantifiable benefits from the sustained production of non-
wood forest products (bushmeat, food stuff, medical plants, etc.), which
play a very important role in the food security and health care of most
rural comunuities, and the ecological benefits derived from the
preservation of natural forests.   The average rate of return on the
project's Industrial Plantation Component is estimated at 15?.
12.      Risks.   The project's principal risk is that the measures to
protect natural forests and the fiscal reforms needed to rationalize
logging  and  timber-processing may  be  resisted by vested  interests
benefiting from the status quo. However, strong support is given at the
highest government level to the protection of natural forests and
implementation of the necessary fiscal reforms is a condition of Second
Tranche Release (IMarch 1990) of the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan
(ASAL) approved in October 1989. Another risk is that of not achieving
high enough standards in the management of industrial plantations. This
risk would be minimized through institutional strengthening, control and
monitoring by DCGTZ, and Bank supervision.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
