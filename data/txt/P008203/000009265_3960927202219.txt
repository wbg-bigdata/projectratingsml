TRADE POLICY LOAN
Loan and Program Summary
Borrowers Republic of Venezuela
Amount:    US$353.0 million equivalent
Termss     15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
Loan and Program Description:
The proposed loan, with the accompanying Structural Adjustment
Loan, are the first operations in Venezuela since its renewed
eligibility for borrowing after graduation in 1974. The loan
would support the first phase of reforms in the Government's
program to improve domestic efficiency and international
competitiveness. Under the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan,
the government is committed to ensure a macroeconomic framework
consistent with trade liberalization. Trade policy reform seeks
to encourage production of tradable goods through neutralizing
productive incentives. The first phase of the program-
-supported by this proposed loan--will concentrate on the
manufacturing sect)r, eliminating quantitative import
restrictions, refo=ming the tariff structure, and rationalizing
export incentives. In the second phase, agricultural import
restrictions would be eliminated and tariffs further reduced.
Benefits and Risks:
The benefits of adjustment would consist of more efficient
resource allocation with rising productivity and employment.
With the continuation of trade policy reform beyond the measures
supported by this operation, and other policy and institutional
reforms in key sectors, adjustment is expected to foster
sustainable growth, strengthened external confidence, and
credit-worthiness. A primary risk is a macroeconomic policy
framework inconsistent with trade liberalization; a second risk
is that domestic pressures could delay or weaken trade policy
adjustment significantly.

Proiected Disbursements:
Except for the US$3 million technical assistance component, the
loan would be disburoed in 2 tranches of US$200 million and
US$150 million, respectively. The first tranche would be
available for disbursement at the time of loan effectiveness.
The second tranche would be available upon fulfillment of
specified conditions of tranche release. Disbursement of the
entire loan is expected by June 30, 1991.

REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTO1.1S
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUA
FOR A TRADE POLICY REFORM PROGRAM
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the RepuEiic of Venezuela for the equivalent of US$353 million, in support
of the Government's trade policy reform program. The loan would be for a
term of 15 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A. Background
2.       Since World War II, Venezuela has been transformed from a small,
rural, isolated economy, to an urbanized nation with an important industrial
base, expanded agricultural production, and a new institutional structure.
With high fertility and immigration, the population increased from 4.2
million in 1945 to 18.7 million in 1988, and the urban population rose from
35Z to 872 of the total. Petroleum exports and foreign borrowing provided
resources for Venezuela to modernize and to exploit te e natural resources
that made possible a range of industrial, agricultural, and mineral ventures.
Since the 1958 revolution, Venezuela has enjoyed internal stability under a
series of democratically-elected governments. Much of the opportunity for
development, however, remains to be exploited, as resources have been
directed by the Government into a relatively thin veneer of prosperity.
3.       Four significant factors have handicapped the economy.  First,
Venouela has not pursued a coherent, viable development strategy. A series
of dlisjointed, contradictory policies has been characterized by increases in
the e tent and complexity of government controls.  Regulations and subsidies,
which Iffect virtually all economic activities, have led to structural
rigidities, declining private investment, and reduced real per capita output.
Producers, accustomed to high protection, are ill-equipped to compete
externally or to utilize resources efficiently. Second, Venezuela has
depended on petroleum which, until the 1986 collapse in prices, provided 95?
of export earnings. The economy beyond the petroleum sector is unevenly
developed and provides limited employment. Third, Venezuela has addressed
the problems of poverty through unsustainable controls of exchange rates and
prices. It has not developed modern, focused programs of income
redistribution. Social indicators in Venezuela are poor for a country at its
level of income, with major urban slums and high rates of infant mortality,
malnutrition, illiteracy, and population increase. And, fourth, despite
numerous programs, Venezuela's governmental institutions and public
administration are relatively weak and would have difficulty implementing a
sustainable, medium-term development strategy.
4.       Venezuelan economic policy and performance have swung sharply with
petroleum prices. Given the dependence on oil exports for Government
revenues (about 70Z of receipts in 1988), fluctuations have had profound
effects on Venezuela. The boom of the 1970's led to a short period of rapid



- 2 -
growth, as public investment programs were aimed at economic diversification,
major policy and administrative reforms were initiated, and programs to
improve social services were introduced. However, once oil prices
stabilized, these programs were financed by a deteriorating external trade
balance. When this was no longer sustainable, there was a switch in macro
management towards contractionary policies, led by reduced public investment.
This stop-go pattern continued until the mid-1980's, reflecting fluctuations
in oil prices. By 1985, Venezuela was left with an Inefficient, distorted
economy, a large external debt, Rnd mounting inflation. Despite successive
efforts in 1985-88, the crisis deepened until, in early 1989, decisive, far-
ranging remedies were required.
5.       The structural weaknesses in Venezuela's economy were not apparent
before the difficulties of the 1980's. With the resources provided by oil,
relatively high growth was achieved between 1950 and 1973. By the early
1970's Venezuela's GDP--over US$1,100 per capita--was the highest in Latin
America. Venezuela's external position was stable, and the debt service
ratio was low (72 in 1973). During the 1970's the Government invested in
steel, aluminum, petrochemicals and hydroelectric powet. It encouraged
private industrial development in durable consumer goods and intermediate
outputs for industry and agriculture. However, the petroleum-based exchange
rate tended to depress the relative prices of traded goods, and industrial
prosperity depended on government discretions protectic.i from import
competition through quantitative restrictions; local content laws; subsidized
credit; and restrictive entry requirements.
6.       Between 1950 and 1975, the agriculture sector grew five percent
annually and underwent a structural transformation. In response to changes
in the demand arising from a more affluent, urbanizing and industrializing
society, output shifted toward more expensive prowacts (particularly
livestock and related products) and inputs for industrial use. Government
policies encouraged less intensive use of labor and more intensive
utilization of land and capital. But in the mid-1970's, agricultural
production, like other tradable goods, responded to the overvalued exchange
rate and the inward-orientation of Government policies. Growth slowed to
1.62 per annum between 1975 and 1984. The agricultural labor force fell
during the mid-1970's by about 85,000 workers annually.
7.       Since the 1974 oil price boom, Venezuela has been unable to balance
moderate growth with a sustainable balance of payments and/or moderate
inflation. Successive policies induced wide variations in performance and
were ineffective in addressing the economy's structural problems. From 1973
to 1977, investment grew (17? a year for private fixed investment, 18? for
public), as Venezuela invested resources provided by the 1973-74 oil price
rise. ventral government revenues increased dramatically--2651 in 1974
alone. Public expenditures reached 401 of GDP in 1978, and public investment
increased 2.5 times faster than GDP.  The Government's role expanded, with
rapid increases in direct production and promotional and regulatory
intervention. GDP grew 6.8? a year. However, the public investment program
in 1974-78 proved too ambitious. Growth was accompanied by a deterioration
in the trade balance, with a shift from a surplus of US$6.6 billion in 1974,
to a deficit of US$5.2 billion in 1978.
8.       With an unsustainable balance of payments, the Government adopted
contractionary policies. Investment was cut 40? in a single year.



- 3 -
Fluctuations in investment and related policies reinforced Venezuela's
petroleum-dependence. From 1978 to 1985, per capita GDP fell in every year-
-a cumulative total of 25Z. By 1985 it was 152 below the level reached in
1973, before the oil windfall. This occurred despite a level of investment
in the 1970's vhich, as a share of GDP, was the highest among the principal
Latin American countries, and also despite the 1979-80 oil boom.
Inappropriate policies led to capital flight--estimated as high as US$10
billion in a single year--ra:her than growth.  The 1978-85 decline was,
however, accompanied by current account surpluses which averaged US$4 billion
in 1983-89. This allowed Venezuela to reduce public external debt by about
US$3 billion to US$25 billion and to raise net official reserves by US$4
billion to about US$16 billion at the end of 1985--the equivalent of more
than two years of imports. The Government contained inflation, with the C?I
increase averaging 10? from 1982 to 1988.
B. Recent Economic Developments and ProsPects
9.       Since 1985, the Government has had only limited success in solving
its growing economic problems. President Lusinchi's Government increased
public investment from eight percent of GDP in 1985 to 122 in 1986 to
encourage growth. GDP increased 6.82, but oil prices fell from US$26 per
barrel ir 1985 to US$14 in 1986, and there was a current account deficit of
US$1.5 billion. The public sector balance moved to a deficit of five percent
of GDP from a three percent surplus in 1985, and inflation accelerated in the
second half of the year.
10.      Th'ss continued in 1987-88.  Public investment stabilized at about
12? of GDP, and moderate growth continueds 3.3? in 1987 and 4.2? in 1988.
However, the fiscal deficit increased from three percent of GDP in 1987 to
seven percent in 1988, and the current account remained in deficit (US$1
billion in 1987, and US$5 billion in 1988-- eight percent of GDP). The
deficits were financed by drawing down :eserves, increasing trade credits,
and other short-term measures. Inflation reached rates unprecedented in
Venezuela: 40? in 1987 and 36? in 1988.
11.      By the end of 1988 Venezuela's economic situation was untenable:
operating reserves were depleted, imports were accelerating in expectation of
devaluation, and the Central Bank built up internal arrears as it stopped
providing foreign exchange at the official rate of 14.5 Bs/$ on expiring six
month letters of credit for private imports. In January, 1989, there were
shortages of price-controlled staples such as bread, coffee, sugar, and rice
as everyone waited for the new President, Carlos Andres Perez, to take office
in February and ann unce the foreign exchange and price regulations. These
issues were unresol -d in late February and shortages persisted or grew. The
Government announced a strong adjustment and austerity program, but details
and timing were not clear. Riots and looting broke out, and more than 300
people were killed.
12.      As the Government seeks to improve economic management, it contends
witI several problemss
(a) Restoring Macroeconomic Balance: Economic policy must find a balance
between feasible external accounts (both immediate cash flow and
declining debt ratios) and a fiscal deficit consistent vith public
external and internal borrowing, and expected inflation and GDP growth.



- 4 -
(b) Improving Public Investment Planning and Imilementation: The investment
program is poorly planned and managed and could be improved through
evaluation of projects in light of Governmental objectives.
(c) Increasing Public Enterprise Efficiencys The predominance of public
enterprises suggests that substantial benefits would accrue from reforms
and pricing policies which reflect economic costs.
(d) Reducing Distortious: The economy has widespread distortions, including
an undervalued exchange rate and a multiple rate system which subsidized
importers and foreign debtors. Interest rates were low with credit
rationed, and price controls were pervasive. Production subsidies
burdened the government budget. Domestic petroleum prices were between
1OS and 402 of export opportunity costs. Fertilizer prices were less
than 152 of opportunity cost, and animal feeds were heavily subsidized.
In order to stimulate private investment and create a climate encouraging
efficient resource allocation, reform of the exchange rate regime,
interest rate policies, taxation system, and trade regime are essential.
(e) Reforming the Trade Regime: Venezuela's trade regime and its uneven
application has stifled the non-oil economy and undermined industrial and
agricultural efficiency. Reform to establish a more neutral system of
productive incentives would encourage the efficient production of
tradable goods in line with Venezuela's comparative advantage.
(f) Alleviatinu Poverty: In concert with the other economic policy changes-
-particularly elimination of price controls and the multiple exchange
rate system--the Government would need to introduce focused programs of
income redistribution to protect vulnerable groups.
13.      Venezuela has good prospects for development.  It has rich natural
resources including petroleum, hydroelectric potential, natural gas, iron
ore, bauxite, gold, and land. This offers the opportunity for diversified
growth in many sectors. The economic problems are susceptible to medium-term
solutions under sound economic incentives, policies, and management.
C. External Debt and Financing
14.      With reasonable economic policies and sufficieat external financing,
projections indicate that a recovery in GDP growth is consistent with viable
external accounts. The Perez Government has begun a comprehensive adjustment
program (described in Part III below) and has already introduced a unified,
freely floa ing exchange rate system. It has signed a Letter of Intent with
the IMF and is discussing an Extended Fund Facility. Although GDP is
expected to fall in 1989, growth of about five percent a year should be
possible in the early 1990's. The projected current account deficit and a
financing scenario are presented in Annex X.
15.      The gross financing needs are large.  Venezuela covered its external
financing in 1986-88 through reserves, trade credits, and arrears, and this
cannot continue. By end-1988 reserves were exhausted, short-term trade
credits could not be expanded, and arrears cannot be built up under the new
exchange system. The IMP program for 1989-91 projects additions to reserves
as shown in Annex X.



16.      It is expected that with the Government's reform program, it will be
possible to obtain substantial flows from official sources, totalling
US$3.1-3.7 billion per year in 1989-91. Even with official support, there is
a need for commercial financing. A major part could come from rescheduling
debt originally incurred before March 1983 (the cut-off for the 1986
commercial bank rescheduling). However, there would remain US$2.0, 1.6, and
1.6 billion to be obtained in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Part could come from
bonds (US$.4 billion were sold in 1988), but this leaves an irreducible
minimum of about US$2.0 billion in 1989 and US$1.2 billion per jear
thereafter that will have to come from commercial banks through new money,
debt reduction, or debt service reduction.
17.      While debt reduction would strengthen the prospects for growth, even
if banks provide new money without debt reduction, the debt ratios show a
steady improvement from their 1988 levels (Panel C of Table 1, Annex X).
Gross total debt as a ratio to exports falls from 2842 in 1988 to 215Z by
1995. If total reserves (including gold) are netted out, the ratio falls
from 2192 to 1602 in 1995. These ratios are low compared to levels of
400-500Z in other highly indebted countries.
18.      These results are sensitive to the price of oil and to interest
rates. At current production rates, a fall in the price of oil of $1 per
barrel reduces revenue by $.6 billion per year. However, for moderate price
declines, the basic debt ratios would still fall over time. For example, if
oil prices were 102 lower than the levels in the base case in every year, the
gross-debt-to-export ratio would fall to 2562 in 1995 compared to 215t in the
base case. Oil prices would have to be consistently more than 25 below the
base case for the ratios to deteriorate. In the case of interest rates, a
10? rise in all interest rates would cost the country about US$.3 billion per
year. Over time, a 102 rise in interest rates would lead to a gross-debt-to-
export ratio of 224? in 1995 compared to 2151 in the base case.
PART It - INTERRATIONAL TRADE
A. International Trade in a Petroleum-Based Economy
19.      Petroleum has accounted for 13 to 212 of Venezuelan CDP at current
prices in recent years and 35 to 522 of current tradables GDP. Trade has
been 41 to 452 of GDP, but exports have declined sharply while imports have
risen as a percentage of GDP (Table 1). Petroleum and derivatives dominate
Venezuelan exports, accounting for as much as 95? of the total, and this has
implications for the incidence of protection and the effect of trade reform.
20.      Protection against imports encourages expansion of the favored
domestic indiestries at the cost of others (and at the cost of aggregate
national welfare). The size of the expansion depends on the ease with which
resources can be dre-n from disfavored activities, particularly exportables.
21.      The oil sector in Venezuela is a publicly-owned enclave industry
which adheres to OPEC quotas. Consequently, petroleum exports are less
responsive to changes in the effective exchange rate than non-petroleum
export supply and the demand for importables. Non-petroleum export supply is
likely to be highly elastic with respect ta changes in the effective exchange
rate. These characteristics result in a lower equilibrium exchange rate for
a given level of protection than would occur in the absence of the largely
exogenous inflow of foreign exchange deriving from petroleum exports.

* Preliminary
22.      Thus, a given level of protection is likely to be less effective in
stimulating import substitution than otherwise, because of largely offsetting
real exchange rate changes. At the same time, the given level of protection
is likely to be more punitive on non-petroleum exports than otherwise,
because of the relatively more responsive supply.
23.      Trade liberalization will be likely to have more impact in
stimulating non-petroleum export activities than in reducing aggregate import
substitution activity. AltLiugh, by smoothing out protection across
importables, it surely will change the composition of importables produced.
This accords with the experience of other countries, such as Mexico (oil) and
Chile (copper), which have one dominant commodity and have liberalized trade.
Exoort Structure and Performance
24.      The strong anti-export bias in Venezuela's inward-oriented policies
has reinforced the traditional dependence on oil. Exports accounted on
average for 282 of Venezuela's GDP in 1980-85. Of this, about 952 were
traditional exports--petroleum, iron ore, coffee and cocoa--see Table 2 (and
Annex IX, Table 2). Nontraditional products have grown from four percent of
exports in 1980 to eight percent in 1985, and 13? in 1987. Much of this
increase results from shifting weights among exports on account of falling
oil prices, rather than an increase in the volume of nontraditional exports.

25.      Venezuela exports less than three percent of its nontraditional GDP.
Nontraditional exports are heavily weighted toward basic metals and chemicals
produced by public enterprises. In 1987, aluminum accounted for 372 of
nontraditional exports, steel products for 242, chemicals and fertilizers for
112, and cement was five percent. About two-thirds of nontraditional exports
originate from public enterprises, and 602 of exports qualifying for the
export subsidy in 1987 were produced by public sector enterprises.
Import Structure
26.      Venezuela's vigorous import substitution strategy is evident in the
data in Table 3 (and Annex IX, Table 3). The economic crisis in 1983 forced
a sharp reduction in imports, and imports over 1983-86 averaged 612 of those
during 1980-82. However, the reduction in imports was concentrated more
heavily in consumer goods and construction materials. Capital goods imports
fell in roughly the same percentage as total imports, while raw materials
fell considerably less. The import substitution bias is most evident in
imports of passenger vehicles. Assembled vehicles fell to 162 of their
previous average, while CKD kits fell only to 792.
B. The Trade Regime
27.      The trade regime has comprised a complicated system of multiple
exchange rates, admunistered allocation of foreign exchange, import

Exchange Rate System
28.      During 1983-8b, foreign exchange transactions were shifted often
within a multiple rate system and the controlled rates were subject to a
series of step devaluations. In December 1986, the main official rate was
adjusted from 7.5 to 14.5 is/USS. The rate of 4.3 Bs/USS applied to certain
debt service payments and 7.5 Bs1US$ applied to 'essential* imports. The
free exchange rate depreciated steadily from 7.5 BsJUS$ in March 1983 te
nearly 42 BsJUSS in late 1988.
29.      The shifting of transactions between rates, the step devaluations,
and the continuous depreciation of the free market rate moved the weighted
average exchange rate for imports from 5 BsJUS$ in 1983 to 15.5 BsJUS$ in
1988. In real effective terms, the value of the bolivar at end-1988 was 40Z
below its March 1983 leval and about equal to its 1974 level, despite the
intervening deterioration in the terms of trade.



- 9 -
30.      In October 1988, measures were taken to simplify the exchange
system. The preferential rate of 7.5 BsJUS$ for oessentiall imports (mainly
food, medicine, and some agricultural inputs) was eliminated aud these
imports were shifted to the main official rate of 14.5 Bs/US$. The domestic
value added component of receipts from nontraditional exports was permitted
to be sold at the free market rate if the exporter would forego, for at least
two years, the subsidy for nontraditional exports (see below). The import
content of these exports was still required to be surrendered at the official
rate of 14.5 Bs/US$. In addition, debt to equity conversions for financing
investments in the export sector were authorized at the free market rate.
Import Controls
31.      Foreign Exchange Allocation.  With tLe adoption of a multiple
exchange rate system in 1983 the Government had to allocate exchange by nsa-
market criteria. Rationing was done by the Ministry of Finance, initially by
the Oficina del Reaimen de C'umbios Diferenciales (Office of the Differential
Exchange Rate Regime, RECADI) and, after December 1986, by the Direccion
General v Sectorial de Divisas para ImDortaciones (General and Sectoral
Department for Foreign Exchange Allocation for Imports). Under RECADI, an
importer had to obtain an impe.  conformity to assure that foreign exchange
would be available at an official rate. Processing application could take up
to two months, at the end of which the importer was able to obtain 30Z of the
authorized foreign exchange. When the merchandise arrived, the importer had
to request a foreign exchange authorization to receive the balance of the
foreign exchange. Conformities expired after six months, so when shipments
took longer. the importer needed to apply for an extension. During 1985,
RECADI issued 7500 conformities and 5000 extensions per month.
32.      To improve allocation and reduce uncertainty, firm-specific budgets
were introduced in January 1987. The Government's intention was to ensure
that importers could plan on a specific amount of foreign exchange each year,
granted automatically at the official rate. The budgets, set annually by
RECADI in consultation with industrial councils, were largely based on
historic import levels. The implementation of this system was, however,
marked by delays and discretion, and charges of corruption and favoritism.
33.      An intergovernmental committee periodically set the foreign exchange
budget for importers to meet sectoral priorities. When requests exceeded the
budget, RECADI delayed allocations or denied requests selectively, using
criteria similar to those for import licenses: availability of domestic
substitutes, utilization of domestic capacity, and priority of the output.
34.      The Ministry of Development issued import licenses without regard
for foreign exchange budgets, and the quantity of licenses generally exceeded
the available foreign exchange. Thus, the Ministry of Finance assumed a role
in industrial protection. If foreign exchange were denied at an official
rate, the importer had to obtain funds in the free market. The differential
between the official rate of 14.5 Bs1US$ and the free market rate in 1989 was
equivalent to an additional tariff of 130-180?, and exchange allocation was
the primary protective measure for some manufacturers.
35.      Non-Tariff Barriers.  In 1982, only seven percent of items in the
tariff code required a license or were prohibited (see Annex IX, Table 5).
This figure was over 502 in 1984, and currently 302 require licenses and 112



- 10 -
are prohibited. In granting protection through QRs, the Government has
pursued a general, unfocused strategy of import substitution, with licensing
requirements imposed where there is domestic production. Overall, the sector
most protected by QRs is agriculture, with 202 of tariff positions facing
import prohibitions, another 38Z requiring licenses, and another 36?
requiring health permits (see Annex IX, Table 7). The manufacturing sector
follows with 402 of positions subject to licensing or prohibitions, while the
figure for mining is 16?. While licenses or prohibitions protect 39? of
manufactured items in the tariff code, it is estimated that these items cover
about 502 of the total manufacturing sector, and 552 of non-petroleum
manufacturing (see Annex IX, Table 9).
36.      The customs code has nine license categories or 'notas," of which
the most important for protection of domestic manufacturing ares  nota 1 -
import prohibited, nota 2 - the right to import reserved for the Government,
and nota 4 - import permit required from the Ministry of Development (see
Annex IX, Table 6). The other categories are health certificates and permits
from other ministries. About five percent of tariff positions are subject to
two separate notas and another two percent are subject to three notas such as
processed foods which require a license or delegation (nota 2 or 4), a health
certifice- from the country of origin (nota 5), and a health certificate
from the Venezuelan Ministry of Agriculture (nota 6). In 1985, the Ministry
of Development alone received 71,000 applications--each taking between two
and six months to process--of which two-thirds were denied.
37.     'While the criteria for placing items on the prohibited list have
become blurred over the years, in general, prohibitions were used where
Venezuelan producers had sufficient capacity to supply the domestic market.
Items where domestic production was limited in quantity or quality were
subject to either a nota 2 or 4 requirement. The distinction between the two
categories is procedural. Venezuela is a member--with Bolivia, Colombia,
Peru, and Ecuador--of the Andean Common Market (ACM). The members maintain a
common tariff nomenclature (Nomenclatura Arancelaria de los Paises Miembros
del Acuerdo de Cartagena--NABANDINA) and impose common minimum external
tariffs on some items. Under ACM regulations, a country cannot impose a
licensing requirement on imports from other members   However, a government
can circumvent this regulation by designating itsel4 as the sole importer
(nota 2) and delegating the right to import at its discretion. Where an item
was nota 2, the importer applied for a delegation, and where it was nota 4 he
applied for an import license. In both cases, importers effectively had to
obtain permission--often in writing--from domestic manufacturers before a
delegation or license would be authorized.
38.      The licensing requirements were applied more heavily as the stage of
processing increased (see Annex IX, Table 7). About 902 of processed foods
with additives were subject to licensing or prohibitions while 74? of
finished consumer goods and 52? of finished industrial goods were thus
restricted. Conversely, less than one percent of intermediate semi-processed
inputs were prohibited and only 15? were subject to licensing, while 282 of
capital goods imports were prohibited or restricted.
39.      Tariffs.  The tariff structure (as of March, 1989) consisted of 41
ad valorem rates (of which, 13 applied to only one item) ranging from 0 to
1352, covering 6148 tariff positions (see Annex IX, Table 5). The average
unweighted ad valorem tariff is 372. The tariff distribution is highly



- 11 -
variable, and 1091 items attract duties of 0 to 1, while 1292 have rates of
8o0 or above. Specific tariffs are applied to 854 positions, the ad valorem
equivalent of which ranged from one percent to 9402. Substantial tariff
protection is granted to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors with
simple average rates of 37Z and 362 respectively while mining attracts an
average rate of 142 (see Annex IX, Table 7). The highest average tariffs are
applied to consumer goods (582) and processed foods with additives (642),
while capital goods attract 272 and intermediate goods 212. This reflects
the cascading pattern of tariffs found under an import substitution strategy,
where protection increases with the degree of processing and is highest for
final goods, which generally have the lowest value-added.
40.      While the statutory tariff rates are relatively high, actual tariff
collections have averaged only about eight percent over 1985-87 (see
Annex IX, Table 10). Additional customs service fees have resulted in an
av7erage -ate of total trade taxes of about 13Z. It is estimated about two-
ttirds of import duties are exonerated. Exonerations are considered on a
case-by-case basis, and are generally granted if the imported good is not
produced in Venezuela. However, different importers have received different
exonerations, and on identical imports there may be different rates. The
Ministry of Development receives over 7000 applications for exonerations a
year and arrives at a favorable decision in about 802 of the cases. The
decision takes around 6-8 weeks.
41.      Before 1986, no clear rule was followed in setting rates net of
exonerations. Some informal guidelines within the Ministry of Development,
set rates according to product and end-use: Inputs destined for the
agricultural sector attracted a one percent duty, inputs to agroindustry
attracted five percent, capital goods destined for the industrial sector
attracted ten percent, non-essential goods attracted 202 and products
considered *superfluous' attracted 302.
Export Incentives
42.      An incentive program for nontraditional exports was established in
1973 to reduce the anti-export bias and to diversify the export base. The
main incentive has been the export bonus. This is a negotiable certificate,
applicable toward any federal tax. The bonus is paid to the exporter as a
percentage of the FOB value of exports. The value of the certificate is not
itself subject to taxation. The rate paid to the exporter is between 15 and
482, depending on the domestic value-added content of exports.
43.      Annex IX, Table 11 shows details of bonus payments over recent
years. In 1987, 682 of exports received the bonus at an average rate of 232.
Public enterprises received more of the bonus than the private sector, but
the private sector received a higher average rate of bonus.
44.      After the multiple exchange rate system was adopted in early 1983,
nontraditional exporters were also offered the benefit of a currency
retention scheme, whereby gross foreign currency proceeds from exports, minus
502 (later 802) of the value of imported inputs, could be exchanged at the
free market rate. From 1984 through 1986, the free market rate remained at
least twice as high as the official exchange rate (7.5 Bs/US$), and this
scheme provided a considerable incentive. When in late 1986 the official
exchange rate applicable to most international transactions was devalued to



- 12 -
14.5 Bs/USS various policy measures were introduced and the currency
retention scheme was eliminated. Export proceeds were made subject to
surrender to the Central Bank at the official rate. At the same time, the
Government raised the rate of the fiscal credit 202, and applied it at the
14.5 exchange rate instead of the 7.5 exchange rate. In October, 1988, the
Government gave exporters the choice between the export bonus and converting
their national value added at the free market exchange rate. Exporters had
to elect one system or the other and, if they chose the parallel market rate,
they were obligated to stick with their choice for two y'ars. Expecting a
devaluation, very few exporters were willing to make this commitment.
45.      Nontraditional exporters also receive subsidized credit the Export
Financing Fund (FINEXPO). Between 5 and 26Z of nontraditional exports have
been financed through FINEXPO during the 1980's (see Annex IX, Table 12).
Under the most common arrangement, FINEXPO and a commercial bank each provide
half the funds. With FINEXPO financing at about half the commercial lending
rate, the subsidy amounts to 1.5? of the FOB price of exports. This
translates into a five percent value-added subsidy for an exporter with 30?
domestic value-added, and declines as the exporter's value-added increases.
46.      A temporary admissions scheme has existed for several years under
which exporters could import inputs duty-free, but few exporters have taken
advantage of it since the accumulation of benefits from this scheme with the
generally higher benefits of the fiscal credit was not permitted until July
1987. Further, even under the temporary admissions scheme, exporters still
had to obtain import licenses. There is not a duty drawback scheme.
Price Controls and Export Restrictions
47.      The Government has used price controls widely in an attempt to
moderate inflation and to pass the benefits of the official exchange rate
through to consumers. Restrictions on agricultural exports were used to
prevent producers from exporting items where subsidies or controls maintained
prices below world levels.
48.      Before 1983, roughly 30 product categories required an export
license or faced an export ban. After the measures of February 1983, this
was extended to about 115 categories, mainly price-controlled food, but also
including some chemicals, tires, used vehicles, and scrap metal.
49.      Increased export licensing coincided with expanded price controls
after February 1983 to reduce the inflationary effects of devaluations on the
basic consumer basket. As a supporting measure, foreign exchange for imports
of basic food and agricultural inputs was allocated at the preferential rate.
Agriculture was encouraged through high support prices. Cheaper imports at
the preferential exchange rate were rationed to distributors to maintain
consumer prices below world levels. Restrictions were imposed to prohibit
export of subsidized goods, but smuggling increased. Recognizing the
distortions created by the system, the Government in mid-1987 required
cabinet approval of new restrictions. Formerly, export bans could be imposed
by a single ministry, principally, the Ministry of Agriculture.

PART III - THE ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. The Government's Economic Program
50.      President Carlos Andres Perez took office on February 2, 1989, and
his Government sought to redefine the role of the state through economic
reform and restructuring. The aim is to reduce the regulatory framework and
complex, costly subsidies which pervade the economy and to encourage private
investment and production through trade and financial reforms. The measures
include a reform of the exchange and trade systems, reduction of price
controls, deregulation of financial and industrial markets, and improved
government operations. The Government will also improve social programs to
alleviate poverty.
B. The Macroeconomic Framework
51.      The adjustment program seekst  (a) feasible external borrowing in
terms of iumediate cash flow and improvements of the basic debt ratios, and
(b) a fiscal deficit consistent with public external borrowing, internal
borrowing, and expected inflation and GDP. The Government has agreed that
the fiscal deficit and external borrowing must be consistent with the macro
targets. The Bank's analysis indicates that with the SAL program, the Trade
Policy Loan, and the measures already taken, the fiscal deficit accounts and
external borrowing program will be feasible. The reform program will lead to
a sharp reduction is the fiscal deficit through the real devaluation, the use
of tariffs rather than NTBs, and the adjustments in domestic prices of goods
produced by public enterprises. There are four elements to the Government's
program.
(a) Foreisn Exchanae System (Plan Cambiario):  A central feature of the
program is the unified, market-determined exchange rate for the bolivar.
The new regime was began March 14, 1989 when exchange controls were
abolished, and the value of the currency determined in an expanded
interbank market. The unified rate opened at 39-40 Bs/US$ (but soon fell
to 35-37), compared to the previous official rate of 14.5 and parallel
rate of 42 in late 1988.
(b) Fiscal Reforms (Plan Fiscal): The Government plans to reduce the fiscal
deficit from seven percent of GDP in 1988 to 3-4Z in 1989 by doubling
gasoline prices, raising telecommunications rates by 50S, increasing
power rates (30-65? initially, followed by monthly changes), adjusting
prices of goods produced by public enterprises (such as aluminum, steel,
and fertilirers), and by controls on spending. The gains to the public
sector from the devaluation will help meet deficit targets, as will
elimination of tariff exonerations. Privatization and tax reform are
planned, and the Cabinet has decided to privatize three cement plants and
three public banks. In the medium term, the deficit will be reduced by
eliminating subsidies in exchange rate guarantees and by revenue from
further pricing adjustments and a value added tax.
(c) Financial Reforms (Plan Financiero): Commercial interest rates will be
determined flexibly, with the Central Bank regularly adjusting floors and
ceilings consistent with the exchange rate, external reserves, and
monetary targets. The Constitution requires the Central Bank to set
interest rate limits; economic facts dictate that the limits cannot be

far from market levels. The old system, where the ceiling on the general
commercial bank lending rate was 132, ended in February. The rate went
to 3O2 before the new exchange rate system, and to 352 in mid-March.
Interest rates for agriculture were set at 7 percentage points below the
general lending rate for each commercial bank, and credit directed to
agriculture was reduced from 222 of a bank's portfolio to 17S. The
ceiling on loans for lower-cost housing was set at 15Z.   To ensure the
efficiency of the financial system, the Government is studying
legislation to rationalize regulation and supervision.
(d) Social Sector Plan (Plan Socialls The Government plans to convert most
indirect subsidies, which have been given mainly through preferential
exchange rates, into focused social programs. The indirect subsidies
that continue will be for a reduced list of goods of special concern to
the poor, and will be funded through direct budgetary transfers. Focused
programs, such as school-feeding programs and programs operating through
neighborhood health clinics, will be developed.
C. The Trade Policy Adjustment Program
52.      Trade reform is an important element of the program of economic
stabilization and deregulation to promote efficiency and growth. In February
1989 the Government initiated a reform of its exchange rate and commercial
policies to enhance the simplicity, transparency, and neutrality of the
regime. The program will be phased to reduce uncertainty and allow time for
adjustment. The first phase includes the already-completed reform of the
exchange rate regime (described above) and will focus commercial policy
reforms on the manufacturing sector, including agricultural processing. The
second phase will extend commercial policy reforms which will be focussed to
agriculture and will further reduce the levels and variability of protection.
The Government's medium-term objective is a trade regime in which a
competitive exchange rate is the principal instrument of import protection
and export promotion. Additional import protection will be provided only
through moderate tariffs. As part of this program of integration into the
world trading system, Venezuela will begin nego_iations toward accession to
the GATT.
Exchange Rate Policy
53.      Foreign exchange rationing was discontinued and the responsible
agency abolished. The Government is committed to maintain the unified and
freely floating exchange rate. This policy will encourage expansion of the
tradable goods sector and support liberalization of import controls and
rationalization of protection. The Government will study the feasibility of
a stabilization fund to sterilize the real exchange rate against sudden
appreciation in the event of sharp increases in the price of petroleum.
Imnort Regime
54.      Non-tariff Restrictions.  About half of domestic manufacturing and
nearly all agricultural production are protected by prohibitions or licensea
on competing imports. (The method of measuring production coverage, agreed
between the World Bank and the Government, is described in Annex VII). The
Government will reduce the production coverage of NSBs and move to a system
of tariff-based protection for both industry and agriculture over

approximately four years. Import restrictions will be used only for the
protection of public health, safety, and national security.
55.      Currently, half of manufacturing production (including agricultural
processing) is covered by NTBs on competing imports, excluding those related
to health, safety and security. Before July 1989 the Government will remove
NTBs to reduce coverage to no more than 25Z of minufacturing production. By
March 1990 the Government will remove NTBs to reduce coverage to no more than
15Z. By September 1990 the Government will remove NTBs to reduce coverage to
no more than five percent of manufacturing.
56.      Almost all agricultural production is protected by NTBs.  To prepare
for the liberalization of agricultural imports, the Government will by July
1989 initiate a study of the incidence and protective effects of NTBs on
agricultural trade. The study will indicate the relations among domestic
agricultural pricing, distribution, and public health policies and trade
reform. It will be completed, and a program will be formulated (in agreement
with the World Bank) by September 1990 for substantial elimination of NTB
coverage of agricultural production beginning no later than January 1991.
57.      Tariff Reform.  Tariffs had little protective effect, given the
extensive coverage of NTBs and the widespread exonerations. Tariff rates
range between 0 and 135Z, and 854 tariff items are subject to specific and ad
valorem tariffs. While the average statutory tariff in 1987 was 35-401,
exonerations reduced the average duties actually collected to 8-10X.
58.      In concert with the elimination of import licenses, delegations, and
other NTBs, the Government will lower tariffs and reduce their dispersion.
The objective is a structure of three rates in the range of 10 to 20Z, to be
achieved by 1993. The program is set out in Table 4. The Government will
negotiate with its partners possible discrepancies between the trade reform
and the Andean tariff system.
59.      By July 1989 the Government will implement a tariff schedule which
eliminates specific tariffs and has a maximum rate of no more than 801 for
consumer goods and 502 for intermediates and capital goods. This tariff
schedule will provide transitional protection, decreasing over time.



- 16 -
Simultaneously, the tariff structure will be simplified to enhance its
neutrality and transparency. Tariffs will be consolidated at the nine
decimal rates (0, 10?, 202, ..., 802), except where the ACM minimum common
external tariff is different or where items have been imported without
restriction at rates less than 10. This will necessitate setting some items
at 5Z, 15, 25?, ... , as well as keeping some items at rates of .1S, 12, 2?,
... (cf. Annex IX, Table 5). In general, similar tariff items will attract a
uniform rate, and where uniform rates are not applied, thq maximum range
among rates would be 20 percentage points. Presently the range can be as
high as 100X.
60.      Venezuela intends to convert its tariff nomenclature--together with
other members of the ACH--to the new Harmonized System in January 1990. By
March 1990 the maximum tariff will be reduced to 50Z, the number of rates to
six, and tariffs will be restructurcd, in agreement with the World Bank and
with support from the Technical Assistance component. The purpose of this
restructuring would be to harmonize effective protection across economic
activities. In 1991 the maximum tariff rate will be reduced to 40?. In 1992
there will be four rates between 10? and 30? and, by 1993, three rates
between 10 and 20?. All exonerations will be eliminated by July 1989 except
on 17 basic commodities, and CKD kits ("completely knocked down* units
imported for local assembly) for selected industries. Presently tariffs are
exonerated to rates between 12 and 402 for CKD kits for 37 products. This
list will be reduced to 20 before July 1989 and, by March 1991, exonerations
on all CID kits will be eliminated. Tariff exemptions, provided by law for
imports by certain bodies, such as the central government, universities, and
scientific research institutes, would not be affected. These are estimated
to cover about three percent of imports.
61.      Import Mono2olies.  Imports of some items--petrochemicals, aluminum,
and steel--are now restricted, through the licensing system, to state
enterprises. By July, 1989 these monopoly rights will be eliminated.
62.      Sntidumiina and Antisubsidy Procedures.  Consistent with the move to
tariff-baied protection and accession to the GATT, by March 1990 the
Government will establish antidumping and antisubsidy procedures embodying
principles of independent review, public scrutiny, material injury, national
welfare criteria and use of temporary ad valorem duties.
Exnort Regime
63.      Venezuela has maintained a complex export regime.  Exporters have
been required to surrender foreign exchange to the Central Bank at the
official rate, but have benefitted from a tax-exempt fiscal bonus, as well as
concessionary financing through the Export Financing Fund (FINEXPO).
Exporters have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining import licenses,
foreign exchange at the official rate, and tariff exonerations for their
imported inputs. There is no duty-drawback scheme, and the temporary
admissions scheme is not widely understood and few exporters benefit from it.
64.      The Government has assigned a commission to rationalize the export
regime, simplify procedures, and create an agency to promote exports. Under
the new policies, a competitive exchange rate will provide the principal
incentive for exports. Exporters have ready access to foreign exchange at
the unified rate, and the reduction of import licensing and import monopolies



- 17 -
will simplify access to inputs. With elimins*ion of tariff exonerations, the
temporary admissions program and the duty drawback scheme will take on new
importance in providing imported inputs on a duty-free basis. These programs
will be reviewed--particularly in comparison with those in other countries-
-to introduce a duty drawback scheme and to strengthen the temporary
admissions regime, making them simple, automatic, transparent and widely
understood by February 1990.
65.      With exporters benefitting from the free exchange rate and import
liberalization, the export bonus will not be paid on any products by February
1990, and legislation will be introduced to abolish it. Credit through
FINEXPO has been offered at preferential rates. By July 1989 the rates on
FINEXP0 credit will be raised in concert with the overall program of
financial reform.
66.      The Government has restricted certain exports, mainly in conjunction
with its program of consumer price controls and agricultural supports. The
price controls have been substantially eliminated and only 17 commodities are
under control.  By July 1989 the Government will eliminate all restrictions
on exports of manufactured goods, except items for which the Government
provides direct subsidies. The Government has committed that no more than
five commodities would be subsidized, and it currently plans to subsidize
popular powdered milk and fertilizer. A one-time subsidy was recently
provided for sugar.
67.      The Government recognizes that procedures for exporting and
associated controls and paperwork have been unnecessarily costly. It is
reviewing all export procedures and will implement a more efficient process.
Some permits have already been eliminated. The Government will introduce a
new organization, VENEXPORT, to work with the Foreign Trade Institute (ICE)
in promoting Venezuelan exports. It will review all Government and private
programs of export promotion to evaluate any additional measures which--in
view of their costs and benefits--may contribute to overall national welfare.
Customs Procedures
68.      With the Government abandoning import licenses, exchange controls,
and tariff exonerations as methods of regulating imports, the efficient and
uniform collection of tariffs will be of greater importance. By July 1989,
the Government will begin a study of customs procedures and facilities with
the assistance of outside experts. The Government will formulate and begin
to implement by February 1990 a program (to be agreed with the World Bank) of
revised procedures.
Supporting Policies and Actions
69.      Given the existing distortions in relative prices and the program's
emphasis on corrective price adjustments, prine flexibility is central to
trade policy reform. Accordingly, the Government has dismantled the three-
tiered price control system operated under the Ministry of Development and
Price Commission. In March, a new system wss announced, applying to a
maximum of 17 essential goods and services (compared with 85 previously).
The prices of controlled items will be adjusted periodically to ensure that
that they move broadly in line with other consumer prices.



- 18 -
70.      The trade reforms should provide new incentives for investments in
the traded goods sector. However, investment has been restricted by various
discretionary industrial regulations and incentives. To ensure that
investment will flow in accordance with market signals, the Government will
begin by July 1989 a comprehensive study of industrial regulations and
incentives, including the tariff structure, and by February 1990 it will
initiate a program (to be agreed with the World Bank) for industrial
deregulation.
71.      The Government will reorganize the Ministry of Development and its
dependencies to reduce its regulatory and administrative functions and to
enhance its industrial policy formulation and promotion. As part of the
reorganization it will redefine functions, train personnel, and recruit
staff.
72.      To assist enterprises to adapt to the more competitive environment,
the Government plans a program to support private sector restructuring. The
program will include diagnostic studies of measures to improve productivity,
product quality, and export market penetration. A pilot program of direct
technical assistance at the firm level to be provided on a cost-sharing basis
is being developed for the preparation of specific restructuring projects.
The Government will attempt to ensure within its financial reform and
monetary programs that adequate financial resources at competitive interest
rates and a sufficiently broad range of financial instruments are available
to finance private restructuring.
D. Social Impact of Adiustment
73.      Venezuela's inability to achieve sustained growth has hurt job
creation and real wages. Although production recovered in 1986-87, unless
structural reforms are introduced within a consistent macroeconomic
framework, Venezuela may resume its pattern of contraction following
expansion. The reform program should assist in breaking this cycle.
74.      Moderate, increasing growth would be fostered Ly a more efficient
economic structure. This would, over the longer-term, represent the most
important social impact of adjustment. Trade reform will increase the demand
for labor by correcting tne previous bias against labor-intensive export and
efficient 'mport substitution activities. Liberalization is also expected to
reduce inflationary pressures by intensifying competition.
75.      In the short run, the program will have diverse effects, some
negative for specific groups and others beneficial. First, reduction of the
fiscal deficit will affect those who would have benefited from higher levels
of public investment and expenditures. Many of the subsidies that will be
tightly controlled have not been focused on specific groups (e.g., price
controls or fertilizer subsidies). Moreover, successful implementation of
the program will make it possible to avoid past swings from high deficits to
high surpluses, where these groups have lost far more.
76.      Second, the increases in interest rates to positive real levels are
expected to have a beneficial effect on income distribution. Small-scale
savers, who save through time deposits and other accounts of financial
institutions, will benefit from higher rates. The beneficiaries of the
negative real interest rates are those who have been able to get loans from
the banking system--generally not the low-income people.



- 19 -
77.      Third, as items imported at the 7.5 or 14.5 exchange rates enter at
the floating rate, there will be price increases. Goods were kept at the 7.5
and 14.5 exchange rates explicitly to subsidize them. Such a subsidy ts an
inefficient way to improve the standard of living of the poor, since the
subsidy goes to all consumers. Wealthier people consume more goods per
capita and generally a greater share of their consumption comprises imported
items. However, while inefficient, a portion of such subsidies benefits the
poor, and the Government will design better-focused social programs.
78.      The impact of the program should be beneficials specific groups who
would benefit include producers whose imported inputs would be liberalized,
consumers, workers who would find employment in more labor-intensive
industries, and savers. Steps have been taken to moderate the impact on
those who would lose. In the longer-term, implementation of the program
should allow the Government to avoid what could otherwise be a severe
contraction, as has happened when structural reforms were neglected.
Achievement of sustainable and more efficient growth will benefit all.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Background
79.      Following Venezuela's renewed eligibility for World Bank lending in
December 1986, and at the Government's request, a mission visited Venezuela
in January 1987. Its analysis and conclusions are presented in the country
economic report *Policy Choices and Economic Growth in Venezuela*.  The
report was discussed by the Government in July, 1987, and published as report
No. 6771-VE in March, 1988. The Government broadly agreed with the report's
conclusions, and was interested in a reform program. The Government
specifically requested that this program should focus on the trade regime and
on a congruent macroeconomic framework. Preparation missions in July and
September were followed by appraisal in October/November 1987.
80.      In the face of elections in December 1988, the Government was
unwilling to undertake the necessary pre-requisite conditions for Board
presentation, and the loan was not negotiated. The new Government has
indicated its commitment to a substantial structural reform of the economy
and requested an initial lending program comprising a Structural Adjustment
Loan and a Trade Policy Loan. Post-appraisal missions for the Trade Policy
Loan visited Caracas in February, 1989, and April, 1989. Negotiations were
held in Washington, D.C. in May, 1989. The Venezuelan delegation was led by
Dr. Leonardo Vivas of the Ministry of Development.  Supplementary loan data
are provided in Annex III.
B. Loan Obiectives
81.      The proposed US$353 million Trade Policy Loan (TPL) is intended to
support the first phase of Venezuela's trade liberalization. Given the far-
reaching changes that will occur throughout the economy and the benefits of
orderly, gradual implementation to allow time for adjustments at the firm and
sectoral level, the program will be phased over several years and may warrant
continued Bank assistance. A proposed second phase would focus on reducing
NTBe to agricultural trade and further reductions in the level and dispersion
of tariffs. Complementary lending operations to facilitate supply-side
adjustments to the new incentives are under discussion with the Government.



- 20 _
82.      The proposed loan supports the trade reforms scheduled for 1989-90
(described above) in which the Government plans a rapid reduction in non-
tariff barriers to imports, reductions in and rationalization of the tariff
structure, and reform of export promotion. The primary objectives of the
loan ares (i) creation of a more open, transpaient trade regime to encourage
competitive behavior by producers of traded goods and to enhance productive
efficancy; (ii) reduction in the misallocation of resources that arose from
high, variable protection; (iii) rationalization of export incentives and
procedures to create free trade status for exporters; and (iv) institutional
reforms to support the new trade regime. The proposed loan will also
establish a basis for agricultural trade reform through studies to define a
program to eliminate quantitative restrictions on agricultural trade.
83.      The Trade Policy Loan is an element in Venezuela's mobilization of
external resources. The Government is seeking cofinancing from the Export-
import Bank of Japan in an amount similar to the proposed Bank loan. Bank
staff have collaborated with staff of the Export-Import Bank of Japan to
assist their appraisal.
C. DescriPtion
84.      The proposed loan has a Dolicy reform comonent and a technical
assistance component. The bulk of the proposed loan, US$350 million, would
support the policy reform program discussed in Part III of this Report and
also described in the Government's Statement of Trade Policy (Annex IV) and
summarized in the Trade Policy Matrix (Annex V). The policy reform component
will be quick-disbursing in two tranches.
85.      The technical assistance component of US$3.0 million would finance
consultants' services, computer software, and limited computer hardware to
support the following key studies and institutional reforms:
(a) Policy Options to Reform Aftricultural Trade. Study the incidence and
protection of NTBs in agriculture and recommend programs to replace
quantitative import and export restrictions with price based
instruments.
(b) Formulation of Antidumping and Antiubsidy Procedures.  Design
internationally acceptable unfair trade practice procedures.
(c) Reform of Customs Administration and Procedures. Assist in the reform
of customs administration and valuation procedures. Consultants'
services for both diagnostic analyses and longer-term support for
implementation of reforms.
(d) Suinort for GATT Accession. Analysis of the issues surrounding
accession to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT),
including legal and administrative changes, experiences of recent
members, and acquisition of international trade data.
(e) Reorganization of the Ministry of Development. Improve the Ministry's
capabilities in industrial policy analysis and industrial promotion and
reduce emphasis on administrative controls.



- 21 -
(f) Study of Industrial Regulations and Incentives. The effects of
incentives--including the tariff structure--and regulations on
industrial structure and perfornance. Develop program for deregulation
of industry, reform of industrial incentives, and restructuring of the
tariff.
(g) Studies to Support Industrial RestructurinR. Sectoral and subsectoral
studies of product technology, quality control and marketing to support
investments in industrial restructuring by private firms. Pilot program
of direct assistance to producers formulating restructuring projects.
Annex VIII describes each of the technical assistance components and
outlines corresponding terms of reference.
D. Disbursement. Procurement. Administration and Auditing
86.      The policy compcnent of US$350 million would be disbursed in two
tranches of US$200 and US$150 million. The first tranche would become
available upon effectiveness, and the second upon fulfillment of specific
conditions for tranche release. Retroactive financing of up to 10X of the
loan amount from March 1, 1989 or from a date four months before the loan
agreement is signed (whichever is later) would be permitted. The remainder
of the loan (US$3.0 million) would be disbursed to purchase computer
hardware, software, consultants' and training services. Disbursements of the
technical assistance component of the loan would be independent of tranche
releases and would occur over a period not to exceed two years. The closing
date of the proposed loan would be June 30, 1991.
87.      The loan proceeds would be used to reimburse 100Z of the foreign
exchange cost (CIF) of eligible imports. Ineligible imports comprise goods
financed from other official multilateral or bilateral sources, luxury goods,
and goods intended for military or paramilitary use. The Government shall
have the option of using up to 252 of the proceeds of the loan to implement a
Debt Reduction Plan which, in the judgement of tne Bank, shall meet the
requirements for the Bank's support of debt reduction programs. Loan
proceeds could be disbursed for this purpose only after fulfillment of
conditions for release of the second tranche and subject to agreement with
the Bank on terms and conditions to be applied.
88.      Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing. Contracts under US$5 million each would be awarded on the basis
of the normal procurement practices of the purchaser, provided that these are
acceptable to the Bank. Whenever possible, quotations from eligible
suppliers from at least two countries will be sought. Contracts estimated to
cost US$5 million or more each, would be procured through simplified
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
e9.      Consultants to be financed with the proceeds of the loan would be
employed in accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in the
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" of August 1981. Computer software--estimated
to cost no more than US$50,000 equivalent in aggregate--and computer hardware
(mainly personal computers and ancillaries)--estimated to cost no more than
US$100,000 equivalent in aggregate--would be purchased through international
or local shopping. Individual contracts would be for less than US$25,000
equivalent.



- 22 -
90.      The Ministry of Finance would be responsible for maintaining loan
accounts, and for preparing and submitting withdrawal applications.
Disbursement against contracts valued at less than US$5 million equivalent
would be made on the basis of a Statement of Expenditures to be submitted by
the Ministry of Finance. Full documentation would be required for approval
of individual contracts exceeding US$5 million equivalent. The Ministry of
Finance is expected to undertake the screening process to ensure that all
procurement conditions have been met. Disbursements would be made on the
basis of a summary from Ministry of Fin-.nce detailing individual import
transactions in each relevant period, together with a certification of
payments of the amounts involved, and of their eligibility under the loan.
The Ministry of Finance will retain all records evidencing expenditures under
the loan for review by the Bank, as required, until at least one year after
the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last
withdrawal from the Loan Account was made.
91.      Audits of the supporting documentation for the statements of
expenditure used for disbursements will be carried out annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit reports would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
E. Effectiveness and Tranche Release
92.      The proposed loan (except for the technical assistance component)
would be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche would be available
upon loan effectiveness. The loan would become effective: (i) when all
standard conditions for loan effectiveness (as set forth in the Bank's
General Conditions) are met, and (ii) when all specific conditions for loan
effectiveness, as summarized in paragraph 93, have been fulfilled. The
release of the second tranche, projected to be disbursed approximately eight
months after loan effectiveness, would be contingent upon the Government
having taken the actions s9amarized in paragraph 94. As part of the Bank's
continuing policy dialogue with the Government it would monitor the
Government's macroeconomic program to determine that it remains consistent
vith the implementation of the trade policy reform.
93.      Specific conditions of effectiveness for the loan would be:
(a) the macro-economic framework is consistent with the objectives of the
trade policy reform program (paras. 52-72);
(b) the Government has announced a timetable for the removal of NTB's on
imports of manufactured items and for restructuring and reducing tariffs,
consistent with international agreements (paras. 54-60);
(c) NTBs have been removed from sufficient tariff items to reduce the agreed
index of production coverage (Annex VII) to 252 (para. 55);
(d) all specific tariffs have been removed (para. 59);
(e) tariff exonerations, except on selected CKD units and basic commodities,
have been eliminated (para. 60);
(f) a maximum tariff of 80Z has been established (para. 59);



- 23 -
(g) monopolies or exclueive import rights on products by state enterprises
have been removed (para. 61);
(h) all restrictions on exports of manufactured goods, except for those items
where the Government provides subsidies, have been eliminated (para. 66).
94.      The release of the second tranche is expected to take place in March
1990, after an exchange of views with the Government. The second tranche
will be released when the Bank has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it
that:
(a) NTBs have been removed from sufficient tariff items to reduce the agreed
index of production coverage to 15t (para. 55);
(b) the tariff structure has been reformed, in agreement with the Bank, to no
more than six rates between 0 and 502 (para. 60);
(c) the export bonus is not paid on any products, and legislation has been
submitted to abolish it (para. 65);
(d) antidumping and antisubsidy provisions have been formulated and put into
effect and, when required, submitted to its Congress for approval,
embodying principles of independent review, proof of injury, national
welfare criteria, public scrutiny, and providing relief through temporary
ad-valorem duties with fixed terminations (para. 62);
(e) programs to introduce duty drawback and improve temporary admissions for
imported inputs for exporters have been implemented (para. 64);
(f) the macro-economic framework is consistent with the objectives of the
trade policy reform program (paras. 52-72).
95.      The Government in its Statement of Trade Policy has indicated that
it will undertake the following additional actionst
(a) removal of NTBs sufficient to reduce the agreed index of production
coverage to not more than five percent by September 1990 (para. 55);
(b) completion of a study by September 1, 1990, and agreement by the
Government with the World Bank on a program for substantial removal of
NTBs on agricultural imports and controls of agricultural exports,
beginning January 1, 1991 (para. 56);
(c) completion of a study of customs administration and, by February 1990,
implementation of first stages of a program for improvements agreed with
the World Bank (para. 68);
(d) completion of a study of industrial regulations and incentives--including
the tariff structure--and agreement by the Government and the World Bank
on a program for improvements by February 1990 (paras. 60, 70);
(e) exonerations will be eliminated on all CKD kits by March, 1991 (para.
60).
Preparation and Board presentation of a second Trade Policy Loan would depend
upon the Government's satisfactory implementation of (a) through (e).

F. Monitoring
96.      The trade policy reform program and the proposed loan will require
monitoring of the adequacy and consistency of the macroeconomic framework and
the implementation of the actions under the program detailed in the
Government's Statement of Trade Policy (Annex IV). The Bank will monitor
these areas through regular supervision and exchange of views with the
Government. These discussions will cover actions, targets and performance
regarding the public sector deficit, public investments and expenditure,
interest rates, the exchange rate, reduction of quantitative import
restrictions, import tariffs, and export incentives. Monitoring of the real
exchange rate, interest rates, and inflation will, in particular, assist in
assessing the consistency of the macroeconomic policy framework. The Bank
and the Government have agreed on the basis of monitoring these areas.
G. Benefits and Risks
97.      Benefits.  Trade policy reform is a critical area of structural
change. Reorientation from inefficient import substitution will promote
international competitiveness in non-oil exports and production for the
domestic market. Together with an appropriate macroeconomic framework and
trade liberalization is also expected to reduce inflationary pressures.
Finally, external confidence in economic management should increase, thereby
facilitating mobilization of official and conmmercial financing.
98.      Risks.  A major risk is the possible inconsistency of the
macroeconomic policy framework with trade liberalization and continued
structural change. This risk has been addressed by specific commitments from
the Government both to the Bank (in the context of the proposed SAL) and to
the IMF on policy targets and actions concerning key macroeconomic areas.
99.      A second risk is that of delayed or incomplete implementation of the
first phase of reform. This risk is minimized both by the Government's
strong commitment to the program and by the expectation that external factors
(oil prices, interest rates) w4ll not evolve to alter this commitment.
100.     Finally, there is a risk that the structural change under this
operation may not be sustained and extended, and that microeconomic
adjustment is not induced. This risk is mitigated by the widespread desire
in Venezuela to reduce the economy's vulnerability to external shocks by
diversifying the productive base and increasing its efficiency, and by the
strong public commitment of the President to carry out the proposed reforms.
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
101.     The TPL and SAL would be the first Bank loans to Venezuela since
January 1974. The Bank's strategy for assisting Venezuela is designed to
support the economic reforms introduced by the Perez Government, with focus
on those aspects directed,to medium-term development: provision of a
competitive economic environment; establishment of an appropriate role for
the public sector, through reform and restructuring of public enterprises,
reforms of regulatory structures, and privatization of state enterprises;
strengthened management of public investment as a vehicle for growth; and
concerted programs to address the problems of poverty and to develop



- 25 -
affective social services. These areas, together with support for the
macroeconomic framework will be the focus of the Bank's future program.
A. History of Bank Assistance
102.     The Bank was active in Venezuela between 1961 and 1974.  The Bank
approved 13 loans to Venezuela, the first in 1961 (for a Caracas expressway),
the last in 1974, for agricultural credit. The latter loan never became
effective, so the last loan that was disbursed was the 1972 Livestock
Development Loan. Total loans to Venezuela amounted to US$383 million, of
which US$342 million was disbursed, and all but US$3 million has been repaid.
The last disbursement was made in 1979. The Bank's loans to Venezuela
included support for agricultural development (two projects), transport (four
projects, including an airport), power (four projects, including the Guri
hydroelectric project), telecommunications (two projects), and water supply
(one loan). PPARs were prepared for most projects; their findings, have
limited application given the fundamental transformation of Venezuela's
economy which has taken place over time.  In summary, most projects were
viewed as relatively successful, with the exception of the two agricultural
projects which were not implemented because the Government which took office
in 1974 pursued a different agricultural policy and cancelled the loans.
103.     During the 1970's, the Bank provided substantial technical
assistance to Venezuela, and maintained a Resident Mission through 1979.
Venezuela chose not to borrow from the Bank; subsequently, the per capita
income exceeded the Bank's graduation limit. Venezuela in 1974 loaned the
Bank the equivalent of US$500 million. The Bank provided the equivalent of
27 staff-years of non-reimbursable technical assistance to help in the
appraisal of proposed projects and in general economic analysis. In this
context, the Bank was closely associated with the establishment of the
Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) and its early operations. From the late
1970's, Bank technical assistance was one staff year each year.
B. Renewed Bank Program for Venezuela
104.     With the onset of the debt crisis and reduced external, Venezuela
sought to borrow from the Bank. In 1984, a hydroelectric loan was considered
and dropped. The Bank at this stage pre-paid Venezuela's loan to the Bank.
By 1986, it was clear that, with the expected devaluation of the currency,
Venezuela would be eligible to borrow from the Bank, and the needs for
development were established. The Executive Directors were informed in
December, 1986 that Bank management considered Venezuela an eligible
borrower, and that the focus of the program would be on policy reform and
adjustment lending. Based on projected economic growth, Venezuela is
expected to remain eligible to borrow well beyond 2000.
105.     Up to January 1989, the Bank's operational work in Venezuela focused
on assessing economic policies and on preparing this trade policy loan. At
the Government's request the Bank in 1988 assessed economic issues and
options for reform to establish a coherent medium-term framework for the
Government's programs and Bank operations. The objective was to help the
incoming Government formulate a program of economic reform, which each
presidential candidate affirmed was required. UNDP financed the work, which
was carried out by the Bank, in collaboration with the Government. The
report, sent to the Government in November 1988, was organized around four



- 26 -
themest public sector reform; exchange rate, trade, and industrial policies;
financial policies; and social policies. The consensus with the Perez
Government on the diagnosis in this report and its recommendations served as
the basis to prepare the structural adjustment program.
C. Bank Operational Strategy
106.     The Bank's operational strategy for Venezuela has been framed in the
light of the Policy Options Report and discussions with the new Government.
It will support adjustment and development through lending, economic and
sector analysis, and supporting external resource mobilization.  Immediate
priorities are: (a) to continue to realign the economy by removing severe
distortions while protecting the poor during the transition, and to initiate
the medium term economic adjustment and development program; (b) to support
Venezuela's efforts to secure external financing, including restructuring and
reduction of debt; and (c) to prepare programs and investment projects
involving: policy measures and investments in industry and agriculture;
financial sector and trade policy reforms; social policies and development of
social services; and adjustment and investment programs in infrastructure,
notably the power sector, urban transport, and municipal services.
107.     The SAL and TPL would support the Government's economic reform and
define the scope for future action. The SAL builds on the stabilization
measures, agreed in the context of the IMF program. However, it focuses on
longer-term structural reform. The SAL would establish a foundation for
broad-based assistance. The SAL and TPL are important to stabilization and
adjustment. The financial package also includes the planned IMP Extended
Fund Facility, bilateral loans in conjunction with the IBRD and IMF programs,
and a new agreement with the commercial banks entailing a revision of current
rescheduling agreements, new money packages, and debt reduction measures.
The program represents a coherent framework for stabilization and reform, but
the external financing will be critical to its success. Close collaboration
and coordination among the parties has been and will be essential.
Future Lending Program
108.     Future Bank lending could, as economic reforms proceed, amount to
about US$750 million a year. Loans would support policy reforms, with about
half in quick-disbursing loans for policy adjustment, and for sector or
project investment with related policy reforms. Proposals for the next two
years include:
(a) a financial sector adjustment operation to reform the banking sector,
improve regulation and supervision, and reforms in directed credit
programs and the public banks;
(b) a public management operation to deepen reforms under the SAL, notably
further adjustments in the pricing of public enterprises and utilities,
restructuring of public enterprises, privatization, and civil service
and tax reform;
(c) a social sector project to support expanded and new programs focused on
the poor and vulnerable social groups, notably nutritional programs in
low income areas serving pregnant women, infants, and children;



- 27 -
td) an industrial restructuring operation;
(e) a social sector operation to improve services and housing in the slum
areas of Caracas and major cities; and
(f) an agricultural sector operation to reform agricultural policies on
trade, input subsidies, prices, credit, and investment.
In subsequent years, lending proposals include further support for trade
reform, agricultural research and extension, urban transport, and improved
urban services, notably water supply.
External Financint Requirements and TBRD Exposure
109.     Venezuela's net financing gap is projected to be US$2.6 billion per
year in 1989-95. Bank gross disbursements of US$650-700 million per year in
the immediate future would contribute 252 of the net financing gap.
Currently, the IDB is expected to contribute 1Ot, bilaterals (including
suppliers' credits) 201, and international monetary institutions (1HF, FAR,
BIS) 15?. Private financial institutions, in addition to rescheduling
amortizations, are expected to finance the remaining 30S of the net financing
gap. Because the World Bank is renewing its lending to Venezuela from zero
base, this level of lending will not lead to significant exposure. The World
Bank's share of total debt would be less than 7Z in 1995 and 9.41 in 2000.
Furthermore, the debt service to the Bank will level off at 2.21 of exports
in the late 1990s and then decline.
110.     Debt reduction could contribute to the financing plan to complement
new money. We are providing the option of support for debt reduction in this
loan (para. 87). Debt reduction would not inciease significantly the Bank's
exposure. For example, a 251 reduction in commercial debt would raise the
Bank's share in total debt by about one percentage point to 10.41 in 2000.
Economic and Sector Work Proaram
111.     The Bank's economic and sector work program would have the
objectives of supporting policy reforms and developing the lending program.
The first priorities are a review of the public investment program to support
the Government's reforms under the SAL, analyses of the agricultural and
industrial sectors, and a review of urban transpoL. problems. Studies of
social well-being and environmental issues are also planned.
112.     Formulation of a poverty alleviation program would include specific
operations. This is important in light of the severity of poverty despite
past prosperity and heavily-subsidizeA social services.  In addition,
institutional development will be emphasized to enhance the economic program
by strengthening ministries and agencies implementing the program. Technical
assistance is proposed under the TPL and the SAL to identify and prepare
broader institutional development programs. Important environmental issues
will be addressed including potential damage to the Amazon and Orinoco
basins, limited watershed management and soil erosion and depletion in some
areas, and pollution linked to industrial and mining development.

D. IFC ODerations
113.     The IFC has been active in Venezuela since it resumed opsrations In
1987, providing investments and technical assistance. In May, 1987 the IPC
approved a US$10 million loan and a guarantee for a US$27.6 million domestic
bond issue for a private cement firm. In January 1988 the IFC approved a
US$75 million operation, involving Japanese banks, for an iron plant.
PART VI - COLLABORATION WIT! TIE IMF
114.     Before 1989, Venezuela had not used IMF resources and had a large
reserve position in the Fund. As part of the 1986 commercial rescheduling
agreement, Venezuela entered an Enhanced Surveillance arrangement with the
IMF, under which economic targets were set, reviewed by the IMP semi-
annually, and Fund Staff Reports were circulated to the banks. In early
1989, Venezuela asked to enter a more formal program. A Letter of Intent was
signed and the Board approved Venezuela's request to purchase ito First
Credit Tranche (251 of Quota--about US$450 million). An Extended Fund
Facility is being discussed to allow the purchase of about US$4.3 billion
over three years. The Fund's Board is expected to consider this in June.
115.     The Bank and the Fund would be supporting the same macroeconomic
framework, and the Fund and Bank programs are consistent, with the Fund's
program focused on macro-stabilization and the Bank's on longer-term
adjustment within a consistent macro framework. Critical to both programs
are the unified, floating exchange rate, the flexible interest rate policy,
the lifting of quantitative import restrictions and tariff reform, tax
reform, the pricing of goods produced by public enterprises, improved
effectiveness of subsidies, and the fiscal deficit. Bank and Fund staff
agree on the importance of progress in each area, and have worked with the
Government in preparing its program. Both institutions recognize that there
is a single, unified and coherent reform program.
PART VII - RICONUM&TION
116.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Art.cles
of Agreement of the Bank and reconmend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMEN? PROGRAU
The Government of Venezuela has adopted an overall economic strategy
that seeks to correct the disequilibria in the fiscal, monetary, exchange, and
foreign trade areas that have affected the country's ability to grow without
inflation. The short-term stabilization measures aim at establishing the
basis for a healthy and durable expansion of the economy in the coming
decades.
As part of this strategy, the National Government has decided to go
forward with a Trade Adjustment Program with the fundamental objective of
increasing the competitiveness of the Venezuelan economy. It is also expected
that the reform will facilitate implementation of the adjustment policy during
the years 1989 and 1990 and allows industrial policy objectives to be met.
The Government has well-founded expectations that, as a consequence
of its policies and of the achievement of its established objectives,
inflationary pressures and capital flight will be reversed, while new
employment opportunities are generated, which will permit addressing the needs
of the disadvantaged population more effectively. These expectations are
strongly influenced by the evolution of the foreign environment, particularly
with regard to the external debt and international trade trends.
This statement describes the Government's policies and goals for the
medium-term trade regime. To support this adjustment program, the Government
of Venezuela requests World Bank financing.
1. THE BASIS FOR ITS TRADE POLICY
Trade adjustments are an important element of the overall program for
stabilization and gradual removal of unnecessary controls, which is designed
to promote efficiency and growth. During the 19809, the Venezuelan trade
regime became very complex. Numerous interrelated measures were used,
including multiple foreign exchange rates and rationing of foreign currency;
import restrictions and licensing; tariffs, additional duties, and
exonerations; export licensing and controls; and export credits and fiscal
subsidies. On the other hand, quantitative restrictions and other domestic
measures closely linked to the trade regime, e.g., price controls, have been
heavily depended on.
These measures had contradictory effects, since they either
strengthened or nullified each other. Consequently, the Government will bring
about gradual adjustment of its trade policies so as to promote the
simplification and transparency of the trade regime. The gradualness of the
program is aimed at reducing the uncertainty caused by the changes to the
regime and at guaranteeing sufficient time for industry to effect the
necessary adjustments which imply adaptation to an opening to international
competition. The first phase of this adjustment program will focus on the

- 37 -                         Page 2 of 6
manufacturing sector. The medium-term objective will be directed towards a
regime in which the exchange rate will be the principal instrument of
protection for imported products and for export promotion. Protection with
regard to imports will be provided by tariffs.
In this context, and in view of the desire of the country to adhere
to the GATT, the Government of Venezuela will initiate the corresponding
process of negotiations for its entry into this organization.
2. EXCHANGE POLICY
The Government has made progress in adjusting its exchange system,
having established a single and floating exchange rate which guarantees
maintaining a real and competitive parity, to promote expansion of traded
goods and support the trade reform.
S. DMPORT REGINE
Son-tariff bar_iers INTBs). At present, 492 of national
manufacturing production and an important part of the agricultural production
are protected by import barriers and quantitative restrictions. Allocation of
foreign exchange at preferential rates has been eliminated. The Government
will reduce manufacturing production coverage by non-tariff restrictions and
substitute tariffs for this mechanism. In the medium term, import
restrictions will be used as needed only in the areas of public health,
sanitation, and national security. Quantitative restrictions referred to in
this document as being lifted are those represented by Schedules 1, 2, 4, and
8 of Venezuela's external tariffs.
By July 1, 1989, the Government will lift NTBs so as to reduce this
coverage to 252 of manufacturing production. By March, 1990, the Government
will eliminate additional NTBs, thereby further reducing manufacturing
production coverage to 152. By September, 1990, NTBs will cover 5 of
manufacturing production subject to quantitative restrictions, not including
in this percentage those referred to in the previous paragraph.
The Government will initiate a study of the trade regime's impact on
the agricultural sector, with the aim of harmonizing adjustments in this area
in pricing, financial, and marketing policies. This study will have been
completed by September 1, 1990. Agricultural trade policy adjustments will
begin in January 1991.
Tariffs. Tariffs have offered little protection due to the extensive
use of NTBs and the practice of exonerations. In April 1989, Venezuelan
tariffs covered a range of between 02 and 1352, ad valorem, and nearly 1,000
tariff categories were subject to ad valorem and specific taxes
simultaneously. If in 1989 the average incidence was between 35Z and 401,
exemptions reduced the taxes effectively collected by revenue authorities to
between 82 and 1O0.



ANNEX IV
- 38 -                         Page 3 of 6
In July 1989, the Government will develop a tariff schedule that
will eliminate all specific taxes, establishing a tariff ceiling of 802 for
consumer goods and a 502 ceiling for intermediates, capital goods and raw
materials. The objective of this initial scheme will be to provide temporary
and decreasing protection over time. It should also be compatible with
international agreements entered into by the Government of Venezuela.
As of July 1989, all exonerations will be eliminated.incorporating
ther-, partially, in the tariff except for those granted to basic goods, the
CKD regime, and public administration (cases for which exemptions will
continue until the laws of creation of certain autonomous institutions are
modified).
By March 1990, the maximum tariff for consumer goods will be reduced
to 5O0. At the same time, the harmonized tariff system will be adopted,
restructuring of tariffs will be implemented according to the stage of
processing of the goods. The Government of Venezuela proposes establishing six
(6) tariff levels, and the sectoral structure will obey criteria which permit
adequate effective protection levels. The process of reducing tariffs will
continue gradually and in a homogeneous manner, so as to prevent speculation
and expectations that might jeopardize its success.
By March, 1991, exonerations of the CKD regime will be eliminated.
Maximum ad-valorem level will be fixed at 402. By March 1992, the maximum ad-
valorem rate will 30? in four (4) tariff rates, and by March 1993, the maximum
tariff rate will be 20? and three (3) ranges.
These measures and the schedule for their implementation will be
announced, so as to reduce uncertainty in the productive sector and provide
the necessary adjustment period to adapt its production plans.
Imnort Mononolies. By June, 1989, the Government proposes to
eliminate all import monopolies.
Unfair Trade Practice Heasures. As part of its trade adjustment
program and in accordance with the transition towards a tariff-based
protection system, the Government will develop mechanisms to deal with unfair
trade practices. During the transition period, compensatory tariffs based on
a comparison with international prices will be used as a means of protection.
By February, 1990, the Government will establish a competent review
authority with public accountability, to whom complaints would be submitted.
4. EXPORT REGIMN
Venezuela has maintained a complex export regime. Notwithstanding,
maintaining a competitive exchange rate and rationalizing protection of the
domestic market will be a decided impetus to export growth.
In conformity with the Organic Law of Central Administration, Decree
No. 80 of March 12, 1989, created a commission with the following objectives:



-39 -                           ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 6
a)       To analyze and evaluate the export regime of non-traditional goods
and services of national origin, as well as the incentives granted to
this sector;
b)       To study and propose mechanisms to simplify existing exporting
procedures; and
c)       To carry out the pertinent studies for the creation of an agency to
promote and finance exports.
This commission will present to the Executive Branch. within a period
of two months, a report containing the results obtained gnd the ensuing
recommendations, including the protocols for the instruments required.
In order to complement the trade adjustments advanced by the
Government of Venezuela, the coimission is presently studying the following
proposed export-related measuress
Exnort Incentives
The present tax credit regime will be progressively eliminated, as
the tariff adjustments are implemented and the various customs rebate regimes
contemplated in the Organic Customs Law come into full effect (duty draw back
or export customs tax allowances). By June 1989, the Executive will carry out
a study on the more efficient alternatives for operating this regime.
it is estimated that these regimes will be in place by February 1990, and,
therefore, the export bonus will be eliminated.
Restructurina of the Institute for Foreimn Trade (ICE)
The ICE will be restructured to comply fully with those functions
assigned to it as the coordinating agency for the export promotion policy.
As part of this restructuring, it is proposed to establish an
executing body for international promotion activities and technical assistance
to exporters (VENEXPORT).
Financina and Insurance
As regards financing and credit insurance, flexible and dynamic
mechanisms will be formulated which will permit more effective participation
in the international context. Non-discriminatory access to credit by all
exporters will be equally guaranteed.
ndean Pact and Other International Commitments
The Government will respect its commitments with regard to trade agreements
and negotiate any possible discrepancies between these and the trade
adjustments.

Administrative Controls and Procedures
Unification of the exchange rate made possible elimination of a good
part of the controls demanded of exporters and allowed, moreover, free access
to foreign currency for the purchase of raw materials and imported inputs.
The ICE eliminated export permits required for samples and the prior
requirement of a National Value-Added Certificate for exporting.
By July 1989, the ICE will have made their tax credit administrative
procedures more flexible. It will have also eliminated all permits, licenses,
and restrictions on manufactured goods for export, except for those products
presently included in the basic basket of goods, which would be submitted to a
special regime.
s. MCHNSM TO SUPPORT TUE ADJUSnKNTS
The success of the trade policy adjustment program described above
will depend In great part on the capacity of the productive sectors to adjust
to an environment of greater economic competitiveness. With this in mind, it
is intended, with the possible aid of the World Bank Ad other institutions,
to undertake initiatives in the areas of industrial restructuring,
institutional reforms, trade streamlining, and training of human resources.
In the area of restructuring, the Government intends to start a
program of technical and financial support for those firms that are willing to
increase their productivity, modernize technologically, and bmprove the
quality of their production, so as to expand their exports and stimulate
competitiveness vis-a-vis imports. The technical assistance would include
subsector studies, designed to provide information to producers and financing
institutions on productivity improvement programs, as well as direct
assistance to firms, under shared-cost schemes, for the preparation of
restructuring proposals. A portion of the proceeds from the trade policy
adjustment loan would be allocated to finance initial technical assistance
efforts for industrial restructuring.
In line with the financial sector adjustment program, efforts will be
channelled to ensure financial support and investments for industrial
restructuring. This will require the creation of adequate institutional
mechanisms for the evaluation of restructuring projects, and ensuring
sufficient credit resources and appropriate instruments of credit.
The institutional streamlining of the Siinistry of Development and its
agencies for its new functions will be supported by the trade policy
adjustment loan. The Government proposes to begin reorganizing this Ministry
to facilitate its role as industrial promoter and to reduce administrative
controls. A portion of the trade policy adjustment loan would be allocated to
technical assistance, consulting services, and equipment for this
reorganization, as well as to the necessary studies regarding Venezuela's
possible incorporation into GATT.
With the intention of facilitating the flow of trade, the need to
revise customs administration procedures and modernize customs in general has
been raised. As a first step, the Government would carry out, with World Bank
assistance, a study of customs and customs administration, for the purpose of
formulating a plan of action to facilitate trade, to begin on July 1, 1989. A

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF ANALYSIS OF-tARIFFS
AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS
This annex describes the methodology used to generate tariff (mean,
standard deviation. etc.), and non-tariff barrier (coverage, etc.) infor-
mation.  The analysis has been performed using the World Bank SINTIA-T
software 1/ and data provided by the Goverament.
A. Basic Tariff and NTB Data
The basic tariff information was obtained from the Arancel de
Aduanas de Venezuela No. 95 (April. 1989). Ad-valorem tariff rates were
entered item-by-item at the 10-digit NABANDINA level and were based on the
published rates.
Specific tariffs were converted to ad-valorem equivalent by the
Government using data on import volume and values (in bolivares) from the
Anuario del Comercio Exterior de Venezuela. 1986 and 1987. Where there are
tariffs, they are generally accompanied by ad-valorem rates; the tariff duty
payable being the combination of ad-valorem and specific rates levied on
c.i.f. import value. To reflect the companion nature of specific tariffs,
these rates are included in the data file as *other duties' and can be
included or excluded in the analysis.
Non-tariff barriers information were derived from the numbered codes
listed in the Reximen Leval section of the Arancel de Aduanas. Each code or
combination of codes was entered by NABANDINA item. On one data file they
were consolidated into four categories to facilitate analysis as follows:
Category As   Unrestricted Import (no nota)
Category B:   Prohibited Import (Nota 1)
Category C:   Restricted Import (Notas 2, 4, and 8)
Category Ds   Health, safety, security,  Import Permit (Notas 3, 5,
6, 7, and 9).
In cases of multiple notas, prohibitions or restrictions were given priority
relative to others, and thus a product with multiple Notas 2, 5, and 6
(license + health permit + health verification) for example, would be
considered as Category C.
B. Production Coverage by NTBs
Production data were derived from the 1987 Encuesta Industrial on
the ISIC classification (CIIU), with 1 digit information for Agriculture, and
Mining, and 4 digit information for Manufacturing (including agro-
processing). More detailed data are being sought for agriculture and mining.
The Government has provided a mapping between NABANDINA classifications and
4-digit ISIC for all sectors (Agriculture, Mining, and Manufacturing).

The relative importance of various NTB regimes was counted by the
frequency of consolidated NTBs categories in each ISIC sector. The frequency
ratios were multiplied by the value of production for that sector to derive a
measure of NT8 coverage. These measures are approximate rather than actual
values of production covered by NTBs. The methodology to calculate the
production coverage of quantitative restrictions by ISIC sector is
represented algebraicly as followst
OjaNj
where Oj is the percentage of NABANDINA items with NTBs in sector j; ;j
represents the number of NABANDINA positions corresponding to each ISIC
sector J, and Nj represents the number of items subject to NTBs for that
sector. Total production coverage of quantitative restrictions is calculated
as:

C. Imorts and Exports
Import and export data for 1987 by 4-digit ISIC were provided by the
Instituto de Comercio Exterior, Oficina de Informitica.
D. Monitorinu of Trade Reform
t.he basic data on tariffs and NTBs and the derived data on coverage
ratio will be used to monitor the trade reform process. The Government will
provide updated data to the Bank at regular intervals.
P. Harmonized System
Venezuela intends to introduce the Harmonized System of Tariff
nomenclature, along with its partners in the Andean Common Market in
January, 1990. The Vorld Bank and the Government will, at that time, adopt a
mutually agreeable methodology to map the Harmonized System - based
restrictions into the NABANDINA System for the purpose of measuring
compliance.

TECUNICaL ASSISTANCE
The trade regime envisaged under the new policies will require
procedures, skills, facilities, and institutions which differ markedly from
those vhich are now applied. A technical assistance component is proposed to
finance training, outside consultants, equipment, and analytical support
necessary for the policies' successful implementation. The technical
assistance will support policy studies and institutional reforms and finance
the design of the programs of industrial restructuring.
Cost of the technical assistance is estimated at US$3.0 millions
US$675,000 is for studies to support institutional reform, US$150,000 for
computer software and hardware, US$1,575,000 for studies to support
industrial restructuring, and US$600,000 for a pilot program of direct
technical assistance to enterprises.
STUDIES AID INSTITUTIONAL RZFO3I
Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation. With the Government
restructuring tariffs, eliminating exonerations, and abandoning import
licenses and exchange controls, the efficient and uniform collection of
tariffs will be of greater importance. An efficient customs service reduces
the costs of importing and exporting and assists the Government to achieve
its objectives in trade reform. The Venezuelan customs service needs
modernization and mechanization. Forms and procedures need to be designed
with a view toward trade facilitation while providing adequate governmental
control.
It is proposed to retain international technical experts to study
all aspects of customs administration !ncluding facilities, valuation,
classification and import controls, statistics, and trade facilitation. This
study will be completed prior to release of the second tranche, and its
findings will be a basis for a program to improve the customs service.
Consultancy services will be provided in two stagess (i) diagnostic services,
and (ii) assistance with institutional reforms.
In the diagnostic stage the services of recognized international
experts will be retained to assess requirements for changes in
classification, valuation, and customs administration. The consultants will
design plans for reform in these areas and prepare terms of reference for
consultants retained under the implementation phase. The estimated cost of
the diagnostic work is US$75,000 ineluding travel and overhead.
In the implementation the government will contract consultants for
up to one year to support the implementation of the reform program, according
to terms of reference developed in the diagnostic phase. These consultants
will generally be expected to be former senior officials of customs services
with experience in implementing improvements. The estimated cost of the
implementation phase will be US$100,000, including travel and allowances.
SuDport for GATT Negotiations. With Venezuela's import substitution
strategy and reliance on exports of petroleum and a --w primary commodities
from state enterprises, previous Governments have had ls;u'e incentive to



-49 -                                AM= VM
Page 2 of 12
pursue integration into the world trading system. However, under the new
policies which will expand imports and exports while reducing governmental
intervention, the 6overnment anticipates that there could be new benefits
from accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It
proposes to investigate the consequences of accession to GATT, and it seeks
assistance to facilitate its analyses and negotiations. In some areas, Bank
staff members can provide initial information and guidance, but outside legal
and technical experts will be required for detailed consultations.
Legal Studies. The implications for Venezuela of the various Codes,
agreements, and instrumerts which comprise GATT need to be fully
understood. The Government proposes to contract with experts who could
undertake detailed analyses of the implications of each for the Venezuelan
economy and its structure and institutions of international trade.
EFxeriences of Previous Entrants. Other Latin American nations, including
Mexico and Costa Rica have recently acceded to GATT. Venezuelan officials
could benefit from understanding the experiences which these nations had
in negotiating their accession and the implications for Venezuela. The
Government has reqttested financial support for travel of selected
officials or outside experts in connection with these consultations.
Support for GATT negotiations is estimated to cost US$50,000
(Legal studies, $30,000; Expericiies of previous entrants, $20,000).
These funds will support travel and fees of both international and national
consultants and training for selected government officials.
Trade Policy Seminar. Governmental officials, private executives,
the press and the wider community would benefit from a greater
understanding of the consequences of the Government's new trade policy
measures or of accession to GATT. To facilitate an informed public debate,
the Government proposes to sponsor a public seminar on the implications for
Venezuela of trends in international trade, trade policy reform and the
experiences of other nations, the GATT system, and the Uruguay round. The
seminar will feature speakers from relevant organizations and would draw
upon several lines of research and technical expertise of the World Bank.
The Government has requested assistance in identifying appropriate topics
and speakers and in financing some of the expenses of the seminar. The
estimated cost of this activity is US$40,000.
International Trade Data Systems. There are a number of data
systems--including some developed within the World Bank--available on trade
flows and tariffs and NTBs. These systems would be useful for governmental
policy decisions and the private sector, but the Government does not have
the hardware, software, or trained staff to use them. The Government has
requested advice on appropriate, cost-effective methods to use these data
bases and to integrate its trade data with them. It has requested
technical assistance to buy hardware and software, and to train selected
staff members. This function is expected to cost US$60,000.
Anti-Dumping and Anti-Subsidy Lexislation.  Venezuela has relied
on prohibitions, licenses, and delegations to restrict imports. Under the
new policies, trade flows will be controlled primarily by the exchange rate
and by tariffs so that the domestic economy could be more vulnerable to
possibility of the proscribed trade practices. The Government proposes to



-S    -                              AM=EU VIII
Page 3 of 12
enact anti-dumping and anti-subsidy legislation to provide relief where
there are legitimate findings that dumping or trade subsidies have caused
injury.
As part of the trade reform program and the shift to tariff-based
protection and accession to the GATT, the Government will formulate GATT-
consistent antidumping and antisubsidy pzocedures. Independent legal
experts will be retained to advise on alternative institutional
arrangements and procedures to ensure that any determinations are based on
national welfare criteria, subject to public scrutiny, and that relief is
provided only through temporary duties with fixed termination dates.
The technical assistance component will support approximately four
man months of consultancy services by internationally qualified experts to
advise on the design and implementation of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
procedures. Estimated costs are US$50,000, including travel and fees.
Duty-Drawback and Temnorary Admissions Schemes. Because tariff
exonerations will be eliminate&d under the Government's program, the
temporary admissions and the duty drawback schemes will take on new
importance for exporters. The Government will contract with outside
technical experts to review these programs--as well as those of several
other countries--to adapt procedures for Venezuelan exporters which are
simple, accurate, transparent, and widely understood. The estimated cost
of this assistance will be approximately Us$50,000 to support four man
months of consultancy services with associated travel and overheads.
Study of Agricultural Sector. As of February, 1989, about 942 of
agricultural production was protected by NTB's on competing imports.
Further, in connection with its price controls, the Government has banned
exports of several agricultural products. To inform the process of
liberalization of agricultural trade, the Government will engage outside
technical experts to undertake a study of the incidence and protection of
all NTB's on agricultural imports, and the costs and benefits of export
prohibitions. The study will indicate the necessary coordination between
domestic agricultural pricing and distribution policies and reform of the
trade system.
The product of the study vill be programs to eliminate export
prohibitions and to replace non-tariff agricultural import barriers with
tariffs. In the case of products subject to price stabilization, the
consultants will explore mechanisms to establish a system of variable
levies. Programs should be ready for implementation by December 1990.
Costs are estimated at US$100,000 for consultant services, including travel
and subsistence.
Study of Industrial ReRulations and Incentives.  Private
investment has been restricted by discretionary industrial regulations and
incentives. Reform of this system is important to provide the proper
incentives for investments in the traded goods sector in response to the
trade policy reform. The Government will undertake a study of the
industrial regulations and incentives--expected to cost $100,0000--to
design a program for industrial regulation. As part of this study, and to
ensure that the restructuring of the tariff, the Government will engage
consultants to evaluate alternative tariff structures.

Restructurine of Ministry of Development. The shift in emphasis
implied by the trade reform program for the Ministry of Development is
marked. Administrative approvals of trade and investment controls will be
eliminated and new functions in industrial promotion and restructuring will
need to be developed. Programs of retraining for existing staff,
reorganization of departments, and orderly procedures for redeployment of
the work force will be needed.
The technical assistance component will finance consulting
services and training, including travel and subsistence, to support the
reorganization of the Ministry. Costs are estimated at US$50,000.
Computer Suport. The information and data processing capability
of the ministries charged with analyzing, implementing, and monitoring the
trade policy reforms is inadequate. The Government has asked for financing
for hardware and software for selected officials to monitor and analyze the
implementation of the program. Costs of computer software are estimated
not to exceed US$50,000. Purchase of computer hardware, consisting mainly
of personal computers and ancillaries, will be financed up to US$100,000.
INDUSTRIAL YSR1JCTURING PROGRAM
Sectotal and Subsectoral Studies. The Government of Venezuela,
producers' associations, and the World Bank are exploring the possibility
of an Industrial Restructuring and Development Program. The objective of
the Program would be to accelerate adjustment to the relative price changes
emerging from trade reform.
The main strategy would be to foster increases in factor
productivity and international competitiveness of industrial enterprises to
take advantage of efficient import-substitation and export opportunities.
The strategy would be expected to increasf penetration of (primarily
consumer goods) export markets and to gain a larger share of the domestic
market for internationally competitive goods. Such a strategy, combined
policies to neutralize productive incentives between exports and import
substitution, will encourage reallocation of resources toward areas of
comparative advantage, and increase the rate of employment creation while
conserving capital and foreign exchange.
The program would focus on the private sector, though given the
Goverrment's recently announced interest in privatization, it might also
address public enterprises. Subject to further consideration during
preparation, eligibility for financing would require enterprises to provide
well prepared restructuring proposals yielding financial and economic rates
of return above the opportunity cost of capital and reducing the gap
between domestic and international production costs.1
I/ Restructuring investments, as distinct from those aimed at expansion of
productive capacity, includes modernization and rehabilitation of
plants; changes in technology; development and diversification of
product lines; reorganization of production, marketing and
distribution; labor and management retraining and redeployment; changes
in financial structure and/or investment and working capital financing.

Program Preparation. A series of studies at the industrial
sector, subsector and enterprise levels seeks to evaluate and design a
program. These represent the identification and preparation phases of the
Program. This work is expected to be completed before July 1990.
Studies of three to five subsectors will be undertaken initially.
Should a program materialize, its scope would be likely to be enlarged
during implementation as the value of restructuring is demonstrated and the
problems and potential of other subsectors can be assessed.
The subsector studies will be prepared in three stepss
Survey - about 2 weeks of exploratory work to determine whether there
are significant benefits of restructuring and, if so, to prepare terms
of reference for Phase 1. Such work would begin in July 1989.
Phase 1 (Diagnostic) - an analysis over 2-3 months, based on a
representative enterprise sample, to determines (i) the international
competitiveness, (ii) the causes of any gap stemming from factors
within enterprises, the market's structure, or public policies, (iii)
the potential for improving performance and its socio-economic impact,
and (iv) options for restructuring and development. The report will
be reviewed by a committee of Government, industry, and the World Bank
to agree on its conclusions and recommendations.
Phase 2 (Program) - preparation over 3-4 months of a restructuring
program for the subsector and/or major enterprises which would set out
the costs of attaining international competitiveness and improving
performance. This would form the basis for investments and financing
of the restructuring. Each program would establish the cost of
restructuring, identify the main institutional support and other
arrangements for implementation, and estimate the economic and social
consequences.
The sectoral studies would be done primarily by Venezuelan
consultants, while for the subsector studies, joint ventures Dezween
Venezuelan and international consultants are anticipated. Work under Phase
1 is expected to be completed by February 1990. Phase 2 work should be
completed by about June 1990. Draft terms of reference for Phases 1 and 2
and guidelines for consultants for Phase 1 are contained in Attachments 1
and 2.
Direct Consulting Services to Enterprises. A pilot program of
direct assistance to firms on a cost-sharing basis will be undertaken. The
following tasks will be performed by consultants who are subsector
specialists with operational experience.
(a) Based on diagnostic phase, the consultants will estimate the costs
of specific restructuring and development measures and assess their
effects. These measures can be related to 'hardware" (plants and
equipment) and/or 'software' (product design, quality, or
development; marketing; export strategy; etc.). They may also
involve substitution of existing product lines, partial closures,
expansion of existing capacity, and identification of joint venture
partners to facilitate transfer of technology, access to export
markets and equity financing.

Page 6 of 12
(b) Preparation of restructuring and development proposals (packaging of
restructuring measures) which would serve as the basis for appraisal
by commercial institutions, The project proposals would comprise:
definition of scope, capital cost, financial and economic evaluation
including rate of return, and risk assessment.
(c) Preparation of an action plan with an assessment of implementation
assistance. It should be based on a milestone schedule for the key
activities according to their priorities.
(d) Advice to enterprise managers in terms of technology, cost
structure, product development, and general operating/investment
strategy.
Inputs. Outputs and Timing. The in-depth studies will overlap
with the diagnostic phase and will begin after completion of several
enterprise diagnoses and subsector reviews. It is desirable to arrange the
studies so that several concerning the same subsector can be effected
simultaneously to minimize travel expenses. On average, each study will
require about six staffweeks, so if 30 enterprises participate in the
program, the total requirements will be about 45 staffmonths. Since many
studies would be conducted in parallel, the study phase is projected to
last 12 to 15 months. Each study will involve one progress review and a
final discussion with the enterprise management and Ministry of Development
staff concerning the findings and recommendations. Contractual parties
will be the enterprise to be studied, Ministry of Development, and the
consultants. Funding will be provided through the technical assistance
component, with the enterprises required to contribute to the costs.
Industrial Restructuring Program Budget. The technical assistance
component will cover the costs of consultant services for the proposed
sectoral and subsectoral studies and a pilot program of direct assistance
to firms. The proposed budget ist

INDUSTRIAL 3RSTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROORAW
SUBSECTOR STUDY
DRAFT Tnm  OP RE ZuN
The Government of Venezuela, industrial producers' associations
and the World Bank are investigating an industrial restructuring and
development program. The purpose of the program would be to increase the
factor productivity and international competitiveness of Venezuelan
enterprises in response to the productive incentives under the trade policy
reform program.2
Identification and Prevaration
A series of sector and subsectoral studies would evaluate the
benefits and costs of a program and consider its design. They are the
identification and preparation phases of the Program and are prerequisites
for appraisal. Sectoral studies will be carried out on selected subjects
influencing industrial performance, including industrial incentives and
administrative controls. Drafts of these reports are anticipated in
January 1990 and would be available to firms selected for subsectoral
studies. Subsectoral studies will increase knowledge of industrial
performance and prospects, assist with sectoral work, support development
of an industrial policy, and devise restructuring and development programs.
Structure of the Subsector Study
Phase 1 - Subsector Diaanostic and Preliminary Plan. Analyses
should be prepared on a representative enterprise sample and in
collaboration with major interest groups to determines
(a) The international competitiveness of local production;
(b) The principal reasons for any gap stenmning from factors within
enterprises, the market's structure, or public policies;
(c) The costs of improving performance and its estimated effects;
(d) Policy options and costs for the subsector to attain international
competitiveness;
21 Restructuring in this context excludes investments aimed only at
expanding capacity to manufacture existing product lines.
Restructuring includes modernization and rehabilitation of plants;
changes in technology; changes and diversification of product lines;
reorganization of production, marketing and distribution; changes in
human resource skills, levels and uses; and changes in the capital and
financial structure as well as in sources and terms of investment and
working capital.

(e) A preliminary restructuring plan, to includes
(i)   Comparative advantage in major product lines,
(ii)  Apparent real arz  financial restructuring costs of enterprises,
(iii) Identification v  -he policy, institutional, and
infrastructural changes to facilitate restructuring, and
(iv)  Estimabed capital requirements to implement the plan;
(f) Terms of reference for Phase 2.
A thorough knowledge of the international market for each
subsector and of efficient comparator firms is a prerequisite for these
studies. Resources are to be focused on Venezuelan firms and their
business environment. Particular emphasis is to be placed on the influence
of public policies on performance, both in the recent past as well as under
any possible program. Phase 1 should be completed within four months.
Phase 2 - Restructuring and Development Plan. This phase should
entail preparation and support of the implementation of a medium-term
restructuring and development platz for the subsector. It should include:
(a) Detailed design of and support to reach agreement on public policy
changes identified in Phase 1;
(b) Detailed proposals for programs, infrastructure, and institutional
support at the subsector level identified in Phase 1 to facilitate
restructuring;
(c) Further domestic or international market studies on the viability of
any significant change in product mix; and
(d) Where only a few enterprises constitute most of subsector output.
preinvestment work to prepare for other aspects of restructuring.
Firms submitting proposals should include a description and a
detailed work program for the tasks they would carry out for Phase 2, based
on their understanding of the subsector in Venezuela and similar work
elsewhere. Phase 2 is anticipated to require about three months. A full
proposal is to be included in the Phase 1 draft report of the each firm.
Management and Sutervision
The program will be managed by a Subsector Committee, chaired by
the Minister of Development and including other representatives of the
Venezuelan Government, producers' associations, and bankers' associations.
It will assure that the consulting firms have visa arrangements adequate to
perform the study and access to all prior studies, recent information and
material necessary to complete the study.
Two reports are to be prepared in Spanish for Phase 1 An interim
report summarizing findings on subsector competitiveness and the principal
reasons for any gaps (sections (a) and (b) of para. 3), and a final report.
They will be submitted to the Subsectoral Committee and to the Vorld Bank
for review, discussion, and approval.

INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING AND DEVEL0     T PRORII
SUBSEcToR STUDY
Guidelines for Phase 1
Phase 1 of the Subsector Study, described in the attached Terms of
Reference, should build upon prior work and include:
(a) Assessment of lont run performance and competitiveness.
(i)   Value added, export, employment and wage trends;
(ii)  Comparisons in prices, cost structures, quality, productive and
allocative efficiency and capacity utilization for comparable
products between Venezuelan manufacturers and those in two or more
other countries currently considered to have the highest productive
efficiency. Comparisons should be made over a sufficiently long
period to account for exchange rate fluctuations; and
(iii) Financial performance (income and expense, sources and uses of
funds) and condition of the subsectort and a sample of larger and
smaller producers.
(b) Principal reasons for tans in comoetitiveness. Where product groups
are internationally competitive, explain basic factors giving Venezuela a
comparative advantage. Where product groups have higher price/cost
differentials, explain the gap. This should include examination of at least:
(i)    The domestic demand, including its size, structure of consumption
(including imports) of the main product lines, the market's growth
rate, and elasticities of demand with respect to income and price;
(ii)   Market structure, including number and size of firms, installed and
utilized production capacity by stages and products, geographical
distribution of plants, degree of specialization and integration,
ownership (including public/private, relations with multinationals
and interlocking relationships with other industrial and financial
enterprises), distribution channels, supply times and reliability.
other intangible factors influencing buyers;
(iii)  Exports and the strength and weaknesses in penetration of that
market;
(iv)   Production levels of plants, enterprises and the subsector in
relation to economies of scale;
(v)    Cost and productivity of production factors used (labor, capital,
technologies, raw materials and intermediate goods);
(vi)   Enterprise behavior, particularly in terms of strategies for
pricing and market share, the influence of foreign ownership and
management, and trade practices among enterprises;

(vii) The influence of the financial sector - cost of long term financing
and equity, conditionality for directed credits, cost of credit
given the types or locale of financial institutions, state of the
commercial financial system, etc.;
Iviii) The effects of government intervention--public ownership, price and
production controls, fiscal policies. Import restrictions and
tariffs, investment controls, subsidies--on allocative and
productive efficiency and a determination of the main beneficiaries
of these policies; and
(ix)   The influence of other public policies, such as those affecting
labor mobility and cost, the exchange rate, investment code and
industrial regulations, and receivership; and
(x)    The influence of the principal public and producer institutions on
performance--their responsibilities, their interactions and the
coordination and/or conflict in policy-making, implementation and
monitoring.
In each area, the analysis should be contrasted with trends in other
countries in which producers have attained the highest productive efficiency
and are likely to be international competitors of Venezuelan firmr.
Cc) Costs and Benefits of improving performance. Where a subsector is
not internationally competitive, assess the costs of restructuring. This
should include an assessment of the views of Venezuelan industrialists of the
benefits of restructuring and development of the sibsector, and their interest
in investing in such an endeavor. The benefits of such investments should be
described and estimated.
Cd) Subsector strateiv to attain international competitiveness. Prepare a
set of subsectoral policies and a strategy to improve performance, which could
become the basis for agreement between the producer association and the
Government with the support of the Bank; and
(e) A preliminarv subsector restructurinQ and develonment plan. As a
consequence of the analyses and subsector strategy, prepare a preliminary
restructuring and development plan which includes:
(i)   The main product lines and markets (both domestic and export) in
which Venezuela is likely to be competitive, including dauand
forecasts and proposals for adjustments in product mixt
(i$)  Definition of restructuring requirements with respect to enterprise
production (changes in product lines, fragmentation or consolidation
of enterprises through acquisition and mergers, changes in vertical
integration, relocation, etc.) and production factors (new
requirements for plant and equipment, management and the labor
force, technology and infrastructure) to increase competitiveness;
(iii) Description of changes in enterprises' liabilities and equity base
to establish financial viability for weak enterprises and to sustain
restructuring (refinancing and/or write-off of debt, increase in
working capital, new shares, convertible subordinated debt, etc.);

(iv) Proposals for public policies to facilitate restructuring. These
may include adjustments in areas such as technology policy
incentives', the external trade regime, labor and price control
regimes, other investmentioperating regulations, directed credit
policy, Government-industry working relationships and
receivership/baukruptcy. Such proposals should be accompanied by
estimates of the rate and phasing of policy changes in relation to
the rate at which enterprises can efficiently restructure;
(v)   Identification of institutional arrangements to facilitate
restructuring (institutional support to improve management, worker
retraining and redeployment, product development and marketing, new
financing mechanisms, adaptation or transfer of technology); and
(vi) Estimates of capital, by subsector and type of financing, to
implement the plan.
