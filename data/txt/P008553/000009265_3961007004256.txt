MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE               DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANI
FOR THE ELAIPEDA ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.        1 submit for your approval the following memnorandum and recomunendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Lithuania for the equivalent of US $7.00 million to help finance a project for the
environment. The loan would be at-the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen
years, including five years of grace.
2.         This proposed project would be financed in association with grant financing by the
Govermnents of Sweden and Finland of a total amount of US $7.00 million equivalent. Additional grant
financing would be provided by other donors for a total amount of US $2.1 million equivalent.
3.        Country/Sector Bakround. Lithuania is the most southerly of the Baltic countries. It covers
an area of 65,200 kr2, with a population of about 3.8 million. During the Soviet period, Lithuania had
a strong economy, based on specialized industries and agriculture, which was fully integrated into the
larger Soviet system. Since the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1991, the country has
undertaken a major program of political and economic reforms, which has brought it from a centrally
planned economy to a transitional market economy. In this process, it has experienced adjustment shocks
comnon to many economies in transition, characterized by a significant decline in economic productivity
and high inflation rates, with the gross domestic product (GDP) declining sharply as a result of the
collapse of trading relations with Russia and other former Soviet Republics.
4.         The Government of Lithuania (GOL) has been pursuing economic reform and stabilization,
including price and trade liberalization. A formal macro-economic program was launched in 1991,
supported by two IMF standby arrangements (in October 1991 and October 1993). Since then, Lithuania
has been successful in containing monetary expansion and fiscal deficits. Lithuania introduced the national
currency, the Litas, in July 1993; it has been tied to the US Dollar since April 1994. Inflation has been
reduced from an annual rate of 1,020 percent in 1992 to an expected rate of 63 percent in 1994, and is
projected to decline firther thereafter. The introduction of a currency board system in April 1994 is
expected to be very effective in ensuring continued macroeconomic stability. The estimated per capita
income level was US $1,305 in 1993. The Bank expects the Lithuanian economy to recover from its
current economnic recession and projects a GDP growth rate of 2 percent in 1994, 6 percent in 1995, 5.5
percent in 1996 and 5 percent per year thereafter.
5.        The Bank's overall strategy in Lithuania is to support the country's efforts to accelerate
structurl reforms leading to a full transition to a market-based economy and, at the same time, to support
efficient investments in high priority sectors to facilitate a return to economic growth. To date the Bank
has provided the GOL with a Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3524-LT) of US $60 rnillion in October 1992,
which is being successfuly implemented, and a Power Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3737-LT) of
US $27 million in May 1994.
6.        Infrastcure rehabilitation and development is considered one of the Bank's priorities in
Lithuania. The recently comnpleted Public Expenditure Review, jointly prepared by the GOL and the
Bank, highlighted the need to support priority investnents in energy, transport and environmental
services, including improved water supply and wastewater treatment. The priority given to investments
for environmental services was justified by the need to improve the quality and reliability of drinking



-2-
water and to address the water quality problems and health risks created by the discharge of partially
treated and untreated wastewater to water courses and the marine environment. The proposed Project
would support the improvement of water and wastewater services in the important port city of Klaipeda
and demonstrate the application of a variety of management methods to support environmentally sound
development around Kursiu Lagoon and in the adjacent coastal area of Lithuania.
7.         The coast of Lithuania is dominated to the south by the Kursiu L-agoon, which receives the
waters of the Nemunas River before discharging theem into the Baltic Sea. Near the center of the coast,
at the- mouth of the lagoon, is the city of Klaipeda (204,000 inhabitants); to the north--the direction of
the prevailing winds and currents--are long sandy beaches extending to the border with Latvia. As
Lithuania's only port, Klaipeda has an important role in the economy of the country, while the Kursiu
Lagoon serves as critical habitat for wildlife and fisheries and the beaches north of Klaipeda provide a
major national and regional recreational and tourist attraction. The sustained use of these areas, however,
as well as the health of the inhabitants and recreational users of these waters, is currently threatened by
adverse effects from the discharge of partially treated and untreated municipal and industrial wastewater
into the Kursiu Lagoon, which are then transported up the Baltic Sea coast.
8.        In response to increasing concern for the environment in and around the Baltic Sea, a
regional program, the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Enviromnental Action Progranmne, was adopted
at a Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of Environment in April 1992. The objective of the Programme
is to restore the ecological balance of the Baltic Sea. In the context of the Helsinki Convention on
Environmental Protection of the Baltic Sea, which Lithuania has signed and ratified, the Progranime has
identified a number of pollution "hot-spots" around the Baltic Sea, including Klaipeda.
9.         There is considerable local concern about the adverse environmental effects of wastewater
discharges from Klaipeda. In addition, the Government of Lithuania (GOL) has committed itself to fulfill
the recommendations of the Helsinki Commission. Consequently, the GOL, together with the
Municipality of Klipeda (MOK), is seeking to enhance the water quality of the Kursiu Lagoon and in
and around Klaipeda in order to imnprove environmental conditions. This implies a number of measures
to improve existing water and wastewater services in Klaipeda and actions for sustainable development
of the adjacent coastal zone, including the Kursiu Lagoon.
10.        ILessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. This would be the first environmental
project supported by the Bank in the country. The Project would reflect previous Bank water and
wastewater sector experience, in particular: (a) the need to develop managerially and financially
autonomous and decentralized water and wastewater utflities and (b) the benefits of taking an integrated
approach to addressing improvements in water and wastewater services. Given previous regional
experience with environmental projects, especially in Poland, project implementation would include the
partizipation of a procurement specialist who would evaluate procurement -issues and conduct training
activities for borrower personnel.
11.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. 'The support of the Bank for the proposed Project would
provide an opportunity to support Lithuanian efforts to improve national enviromnental quality and protect
the Baltic Sea. In the absence of Bank involvement, it is most unlikely that the country would be able to
mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources required to implement an environmental
management project for this environmetally and economically important area of the country. In addition,
the Project would provide a mechanism for the Bank to test the feasibility of the rapid preparation and
implementation of small projects for pnonty investment activities in former Soviet Union states . It would



-3 -
also provide important design lessons for the integration of complementary natural resources management
cowmponents into water and wastewater improvement projects and would serve as a demonstration project
for similar initiatives in other areas in Lithuania and the other Baltic countries. The proposed Project is
consistent with current Bank policy in that it supports .a priority environmental investment action and
facilitates the decentralization process. A Country Strategy Paper for Lithuania was presented to the
Operations Committee in July 1994 and a comprehensive Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is to be
presented to the Board alongside this Project. The CAS provides a full discussion of the Bank's
assistance strategy for Lithuania, of which this Project is an integral component.
12,        Proiect Obiectives. The project's main objectives are: (a) to reduce discharge of partially
treated or untreated wastewater to the Baltic Sea; (b) to restore and enhance the water quality in Klaipeda
-and adjacent recreational beahes; (c) to improve water supply and sanitation services in Klaipeda; (d)
to improve the operational efficiency and management systems of the Klaipeda State Water Supply
Enterprise (KSWSE); and (e) to promote enviromnentally sustainable management and development of
the Kursiu Lagoon and adjacent coastal are.
l3.        Project Description. The project would be implemented over four years as an environmental
management project for the coastal area of Lithuania. It would consist of a Water and Wastewater
Improvement Component (WWIC) and an Environmental Management Component (EMC). The WWIC
would consist of: (a) rehabilitation and expansion of the Klaipeda water and wastewater system, including
equipment and works along with engineering services; and (b) institutional strengthening and training to
assist in establishing an autonomous and financially independent water and wastewater utility in Klaipeda.
This would include assistance for tariff restructuring/tariff planning and financial operations. The EMC
would consist of: (a) technical and financial support for the development and implementation of a
comprehensive management plan for the Kursiu Lagoon and an integrated coastal zone management plan
for the Lithuanian coastline; (b) support for the implementation of selected elements of the management
plan by coordinating and providing funding for identified investments such as access roads, parking lots,
sanitary facilities, information boards, observation towers etc.; and (c) support in the development of
recreational and nature-based tourism in the Kursiu Lagoon region. The Project includes an advance
from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
14.        Proiect Implementation. The Project would be implemented under the general supervision
of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MOEP). A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by
the MOEP, is being established to provide overall guidance for the proposed Project and to facilitate
national and local government coordination. Management of the proposed Project would be the
responsibility of a Project Coordinator who would be appointed by the Minister. The implementation of
the WWIC would be delegated to the KSWSE. To implement this component, a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) would be established within the KSWSE. The EMC would be managed by the Ministry of
Environmental Protection. A diversity of specialists-from the MOEP, local Environmental Protection
Departments, State Tourism Departnent, concerned local govermnents, the World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) and, where appropriate, local and other non-governmental organizations-would undertake
implementation of actions supported under this component. Project implementation would receive frequent
supervision, including support by Bank staff from the Regional Office for the Baltic Countries in Riga
and the local office in Vilnius.
15.        Project Financing. The project cost is estimated at US $23.10 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US $11.96 million equivalent (52 percent excluding taxes and duties).
The Bank would finance US $7.0 million equivalent (29 percent of the foreign exchange and 30 percent



-4-
of the total). Parallel grant cofinancing by the Goveruments of Sweden (US $5.0 million equivalent) and
Finland (US $2.0 million equivalent) and the Europeaa Union (US $600,000 equivalent) comprises about
35% of the WWCI. The EMC would be fully fmanced through grants from a number of donors. A
breakdown of costs and the -financing plan are shown--in Schedule A. An-advance of-US $240,000 from -
the PPF would be used to support establishment of the PIU, prepare bidding documents and conduct a
tariff study. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Lithuania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A nup (No. 26194) is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13430-LT, dated October 24, 1993, is being distributed
separately.
16.       Aareed Actions. Prior to negotiations' the following conditions were fulfilled: (a) the MOK
and the KSWSE had nominated personnel for carrying out the Project; (b) Action Plans, to be included
in the implementation schedule and performance indicators were prepared for both components; and (c)
agreement on competitive bidding for possible future management contracts for the water and wastewater
services of the KSWSE was reached. During negotiations it was agreed that; (i) the KSWSE would adjust
and maintain the water and sewerage tariffs at a level such that enough revenues would be generated to
cover total operating expenses, service the debt and provide for non-cash items, including maintenance
and replacement costs; and (ii) KSWSE shall not enter into any contract or arrangement for the
administration, operation and maintenance of its water and wastewater services without prior approval
of the Bank. Conditions for effectiveness of the proposed loan include: (1) submission of satisfactory
evidence that all conditions precedent to effectiveness of grants from co-financers have been fulfilled; (2)
execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the GOL and the KSWSE; (3) appointnent of staff for
the PIU; and (4) KSWSE shall have entered into a twinning arrangement with a water and wastewater
utility satisfactory to the Bank.
17.        Enviromnental Aspects. Implementation of the proposed Project would have positive
environmental benefits through: (a) reduction of untreated wastewater discharges to the Baltic Sea; (b)
amelioration of water quality in the town of Klaipeda; (c) pollution reduction in Kursiu Lagoon; and (d)
protection of Kursiu Lagoon and Lithuanian coastal areas through effective environmental management.
The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B". An environmental review
consistent with the provisions of the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, "Environental
Assessment" and the applicable environmental procedures of the GOL has been prepared for the WW1C.
Supplemental environmental reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed planning process for
activities supported under the EMC.
18.       ParticiDatorv Approach. The preparation of the water and wastewater component of the
proposed Project has been carried out in close cooperation with the MOEP, the MOK and the KSWSE.
The work of the consultants was supervised by a steering group which included representatives of
Lithuanian authorities, the Swedish and Finnish Minstries of Environment and the Bank. This process
included regular consultation with representatives of the locally elected City Council. The Bank has been
cooperating with the MOEP, local authorities and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in preparation
of terms of reference for activities under the EMC.
19.        Project Benefits. The benefits of the WWIC would include: (a) improvements in water
quality through reduction of leakages of wastewater into the groundwater and reductions in discharges
of untreated and partially treated wastewater, thereby improving the water quality in the northern section
of the Kursiu Lagoon and the beaches north of Klaipeda; (b) reductions in operating costs and



-5 -
maintenance requirements in the water and wastewater systems; and (c) improvement in the quality and
reliability of the services through.establishment of an autonomous water and wastewater utility. The
benefits of the EMC would be: (a) expanded recreational use of Kursiu Lagoon and Baltic beaches
through reducing pollution; (b) upgrading of environmental management of the Kursiu Lagoon and coastal
areas; and (c) expanding the opporhtities for environmentally sound tourism along the coast.
20.        Project Sustainability. Important elements in assuring sustainability of the WWIC include:
(a) timely implementation by KSWSE of the agreed implementatin program, which would promote the
establishment of an autonomous and efficient utility; and (b) development and maintenance of a realistic
tariff structure for municipal and industrial users of the water and wastewater system. The sustainability
of the EMC will be determined by: (a) the level of coordination between the MOEP, the Klaipeda City
Council, cooperating District and Municipal Govermnents, and cooperating non-governmental
organizations; (b) the level of local participation in design and implementation of activities; and (c) the
development of a solid implementation structure for long-term management and development of the
Kursiu Lagoon and the adjacent coastal areas.
21.        Risks. The main risks are: (a) the political commitment of the Klaipeda City Council to
support an independently managed water and wastewater utility; (b) political or macroeconomic factors
which may interfere with the commitment of the Klaipeda City Council to raise tariffs sufficiently to
repay the Bank loan; (c) a longer implementation period due to limited implementation capacity;
(d) continued difficulties in the effective collection of water bills; and (e) possible resistance from local
governments and private landowners to land use controls recommended under coastal zone, protected
areas and tourism management plans. These risks would be reduced by: (a) implementing a time-bound
schedule for corporatization of the KSWSE; (b) carefully monitoring the requirements for tariff increases
and providing significant institutional development support to the utility to improve its financial
management, billing and collection practices; (c) ensuring appropriate project management arrangements
are in place in a timely manner; (d) providing procurement assistance; and (e) incorporation of an active
local participation process in development and implementation of the proposed land use management
systems.
22.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
