REABILiTATION LOAN
Loan and Program Summary
Borrower:      Republic of Latvia.
US$ 45 million equivalent.
Terms:         17 years, including a 5 year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.
Description:    The proposed loan would provide foreign exchange to finance critically-needed
imports and technical assistance in support of Latvia's program of stabilization and
economic reform. The Latvian Government has embarked on a comprehensive
effort to restructure the economy on the basis of market principles, and the initial
stages of the reform program have already been implemented. A policy framework
of systemic and structural reforms has been developed with the assistance of the
Bank in the following areas: enterprise reform (including privatization), pro-
competition and anti-monopoly policies, financial sector reforms and establishment
of a social safety net. The proposed Rehabilitation Loan would support these
reforms in the context of a sound macroeconomic framework for stabilizaticn being
supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement.
Benefits
and Riscs:    'The proposed loan would help to maintain production in the short term in vital
sectors of the Latvian economy, which is initiating a far-reaching transformation.
The imports to be financed by the loan would have direct output and employment
effects and would also ensure a minimum availability of certain essential services
and items. Restoring growth in the longer term would depend on continuing
economic reforms. The technical assistance to be provided would assist the
Government in implementing its economic reform program. Future Bank
adjustment and investment lending are expected to play an important role in helping
to sustain the growth process. Possible risks include a longer than expected
implementation period for importing goods due to an untested implementation
capacity and possible procurement delays and uncertainties and slippage in the
implementation of the economic reform program. To minimize the first risk, close
attention has been paid to the requirements for efficient implementation, including
pre-identification of the goods to be imported, early establishment of the project
implementation unit and provision of procurement support to implementing
agencies. The second risk would be reduced through the provision of technical
assistance to support implementation of the reform program, including assistancc- for
strengthening the social safety net to enhance the program's social and political
acceptability. The technical assistance would be intensively supervised to better
ensure implementation of the economic reforms in a timely manner.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESEDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELDPMENT
TO THE EX             DECTORS
ON A PROPOSED REHABILITATION LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF IATVIA
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
rehabilitation loan to the Republic of Latvia for the equivalent of US$45 million to help finance
critically-needed imports and technical assistance in support of a program of macroeconomic
stabilization and systemic and structural reforms. The loan would be at the IBRD's (the Bank)
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace. L/ Co-
financing on a parallel basis is being provided by the Export-Import Bank of Japan in art amount to be
determined out of a total amount of US$100 million equivalent for all three Baltic countries.
Assistance valued at about US$0.25 million is being provided on a bilateral basis by the Government
of Sweden for implementation-related technical assistance.
2.           Latvia joined the IBRD and IDA on A m-ust 11, 1992. An economic mission visited
Latvia in February 1992, and a report on the current economic situation will be distributed to the
Board shortly.
I. THE ECONOMY
A. Background
3.           Latvis is situated on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and is bounded by Estonia
from the north, Lithuania from the south, Russia and Belarus from the east. It has a 500 kilometer
coastline, with ice-free seaports at Ventspils, Liepaja and Riga, the capital. A little less than half its
area of about 65,000 square kilometers is arable. Woodlands cover about 40% of the territory and are
an important source of timber. Other thar some peat deposits, the country is poor in natural
resources. Industry accounts for nearly 50% of GDP and 30% of employment. Agriculture accounts
for 18% of GDP and 16% of employment.
4.           Latvia's population is about 2.7 million, with approximately one-third living in Riga.
The composition of the population changed significantly during the post-World War II years.
Whereas over three-fourths were of Latvian origin before that war, by 1990 this ratio dropped to just
over one half, mainly because of an increase in immigration encouraged by the former Soviet Union
(FSU) from the nearby regions of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The population size is stable, with a
growth rate of only 0.1%. Over 55% of the population is active in the labor force.
5.           During World War I, Latvia served as a battleground between the Germans and the
Russians. In 1920, a peace treaty was signed with the Soviet Union and Latvia's independence was
recognized. In 1940, the Soviet army invaded Latvia, and in August of that year Latvia was
incorporated into the Soviet Union. By the early 1950s, its economy was fully integrated into the
Soviet centrally-planned system.
t/    Latvia is treated as a lower middle-income county for IBRD borrowing on the basis of a combination of the current
GNP per capita estimat, for 1991 (about US$3400) and the expected steep dcline (by at loast 25%, as discussed in
pam. 10 of this report) in 1992. GNP estmates for eoonomies of the forner Soviet Union are subject to more than
the u   range of unowettiy, should be regarded as very preliminary and are subject to revision.

6.           Rapid industrialization occurred during the period following World War II as a result
of an aggressive capital formation strategy and forced labor movements from agriculture to industry
and from other parts of the Soviet Union into Latvia. The republic's comparatively wellsAe {eloped
infrastructure and skilled work force motivated Soviet central planners to establish relatively
sophisticated industries in the republic, including machine-building, chemicals, electronics, wood,
paper, food and light industries. The agriculture sector was relatively well-developed, and Latvia
became an exporter of mea, dairy and fish products to the other republics of the Soviet Union.
7.           As occurred elsewhere in the FSU, real economic growth steadily declined over the
years. The technologies employed in civil industries became increasingly obsolete and the
environment suffered. The shortcomings of the central planning mcdel became more visible during
the 1980s. Between 1981 and 1989, real GDP growth rates averaged a relatively modest 3.9%
despite high investment levels-an indication of the low efficiency of production.
8.           The gradual abandonment of central planning by the Soviet authorities in the second
half of the 1980s did not reverse this economic decline. Instead, the increasing economic and
political turmoil aggravated macroeconomic imbalances and led the entire Soviet economy into crisis.
At the same time, Latvia's drive toward political and economic independence accelerated and
international recognition of this country's renewed independence was achieved in September 1991,
allowing Latvia to take fuller control of its national economic policies.
B. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
External Trade and OutWt
9.           Latvia's economy has been highly integrated with that of the FSU. Prior to
independence, trade with the FSU constituted over 90% of total trade: Latvia imported mainly raw
materials, oil products and gas and exported mainly finished goods and food products. Following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of the centralized trade regime, imported inputs
and raw materials, particularly oil products, from the FSU dropped sharply from 46.8% of GDP in
1990 to 27.5% in 1991. This led to an accelerating decline in GDP, from -3.5% in 1990 to -8% in
1991. This decline was across all sectors except industry. Although information on industrial value
added is not available for 1991, industrial production remained essentially unchanged from its 1990
level, partly because enterprises were able to utilize stocks of raw materials and partly because
increased production by private enterprises and cooperatives offset the decline in output by state
enterprises. This has tended to moderate the overall decline of production in 1991, which would have
been even larger otherwise.
10.          As the stock of raw materials became depleted, however, industrial production
declined by about 30% in the first half of 1992 compared with the first half of 1991. This decline is
expected to continue during the remaining part of the year and to lead to an overall drop in GDP of at
least 25% for 1992. The continued shortage of raw materials, energy supplies and hard currency are
the main factors contributing to this decline. In addition, and due to a severe summer drought this
year, the Latvian authorities expect that agriculture production may not reach more than half of the
level expected at the beginning of the year, thus further exacerbating the drop in overall output for
1992. A main objective of the proposed Rehabilitation Loan is to help mitigate continued production
declines in 1993.

Prices and the Terms of Thzde
11.         FLatvia abandoned the Soviet pricing system and started its comprehensive price reform
program in 1991, about one year before similar reforms were undertaken in most parts of the then
ruble zone, except for Estonia and Lithuania. The main objective of price reform was to move
toward establishing a marl-.et economy. By early 1992, fewer than 8% of goods and services in the
consumer price index remained subject to price controls (mainly some evergy products and a few
municipal services). Although relative prices have started to adjust, including administrative price
increases for items still subject to controls, it will take some time before full adjustment is achieved.
When that happens, energy prices are expected to adjust more than other prices as they move toward
international levels.
12.          Price reform had several important but temporary effects in 1991. For one, it
contributed to an improvement in the financial position of enterprises that were permitted to adjust
their output prices substantially while still buying imported inputs at relatively low prices. This in
turn increased tax revenues which contributed to the fiscal surplus (para. 16). Secondly, it resulted in
a significant improvement in Latvia's terms of trade, which in turn resulted in a shift of the trade
balance from a deficit of 6.8% of GDP in 1990 to a surplus of 3.4% in 1991. Thirdly, it reduced
budgetary subsidies from 11.6% of GDP in 1989 to 4.3% in 1991. However, the gains were only
temporary since subsequent price liberalization in Russia and other parts of the FSU started reversing
Latvia's terms of trade gains, particularly as Russia began increasing its energy nrices. The resulting
pressure on the financial performance of enterprises is already being felt and is expected to be
transmitted to the budget through lower tax revenue receipts and higher unemployment benefits as
failing enterprises start shedding labor.
13.          Price reform, coupled with rising import prices and the drop in production, also led to
a dramatic acceleration of inflation. Prices increased by 10% in 1990, 172% in 1991 and by an
average of 48% a month in the first quarter of 1992 before dropping to an average of 13% a month
in the second quarter.
Employment awd Wages
14.          Despite the fall in output, overall unemployment did not rise until late-1991.
Enterprises were able to maintain the overall level of employment during 1991 at the previous year's
level because of the temporary gains from the improved terms of trade. Increases in private sector
and cooperative sector activities provided some relief as well. Unemployment has started to increase
more significantly in 1992.
15.          Wages were not fully liberalized, and both the minimum wage and state sector wages
remair.ed under control. However, nominal wages were adjusted frequently. In May 1991, the
Goverr nent adopted a partial wage indexation policy. As a result, real wages decreased in 1991 and
in the beginning of 1992. However, as price increases moderated while nominal wages continued to
rise, real wages started to increase in the second quarter of the year.



Fiscal, Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policies
16.          The decrease in budgetary subsidies brought about by price reform, the discontinued
transfers to the Soviet budget together with a cautious stance by the Government on other expenditure
categories led to a budgetary surplus on the order of 8% of GDP in 1991. In 1992, however, a
budget deficit of about 2-3% of GDP is expected mainly due to the negative impact of falling
enterprise profits on tax revenues, wage increases at the beginning of the year and the expected
increase in social benefits expenditures.
17.          Monetary developments in 1991 were characterized by large increases in broad money
and credit. Real interest rates became largely negative and the banking system, which did not face
any restrictio.s on lending, substantially increased credit to enteiprises. The monetary situation has
become tighter in 1992. A serious problem in 1991 and the first quarter of 1992 was the severe
shortage of cash rubles. Although Latvia remained in the ruble zone, .t did not receive regular
deliveries of ruble bank notes from the Russian central bank. This led the authorities to supplement
the ruble by issuing an interim currency, the Latvian ruble, in early May 1992 and prepare plans to
introduce a mcre permanent national currency, the Lat. However, the Government has accelerated its
plans for the introduction of the new currency and starting July 20, 1992, nas made the Latvian ruble
the only legal tender, until the Lat is printed and put into circulation later in i992.
18.          Initially, the Latvian ruble was pegged to the ruble at a one-to-one ratio, but since
July 20, 1992, it has been allowed to float and its rate has fluctuated at par or sightly stronger than
the ruble. This was very much in line with Latvia's policy over the previous year or so, whereby no
restrictions were imposed on foreign exchange transactions. As a result of this open policy, a very
sizable foreign exchange market has developed and attracted traders and businessmen from other parts
of the FSU, particularly private entrepreneurs who enjoyed relatively free access to foreign exchange
to finance imports.
Enterprise Reform
19.          Reforming the public enterprise sector in Latvia is of high priority given its poor
performance as reflected in the high levels of inter-enterprise arrears, the depleted capital stock, the
lack of international competitiveness and the substantial levels of redundant workers. The
Govemment has singled out specific areas of enterprise reform deserving particular attention,
including: (i) inter-enterprise arrears, (ii) state-owned enterprise (SOE) management, (iii)
privatization, (iv) restitution, (v) demonopolization and (vi) private sector development through the
entry of new firms. Progress in these areas has been mixed.
20.           Inter-Enerprise Arrears. Input shortages resulting from the collapse of FSU trading
arrangements and the high cost of non-FSU imports, together with falling internal and external
demand, have produced substantial losses for Latvian enterprises since early 1992. When combined
with failures of the FSU payments system, these factors have contributed to a significant build-up of
inter-enterprise arrears. Many firms appear to be reaching the limit of the arrears that they are
willing to absorb from other firms in order to stay in business. As a result, Latvian enterprises are
turning increasingly to prepayment schemes and other temporary arrangements to stem the flow of
arrears.



-6-
21.          SOE Management. Some steps have already been taken to install a commercial
orientation in existing state-owned enterprises, including: (i) the elimination of state-orders (except
those needed to fulfill interstate agreements), (ii) the general removal of privileges to enterprises
which are suppliers to the state, (iii) the elimination oi budgetary support to enterprises. incl'  g
implicit subsidies from all levels of CGovernment coupled with the enactment of bankruptcy legislation
(December 1991), and (iv) the elimination of guarantees on loans to enterprises. The Government has
acknowledged the need to deepen these measures and intends to review proposals for further measures
in the coming months.
22.          PlWvazalion. In November 1991, a law on privatization of small enterprises was
passed, and municipalities were instructed to privatize businesses in trade, services and catering under
their jurisdiction. In conjunction with this program, small state-owned enterprises were converted to
municipal ownership. The program started slowly in early 1992, but has since gained momentum.
In addition, in early 1992, Parliament passed legislation to increase the scope of the small
privatization program by eliminating the size restriction on entities that can be sold. Progress on
other aspects of privatization continues to be slow mainly resulting from the lack of clear policies on
citizenship and restitution of property to previous owners.
23.          In March 1992, Parliament adopted a resolution providing an overall framework for
the privatization program and stating its commitment to proceed with the privatization of large
enterprises as quickly as possible. However, a major effort will be needed in the coming months to
achieve a consensus on the various proposals, finalize legislation and establish institutional
arrangements for implementing privatization of medium and large enterprises. Efforts should also be
made to address the arrears problem, as well as the requirements for improved management, and in
many cases the improvements needed in technology and capital equipment of the enterprises. The
Gvovernment's enterprise reform and privatization program is still at an early stage and will require
the design of an overall strategy and implementation of pilot efforts supported by technical assistance.
It will also need to be closely linked to financial sector reform and to changes in the social security
system.
24.          Reslidon. The need to identify those who owned property that was nationalized
during the Soviet period has slov_d privatization and enterprise restructuring efforts. The
Governme-:t has promised to restore such property to the former owners or their descendants, or to
pay compensation in cash, vouchers or comparable property when the property itself cannot be
restituted. Three separate restitution programs for housing, enterprises and land are currently
underway. Progress is varied in these areas as claims' deadlines difeer and compensation rules have
not been finalized. The Government intends to move ahead with privatization by reserving shares of
enterprises for claims by former owners and privatizing the rest. In instances where claims by the
former owners have not been received by the time of privatization, cash or alternative compensation
will be permitted. These mechanisms are intended to ensure that potential restitution claims will not
be allowed to further slow the privatization process.
25.          Demonopolzaion. Many enterprises in Latvia are vertically and horizontally
integrated. Large industrial "combinats" exist even where there is no justification based on economr
of scale requirements. In addition to fostering monopolistic tendencies and anti-competitive behavior
in selling goods, these entities tend to purchase inputs from other members of the combinat, thus
discouraging the development of competitive independent suppliers. The Gove,nment intends to



break up these enterprises to facilitate the competitive practices typical of market economies. Large
industrial combinats will be broken up into financially autonomous entities which could purchase
inputs and sell products outside their former organization. Following enactment of an Anti-Monopoly
Law in December 1991, a demonopolization office within the Ministry of Economic Reform (MER)
was established and assigned responsibilities for enterprise break-up.
26.          Private Sedor Development. The promotion of new private ventures has been an
important objective of Latvia's structural reform program. The Government has taken steps to clarify
the rules and regulations concerning commercial and financial transactions, entry and exit activities,
unfair practices, the establishment of joint ventures and promotion of private sector activities. At the
beginning of 1992, nearly 7,000 newly registered firms were operating in trade and other services.
Free access to and availability of foreign exchange contributed to increased activities in these business
areas. New business establishment is also being enhanced by the privatization of enterprises in trade,
catering and services as described previously. Relatively large advances in ownership change have
also been realized in the agricultural sector by breaking up collective and state farms, transforming
them into shareholding companies and distributing shares to employees. In parallel, an extensive
program of homesteading - initially with users' rights and as of January 1993 with ownership rights -
has been underway since 1990 and will complement the restitution program. By January 1992,
applications had been received to establish private farms covering 38% of available land.
Financial Sector Reforn
27.          The Bank of Latvia (the central bank) took over most of the former state banks and
their commercial activities in September 1991. Subsequently, it transformed these banks into a
number of commercial branches. The financial situation of many of these branches remains very
weak, and most of them hold portfolios of uncertain quality. Perhaps one of the more serious
problems in the financial sector relates to the Savings Bank. This bank, that holds more than 95% of
all household deposits in Latvia, is technically insolvent and probably illiquid. At the end 1991, its
claims on the now defunct Soviet Savings Bank were nearly 5 billion rubles, on which it has not been
receiving interest payments. The status of these deposits remains uncertain.
28.          The Government has recognized that a complete restructuring of the banking system is
needed to establish an independent central bank and to put the commercial banking system on a sound
footing. Parliament has recently approved two pieces of legislation to establish a two-tier banking
system, which is essential for proper implementation of the stabilization and reform program. A
transition period of six months is envisaged to fully separate the commercial banking activities of the
Bank of Latvia. Further work will be required to develop prudential regulations for banking
supervision and accounting, auditing and payments systems.
Soil Protecdon and Social Sfety Net
29.          To cushion the cost of adjustment to the most vulnerable social groups, the
Government recently began to change the structure of thc :ocial security system, which had been
integrated into the social programs of the FSU. A number of reforms were introduced in the areas of
targeting unemployment benefits and providing family assistance to the poor. Further reforms are
required to streamline the cash benefit system, strengthen employment offices and adopt a financially
sustainable pension system.



- 8 -
30.          The social security operations are independently funded by employers and employees
whose contributions amount to 37% and 1% of wage payments, respectively. Beginning in January
1992, the social security budget has also covered unemployment benefits, which have been funded by
an allocation of 1.5% of the social security contribution rate.
H. DEVELOPNIENT PROSPECTS AND UNCERTAINTIES
A. Prospects for Stabilization and Structural Reform
31.          Ltvia is now at a critical stage in its transformation to a market economy. The
reforms aiready initiated are anly a beginning, and the restructuring tasks ahead are enormous.
Prospects for transformation of the economy hinges on the simultaneous adoption of the following
measures: (a) appropriate demand management policies to ensure stability and confidence in the new
currency; (b) reorientation of international trade toward international markets, with the objective of
obtaining the bulk of medium and long-term financial needs through convertible currency exports; and
(c) fundamental restructuring of the economy including reform of the enterprise sector, development
of a competitive environment for business activities, restructuring of the financial sector and
rationalization of the social safety net system.
32.          The Government's reform program, which this loan supports and whose elements are
presented in Part IV, addresses these areas. Success will depend on political support, effective
imnlementation and timely provision of external financial assistance. The large scope of the reform
program makes future economic development and performance uncertain, and a number of alternative
scenarios have been developed regarding the evolution of Latvia's economic growth and external trade
and financing. Although economic difficulties are expected to continue in the short term and the
reform program will likely face social and political constraints, improvement in Latvia's overall
economic situation in the next few years appears possible, provided Latvia sustains the
implementation of the stabilization and structural adjustment program, supported by this loan and the
IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). Such a "sustaied reform scenario" could have the following
features:
*     The downturn in output that began in 1990 and continued in 1991 would accelerate in
1992, with a cumulative loss of output of around 35% over 1991 and 1992. This
decline in output and the deteriorating terms of trade together with the curtailment of
financial support to enterprises would force inefficient enterprises to be liquidated or
restructured. This would lead to significant increases in unemployment, probably
rising as high as 5-6% of the labor force within about a year.
*     Restrictive monetary and fiscal policies and a tighter incomes policy would contain
demand and sharply bring down inflation. This would start generating some
confidence in economic management and the new currency. The improved economic
situation, combined with essentially free price and trade regimes, would help set the
stage for a gradual recovery.



-9 -
*     Assuming that entry of new private ventures continues and rigorous privatization
begins to take off, the economic slowdown would begin to decelerate in 1993 and the
economy would start growing gradually. Sustained growth in the mid- and late-1990s
would depend on the recovery of selective investments in key sectors such as
agriculture, industry, energy, transport and telecommunications, which could begin as
soon as the macroeconomic situation improves.
*     Financing of investment would initially have to rely to a considerable extent on
external sources, but would in the medium to long term be met by increased domestic
resource mobilization and larger export receipts. Reorienting a larger share of
exports toward convertible currency areas will take time for a number of reasons: the
strong production links to the republics of the FSU, the large investments that would
be needed to expand or upgtade some export industries and the uncompetitive quality
of Latvian products at present. In the latter half of the 1990s, however, exports
would contribute more significantly than presently to the foreign exchange that is
needed to finance Latvia's import requirements.
33.          The Government has undertaken major policy initiatives in the direction of the above
objectives. However, much remains to be done to carry out the necessary policy measures and ensure
success of this scenario. Most enterprises will find it difficult to continue operations and maintain
employment in the face of the discontinuation of subsidies and transfers form the Government budget.
Many of them are in arrears, are seriously decapitalized and may have to close down completely or
engage in massive lay-offs to become profitable. Unemployment, therefore, could reach 12-14% of
the labor force by end-1994. This would lead to a substantial fiscal burden brought about by higher
unemployment benefits and other related expenditures. With a weak tax base and a poor tax
aministration, the Government may find it difficult to finance the additional expenditures for social
protection without jeopardizing the fiscal, monetary and inflation objectives of the current stabilization
program.
B. External Trade and Balance of Payments Prospects
34.          Latvian trade is heavily influenced by energy imports which account for about a
quarter of total imports. The country has to import all of its natural gas and oil products and about
half of its electricity needs. Gas and oil products have traditionally been supplied by Russia.
However, with the disruption of trade between the two countries and as the prices of these
commodities started to increase toward international levels, oil and gas imports from Russia have
dropped significantly. Supplies of oil products from alternative sources have increased; this has been
possible because the port of Ventspils is equipped to handle part of such imports. Still, based on
trade agreement with Russia and the actual delivery of oil products in the first half of 1992 (which
shows a drop of 40%), energy imports in 1992 are expected to be only about two-thirds their 1991
level, and Russia could be expected to remain a major supplier of gas and oil products for some time.
Nevertheless, these developments represent a significant shift in the geographical structure of Latvia's
energy imports. Among other factors, this shift partially explains why Latvia's trade deficit in 1992
and 1993 is expected to be primarily with the non-FSU countries (Table 2). Another factor
contributing to the trade deficit is the expected drop in non-energy imports from the FSU by as much
as 30% in 1992, based on actual data for the first half of the year. This reduction is most likely due
to: the general sharp production declines in the FSU republics, attempts by those republics to limit



- 10-
exports and avoid internal shortages, deficiencies in payments mechanisms and the terms of trade
shock.
35.          Exports to the FSU are not expected to decline as much as imports from the FSU in
1992. Exports are comprised primarily of food, machinery and industrial products. The actual trade
volumes in the first part of 1992 show that, in contrast to the sharp fall in imports from Russia, there
has been only a moderate decline in exports of food items to Russia. The overall decline in Latvia's
FSU exports is projected at about 20% in 1992, much less than the expected decline in imports. This
probably reflects the asymmetric trade relations between Russia and Latvia: Latvian exports do not
have ready alternatives to Russian markets while the opposite is not true. Exports to non-FSU
countries are assumed to show a moderate increase in their share in total exports in 1992.
36.          Projections for 1993 assume a gradual resumption of trade relations with the FSU.
Such a situation appears plausible in view of the expected reduction in Government involvement in
interstate trade and the possibility of the revival of enterprise-to-enterprise trade, given the long-
established trade links between enterprises in Latvia and the FSU. Energy imports would be expected
to stabilize in volume terms, non-energy imports would be expected to grow, and energy import
prices would rise close to world market levels. The improved availability of imported inputs would
also permit a rise in export volumes. Because of the low volume of trade in 1992, both imports and
exports could show a substantial growth in 1993. After this initial increase, exports and imports
would grow more moderately and would be in line with the growth prospects of the economy. Non-
FSU exports are projected to grow on average by about 12% a year and imports by 10% a year
between 1993-97. Some trade diversification is expected in the non-energy sectors in line with
reorientation of trade with the convertible currency areas. As Latvia's trade with convertible
currency areas grows, trade with the FSU would stabilize at a much lower level than in the past, and
stay around 55% of total exports by the late 1990s.
37.          Expanding Latvia's trade with the convertible currency area remains one of the most
important medium-term challenges for the growth of the economy. Latvia needs to build up a level
of convertible exports that will, after a transition period of say three to four years, begin to pay for
most of the convertible imports. The success in achieving this objective depends on the ongoing
structural reforms and on removing some remaining constraints on exports (e.g., export quotas,
export taxes).
38.          Latvia's wood industry is already competitive in world markets. Other products such
as textiles, light machinery, building materials and fisheries may also be competitive in non-FSU
markets, given the currently depreciated exchange rate of the Latvian ruble against the US dollar.
However, reorientation of exports toward convertible currency areas will take some time for a
number of reasons, including the low quality of products, large investment needs to upgrade and
expand export industries, and the lack of marketing know-how and export finance. Transport services
and tourism also have good potential to earn hard currency for Latvia.
39.          The outlook for Latvia's trade indicates a negative balance over the 1992-93 period
(Table 2). The trade deficit is projected to amount to US$170 million in 1992 and US$280 million in
1993. While merchandise trade is estimated to show a deficit, net service income is likely to be
positive, due mainly to foreign exchange receipts on maritime and shipping services, port service fees
for exports of Russia's crude oil, and a low initial stock of debt on which interest is owed. The



- 11 -
overall current account deficit could, therefore, amount to about US$90 million in 1992 and US$240
million in 1993. As highlighted above, the bulk of this deficit is expected to be with non-FSU areas.
Although accurate information on payments and arrears between Latvia and the rest of the FSU is not
available, the Latvian Government reports that, during the first half of 1992, arrears owed by Russian
enterprises to Latvian enterprises exceeded arrears in the opposite direction.
40.          These projections, however, are tentative and subject to large margins of error, given
the uncertaies regarding the impact of currency reform on trade and payments relationships and the
speed with which Latvia can normalize its trade relations with the FSU and expand its exports to
convertible currency markets. Quantifying the balance of payments is itself complicated by data
problems; statistical systems are still weak and are undergoing a transition from the Soviet system to
Western and worldwide standards. The data problems are exacerbated by rapid inflation, which
makes conversion of ruble data into US dollars rather speculative.

C. Major Uncertainties
41.          As mentioned before, the simultaneous implementation of stabilization and structural
reform measures is probably the best vehicle for the economy to recover and ultimately achieve
sustainable growth. However, the process will not be easy, as major uncertainties exist in
implementation capacity, implementation of policies due to socio-political pressures, availability of
external financing and developments in the external environment.
hnplmetain Capacy
42.          Despite highly skilled and motivated manpower, mainly in technical fields, Latvia
lacks the specific skills needed for the transformation to a market economy, and this problem is likely
to hinder the pace of implementation of the reform. A major challenge facing the authorities is how
to develop implementation and institutional capabilities within the Government, particularly in the line
ministries, in a relatively short time. Priority areas which require strengthening include: the
management of public expenditures; the general ability of the legal system to implement laws and
supervise their enforcement; the quality of statistical information and economic projections; and the
adoption of international standards and practices in accounting, auditing and procurement. The Bank
has made special efforts in the context of this loan to ensure that a subsantial program of consultancy
and advisory assistance is undertaken in key areas of reform and to strengthen institutional and related
implementation capacities (Annex 5). The IMF, other multilateral institutions and bilateral donors are
also providing a wide range of technical assistance. The Bank has coordinated its work in these areas
with the major donors active in Latvia and is working to strengthen such coordination further in the
months ahead.
Polcal and Poliqy Slpage
43.          The reform program may be negatively affected by possible policy slippage in areas
of socio-political sensitivity, such as the introduction of an incomes policy designed to lower real
wages and the imposition of strict financial discipline on enterprises which is likely to lead to much
higher levels of unemployment than at present. Citizenship is also a sensitive issue which has
affected progress in the areas of restitution, ownership and privatization. The combination of these
factors may lead to significant policy backsliding that would make the transition more difficult and
evenually more costly.
Resowce AvaiYability
44.          Another uncertinty facing the reform effort is whether Latvia would be able to obtain
the type of international financial support it requires. In large part, due to the Government's
announced program of policy reform, which has the support of the Bank and the IMF, the country
enjoys broad support in the donor community, and prospects for obtaining the financing requirements
appear reasonably good.
Extenal Enviromxent
45.          Latvia also faces challenges resulting from its external economic environment. The
pace of political and economic stabilization within the FSU will be of prime importance to



- 14-
normalizing Latvia's trade with the FSU and thus its overall economic recovery. Political and
economic stability within the FSU will have impacts on the financial viability of many of Latvia's
enterprises and the degree to which it earns hard currency from non-FSU exports that could be used
to cover trade deficits with the FSU. While some import and export diversificiation will be possible
in the medium term, experience in other reforming economies indicates that this will inevitably be a
long-tt.. m process. Thus, Latvia will continue to depend on critical inputs from the FSU as well as
FSU markets for its exports for some time. The present continuing political tensions and economic
contraction in many republics of the FSU suggest that the risk of a slow pace of normalization of
trade with the FSU is fairly significant.
m. EXTERNAL FINANCING AND CREDITWORTHINESS
A. Financing Requirements
46.          During 1992-93, Latvia requires substantial external resources to cover its current
account deficit, build up adequate reserves to support the new currency and cover modest trade
fluctuations, and to service the emerging external debt. Total gross financing requirements are
estimated at about US$435 million for the two-year period 1992 and 1993 (Table 3). Of this amount,
US$310 million would be needed to finance the non-interest current account deficit, about one third of
which is due to trade with the FSU.2/ Approximately US$100 million would be required for
reserve build-up, and about US$25 million for debt service payments which are expected to remain
small during the period.
47.          With implementation of the reform program and adjustment of the economy to the
strong 1992 terms of trade shock, Latvia's current account deficit and the resulting financing
requirements are expected to decline significantly in the mid-1990s, while remaining large through
1994 and probably 1995. Some of the financing requirements through the mid-1990s may still be
needed to cover trade deficits with Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
2/    This is m conkast to the expeowd situation in Lithunia, for example, where the largest part (about two-thirds) of the
Currnt acount deficit is due to trade with the PSU.

B. Possible Sources of Financing
48.          Prvate Sources. Private flows are not expected to be significant in the short term,
but are likely to become more important in the medium term. The possible sources of financing for
1992-93 are as follows:
49.          CommerIl Credt.  Private foreign borrowing required to close the financing gap
is expected to be negligible over the 1992-93 period, given Latvia's lack of credit history in



- 16 -
international financial markets. So far, most commercial lending to Latvia has been in short-term
trade credits, and the outstanding amounts have not been increasing.
50.          Direct Foreign Inves*tent. Direct foreign investment has already commenced in
Latvia, particularly by Nordic investors. Investments are being made by foreign enterprises in the
hotel, fish processing, furniture and wood industries. However, the impact of such inflows on the
balance of payments will not be significant during 1992-93 since investments will generally be
implemented over a longer time period.
51.          Ofi     Soumrs. Official flows in the form of grants or loans from multilateral and
bilateral sources will be an essential part of the financing plan in the short term. Estimates of the
types and sources of funds that may be available to Latvia from official sources over the next two
years are summarized below.
52.          MultUateral btstUtions. Commitments from multilateral institutions are estimated at
about US$195 million in 1992 and 1993. Of this amount, about 45% will be provided by the IMF
largely as reserves financing, about 25% by the Bank through disbursements of this Rehabilitation
Loan and the rest could be provided by the EBRD and NIB.
53.          Biateral Sources. Financial support from bilateral sources is essential for the success
of the Government's reform program. Without such funding, the reduction of imports will be even
more severe, which would lead to an even more serious fall in output and consumption. It is
therefore assumed that the balance of financing requirements would be provided by bilateral sources
with a substantial grant element. US$190-200 million in disbursements would be needed for 1992
and 1993 from bilateral donors. Efforts are underway under the auspices of the G-24 to secure such
financing.
54.          Expoul Credit Agences. Export credit agencies (ECAs) are expected to become a
significant source of financing over the next several years. Trade credit facilities have been or are
being established by Denmark, Canada and Germany. In the current distorted and uncertain
environment, export credit agencies will need to pay particular attention to the financial and economic
viability of projects proposed for financing under export credits. Significant opportunities for co-
financing projects with multilateral institutions will be present, and the involvement of these
institutions could help to provide additional assurances of the economic merit of such investments.
55.           Most ECAs, as well as private commercial creditors, are expected to provide medium
and long-term credit provided the country has accumulated an adequate level of foreign exchange
reserves and has established a track record of success in implementing structural reform programs.
Therefore, commitment of the Government to implementing the current reform program, supported
by the Rehabilitation Loan, is essential for attracting a considerable share of the financing needs from
these sources.
56.          Techn*c  Asstnce. In addition to the resources required to fill the balance of
payments gap, substantial resources are needed to help finance Latvia's technical assistance



17 -
requirements. Major potential sources of funds include the Nordic countries and the EC's PHARE
program.
57.          Aid coordination will play a vital role in assuring the success of the sustained reform
scenario. Although a combination of budgetary constraints in donor countries and problems in
implementing the reform program could raise difficulties, there is reason to believe that the necessary
resources can be mobilized. The Bank and the IMF have worked closely to identify possible sources
of financing from private and official donors. This has included contacting representatives of
potential donor countries, participating within the G-24 framework for the coordination of assistance
to the Baltic countries and participating in the coordination of technical assistance.
C. Matching Financing Reuirements
Matching By Source
58.          The need to match financing sources with trade and balance of payments requirements
underscores the need for a well managed, foreign aid coordination process for Latvia during the next
few years. Foreign exchange provided by official sources is usually tied to imports from a particular
country, a specific investment project or technical assistance. Likewise, private financing is usually
tied to a specific project or product.
59.          While about one-third of Latvia's gross financing requirements for 1992 and 1993
arises from trade deficits with the FSU, particularly Russia, virtualy all external assistance is from
convertible currency sources outside the FSU. A significant portion of these funds, especially those
from official sources, may be tied. To the extent that they cannot be used to finance FSU imports
and the associated trade deficits, the hard currency export earnings will have to be the primary source
of financing these deficits. It is important to note, however, that this matching does not seem to be as
serious a problem for Latvia as it is for Lithuania, for example, since Latvia's hard currency export
earnings are expected to more than cover the trade deficit with the FSU in the next two years, as
discussed below.
60.          In 1992-93, non-FSU exports are projected to total about UJS$920 million, and another
US$120 million is expected from net service exports and private trans*es,s bringing the amount of
available foreign exchange to about US$1,040 million (Table 2).J/ For the same period, the total
trade deficit with FSU is estimated at only US$100 million. Therefore, the total hard currency export
earnings for these two yars is expected to be more than enough to cover the trade deficits with the
FSU. This should leave some US$940 million to finance part of the non-FSU imports of US$1,270
million for those two years. Thus, US$330 million of the non-FSU imports will have to be financed
through the capital account in the form of flows from both multilateral and bilateral sources. It
should be noted, however, that the amount of foreign exchange needed to finance the FSU trade
I/    Serves and priate tsers are teed on a net basis m the absence of more deailed infomaion regardng their
composi. Thus, gross fo1cegn exchae from expolts of goods and servieos plus private tansfers might be
somewhat hi.



- 18 -
deficit could become larger, if following the resumption of trade relations with the FSU, Latvia
imports all its energy needs from that market in 1993. In that case, the total trade deficit with the
FSU in 1992-93 could increase to US$210 million (instead of US$100 million).
Matching By Type
61.          In the short term, Latvia's most pressing foreign exchange needs are for balance of
payments support to permit it to obtain critical imports and stabilize the economy. If this form of
financing can be obtained, Latvia would gain flexibility in managing its foreign exchange flows. The
proposed Rehabilitation Loan, which will finance essential imports for high priority sectors of the
economy, is designed to provide the Government such flexibility by permitting the reallocation of the
loan proceeds among priority sectors.
62.          Well designed project support will also be needed, particularly in the areas of bank
and enterprise restructuring which could be of significant importance in stimulating a supply response
in the short term. Project financing from private foreign sources, especially through direct foreign
investmenit, will be desirable to supplement the project support expected from multilateral sources.
Within the next year or two, it is expected that the Government will launch a carefully targeted public
investment program that addresses the serious underinvestment in public services during recent years.
63.          Although Latvia's external debt is still small as explained in Section D below, it will
be important for the Government to adopt an appropriate external debt strategy to prevent an
excessive debt service burden in the future. In the short term, grants and loans from official sources
should play a major role in meeting the external financing requirements, given the time which will be
required to develop Latvia's capacity to earn foreign exchange from convertible currency markets.
The prospects for obtaining such financing are enhanced by: (i) the sympathy of donors for the need
to maintain imports to avoid further economic compression and the consequent risk of serious social
and political problems, (ii) the steps to assure short-term stabilization, as evidenced by the recent
agreement on a Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF, and (iii) a solid economic reform program
which has the support of inter!- itional financial institutions.
64.          Latvia will also need a substantial amount of technical assistance in the short term,
and donor support for such assistance is being sought actively. However, technical assistance funds
normally make little contribution to the balance of payments. Technical assistance funds have
therefore not been included in the balance of payments in Table 2, and related financing requirements
would be in addition to those shown in Table 3.
D. Debt and Debt Management
65.          As a republic within the FSU, Latvia was allocated responsibility for over US$1
billion of the external debt of the FSU. However, in mid-March 1992, the chairmen of the Supreme
Councils of the three Baltic states issued an official declaration that their countries are not legal
successors to the FSU and therefore cannot take responsibility for servicing and paying off its external
debt.



- 19 -
66.          Since regaining independence in September 1991, Latvia has undertaken only
negligible new debt obligations. However, the Government and state enterprises will soon have
access to foreign credit, starting w:th loans from multilateral institutions and the establishment of
short-term credit lines with export credit agencies. The Government has set up a new unit in the
Ministry of Finance in charge of monitoring and reporting external debt and new borrowing.
E. Creditworthiness
67.          Under the sustained reform scenario, Latvia's debt service would stay within a
prudent level of 5% of non-FSU exports in 1993. Having only recently regained independence and
with no credit record, Latvia will need to establish full ireditworthiness in the international financial
markets. The projections shown in Tables 2 and 3 imply current account deficits of about 7% of
GDP in 1992 and 12% of GDP in 1993. Over the longer term, if reforms are sustained and the
economy fully adjusts to trade at world market prices, the current account deficit could be reduced to
about 3-4% of GDP by the late-1990s. Under these assumptions, Latvia's level of debt service would
be equal to about 7% of total exports or less than 15% of non-FSU exports and thus would be
considered manageable, according to normal creditworthiness criteria.
68.          Although the level of debt and debt service would be manageable if reforms are
sustained, under a r..ore adverse macroeconomic performance, Latvia could build up new debt
relatively quickly and become a moderately indebted country by the end of the decade, even if exports
grow reasonably fast. Latvia will need to borrow substantial sums of foreign exchange during the
next several years to help assure the success of its economic transformation program. If most of the
funds are borrowed on normal commercial terms, the debt service ratio could rise above sustainable
levels in the medium term (to 25% of non-FSU exports by 1997).
69.          In view of the considerable uncertainty that surrounds balance of payments projections
for any country of the FSU, the Bank will continue to monitor the evolution of Latvia's debt closely
and through its aid coordination activities seek to ensure that as much as possible of financial
assistance to Latvia is provided either on highly concessional terms or as grants. While selected
enterprises appear to be obtaining short-term credits from abroad, Latvia's access to the world capital
markets will take several years to develop and will depend heavily on the success of the current
economic reform program.
IV. THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC REFYORM PROGRAM
70.          In response to the many fundamental economic challenges discussed above, the
Government has developed a program of stabilization, adjustment and structural reform for the next
several years. This program is being concurrently supported by this loan and an IMF Stand-by
Arrangement. The Government's commitments regarding both stabilization and structural reform are
presented in its Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies (Annex 2). The structural reform
measures are summarized in Box 1.



- 20 -
A. Stabilization Program
71.          The objective of stabilization program is to reduce infladon to about 3% a month by
the end of 1992. Although inflation has moderated substantially in the second quarter of 1992 (para.
13), achievement of this objective is a serious challenge to the authorities. The main elements of the
program include: complet ng the price liberalization process, tightening incomes policy,
implementing a prudent fiscal policy and a strict monetary policy, and maintaining control over
external balances.
Price and Wage Poliy
72.          Most prices in Latvia have by now been liberalized, and the Government intends to
remove the remaining obstacles to the free formation of prices as soon as possible. Specifically, the
Govermment plans to limit agricultural support prices and abolish profit margins of processors of
agricultural products. It also plans to eliminate price ceilings on fuel oit and natural gas for industrial
use and substantially increase electricity prices, heating prices and rents. Energy prices are
particularly important because of their effects on budget subsidies and energy usage. As a general
principle, the Government intends to adjust energy prices to cover production and distribution costs
and to ultimately eliminate all subsidies.
73.          In order to prevent a wage-price spiral from emerging and to control budgetary
outlays, the Government intends to introduce measures to restrain the rise in nominal wages to a rate
consistent with the inflation target agreed under the SBA. Therefore, it plans to introduce a tax-based
incomes policy and limit the wage bill and non-wage payments for public enterprises. It would also
limit payments of bonuses to a specified percentage of the wage bill. This area of the program is
likely to be among the most challenging to implement on a sustained basis.
Mecal Polcy
74.          The Government intends to restrain overall demand by limiting the budgetary deficit
to less than 2% of GDP for 1992. It intends to undertake a number of measures for this purpose.
On the revenue side, these include: elimination of most exemptions from the value-added and profit
taxe,s, imposition of a flat rate import duty of 15% =d strengthening revenue collection. On the
expenditure side, the measures include: elimination of subsidies to enterprises, sharp curtailment of
the remaining consumer and agricultural subsidies, reduction in residential heating subsidies and
establishment of a ceiling on the overall level of employment in the public sector. in view of the
cautious approach of the Govermment on expenditures policy, achievement of this objective should be
possible.
Monetary Polky and C    gvney Reforn
75.          With the decision to advance currency reform, the main objective of the Government
in the monetary area is to pursue an independent monetary policy and to maintain confidence and
stability in the new currency. Accordingly, banking system credit would be linked to the target of
reducing inflation to 3 % a month by the end of 1992. The refinancing facilities of the Bank of Latvia
would also be managed in conformity with these objectives. Moreover, the Government intends to
rely more on monetary policy instruments, including interest rate policy, to control and allocate



- 21 -
credit. Thus, interest rate subsidies would be eliminated, and all banks would be allowed to
determine their lending rates. Interest rates on deposits have already been freed.
76.          Since the existence of an independent central banking system is essential for the
successful conduct of monetary policy and a stable new currency, central banking functions of the
Bank of Latvia would be strengthened and its commercial banking activities separated. Although
Parliament has given the Bank of Latvia till the end of 1992 to separate its commercial branches into
independent credit institutions, these branches are already required to observe all the regulations in
the new banking law and are subject to the same monetary policy rules and prudential regulations as
the other commercial banks.
External Sedor Policies
77.          Development of an open economy and maintenance of a competitive foreign exchange
rate are the main objectives in the external sector. The trade regime in Latvia is already very liberal
with hardly any import restrictions and only limnited restrictions on exports. Nevertheless, the
Government intends to eliminate most of the few export taxes. On the import side, a moderate flat
rate import duty would be introduced, mainly as a revenue generating measure that would not distort
the domestic relative price structure.
78.          The Government intenes to conduct its international economic relations on a non-
discriminatory basis and recognizes the need to maintain close economic relations with the FSU. In
that regard, Latvia has signed several bilateral trade agreements with some of its main trading
partners in the FSU and elsewhere. Unfortunately, some of these important agreements have not
proved binding. The Government is committed to promoting trading directly between enterprises and
reducing Government s involvement in trade relations with the FSU.
B. Structural Reforms
79.          The Government's program of structural reforms for 1992 builds on the progress
achieved so far and complements the stabilization program in the following areas: enterprise reform
and private sector development, competition and anti-monopoly policies, bank restructuring, social
assistance programs and economic management reforms. The specific measures and timetable for
imple.menting the reform program is spelled out in the attached Memorandwn on Economdc Reforn
Policies and summarized in the following paragraphs.
Eiaerprise Refornx
80.          Essential for the transformation of the economy to a market-based system is the
progressive enlargement of the role of the private sector. For this purpose, the Government is
committed to promoting the development of new enterprises and encouraging direct foreign
investment. In addition, it intends to privatize a vast majority of enterprises and manage those
enterprises that will remain in the state sector on a commercial basis.



- 22 -
81.          Small business development will be promoted largely through the small privatization
program. Parliament has instructed municipalities to sell 35% of retail businesses under their purview
by September 1992, and the objective is to continue to carry out such privatization until it is
essentially completed, at the latest by the end of 1993. The sale of moveable assets and separable
activities of state-owned enterprises has been permitted in order to stimulate small business
establishment. The Government also plans to address the contracting out of public services more
systematically.
82.          To allow sufficient growth of urban commercial space for private investment, the
Government plans to ease the existing moratorium on the sale of land, particularly within urban
zones. This should be introduced in parallel with reforms permitting private ownership of agricultural
land, scheduled for January 1993. The Government has ruquested Parliament to advance the date of
submission of housing restitution claims in order to accelerate the privatization of housing units.
Also, a draft proposal for the privatization of housing through a voucher system is presently being
considered by Parliament.
83.          Appropriate legislation is expected to be completed shortly to permit the sale of large
enterprises through a variety of techniques to both domestic and foreign purchasers utilizing a voucher
system. Branch ministries have identified enterprises under their purview to be privatized and have
been mandated to submit privatization plans (including possible pre-privatization corporatization and
restructuring) for these enterprises by November 1992. A shortlist of 25 large enterprises to be sold
through a variety of techniques to both domestic and foreign buyers in an initial round of privatization
has been identified. Based on this experience, further and more extensive privatization of large
enterprises is planned to be undertaken during 1993.
84.          For those enterprises that remain in the state sector or that require a longer time to
privatize, steps are being taken to strengthen their commercial practices. The Government has
already requested technical assistance to strengthen corporate governance and is, in parallel, building
the legal infrastructure to handle liquidations and bankruptcies. As a first step, the past practice of
financing enterprise losses through the budget has been stopped. This will probably result in an
increase in inter-enterprise arrears and, therefore, the Bank of Latvia is in the process of installing a
system to monitor these arrears. Together with the Ministry of Finance, it intends to develop
guidelines to prevent the accumulation of such arrears.
85.          To stimulate foreign investment and improve the efficiency and international
competitiveness of Latvian enterprises, the Government intends to open up various types of
investments to foreign buyers, including all or part of large enterprises being privatized. The
assistance of the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the Bank has already been sought to
undertake a diagnostic study and to assist in designing ways to promote foreign investment. Foreign
investment procedures are expected to be amended and institutional arrangements modified based on
the results of this study.
ProConpetion and Anti-Monopoly Policies
86.          The Government intends to promote competition by breaking up monopolies and
multi-plant enterprises and encouraging the entry of new enterprises. An active program of
demonopolization of wholesale and retail trade is planned to be initiated in late-1992 and expanded to



- 23 -
other sectors in 1993. The program of demonopolization will be closely coordinated with the
program of corporatization so as to avoid further integration of enterprises and increase competition
and efficiency. Also during 1993, competitive bidding practices for Government procurement will be
extended.
87.          To assess the viability of enterprises, the Government proposes to adopt an accounting
law, conforming to internationally-accepted accounting standards. To further enforce financial
discipline and permit systematic liquidation of non-viable enterprises, the institutional framework for
implementation of the bankruptcy law will be developed, and liquidation of non-profitable enterprises
is expected to begin before end-1992.
Financil Sector Refonn
88.          To enhance prospects for macroeconomic stability and provide efficiency in the
mobilization and allocation of resources, the banking system needs to be restructured. Further reform
is also required in areas of bank supervision, accounting, auditing and payment systems. Essential for
the success of the new currency is a strong central bank with the appropriate authority to conduct
monetary policy and regulate and supervise commercial banks. Therefore, the Government intends to
strengthen the central banking functions of the Bank of Latvia on a priority basis and to restructure
and privatize the commercial branches of that bank. It will also put in place a system of prudential
regulations for banking supervision.
89.          For restructuring the commercial branches of the Bank of Latvia, a comprehensive
plan based on the evaluation of their portfolios would be prepared. The restructuring plan would also
identify ways of adapting the banking system to the needs of a market economy and, in particular, to
increasing the private ownership of the banks.
Soial Proection and Safet Net
90.          The implementation o he stabilization and restructuring program of the Government
will certainly involve social costs due to the expected rise in unemployment and the need to keep real
wages under control. The Government, therefore, proposes to take measures to prevent the
adjustment costs from falling disproportionately on the most vulnerable groups of the population. The
current social security system (social assistance, unemployment benefits, pensions) is not sufficiently
targeted. The Government, therefore, intends to define a more comprehensive poverty line, taking
into account international experience, as a benchmark for all future programs of social assistance.
The poverty line would be revised regularly to maintain its value in real terms. The medium-term
objective is to assure that individuals receive payments sufficient to bring their income to at least the
poverty line. A network of social assistance offices would be developed to help channel the necessary
help to the most vulnerable groups.
91.          To make the social benefits system more compatible with the practice of market
economies, the Government is also planning to take a number of measures to tighten eligibility
requirements for social benefits, including raising the retirement age and changing the sickness benefit
scheme to have employees and employers share in bearing its cost.



- 24 -
92.          The present system of employment offices is inadequate to handle the anticipated
increase in unemployment. Therefore, the Government intends to strengthen local employment
offices with additional resources and design a system of retraining and other proactive labor market
policies for displaced workers. To cope with the resulting budgetary costs, the Government would
introduce a more simplified structure of unemployment benefits with modified eligibility criteria that
would exclude new entrants and re-entrants into the labor market from receiving benefits.
93.          The budgetary cost of the current earnings-related pension system is unsustainable.
To prevent budgetary imbalances and to achieve the fiscal targets of the stabilization program, the
Government plans to adopt a temporary flat rate pension scheme while the poverty line is being
developed. The Government would also evaluate options for a comprehensive medium-term pension
reform plan, including the establishment of private pension schemes.
94.          The Government also intends to restructure the contributions to the social benefits
program. The present system does not provide any visible linkage between employees' contributions
to the Social Insurance Fund and the benefits obtained. Therefore, the Goverment plans to increase
the employees' and to reduce the employers' contributions until they pay equal shares.
Economnc Mangement
95.          The Government recognizes that successful implementation of the reform program
depends on its own institutional capacity to guide and monitor the reforms as well as the
establishment of appropriate legal and institutional infrastructure within which the private sector can
operate effectively. This will involve strengthening the institutional framework for policy
development and mechanisms for coordination among the various concerned ministries and the Bank
of Latvia. As a first step, the Government intends to establish a cash management system in the
Ministry of Finance to forecast cash flow and develop a full-scale treasury function. It will also put
in place a system for monitoring and recording external debt in that Ministry.
96.          In anticipation of a resumption of the public investment program, the Government
plans to establish a mechanism for setting priorities, establishing project evaluation criteria and
appraising project proposals for public investment. It also plans to prepare a rolling three-year public
investment program, with the objectives of determining public investment requirements and programs,
establishing sectoral policy frameworks and setting relative public investment priorities among and
within sectors.

Box 1: Sumary of the Systemic Reform Program
1. ENTERPRISE REFORM
Private Sector Develonment: The Government intends to promote the development of new enterprises
and encourage direct foreign investment. Municipalities are instructed to privatize 35% of their retail
businesses by September 1992 and to complete the process by the end of 1993. To improve the environment
for private businesses, the Government is committed to create a stable macro framework, improve access to
bank credit, and provide information on laws, regulations and policies. Sale of moveable assets and
separable activities of state-owned enterprises has been permitted. Contracting out of public services will be
addressed in early 1993. The Govermnent is encouraging Parliament to act on housing restitution claims. A
draft proposal for housing privatization is being considered by Parliament. To further expedite privatization,
the Government will, during 1993, ease the existing moratotmm on the sale of land.
Privatization of Large State-Owned Enterdrises: In March 1992, Parliament passed a resolution
allowing the Govetnment to develop guidelines for the privatization of large enterprises. Legislation will be
completed by December 1992. Branch ministries have identified enterprises for which privatization plans
are to be completed by November 1992. Technical assistance will be sought for the sale of 5-10 enterprises
to foreign and domestic investors through a variety of techniques. More extensive privatization will take
place in 1993.
Public Sector Enterprises: For remaining enterprises in the public sector, technical assistance has been
requested co strengthen corporate governance and to deepen commercial practices. During 1993,
competitive bidding practices for Govermment procurement will be extended.
Financial Discipline: The Government has eliminated budgetary support, guarantees on loans and
implicit subsidies through the commercial banking system to public enterprises. By September 1992, the
BOL (Bank of Latvia) wiU finalize a system to monitor inter-enterprise arrears and, with the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), will develop guidelines to prevent their accumulation.
Foreign Investment: Sale of all or parts of large enterprises will be open to international competition.
Foreign investment procedures and institutional arrangements will be modified based on the results of the
ongoing FIAS study.
H. PRO-COMPETITION AND ANTI-MONOPOLY POLICIES
l)emonopolization: The Government intends to promote competition by breaking up monopolies and
multi-plant enterprises and encouraging new entrants. A comprehensive approach to demonopolization will
be developed and an action program will be initiated by December 1992.
Accountina and Auditing: The Government will introduce an accounting law, confirming to
internationally-accepted accounting standards, by December 1992. The institutional framework necessary for
the implementation of the bankruptcy law will be developed by November 1992 to begin liquidation of non-
profitable enterprises immediately thereafter.
HI. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
Legal Framework: In May 1992, the Law on the Bank of Latvia was adopted to strengthen the central
banking functions of the BOL and to prevent it from commercial banking activities by 1992. Until then,
commercial branches will prepare separate balance sheets, be largely independent, be subject to commercial
bank regulations, and be under the supervision of the BOL. A system of prudential regulation will be in
place and fully functional in December 1992.

Box 1: Summary of the Systemic Reform Program (cont.)
Restructuring: In addition to the separation of the commercial branches of the BOL, a comprehensive
plan for restructuring and privatizing banks will be prepared by December 1992 with implementation
starting in 1993. The plan will cover financial, management and ownership issues. It wil deal with non-
performing assets, liquidation or recapitalizetion and privatization, licensing of new banks, and ways to
improve intemal efficiency of the banking system. The restructuring of commercial banks will be carefully
coordinated and linked with the reform of enterprises.
Accounting and Payment Systems: In 1993, as in the case of enterprises, the Government intends to
introduce internationaly-accepted acounting and auditing standards for banks. Appropriate legislation to
supervise adherence to these standards will be introduced in December 1992.
IV. SOCIAL PROTECTION
Povertv Line: A poverty line will be defined by end-1992 and wDl include provisions to maintain its
real value.
Social Assistance Offices: By June 30, 1993, the Government will develop a network of social
assistance offices capable of (i) channelling help to vulnerable groups on a means-tested basis and (ii)
closing the poverty gap. By December 31, 1992, the local employment offices will be strengthened and
expanded, and a system of retraining and other active labor market policies with a specified level of
financing will be established.
Reform of the Social Proarm: The Government plans to streamline the existing benefits program and
make it compatible with the practice of market economies. The retirement age will be raised gradualy
starting January 1993. Beginning September 30, 1993, the Government will increase the linkage between
the employees' contribution to the Social Insurance Fund and the benefits obtained. Over an extended
period beginning September 1993, employees' contributions will be increased and the employers' decreased
to reach equal shares.
The Pension System The Government will consider a simplified flat-rate structure of pension benefits
to be introduced in 1993 as a temporary measure. In 1993, a comprehensive medium-term pension plan
wil be prepared based on full costing and alternative economic and demographic scenarios.
V. ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
l Leal and Institutional Framework: The Government will soon establish, with the assistance of the
IMF, a cash magement unit in the MOF to forecast cash flow and develop a full-scale treasury function.
It wil provide adequate staffing and training in the Department of Statistics, BOL, and in other ministries;
it wiDl implement mechanisms for data colection and compilation of national accounts, price, monetary
fiscal, and balance of payment statistics. Starting October 1992, key economic indicators necessary to
monitor the reform program  will be prepared perodicaly.
Technical Assista_e and Aid Coordination: A unit in the Ministty of Foreign Affairs exists to
coordinate technical assistance. In the MOP, a unit will be established for external debt recording and
reporting. By October 1992, the Government plans to put in place a system for monitoring external debt.
Public Investment Proram: The Government plans by April 1993 to establish a mechanism to set
prorities, establish project evaluation criteria and appraise project proposals for public investment. The
first 3-year, rolling public investment program will be prepaed by July 1993.

V. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
A.  biectiv
97.          The Bank's immediate objectives are to assist the Government in the early
implementation of its economic reform program, while providing import financing to maintain
essential services and production. The Bank's medium-term objectives are to continue to support a
full transition to a market-based economy including structural measures to ensure a vigorous supply
response to the new incentive system, while financing sound investments in key sectors. More
specifically, the Bank's activities would aim to:
*     support the process of economic reform by facilitating the implementation of
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms needed to stabilize the economy and
stimulate production, while providing quick disbursing support to critical sectors of
the economy;
*     strengthen the design and implementation of a social safety net that would protect the
most vulnerable groups during the transition period and assist in labor force
restructuring;
*     build institutional capacity in economic management to support a market-based
economy; and
*     support sector-specific reforms to restructure or expand productive capacity and
promote medium-term investments to improve economic efficiency and protect the
environment, focussing initially on the critical energy sector.
98.          The implementation of the reform program will be monitored closely by the Bank,
and the degree of its success would serve as a benchmark against which the scope and content of the
evolving Bank assistance program to Latvia will be determined.
99.          Latvia joined the Bank in August 1992. The Bank's relationship with Latvia is
therefore still at a very early stage. The proposed Rehabilitation Loan would be the first Bank
operation in the country. Contacts with the Latvian Government were initiated shortly after Latvia
regained its independence and applied for membership in September 1991. In anticipation of
membership, a Bank economic mission visited Latvia in January/February 1992 and reviewed the
macroeconomic situation and key sectors including agriculture, industry, energy, transport,
telecommunications, environment, municipal services, health, education and housing. The mission's
report, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), will be distributed to the Executive Directors
shortly. In addition to reviewing recent economic and policy developments, the report examines
macroeconomic prospects, including external financing requirements, priorities for medium-term
structural reforms, sectoral policies and investment priorities. Based on work related to this task and
the proposed loan, the following discussion provides an initial outline of the Bank's country assistance
strategy.



- 28 -
Macrocconomlc and Systemic Reforms
100.         The primary focus of the Bank's assistance strategy is to assist the Government in the
ongoing transformation of the economy in order to establish market mechanisms and restore
sustainable growth. The Government's intentions in this connection are described in the preceding
section of this report and in the attached Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies. The proposed
Rehabilitation Loan will provide support for the reform program. Related actions by the Bank to
further support the program are described briefly in this section.
101.         Macroeconoi.dc Polices. Bank advice on macroeconomic policies has been provided
through both CEM-related discussions and the preparation of this initial lending operation, in close
coordination with the IMF. The CEM and subsequent economic updating reports will also provide
the basis for mobilizing and coordinating assistance from other multilateral and bilateral agencies.
This task will become increasingly important as the emphasis shifts from macroeconomic stabilization
to systemic and sectoral reforms as well as deciding on investment priorities. Since the normalization
and diversification of trade relations will continue to be a critical area, the Bank will also initiate a
review of trade issues in Latvia and the other Baltic States. The Bank expects that issues relating to
the management of the public expenditure program, central/local fiscal relations, debt management
policies, investment planning and sectoral reform will become increasingly prominent in the policy
dialogue, areas in which the Bank's technical expertise can be particularly helpful to the Latvian
authorities in developing the next stages of the reform program and utilizing foreign assistance in an
efficient manner.
102.         Systemic Reforms. In CEM and loan-related discussions, the Bank has already
provided initial support in the design and introduction of systemic reforms in a mnmber of wide
ranging areas. The Bank intends to continue to support this process through our economic and sector
work, lending and supervision work as well as through technical assistance. Bank policy advice and
technical assistance proposals have focused, in particular, on the following areas:
     Private Sector Development/Enterprise Reform/Pro-Competition and Anti-Monopoly
Policies. Policy advice has already been provided by the Bank in all these areas.
Technical assistance proposals have been prepared in the areas of pilot privatization
and anti-monopoly policies. An enterprise survey has also been initiated, and FIAS
has, at the request of the Government, undertken a diagnostic assessment of the
environment for foreign investment. Financial support for the enterprise reform
process, drawing on this and further sector work programmed in FY93, would be
provided through a proposed lending operation that is likely to focus jointly on
enterprise and financial sector reform.
*     FKnancial Sector Reform. The CEM will provide extensive analysis of the problems
affecting Latvia's financial sector and their links with the enterprise sector. As a first
step in the process of restructuring and strengthening the commercial banking system,
a study to prepare a detailed restructuring plan will be initiated. The findings of this
study, together with the work on the enterprise sector, is intended to be utilized in the
preparation of the above-mentioned enterprise and financial sector reform operation.



- 29 -
*     Sodal Safety Net. The Bank is assisting the Government in reviewing its social
protection and safety net system and identifying measures to strengthen this system
during the transition to a market economy. Technical assistance proposals are being
prepared in several areas, including the development of a network of social assistance
offices, the streamlining of benefit programs and the strengthening of local
employment offices. In addition, the Bank's CEM wUIl provide recommendations for
improving efficiency and protecting essential services in the health and education
sectors. A proposed sector review and related lending operation are expected to
strengthen the design and implementation of social safety net programs to help protect
vulnerable groups from dislocation and hardships and the inevitable difficulties of an
economic reform process of this magnitude. Protecting vulnerable groups is essential
for the socio-political sustainability of the reform process.
*     Economic Management. High priority will be given to strengthening institutional
capacity to further design and implement reforms. Although technical expertise and
education levels are relatively high in Latvia, market-oriented professional skills need
to be developed or adapted in a number of areas, including market economics,
business management, finance, market-based legal framework, accounting and
auditing. Many tasks performed by the public sector, most notably public investment
programming, need to be redefined and strengthened. Training by EDI and other
programs on various topics is being initiated to build up the Government's capacity to
perform essential economic management functions and more generally to remedy skill
deficiencies. The Bank will coordinate with the many bilateral and multilateral donors
active in Latvia to ensure that donor efforts are complementary and reinforce each
other.
SedoeS,pefe  Reforms
103.         In the short term, the Government attaches high priority to preventing a collapse of
essential services (such as power, heating and health services) and production, particularly in the key
agriculture sector. Therefore, it intends to channel the imports financed by the proposed
Rehabilitation Loan to these sectors. In the medium term, the Govermnent recognizes that there will
be a need for sector-specific reforms and investments, complementary to the broader macroeconomic
and systemic reforms, in order to achieve the desired supply response, facilitate private sector
activities, increase efficiency and reduce environmental degradation. The Bank's preliminary
assistance strategy in several key sectors is outlined below.
104.         Energ. In view of the importance of energy, the Bank's proposed second loan (after
the Rehabilitation Loan) will be in this sector and may include environment components. The main
sector priorities are to switch to lower cost and less polluting fuels (mainly away from fuel oil);
improve security of supply (oil import facilities and gas storage); retire old power units, rehabilitate
some units and convert others to gas; reduce hot water losses in district heating systems and replace
boilers with more efficient gas-fired plants. Faced with much higher prices for imported energy,
further improvement in efficiency has become a top priority of the Government and is likely to be a
focus of the lending operation, which would also support sectoral policy and institutional reforms
including pricing and taxation.



- 30 -
105.         Agricdnlu. The agriculture sector (including fisheries, forestry and livestock) is
especially critical for Latvia's export earnings and its food security. In the short term, the sector is
facing an acute shortage of inputs (e.g., veterinary drugs, agrochemicals, spare parts and machinery)
which are needed to avoid a further sharp decline in output. Some of these inputs would be provided
by the Rehabilitation Loan. In the medium term, the sector needs to address several challenges,
including distorted relative prices and an inadequate network of services that are oriented towards the
growing number of small, private farmers. The CEM will provide a preliminary assessment of the
needed policy and institutional changes and the investment and technical assistance requirements in the
sector. Follow-up sector work is planned, which would include further work on the important
fisheries and forestry subsectors and provide a basis for proposed lending operations.
106.         TAmspori*aon. The CEM will provide a preliminary assessment of needed policy
and institutional changes, investment priorities and technical assistance requirements in this sector.
The immediate priorities include strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework,
rationalizing tariff-setting mechanisms and strengthening maintenance. Some upgrading or
modernizing of public transport, road, port, rail and airport facilities would be needed in due course.
Bank lending in this sector is also envisioned in the next few years.
107.         Housing and Municipal Senices. In the CEM, the policy and institutional
framework for housing and municipal services is reviewed, and preliminary recommendations have
already been provided to reduce the prevailing distortions. Many of the remaining price controls and
subsidies are associated with housing and urban services (i.e., housing rents and tariffs for urban
services). There is clearly R need to develop a more dynamic and efficient housing sector and to
move towards cost-based tariffs for public services, as well as initiating investments and technical
assistance to maintain and expand essential water supply and sewerage services and put these services
on a more environmentally-sound basis. The work undertaken to-date and further analyses may lead
to future lending activity in this sector.
108.         Env*onment. As mentioned above, the next proposed loan, which would focus on
the energy sector, may also include environment components. In addition, proposed projects in other
sectors are also expected to address environmental issues. In the agriculture sector, measures will be
taken to incorporate environment and natural resources management concerns into assistance for crop
production, livestock, fisheries and forestry. In the transport sector, actions are envisioned to
inventory and manage hazardous waste materials which have been improperly disposed in port areas
and to reduce high levels of tailpipe emissions from poorly designed and maintained vehicles. In the
municipal serices sector, investments in maintenance and expansion of water supply and wastewater
services would be expected to reduce serious impacts on health, fisheries and recreation from severe
water pollution in many areas.
B. Summary of the Bank's Assistance Program
109.         Lendg Pmogr. Based on the priorities indicated above, the Bank envisions an
annual lending program of about US$50 million over the next three years. This would allow for one
or two operations per year, which would be initially focussed on support for the implementation of
the economic reform program and relieving the scarcity of critical imports. As the economy
stabilizes, Bank resources would gradually be channelled to support sector and investment operations.



- 31 -
Following the Rehabilitation Loan, several projects are being considered including an energy project,
a human resource development project with a focus on public sector management and institutional
building, and an agricultural sector project. The energy project would be expected to result in
significant cost savings, improved services and energy conservation, and would also begin to address
issues to enhance environmental quality. The proposed lending program is also likely to include a
private sector development/enterprise development/financial sector project, which would likely
support the restructuring of the banking and enterprise sectors and private sector development,
through policy and institutional measures and investment finance.
110.         Economic and Sector Work. The planned economic and sector work would provide
the analytical underpinning for the Bank's policy discussions with the Government and future lending.
In close coordination with the IMF and European institutions, the Bank's work will continue to focus
on the sectoral and structural elements of the reform program. As indicated above, the CEM planrned
for completion in FY93 will provide a comprehensive overview of macroeconomic and sectoral
issues, constraints and priorities. Following this CEM, periodic economic updates are planned to
review fast moving developments in the economy and to reassess overall financing requirements and
creditworthiness. In addition, a trade study is planned to review trade-related issues in all three Baltic
states. Sector work will also be initiated in enterprise and financial restructuring, agriculture and
public sector management.
111.         Technical Ass Wnce. Substantial technical assistance will clearly be required to
design and implement structural and sectoral reforms and investment projects. The identification of
critical technical assistance requirements has already been initiated in the context of preparing the
CEM and Rehabilitation Loan. As indicated above, many systemic or structural reforms are being
supported by the loan, and terms of reference (TORs) for the related technical assistance have been
prepared. The Government would understandably prefer to finance this technical assistance with
grant resources, and the Bank is assisting the Government in identifying such sources. To this end,
the Bank has already made available its preliminary assessment of technical assistance requirements to
interested donors and expressed its willingness to help in the drafting of TORs for recruitment of
consultants. Future sector operations or projects are also likely to require technical assistance
components, particularly for the design and implementation of related policy and institutional reforms.
C. Other Bank Group Activities
112.         Once Latvia becomes a member of IFC, the Corporation expects to support the
privatization and modernization process of local enterprises so that they can become internationally
competitive, particularly those that can attract foreign technical partners in joint venture undertakings.
IFC would assist such firms by providing technical assistance for the privatization process when
requested and by providing financial support to privatized enterprises that show promise of becoming
internationally competitive. Initial JFC investments in Latvia are likely to be made in relatively small
companies that have joint venture partners with access to export markets. Areas that show particular
promise at this time are the wood proJucts, construction materials and tourism sectors. At the
request of the Government, FIAS is underaking an initial diagnostic assessment of the environment
for foreign investment with a view to providing the Government specific recommendations in this
area. Once Latvia becomes a member of MIGA, new foreign investments would be eligible for non-



- 32 -
commercial risk g-arantees and for specific promotional and advisory services. EDI is also preparing
to provide courses in such areas as priv- tization and bank management.
D. Collaboration with other Agencies
113.         Close coordination has been maintained with the IMF, EC, EBRD and other aid
agencies to ensure the efficient use of resources and technical assistance. Various donors have been
providing assistance to Latvia for the past year or so, and the G-24 has started to coordinate resource
mobilization activities. The Nordic countries are involved in a number of sectors already, providing
both financial and technical assistance. Other European countries, either bilaterally or through the
EC, have initiated programs of assistance, as have the United States and Canada. EBRD has also
initiated its program in Latvia, focussing in particular on energy, telecommunications and the financial
sector. As the Bank builds up its presence in Latvia, it plans to intensify its aid coordination efforts.
Considerable effort has already been devoted to sharing information with donors, both formally and
informally, to minimize the risk of duplication of activities. Realizing the full potential of various
assistance efforts already under way and/or planned will require strengthened coordination by the
Government and the establishment of consistent approaches among donors. Establishing appropriate
systems and strengthening the central government agencies to fulfill these responsibilities is of the
highest priority at this stage of the reform process.
114.         The Bank has worked closely with the IMF. In addition to a regular exchange of
information and participating in each other's missions, Bank and Fund teams have collaborated
extensively during the preparation of the Rehabilitation Loan and the IMF Stand-By Arrangement,
with Bank staff assuming the lead in discussions on systemic reforms and Fund staff on the
stabilization program. Parallel missions have been in the field over the past several months to ensure
that the respective operations are consistent and complementary. The Latvian reform program would
benefit considerably from continued close coordination and cooperation between the IMF, the EC
institutions, the G-24 countries and the World Bank group. The Latvian Government fully
encourages such close coordination.
VI. THE REHABILITATION LOAN
A. Backgroun
115.         As described previously, the Latvian economy is in the midst of both a fundamental
transformation and a sharp decline in output. The Government has already made substantial progress
in designing and initiating the implementation of a program to move towards a market-based
economy. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes the need for further stabilization measures as
well as a broadening and deepening of its reform program. To this end, it has committed itself to an
extensive program of structural adjustment and reforms.
116.         The adjustment and reform process has been constrained by severe trade disruption
and more recently by a sharp deterioration in Latvia's terms of trade. By early 1992, Latvia was
experiencing critical shortages of basic commodities, key raw materials and production inputs.
Although enterprises were still able to draw on accumulated stocks of raw materials and trading



- 33 -
connections with enterprises in other republics in 1991, the supply situation reached a critical state in
1992. Efforts i normalize trade relations with the FSU continue, but the immediate prospects are for
continued trade disruption and large increases in the prices of energy and other imports. Hence, there
is an immediate need for import support to mitigate further declines in output, while a comprehensive
economic adjustment and reform program is implemented.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
117.         The proposed Bank loan, which is being presented to the Board following the
presentation of a Stand-by Arrangement to the IMF Board, would be part of the response of the
international financial community to Latvia's pressing short-term import needs and to Latvia's
demonstrated commitment to economic reform. Although bilateral donors and the EC will continue
to account for a significant share of the financial flows to the country, Latvia and others will be
looking to the Bank and the IMF for leadership and coordination of financial assistance as well as
advice on macroeconomic and sectoral policy.
118.         The proposed loan has been prepared in close association with the IMF's Stand-by
Arrangement. The Bank has concentrated on developing the program of systemic and structural
reforms described above and in the attached Memorandwn of Economic Reform Policies. This
program lays out a framework for reforms which are necessary for the medium term restructuring of
the Latvian economy and establishes targets and indicators to monitor progress over the coming year.
The proposed loan is based on the existence of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework in the form
of an agreed program with the IMF, and on a recognition of the substantial progress already made by
the Government in initiating the structural reform process. If implemented successfully, the reform
program would provide a sound basis for future Bank assistance to Latvia. The rationale for Bank
involvement would therefore be to support the reform process and balance of payments at this critical
urning point, by financing essential imports and technical assistance.
C. OQiectives
119.         The primary objectives of the proposed loan are to: (a) assist the Government in the
design and implementation of its economic reform program as outlined in the Memorandum of
Economic Reform Policies and (b) help reduce further sharp declines in economic activity during the
next 6-12 months through support for the importation of essential goods for high priority sectors of
the economy. Basic imports are urgently required to prevent further deterioration of the existing
capital stock, to maintain essential services such as power, heat and health services, and to generate a
supply response to the new set of incentives in key productive sectors such as agriculture.
D. 0
120.         To achieve these objectives, the loan of US$45 million equivalent would be made to
the Republic of Latvia to finance the following components: (a) essential imports for three key
sectors (energy, agriculture and health); and (b) technical assistance to support the Government's
economic reform program (if alternative grant financing cannot be obtained for this purpose).
Reallocation between components would be possible by mutual agreement between the Government
and the Bank.



- 34 -
121.         Essential Impom. Bank financing of about US$44 million would be provided for the
importation of essential goods and commodities for priority sectors, on the basis of a list of goods
identified by the Government and approved by the Bank. Changes to the list of goods to be imported
can be made with the prior agreement of the Bank. While changes to the list are not anticipated,
flexibility is being provided should humanitarian or other aid for these items be obtained on better
terms. The imports proposed by the Government, which have been reviewed by the Bank and are
judged as the highest priority items for these sectors, include the following:
*     Energy Imports (about US$13.5 million). The Government has requested financing
for mazut (heavy fuel oil) for combined heat and power production to better ensure a
minimum supply of electricity and heat during the 1992/93 winter season for
industrial and residential consumers. Since no funds either in foreign exchange or in
rubles have been available in the budget since March for purchases, there are
currently no stocks of mazut. The minimum projected requirement of mazut for 1992
is 1.3 million tons, but the budget for the period beginning in July is expected to
provide funds for only about one-third of the upcoming year's requirements. The
proposed loan would finance the purchase of about 150,000 tons or about 20 days'
supply.
*     Agriculture Imports (about US$13 million). The Government has requested financing
for: (a) agrochemicals to prevent disease and for weed control, (b) veterinary
medicines, and (c) machinery and equipment for agricultural production. Due to the
disruption of trade with Russia, imports of agrochemicals and veterinary medicines
have virtually ceased, and stocks of these items have been critically depleted. These
imports are urgently needed to mitigate further declines in sectoral output, particularly
in the meat and dairy sub-sectors which generate significant exports and provide food
security. The agrochemicals would also increase yields and reduce crop losses due to
pests. The proposed machinery and equipment would be utilized for seed coating
(with fertilizers and pesticides), sugar beet production and for testing milk quality, all
of which are considered high priority for developing and maintaining important
agricultural activities.
*     Health Imports (about US$13.5 million). The Government has requested financing
for: (a) pharmaceuticals and vaccines, (b) medical materials, and (c) raw materials
for local production of pharmaceuticals. The disruption of supply arrangements with
the FSU has caused severe shortages of essential drugs, viccines and other supplies
(e.g., syringes, sutures, catheters, surgical gloves). The stocks are now critically
depleted, and the situation is considered to be extremely serious. Latvia is
increasingly relying on humanitarian aid, but the supplies have been inadequate. The
two main Latvian manufacturing companies produce drugs that had been marketed in
the former Soviet market, but they have been severely hurt by the dismantlement of
the Soviet Union and the disruption of their traditional markets. Support for these
two firms would assist the industry to supply the Latvian market and perhaps some
neighboring states in Eastern and Central Europe. This would help this important
industrial asset to survive in the near term while it explores the possibility of
attracting outside investments.



- 35 -
*     Other Imports (about US$4 million) to be identified.
122.         Funds would be provided in the budget to cover the cost of the imports, part of which
would be recovered from the end-users at prevailing local prices. Procurement, pricing and
distribution arrangements for all categories of these imports have been agreed with the relevant
agencies. Most output prices have been or are in process of being liberalized in Latvia; therefore
market prices reflecting full import and distribution costs will be applied for imported goods, with
some exceptions where subsidies will be provided in the budget (e.g., for pharmaceuticals and
medical materials distributed to hospitals). To the extent that the imported goods are sold through
auctions or other forms of competitive distribution for domestic currency (such as agrochemicals), the
funds generated, less the legitimate costs of managing this distribution, would be returned to the
Government.
123.         Technkcal Aszis6we. Bilateral and other assistance would provide support for
technical assistance and training to support project implementation and the design and implementation
of important parts of the economic reform program. A unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
been assigned responsibility to coordinate all technical assistance to Latvia, including those under this
loan. Technical assistance financed by the Swedish Govermnent in the amount of about US$0.25
million is included for procurement support in the form of advisory services to the importers to
ensure compliance with Bank procurement guidelines, as well as for finance and disbursement
advisory support, since Latvia is inexperienced in Bank disbursement and accounting procedures.
124.         Additional assistance is being sought from the EC for advisory services for
preparation of part of the structural reform program. As this assistance is not yet confirmed, a
provision of US$1 million has been made under the loan for this purpose. This provision would
roughly cover the cost of about 7 man-years of consultancy services, judged sufficient to address
priority needs in the unlikely event that the expected grant financing doesn't materialize in a timely
manner. Should grant funding be obtained as is expected, then this part of the loan would be
reallocated to finance imports. The areas of assistance elaborated on in Annex 5 include: (a)
enterprise reform and privatization, for the design of an overall strategy for privatization, pilot
privatization of the enterprises, corporatization and commercialization of state enterprises, and
implementation of anti-monopoly policies; (b) financial sector reform, for preparing a plan for
restructuring and privatization of commercial bank branches of the Bank of Latvia and the
development of internationally-accepted accounting and auditing standards for banks and enterprises;
and (c) social protection, for retraining of labor, development of local social assistance otfices and
reform of pension schemes and other cash benefit programs. Terms of reference for such assistance
have been prepared and shared with the EC-PHARE program. Training of major commercial banks
in international financiai transactions in conjunction with the importation of goods into Latvia is being
provided by correspondent banks.
E. Implementation
125.         The Ministry of Economic Reform would have primary responsibility for the day-to-
day administration, coordination and management of the loan. A project implementation unit (PIU)
within MER was established on June 29, 1992 for this purpose. Tne PIlU is headed by the Deputy
Minister of Economic Reform. The unit also contains staff from the Ministry of Finance to handle
the finance and disbursement requirements. The staff of the PIU is being assisted by two



- 36 -
internationally-recruited advisors in the procurement and finance fields. The PIU would prepare,
inter alia, periodic progress reports, annual project accounts in accordance with internationally
accepted accounting procedures for subsequent audit by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
within six months of the end of the fiscal year, and a project completion report for submission to the
Bank within six months of the loan closing date. The Government's Commission for the Use of
Foreign Technical and Financial Assistance and Credits, comprised of ministers or their deputies from
several key ministries, would serve as a Steering Committee to ensure prompt resolution of issues
involving the various ministries and other agencies, or jurisdictional disputes which may arise during
implementation of the loan. The Bank is also preparing training courses on procurement and
disbursement, and the PIU as well as the other concerned agencies will be invited to participate.
126.         The relevant sector ministries and their specialized procurement agencies would be
responsible for the procurement of goods and for their distribution to the final users, under the
supervision of the PIU and its advisors. Ministries and enterprises receiving imported goods and their
procurement agencies would each designate a liaison officer to represent them with the PIU in all
matters involving the procurement of their particular goods. The ministries, enterprises and their
procurement agencies would be primarily responsible for preparation of technical specifications and
bidding documents, evaluation and recommendations for contract award, signing and supervision of
contracts, and pre-inspection of goods where deemed essential, including oversight responsibility for
ensuring that imported goods reach the end-users. Technical assistance would be managed by the
concerned ministries with assistance provided, as necessary, by the PIU.
127.         Given that this is the first operation in Latvia, the time allocated for Bank supervision
has been augmented in order to provide additional assistance that may be required to better ensure
smooth implementation. In addition, an experienced group of procurement advisors is currendy being
established in the Bank's Regional Procurement Office to assist the Bank staff in the supervision effort
and to review procurement documents for approval.
F. Procurement
128.         Procurement of the imported goods would follow Bank guidelines with contracts
above US$300,000 awarded on the basis of simplified international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures. To the extent possible, consistent with broad priorities for critically needed goods and
commodities, items will be selected that can be purchased in packages of not less than this amount to
ensure quick disbursement of the loan proceeds. For contracts under US$300,000, international
shopping procedures would be permitted (i.e., quotations from at least three foreign suppliers from
two countries would be required). Goods which are provided by nationals of, or produced in or
supplied from republics of the FSU, will be eligible.
129.         A General Procurement Notice was published in the Development Business on
May 31, 1992, and bidding documents are under preparation with the help of foreign procurement
experts. Under the loan, essential goods for the agriculture, energy and health sectors will be
procured. Standard bidding documents are being prepared by the PIU based on the Bank's sample
bidding documents. While all bidding documents will be subject to prior review, after the Bank has
reviewed at least the first two ICB documents in each sector, further review could be waived subject
to certification by the PIU that no changes to the standard documents have been made. Prior review
of the evaluation and recommendations for contract awards would be required for all ICB contracts.



- 37 -
130.         Consultants financed from the proceeds of the loan would be selected in accordance
with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World
Bank as Executing Agency" published by the World Bank in August 1981.
G. Disbursement
131.        The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign expenditures
for the imported goods, commodities, and consultancy and advisory services. Disbursements would
be made against standard Bank documentation. It is projected that US$30 million would be disbursed
in FY93 and US$15 million in FY94. The loan closing date would be December 31, 1993.
H. Agreements Reached
132.         During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government regarding the
following: (a) a Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies outlining the scope and content of the
Government's economic reform program and timetable for carrying out the program; (b) maintenance
of a project implementation unit (PIU) with adequate and appropriate staff; (c) utilization of the
Government's Commission for the Use of Foreign Technical and Financial Assistance and Credits as
the Steering Committee for the loan; (d) the use of procurement and disbursement advisory services
and scope of these services; and (e) technical assistance requirements, including terms of reference
and financing arrargements, to support development of the economic reform program.
1. Environmental Aspects
133.         Given the nature of this loan, no environmental rating has been assigned.
Nevertheless, in developing procurement procedures for financing imports under the loan, specific
provision has been made to ensure that the inclusion of any toxic or hazardous substances (e.g.,
agrochemicals) would be under conditions acceptable to the Bank.
J. Benefits
134.         The proposed loan would help to maintain production in the short term in vital sectors
of the Latvian economy, which is initiating a far-reaching transformation. The imports to be financed
by the loan would have direct output and employment effects and would ensure a minimum
availability of certain essential services and items. Restoring growth in the longer term would depend
on continuing economic reforms. The technical assistance to be provided would assist the
Government in implementing its economic reform program. Future Bank adjustment and investment
lending are expected to play an important role in helping to sustain the reform process.
K. Risks
135.         Possible risks include (a) a slower than expected implementation period for importing
goods due to an untested implementation capacity and possible procurement delays, and (b)
uncertainties and slippage in the implementation of the economic reform program. To minimize the
first risk, close attention has been paid to the requirements for efficient implementation, including



- 38 -
pre-identification of the goods to be imported, early establishment of the PIU and provision of
procurement support to importing agencies. The second risk would be reduced through the provision
of technical assistance to support implementation of the reform program, including assistance for
strengthening the social safety net to enhance the program's social and political acceptability. The
technical assistance would be intensively supervised to better ensure implementation of the economic
reforms in a timely manner.
VU. RECOMMENDATION
136.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and recommend that the Executive Direcrs approve it.

18X.8   street l.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Preston,
The  attached  Memorandum  on  Economic  Reform  Policies.-
outlines the program of macroeconomic stabilization and
systemic reforms of the Republic of Latvia. -We request the
World Bank to support this program with a Rehabilitatiod
Loan in the amount of $4S million equivalent.
it is our intention to implement the program described -in
the attached Memorandum in order to achieve a rapid
resumption of economic growth within a sustainable
macroeconomic  framework.  Given *the complexity of the
transition to a market-oriented economy, it is inevitable
that there will be some uncertainties regarding the
implementation of this program.   Some adjustments and
corrective action are likely to be required.   We will.
closely monitor the progress of our reform prograw and we
will, where appropriate, review necessary adjustments with
the World Bank.
Sincerely yours,
Arnis Kalninsh

LATVIA
Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies
A.    Background
1.           After nearly half a century under communist rule, Latvia has embarked on a program
of economic reform to transform its economy from a planned to a market-based economy. The
transition process has been constrained due mainly to the heavy dependence of the economy on the
former Soviet Union and lack of appropriate institutions to set up a market-based economic system.
The disruption in trade with Russia and other former Soviet republics has severely contracted
imported inputs and raw materials, particularly oil products. As a result, GDP has dropped sharply
in 1990 and 1991 and inflation has increased substantially.
2.           Economic performance in 1992 is also being threatened by the lack of hard currency
and imported inputs and raw materials. It is also being influenced by the continued uncertainty of
trade relationships with Russia and other former Soviet republics, although efforts to normalize trade
continues. Even with the anticipated decline in the volume of imports from the former Soviet
republics, Latvia is still facing a large negative terms of trade shock this year. Given the small
amount of exports to convertible currency areas, the low level of foreign exchange resources makes it
difficult to finance urgently-needed imports and prevent further declines in output and employment.
3.           We have already initiated substantial efforts a. economic transformation including
liberalization of wages and prices, introduction of private ownership and legal reforms, privatization
of agriculture and small enterprises and introduction of a market for foreign exchange. Further
reform measures are currently under consideration to restructure the banking system, reform the
enterprise sector and strengthen the social safety net for those who will be adversely affected by the
process of transformation.
4.           To ensure that reforms are implemented in a stable macroeconomic environment, we
also intend to put in place a package of policy measures to maintain macroeconomic stability and
avoid severe inflation and problems in the external accounts. The economic program outlined in this
memorandum sets out both our short- and medium-term objectives which aim at stabilizing the
economy while simultaneously embarking on a far-reaching structural reform program. The
discussions on stabilization policies is kept brief and a fuller discussion of our stabilization program
and its quantitative targets will be found in the Memorandum we have submitted to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
B. Prices. Macroeconomic Management and Foreign Economic Relations
Price Refonn
5.           Although most prices have been liberalized, we recognize the importance of
proceeding quickly to eliminate as many of the remaining price subsidies as possible. By January 1,
1993, prices of all remaining items subject to price ceilings, other than rent, heating oil and natural
gas, will be liberalized. Those other prices will also be gradually adjusted to cover maintenance and
production costs and to reach world market levels. It is expected that price liberalization measures

Annex 2
Page 3 of 9
will result in further price increases in the coming months. However, with the consistent
implementation of firm financial and incomes policies (described below), we are determined to arrest
the rise in inflation and limit its increase to 3% a month by the end of the year.
Fiscal Policy
6.           Further fiscal restraint is central to the success of the stabilization and reform
program. Accordingly, we have adopted a balanced budget for the second half of 1992 with the aim
of limiting the deficit in the general Government budget to less than 2% of GDP for the year as a
whole. We intend to achieve this objective through a variety of tax measures, including elimination
of most exemptions from the value-added and profit taxes and simplification of the excise taxes.
Moreover, tax administration will be strengthened, and a flat rate import duty of 15% will be
imposed on most imports, except those covered by free trade and custom union agreements. We will
also keep a tight rein on expenditures. The remaining consumer subsidies will be reduced over time
by adopting the price policy mentioned above. A cap on the overall level of employment in the
public sector for the second half of 1992 will be established to restrain the expenditure on wages.
Crency Reform and Monetary Poly
7.           We have created the necessary conditions to pursue an independent monetary policy
by the decision to make the Latvian ruble the only legal tender in Latvia in July. Consequently, a
credit program has been established for the reminder of 1992 to maintain growth rates for money and
credit that are consistent with the target of reducing inflation, the objective of the balance of
payments, the projected decline in output and the credit needs of the newly-established private
enterprises. Also, the refinancing facilities of the Bank of Latvia will be managed in such a fashion
that are compatible with this credit program. We intend to increase efficiencv of the financial sector
by moving as quickly as possible toward a system in which interest rates play an important role in the
mobilization and allocation of resources. This will require the creation of effective monetary policy
instruments which we intend to rely on in future monetary programs. We have requested technical
assistance from the IMF to facilitate this transition. We have already liberalized interest rates, and
there are no restrictions on interest rates offered or charged by commercial banks. We have also
eliminated interest rate subsidies by the banking system starting July 1, 1992.
Incomes Poliy
8.           Since conditions for a market system of wage determination are not yet in place in
Latvia, we intend to monitor wage increases to prevent a wage-price spiral from emerging. For this
purpose, we will introduce a tax-based incomes policy for non-budgetary state enterprises for the
second half of 1992 and ensure that increases in minimum wages will riot lead to an acceleration of
inflationary pressures.
External Sector Policies
9.           The removal of exchange and trade restrictions is the core of our strategy for
introducing a rational structure of relative prices, alleviating supply bottlenecks and exposing domestic
producers to import competition. It is our intention to announce a pegged exchange rate, once the Lat
is introduced and a high degree of price and exchange rate stability is achieved. Also, it is our



- 46 -                                 Annex
Page 4 of 9
intention to remove the bulk of export taxes by the end of 1992. We plan to review the tariff system
with a view to make it compatible with those of neighboring countries with similar characteristics.
We have signed free trade agreements with Sweden and Norway and are negotiating a customs union
with the other Baltic countries. We also intend to conduct our international economic relations on a
non-discriminatory basis and in line with multilateral principles prevailing in the world economy. In
this context, we recognize the need for continued close economic relations with the states in the ruble
area and will take all possible measures to avoid actions that will disrupt trade with those states. We
are also committed to remove the remaining trade barriers with the other republics, reduce the direct
involvement of the Government in trade relations, promote direct trading between enterprises and
phase out essentially all remaining privileges granted to enterprises that are suppliers to the state.
C. Structural Reform and Transition to a Market Economy
10.         In addition to the stabilization measures outlined above and the policy reforms adopted
earlier, we are now in the process of undertaking additional steps to create a competitive market
environment and to speed up the process of fundamental economic transformation. The thrust of our
structural reform program includes: (i) enterprise reform including corporatization and privatization
of enterprises and the legal framework; (ii) pro-competition and anti-monopoly policies, including
demonopolization of enterprises, enforcement of anti-trust legislation, facilitating the growth of new
private enterprises and encouraging direct foreign investment; (iii) strengthening the commercial
banking system including adoption of appropriate legislation, restructuring of the banks and setting up
internationally-accepted accounting and auditing standards; and (iv) putting in place a system of social
protection and social safety net including social assistance programs for the most vulnerable groups
and displaced labor arising from restructuring of the economy. Specific policies and actions that we
intend to undertake in each of the areas are elaborated below.
D. Enterprise Reform
11.          Essential for transformation of the economy to a market-based system is the
progressive enlargement of the role of the private sector. For this purpose we will promote the
development of new enterprises and encourage direct foreign mvestment in Latvia. In addition, we
are committed to privatize a vast majority of our enterprises and commercially manage those
enterprises that will remain in the state sector. Reform of the enterprise sector will, howevrr, take
time and considerable resources to design and implement. Therefore, we are counting on support
from the World Bank and other agencies to design and assist in implementing specific policy
programs and meas ires.
12.          Small business development will be promoted largely through the small privatizsation
program. In November 1991, we enacted a law on privatization of small municipal enterprises in
trade, catering and services and converted small state-owned enterprises to municipal ownership.
This program has since been broadened by lifting the size restriction as of mid-1992. Parliament has
instructed municipalities to privatize 35% of retail businesses under their purview by September 1992,
and the objective is to continue to carry out such privatization until it is essentially completed, at
latest by end-1993. The Ministry of Economic Reform is actively monitoring the progress of
privatization based on data collected by the Department of Statistics. In addition, we aim to improve
the environment for private businesses by creating a stable macroeconomic framework, improving



7 -                                        Annex 2
Page 5 of 9
access to bank credit for these businesses and providing them with information on laws, regulations
and Government policies. The sale of moveable assets and separable activities of state-owned
enterprises has been permitted in order to stimulate small business establishment, and the contracting
out of public services will be more systematically addressed in early-1993.
13.          To develop a market for land and allow sufficient growth of urban commercial space
for private investment, we will begin to ease the existing moratorium on the sales of land, particularly
within urban zones, during 1993. We will again encourage Parliament to advance the date of
submission of housing restitution claims in order to accelerate the privatization of housing units.
Finally a draft proposal for the privatization of housing through vouchers is presently being
considered by Parliament.
14.          According to a Parliamentary Resolution passed in March 1992 regarding
privatization, we are presently developing procedures and guidelines for the privatization of large
enterprises, including the assignment of institutional arrangements. Appropriate legislation will be
completed by the latest in December 1992; this legislation envisages the sales of enterprises through a
variety of techniques to both domestic and foreign purchasers and a voucher component. Branch
ministries have identified enterprises under their purview to be privatized and have been mandated to
submit privatization plans (developed at the enterprise level, including possible pre-privatization
corporatization and restructuring) for these enterprises by November 1992. We have identified a
shortlist of 25 large enterprises to be sold in an initial round of privatization; by September 1992, we
will initiate sales by seeking technical assistance for a subgroup (5-10) of these enterprises to be sold
through a variety of techniques to both domestic and foreign buyers. Further and more extensive
privatization of large enterprises will be undertaken during 1993.
15.          For those enterprises that remain in the state sector indefinitely or will take a longer
time to privatize, technical assistance has been requested to strengthen corporate governance. Based
on the outcome of this technical assistance, we will develop concrete plans to deepen the commercial
practices of these state-owned enterprises. Steps that have already been taken in this direction
include: the elimination of state orders (except those needed to fulfill interstate agreements) and the
general removal of privileges to enterprises which are suppliers to the state. During 1993,
competitive bidding practices for Government procurement will be extended.
16.          Financial autonomy of enterprises vis-a-vis the state has been achieved and we intend
to continue to impose financial discipline on public enterprises. We have eliminated budgetary
support to enterprises, including implicit subsidies from all levels of Government, guarantees on loans
to enterprises and implicit subsidies to enterprises through the commercial banking system. By
September 1992, the Bank of Latvia will finalize a system to monitor inter-enterprise arrears and
together with the Ministry of Finance will develop guidelines to prevent the accumulation of inter-
enterprise arrears. In addition, enterprises are increasingly turning to pre-payment arrangements as a
temporary solution to reduce inter-republican enterprise arrears.
17.          To stimulate foreign investment and make Latvian enterprises more efficient and
intenationally competitive, we will open up various types of investments to foreign buyers, including
all or part of large enterprises to be privatized (mentioned above). We have already sought the
assistance of the Foreign Investment Advisory Service of the World Bank to undertake a diagnostic



- 48 -                                Annex 2
Page 6 of 9
study and to assist in designing ways to promote foreign investment. Foreign investment procedures
will be amended and institutional arrangements modified based on the results of this study.
13. Pro-Comnetition and Anti-Monopoly Policies
18.          Because of the inherent structure of production and distribution in the centrally-
planned economies, there are large monopolies in many sectors of the economy, particularly in
wholesale and retail trade and the distribution system. We intend to promote competition through
breaking up monopolies and multi-plant enterprises and encouraging new enterprises. We will
develop an approach to comprehensive demonopolization by December 1992. An active program of
demonopolization of wholesale and retail trade will be initiated by December 1992 and expanded to
other sectors in 1993. The program of demonopolization will be closely coordinated with the
program of corporatization so as to avoid further integration of enterprises and increase competition
and efficiency.
19.          To assess the viability of enterprises, we will complete an accounting law, conforming
to internationally-accepted accounting standards, by December 1992. To further enforce financial
discipline and permit systematic liquidation of non-viable enterprises, we will develop the institutional
framework for implementation of the bankruptcy law (adopted December 1991) by November 1992,
and begin liquidation of non-profitable enterprises immediately thereafter.
F. Finanial Sector Reform
20.          Reform of the financial sector is a prerequisite for the effective mobilization of
resources and their allocation to efficient users. We have already taken initial steps in the reform of.
this sector and are in the process of completing the appropriate legal framework. On May 19, 1992,
we adopted the Law on the Bank of Latvia to strengthen the core central banking functions of the
Bank of Latvia and to prevent that bank from engaging in commercial banking activities. A
parliamentary resolution, however, adopted on the same date allows the Bank of Latvia until end-1992
to formally separate its commercial banking branches. However, during this period, the commercial
branches will prepare separate balance sheets, will be largely independent in their business operations,
will be subject to the same rules and regulations as commercial banks and will be under the
supervision arm of the Bank of Latvia.
21.          Based on the new Law on Banks of Latvia, we will put in place a system of prudential
regulation (both off-site and on-site) for banking supervision by September 1992 and which will be
fully functional by December 1992. This will include the evaluation of alternative institutional
arrangements of banking supervision and the development and organization of a training program for
the staff of the Bank of Latvia or the relevant supervisory institutions as needed. We will seek
external assistance especially from the IMF for these activities.
22.          Restructuring and recapitalization of the banking sector will be a top priority in the
reform of our financial sector and the development and growth of the private commercial banking
system in Latvia. As a first step in this direction, we will separate the commercial branches of the
Bank of Latvia into separate legal entities by December 1992. This action will be followed by
preparing a comprehensive plan for restructuring and privatization of the branches by December 31,
1992, with a timetable for implementation starting in 1993.



- 4                                   Annex42
Page 7 of 9
23.          The restructuring plan will cover financial, management and ownership restructuring
and will deal with: non-performing assets in the banking system; liquidation or recapitalization and
privatization of the commercial banks; licensing of new commercial banks with a view to encourage
competition; and ways to improve the internal efficiency of the banking system. We will ensure that
all decisions and activities on the accounting and auditing system, restructuring of the banking system
and linkages with enterprise reform are carefully coordinated by the responsible agencies.
24.          Privatization of enterprises and new business entry will rapidly increase the number of
transactions in the banking system as well as the number of payments. Our current accounting
practices are still largely based on standards appropriate for a centrally-planed economy, and
accounting is still partially manual. This creates a serious bottleneck in the payments system. As in
the case of enterprises, we intend to prepare and put in place, in 1993, accounting and auditing
standards for the banks. We intend to adopt the appropriate legislation by December 1992 and will
supervise adherence to these standards. Furthermore, we will evaluate alternative measures of
improving the efficiency of the present payment system, based on the new accounting standards.
External assistance will be used for these activities, which in many instances our foreign joint venture
partners could provide us.
G. SocialPo
25.          Transformation of the economy will entail large-scale unemployment. To mitigate the
impact of this transformation on individuals and their families, we are planning to initiate measures to
create incentives to facilitate the process of labor force adjustment and to keep the budgetary cost
manageable, as well as to ensure that the costs of adjustment do not fall disproportionately on the
most vulnerable members of society. Therefore, we will remove all restrictions on labor mobility and
review carefully the costs of our social safety not system.
26.         TMe transition to a market economy will place an unusually heavy burden on the
social safety net if the current system of protection, which is not means-tested, is maintined. From
that perspective, it is important to define a more comprehensive poverty line as the benchmark for all
programs, taking imto account international experience. We will atlempt to complete the definition of
the poverty line by December 31, 1992, and will include provisions for regular revisions to maintain
its value in real terms.
27.          We will develop a network of social assistance offices to be able to channel necessary
help to the most vulnerable groups on the means-testing basis and assess the poverty gap (i.e.
resources necessary to bring up to the poverty line all those that fall under that level) by June 30,
1993. We will introduce the necessary changes in legislation, in particular in the law on
municipalities and local authorities. The system will be fuctional by December 31, 1992, and fully
developed by June 30, 1993. A means-tested system will provide a benefit of last resort for citzens
whose eligibility for other benefits has been exasted or whose entitlement is inadequate.
28.          We will undertke measures to streamline the existing benefits program and make the
system compatible with the practice of market economies. We have already undertaken
implementation of sick pay reform by placing the burden of the costs of the first three weeks of
sicknesS on employers. Beginning lamnary 1, 1993, we intend to start raising the retrement age
gradually over an extended period. Initially, the retirement age will be raised by two years.



- 50 -                                    Annex
Page 8 of 9
29.          Since the sustainability of budgetary expenditures under the current earnings-related
pension scheme may become difficult with a rise in unemployment, we will consider, a simplified
flat-rate structure of pension benefits which can be introduced in 1993, if necessary, as a temporary
measure to prevent budgetary imbalances and reach the stabilization targets of the reform program.
In 1993 we will begin to prepare a comprehensive medium-term pension reform plan, based on full-
costing options under alternative economic and demographic scenarios over an extended period of
time. We will also evaluate options for establishing private pension schemes within an appropriate
legal framework.
30.          The present system of employment offices and financing labor market policies is
inadequate for the expected substantial level of unemployment in Latvia. Therefore, by December
31, 1992, we will strengthen local employment offices with additional resources (including plans for
expansion of such offices to geographic areas likely to be hardest hit by unemployment) and design
the system of retraining and other active labor market policies for displaced workers with a specified
level of financing. We will also better define the scope of other active labor market policies such as
job search assistance, employment subsidies, grants, credits and public works by December 1992.
31.          The present system does not provide any visible linkage between the negligible
employees' contribution to the Social Insurance Fund and benefits obtained. Therefore over an
extended period of time, beginning not later than September 30, 1993, we will increase the
employees' contribution and reduce the employers' contribution to the Social Insurance Fund with the
objective of reaching eventually equal shares in contributions.
Economic Management
32.          The Government recognizes that the successful implementation of the reform program
depends on having in place the institutions and capacity for public sector management to guide and
monitor the reform process as well as appropriate legal and institutional infrastructure within which
the private sector can operate. This includes strengthening the institutional framework for policy
development and mechanisms for coordination among the various economic ministries and the Bank
of Latvia. To this end, with the help of the IMF, we will establish within the coming months a cash
management unit in the Ministry of Finance to forecast cash flows and develop a full-scale treasury
function.
33.          We attach high priority to providing adequate staffing and training in the Department
of Statistics, Bank of Latvia, and in our ministries and to implementing mechanisms for data
collection and compilation so thaL national accounts, price, monetary, fiscal and balance of payments
statistics become available on a timely basis. Starting October 1992, we will prepare periodically in
English key economic indicators for monitoring progress in our reform program.
34.          We have established a Unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate technical
assistance. We will also establish a unit within the Ministry of Finance for external debt recording
and reporting. By October 1992, we intend to put in place a system for monitoring and recording
external debt, consistent with the reporting requirements of the World Bank.
35.          In anticipation of a resumed public investment program, we plan to establish by April
1993 a mechanism to set priorities, establish project evaluation criteria and appraise project proposals



- 51 -                                     Annex 2
Page 9 of 9
for public investment. By July 1993, we will prepare the first version of a rolling, three-year public
investment program, which--unlike multi-year plans in the past--would focus on: (i) establishing
appropriate sectoral policy frameworks; (ii) setting relative public investment priorities among and
within sectors; and (iii) focus.ng on public investment requirements and programs rather than
enterprise investments.

Technical Assistance
1.           Technical assistance requirements for the implementation of the Rehabilitation Loan
and the Government's reform program have been identified. Terms of reference (TORs) have already
been prepared and financing from grant sources has been secured for advisory services related to loan
implementation. For most of the other technical assistance items related to the reform program,
TORs have been or are being prepared. Grant financing will be sought for all of these items, and the
Bank will assist the Government in this endeavor. However, if such financing is not forthcoming,
funding from the loan will be available for this purpose.
2.            The technical assistance requirements include the following:
(a)    Procurement, Disbursement and Accounting Assistance. Advisory assistance and
training is required to assist the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the Ministry of Economic
Reform in carrying out its functions, which include, inter alia, the following: (i) reviewing
procurement documentation for importing goods and consultant services to ensure that they have been
prepared in accordance with World Bank procedures; (ii) advising participating ministries and their
procurement agencies on acceptable methods and procedures of procurement and payment; (iii)
establishing and maintaining records of expenditures; (iv) verifying payments due under contracts and
preparing and processing applications to the Bank for loan withdrawals; (v) coordinating all other
actions and decisions among the participating ministries and their agencies to ensure timely and
effective project implementation; (vi) training PIU and ministry staff in the various aspects of
procurement and payment; and (vii) reporting to the World Bank on the progress of the loan.
(b)    Design of an Overall Strategy for Privatization. Advisory assistance to the Ministry
of Economic Reform is required to finalize a comprehensive privatization strategy and legislative
framework for small and large enterprises, land and houses by end-1992. The Advisor would assist
in consensus building in order to (i) prioritize objectives for privatization; (ii) identify methods for
privatization and future potential owners; (iii) select methods of privatization suited to each type of
property and determine how privatization will tie in with other aspects of enterprise reform and
reforms in lhe enterprise environment; (iv) identify institutions that will exercise ownership rights
over state-owned enterprises and agents to initiate, approve, monitor and implement privatization; (v)
determine the use for the proceeds of sales and develop alternative financing plans to facilitate
privatization; and (vi) set goals for the number and types of enterprises to be privatized annually as
well as identify those that should be liquidated. The Advisor will provide advice on drafts of
privatization legislation and identify areas for technical assistance necessary to support the
privatization program.
(c)    Pilot Privatization of Enterprises. Assistance to the Large Privatization Division of
the Ministry of Economic Reform is required to undertake the sale of a small group (5-20) of medium
and large enterprises in a "pilot privatization" program. The technical assistance will have two
objectives: (a) to take the leading role in undertaking these privatization transactions; and (b) to train



- 55 -                                  Annex S
Page 2 of 3
the concerned Latvian Government staff to carry out future privatizations. Specific tasks would
include: (i) selecting 5-20 enterprises for privatization, utilizing a list of pre-identified privatization
candidates, employing the greatest variety of privatization methods permitted under prevailing
legislation; and (ii) undertaking the privatization of these enterprises by carrying out operational and
financial audits, assessing the need for valuations of assets and, if appropriate, performing such
valuations, preparing prospectus for privatization, identifying potential buyers, identifying procedures
for each sale and carrying out sales, and drafting and negotiating all contractual agreements. The
consultants will also train concerned Ministry staff in techniques for privatization, methods of valuing
assets and privatization procedures.
(d)    Corporatization and Commercialization of State Enterprises. Advisory assistance to
the Ministry of Economic Reform is required to establish appropriate arrangements for exercising the
state's ownership rights and for improving corporate governance, financial discip'-ne and performance
of state-owned enterprises. Tasks related to the exercise of state ownership rights include: (i)
reviewing the existing role of functional departments or ministries now responsible for non-privatized
state-owned enterprises in exercising their ownership role over their respective enterprises; (ii)
developing proposals for institutional arrangements for effectively exercising the state's ownership
role in the future; and (iii) developing proposals as to how best to exercise the regulatory and control
roles of the Government as distinct from its ownership role. For improving corporate governance,
the advisors will propose: (i) actions needed to establish corporate governance bc lies at the level of
the Board of Directors and internal enterprise management level; (ii) effective means by which the
relevant Government authorities would appoint competent directors; (iii) how the Boards of Directors
will appoint competent enterprise management teams and define their functions and obligations; (iv) a
program for development of effective directors to serve on the Boards of Directors; and (v) incentive
and motivation systems for senior enterprise managers. The advisors will also propose proper
reporting and monitoring systems for enterprises and train concerned Latvian staff in the areas
mentioned above.
(e)    Implementation of Anti-Monopoly Policies. Advisory assistance to the
Demonopolization Department of the Ministry of Economic Reform is required to assist in the break-
up of Latvia's highly concentrated, enterprise sector by developing and finalizing an economy-wide
demonopolization program. The scope of the work includes three main requirements: (a) provide
daily assistance to the staff of the department; (b) prepare a detailed plan for implementing a
demonopolization program; and (c) implement demonopolization in selected industries. Specific tasks
include: (i) reviewing current demonopolization-related legislation and providing recommendations
for potential amendments to legislation and requirements for new legislation; (ii) developing criteria
for identifying priority subsectors/industries for demonopolization, prioritizing subsectors of the
economy for demonopolization, and identifying natural monopolies to remain as monopolies subject to
Government regulation; (iii) developing an approach to demonopolize 10 major subsectors; (iv)
identifying institutional arrangements to carry out demonopolization; (v) determining the need to
break-up (deconcentrate) non-monopoly, multi-plant enterprises and providing specific
recommendations; and (vi) assisting in undertaking 5 enterprise break-ups, based on the detailed
recommendations of the above tasks.
(f)    Assistance for Restructuring the Financial Sector. Assistance is required to the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Latvia to produce a detailed plan for implementing the .
restructuring of the banking system. The study would examine (i) the present overall strategy for



- 56 -                                     Annex 5
Page 3 of 3
banking reform; (ii) the legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework of banking operations; and
(iii) the clientele of the banking sector, particularly since the enterprise sector is being restructured
and privatized and it is important to overhaul the banking sector in parallel with the enterprise sector.
Taking into consideration the financial sector strategy, the policy, legislative, regulatory and
enterprise framework, the study would recommend the specific measures that are required to
restructure the banking system; indicate the obstacles and constraints which are being faced or which
may be faced in implementing these measures; recommend methods of implementation for the
measures proposed in the form of a detailed timetable for the critical first operations covering the next
1-2 years; and indicate the possible contribution of external assistance to the banking reform program.
(g)    Assistance for Improving the Social Safety Net. Advisory services to the Ministry of
Welfare, Labor and Health is required to carry out four key tasks resulting from the implementation
of the economic reform program: (i) developing social assistance offices; training the personnel of
these offices to monitor poverty, acquiring skills to undertake proper means testing and to properly
screen candidates for social assistance; and developing the methods for financing the local social
assistance offices; (ii) conducting an extensive study, based on a household survey, aimed at defining
a new, parsimonious poverty line methodologically compatible with international standards; and
estimating a poverty gap and identifying ways to fill the gap; (iii) developing employment offices
which will be able to implement active labor market policies, particularly training; developing
financing mechanisms for these offices, and identifying informational and financial flows between
republican, regional and local offices; and (v) providing advisory assistance in the field of social
security operations and the administrative requirements for managing social security funds, and
identifying the requirements for switching from an employer-funded scheme to an equal shares
contributory scheme.
