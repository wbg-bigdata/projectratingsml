BURKINA FASO
SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1    Burkina Faso is a landlocked country, with its southern border more than 600 km from West
African ports. Covering an area of 274,000 square kilometers, Burkina Faso lies entirely in the Sudano-
Sahelian agroecological zone. With a GDP per capita of US$230 in 1995, Burkina ranks among the
world's poorest nations. Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy: it employs an estimated 80
percent of the population, generates more than 50 percent of the export earnings and contributes about 35
percent of GDP. Agriculture's share of GDP has, however, been gradually declining; for instance, in
1965 it was 53 percent. There is significant potential for agricultural growth in the range of
agroecologies that support specialization in different crops and farming systems. The Government has
realized the critical role of agriculture for the country's economic growth, food security and employment.
1.2   The population, estimated at 10 million in 1994, is growing at the rate of 2.8 percent per year.
The population density on arable land is high, and most rural people are engaged in low-input, low-
output agriculture on which their livelihood depends. The recently prepared Poverty Profile shows that
the incidence of poverty is highest among agricultural households. Thus, improving performance of the
agricultural sector is critical not only to fostering economic growth, but also to alleviating poverty.
1.3    Although Burkina Faso's agriculture has performed well during the past few years, its continuous
improvement will be crucial and substantial investment will be needed to meet this challenge. In 1989 the
Government requested IDA assistance in preparing an agricultural sector adjustment program to
modernize and diversify agricultural production, promote food security at the national, provincial, and
household levels, and improve natural resource management. Serious natural resource and environmental
problems led the Government to prepare a project on natural resource management, the Environmental
Management Project, which is supported by an IDA credit (Cr. 2229-BUR, 1991). It was followed by an
agricultural sector adjustment credit and several investment operations (para 2.30). The proposed Second
National Agricultural Services Development Project, which would be based on the work started under
two earlier projects (the Agricultural Research Project and Agricultural Services Project), would benefit
from the policy changes effected under the agricultural sector adjustment program and the projects
supporting it.
II. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Background
2.1    Past performance. Despite difficult agroclimatic conditions, the growth of the agricultural
sector has been quite satisfactory in the latter part of the 1980s. The longer-term trend (1965 - 86) shows
a growth rate of 2.6 percent/year, which however was below the population growth rate of 2.8 percent.
Agricultural production markedly deteriorated in the 1970s, when the annual growth rate was 1.3
percent, but between 1984 and 1989, agriculture grew at an average annual rate of more than 5 percent.
Favorable rainfall in some recent years (despite irregularities in interseasonal distribution) has allowed



2
Burkina Faso to produce record crops, particularly in cereals. Rainfall variations are reflected in highly
variable growth rates between 1983 and 1994. Subsectoral growth (1983-8) and the trends in production
from 1989 to 1995 are summarized in Table 1.
Table I
Real growth rates in the primary sector in selected periods (in percent)
1983-87  1988    1989    1990    1991   1992  1993 1994 1995
Agriculture (crops)   7.3    28.4    -4.2    -10.8    38.0   0.7   3.6  -0.4  8.5
Livestock           3.6       2.4      2.5      2.4      2.4   2.5   2.4  2.5  2.5
Forestry and Fishing   2.7    1.8      5.1      6.1      3.0   4.9   5.1  4.9  5.2
Agriculture in total   5.6  18.8    -1.8      - 6.0    21.4   1.5   3.6  0.8  7.0
2.2    Agroecological conditions. The country can be divided into four agroecological zones on the
basis of climate, soils and socioeconomic factors: Sahel, Central Plateau, Southwest and East. The Sahel
in the north is the driest region; its rainy season lasts two to three months a year, and average rainfall
varies from less than 400 mm to 600 mm. The dominant activity is livestock rearing. The Central
Plateau is the most densely populated zone. Average rainfall varies between 600 mm and 900 mm.
Environmental degradation is a major concern in this zone. Although economic activities are
concentrated on food production, the Central Plateau has experienced recurrent food deficits except in
years of exceptionally high and well distributed rainfall. The Southwest zone, where average rainfall
ranges from 800 mm to more than 1,200 mm, has the best agricultural potential. In an average year, it
not only supplies its own needs for food crops but can also devote 15 percent to 30 percent of the
cultivated area to cash crops, mainly cotton. Livestock activities are important for both the sedentary
farmers (for animal draft power and income from animal sales) and transhumant herders. The Eastern
Savanna is the least developed, and the least environmentally degraded area of the country. Average
raminfall there ranges from 600 mm to 900 mm.
2.3    Use of arable land. Of the 9 million hectares of arable land, about 3.7 million hectares are
cultivated each year. The average farm size is 4 hectares. Family size is the main determinant of farm
size, because most work is done with handtools and little hired labor is used. Only about one fourth of
the farns own draft animals or have equipment to use them. These are concentrated mainly in the cotton
areas. Use of tractors or power tillers is negligible.
2.4    The major crops, covering 84 percent of the crop area, are: coarse-grain cereals (sorghum, millet
and maize); other food crops, including rice (4 percent); and cash crops, mainly groundnuts, cowpea and
cotton (12 percent). Most of the sugar cane is grown in a single estate in the Southwest on a few hundred
hectares. As noted, agriculture can meet the country's need for staple food only in good rainfall years;
increasing quantities of rice have been imported since the late 1970s. Maize is the cereal that has the
best potential for increased production. Although cotton covers only 5 percent of the cultivated area, it
plays a major role in the economy, accounting for about one half of the total export revenues and
providing an important source of funds for the households in the areas where it is grown. Cotton area
and production increased steadily from 1968 to 1991, when a record production level of 190,000 tons of
seed cotton was reached. Unfavorable world market prices, overvaluation of CFAF and inadequate
credit and marketing services caused a downturn in production between 1991 and 1994. The devaluation
of CFAF in 1994 has provided farmers with better incentives to grow more cotton (its production in
1995 grew by 5.5 percent, but the estimation for 1996 is 36 percent) and other export crops, such as
green beans grown in valley bottom lands in the beginning of the dry season, and Karit6 (Butyrospermum



3
parkii), also known as sheatree. The latter, which has been grown for centuries on farmers' fields,
provides valuable income for women, who extract butter from its nuts. Livestock, which accounts for
more than 10 percent of total export earnings, is the second most important item of agricultural exports
(mainly to the coastal countries). Fruits and vegetables have good development potential and are
increasingly important for nutrition. They are presently grown in small areas only.
2.5    Sector constraints. Although the potential for accelerated growth in agriculture remains
satisfactory, there also are problems. The growth of the sector is constrained particularly by five
physical factors: inadequate and uneven rainfall, low quality of soils, population pressure on land,
scarcity of groundwater resources, and imbalance between demand for fuelwood and the growth capacity
of vegetation. Other problems include the traditional system of land tenure, inadequate marketing
outlets, smallholders' weak purchasing power and the high cost of inputs, illiteracy, the traditional
undervaluation of women's work and the difficulty women have in getting agricultural services.
Additionally, less than 15 percent of smallholders have adopted new technology, and extension and
research linkages are inadequate. In the long run, the sustainability of the sector depends mostly on
increasing the productivity of smallholders rather than expanding the cultivated area.
2.6    Rainfall is low and irregular. The rainy season is short, lasting two to four months (depending
on the part of the country). The coefficient for annual rainfall variation, increasing from south to north,
ranges from 20 percent to 30 percent. Crop farming and pasture management are hazardous due to the
large variation in intraseasonal rainfall distribution. In these conditions, risk management is key to
farming and herding. Farmers, therefore, try to reduce risk by extending the cultivated area for crops and
feeding area for cattle rather than by intensifying their use of land. Moreover, average rainfall has been
declining since the early 1970s. Although there is no scientific evidence that this decline is a permanent
trend rather than a cyclical phenomenon, a comparison of the isohyets shows that they have moved south
about 200 kilometers between the 1950 - 1967 period and the 1968 - 1987 period. As a result, farmers
and herders have become even more risk averse and less disposed to adopting high-input or labor-
intensive technologies.
2.7    The soils in Burkina Faso are generally poor, and the structure is seriously depleted. In the
Central Plateau, the reduced vegetation cover has allowed the soils to become exposed to water erosion
(from runoff in the rainy season) and to wind erosion during the dry season. In addition, the soils
throughout the country are deficient in phosphorus. Because the use of fallow periods for soil recovery
is fast disappearing and because very little chemical fertilizer is used (less than 5 nutrient kg per hectare
annually), the soils are being rapidly mined.
2.8    Population pressure on good land is severe. Of the total area of about 27 million hectares, only
9 million hectares are arable--less than one hectare per person. This is too low for adequate agricultural
production, given the low-input technologies used. The pressure on land is most severe on the Central
Plateau, where about one half of the entire population lives. The average population density is about 60
persons per square kilometer, and as high as 100 persons per square kilometer in some areas. In this part
of the country, the practice of fallowing has almost completely disappeared. Because the population has
exceeded the carrying capacity of the land, spontaneous migration to the Southwest has taken place since
the 1980s. There, the population density had been much lower because of onchocerciasis (river
blindness), a disease that has now been eradicated by concerted international action. However, the newly
I/ About 65 percent of the country lies between the 500 and 800 isohyets.



4
settled areas are now in a danger of being degraded because of improper cropping and deforestation
practices.
2.9    Both surface and subsurface water resources are scarce. Irrigation is little developed; although
the irrigated surface has doubled since 1982, it still accounts for only I percent of total cultivated area.
The river systems have a short flooding period and become dry soon after the rains stop. Surface water
resources, including permanent and temporary watercourses, are difficult to tap because of the country's
flat topography. To have year-round surface-water irrigation under these conditions would require large
water reservoirs and thus large investments. There is also evidence that the underground water table is
falling as a result of lesser infiltration and higher runoff induced by deforestation. Fetching of water is
becoming increasingly time-consuming--this chore usually falls on women and children--taking a large
share of time from other agricultural activities.
2.10   There is a severe imbalance between the demand for wood and the regenerative capacity of the
vegetation. About 96 percent of all energy used by households, including urban households, is derived
from fuelwood collected from the dwindling forests and bush fallow. The imbalance is so severe that
farmers are forced to burn crop residues and cattle dung instead of recycling them to maintain soil
fertility.
2.11   Livestock sector. The most important constraints to the sedentary crop-livestock farmers is the
poor quality feed, especially in the dry season. For the pastoralists in the transhumant system, the
encroachment of cropping into formerly critical dry-season grazing areas undermines the entire
sustainability of the transhumant pastoralist system. Diseases and lack of financial management
experience of the commercial producers are major impediments to intensive pigs and poultry production.
In livestock research, the socio-economic effect of the technologies being developed has not been
assessed. In livestock extension, front-line staff suffers from lack of training in livestock technology and
appropriate tools to demonstrate such improved. The current system is not adequately equipped to supply
the specialized information needs of the pastoral and commercial sectors. For the veterinary services,
inadequate sanitary control and poor diagnostic support facilities, and for the private veterinarians the
lack of enabling environment are key constraints. The project would address these constraints.
B. Agricultural Organizations and Agencies
2.12   Agricultural research. The Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific
Research (MESSRS) oversees research activities, but guidance, coordination, planning, monitoring and
evaluation of research activities are provided by the National Center for Scientific and Technological
Research (CRNST) and its Board of Governors. The actual research work is carried out by several
specialized research institutes. Among them, the Agricultural Research Institute (INERA) and the
Research Institute for Tropical Biology and Ecology (IRBET) are responsible for research in the
agricultural sector. The forestry program of ex-IRBET has been merged into INERA to form a new
institute, the Institut National de l'Environnement et des Rescherches Agricoles (INERA). The new
institute will collaborate with the Research Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology (IRSAT)
which is also based on two earlier institutes. 2Two of IRSAT's research programs, agroprocessing and
agricultural mechanization, are of interest to the present project. INERA has five research centers for the
2/ They are the Institut Burkinabe de l'Energie (IBE), the Laboratoire de biochimie et technologie
alimentaire (LBTA), and some of the old INERA's research programs (such as agricultural
engineering.



S
research work and one that provides training to researchers in addition to research it carries out in
support of the region's agriculture. Smaller field stations are linked with these centers. IRSATs
organizational and physical structure would be developed under the Second National Agricultural
Services Development Project (NASDP II).
2.13   Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal
Resources (AGRI-RA) has been in charge of the sectoral policy and overall development of the
agricultural sector since 1986, when the water and rural affairs were divided into two ministries. Matters
relating to cooperatives and other rural institutions were later transferred back to AGRI-RA. AGRI-RA
has 12 Directorates, most of which will be involved in the implementation of NASDP II. The primary
Directorates benefiting from the project would be the Directorate for Studies and Planning (DEP), in
charge of studies, planning, monitoring and evaluation of projects and agricultural statistics; the
Directorate of Agricultural Extension (DVA), responsible for extension dealing with crops, livestock and
the transformation of agricultural products the Directorates of Animal Industries (DPIA), responsible for
both the modern and traditional (pastoral) livestock sector; the Directorate for Veterinary Services
(DSV), dealing with the animal health delivery including the public health aspects of animal products;
and the Directorate for Promoting Cooperatives and Rural Legislation.
2.14   AGRI-RA is the main institution for planning agricultural and livestock production, providing
extension services to crop farmers and livestock producers; training agricultural and livestock
technicians; and carrying out adaptive research in the PAPEMs (Points d'Appui de Prevulgarisation et
d'Experimentation Multi-locale) planned by and implemented in collaboration with researchers of
INERA (Institut de l'Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles). Input distribution (including
improved seed, veterinary drugs and supplies, and agricultural chemicals) and the distribution of credit
also have been AGRI-RA's responsibilities. However, these two activities have recently been suspended.
These support services have been provided in practice by AGRI-RA's 12 Centres Regionaux de
Promotion Agro-Pastorale (CRPA), established in 1988 as successors to regional rural development
authorities (Organismes Regionaux de Developpement, ORD). The main activities of the CRPAs have
involved extension, monitoring, evaluation, support services and rural works. More recently, they have
also advised on the promotion of farmer institutions. CRPAs have provided their centralized services to
the three specialized units of the Ministry in each of the 30 Provinces (Service Provincial de
l'Agriculture--SPA; Service Provincial des Ressources Animales--SPRA; Service Provincial de
l'Organisation et de la Formation Professionnelle des Producteurs--SPOFPP). The level below the
provinces is the zones, where the village level agents also have their postings. Since AGRI-RA's
reorganization in 1997, the CRPAs have been replaced by the "Directions Regionales de l'Agriculture et
des Ressources Animales" (DRARAs). They are public agencies with no commercial operations, which
concentrate on the public services previously performed by the CRPAs (para 2.17).
2.15   Livestock Sector. AGRI-RA has overall responsibility for the development of the livestock
sector. At the national level, it has carried out this responsibility through: (a) the Directorate for Animal
Production and Livestock Industries (DPIA), which is responsible for livestock extension and the
promotion of the modem production systems; (b) the Directorate of Animal Health (DSA), responsible
for veterinary protection and quality control of food of animal origin; and (c) the Directorate of
Traditional Livestock Production (DOET), responsible for herder organizations, including the
development of special "pastoral zones." All three Directorates contribute to the training of the field
extension agents. In addition, there are a number of semiautonomous institutions in the sector. The
National Livestock Laboratory (LNE) and the National Distributor of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals
(ONAVET, to be privatized soon) are the most important of them. In the 1997 reorganization of AGRI-



6
RA, the Service of Pastoral Area Promotion (SAEP) has replaced DOET and integrated with DPIA. The
Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) has replaced DSA.
2.16   At the regional level, livestock services are integrated with a Provincial Service (SPRA) which
implements the animal health programs and trains the extension agents at zone and village levels. These
three Directorates and agencies in the field involved in animal health and livestock extension have a total
staff of about 40 veterinarians, 70 livestock technicians and 250 field agents. This gives a ratio of about
one professional per 75,000 TLU (Tropical Livestock Unit), and 30,000 TLU per middle level staff,
which is not excessive. Since 1991, when recruitment by the public sector stopped, an active private
veterinary sector has developed. More than 50 veterinarians now operate privately (more than the
number of veterinarians employed in the public sector), covering a substantial part of the Burkina
livestock population.
2.17   Reorganization of AGRI-RA. During the process of preparing the Second National Agricultural
Adjustment Program (PASA II), an extensive plan to reorganize AGRI-RA has also been promoted.
With assistance from FAO, the Government has advanced, through a thorough process of planning and
participation by concerned and interested parties, to a level where implementation of the new organigram
and setting in place the other necessary changes were started in the beginning of 1997. The objectives of
the reorganizations program are to: (a) assure greater efficiency of the public sector activities in the
sector; (b) increase autonomy and improve professionalism of the economically-oriented farmer
organizations and facilitate their participation in the planning and evaluation of public services; and (c)
provide an enabling environment for the private sector to contribute to agricultural development more
than hitherto. The measures to achieve these objectives are several, including introduction of a new
organigram, detailed job descriptions and decentralization of staff and functions; reduction of staff in the
ministry (para 4.4); liquidation of the loss-making commercial activities of the CRPAs and providing
only purely public services through these regional bodies; and promotion of farmer organizations and
encouraging them to take over some of the activities earlier performed by CRPAs.
2.18   Farmer organizations. There are more than 10,000 registered farmer organizations and groups
(250 cooperatives and 10,627 precooperatives), in addition to groups that have been formed informally,
for example, for agricultural extension and other purposes. However, the horizontal and vertical
structures of farner organizations, common in more developed countries, have yet to be developed.
Over the years, farmer organizations and groups have been formed following different promotion and
investment programs supported by the Government, international assistance agencies and local and
international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To facilitate centralized services and broader than
local-level representation, some of these initiatives have led to the development of a vertical organization
for some cooperative and other farmer organizations and to some expansion of the horizontal network of
groups supported by the various initiatives. Examples of the national and provincial organizations are
the Federation of Naam groups, Cooperative Union for Vegetable Growers (UCOBAM) and Federation
Wendyam. However, these organizations and groups may not reflect real indigenous membership
dynamism, but rather the policies and programs of external forces or groups with religious and political
aspirations.
2.19   Nevertheless, although still relatively fragmented and uneven, the network of cooperatives and
other farmer groups forms a basis on which genuine participatory development can be built. The
Government has declared a policy of disengagement of the state from cooperative management and
control, and empowerment of the producers as one of its main tenets of agricultural development. This
policy is expected to be the cornerstone of the Government's approach and a condition of the donor
community's support to facilitate accelerated development. This means that the Government and donors



7
would: (a) help create a regulatory environment (including suitable laws and regulations) that promote
self-help activities; and (b) would supply the new or growing organizations with what they need for
successful expansion. The assistance to be provided under this project (para 4.16) is based on this
policy.
2.20   Liaisons. The Ministries implementing the project (AGRI-RA and MESSRS) plan to maintain
liaison with several other ministries to coordinate the project activities with other operations taking place
in the rural sector. The ministries involved are the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Economy,
Finance and Planning, Ministry of Water Resources, and Ministry of Basic Education and Mass Literacy.
2.21   Numerous other agencies are concerned with agricultural production, including the Societ6 des
Fibres et des Textiles (SOFITEX) for cotton, the Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole (CNCA) for
medium-term credit, the S6cretariat Permanent de Coordination de la Politique Cerealiere for cereal
production and the Secretariat Permanent de Coordination de la Politique de la Developpement de
l'Elevage for livestock. The Secretariat Permanent de Coordination du PASA (Programme
d'Adjustement du Secteur Agricole) would monitor the proposed reorganization of AGRI-RA (see para
4.18).
C. Development and Agricultural Policies and Sector Development Strategy
2.22   Development and agricultural sector policies and objectives. Agriculture is the mainstay of
the economy. Since the early 1 980s, the Government has followed a policy of agricultural development
that aims at achieving food security, improving the incomes of the rural population, and protecting the
environment. In 1985 the country endorsed the goals of intensification and diversification of agricultural
production and improved management of natural resources and the performance of agricultural research.
These goals were followed up by special programs for agricultural extension, research and community-
based land management (Gestion des Terroirs).
2.23   Beginning in 1985, the development strategies for agricultural research were implemented on the
basis of a policy paper titled "Lignes Directrices d'Organisation et d'Administration Strategique de
Recherches Agricoles." It emphasized agricultural research on farming systems; soil and water
management; and production of traditional cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, rice and cotton, as well as
animal husbandry. Among the achievements during this period were: development and adaptation of
improved and disease-resistant crop varieties and preparation of appropriate technical programs for
growing of them; improved knowledge of the physical environment and identification of improved water
management techniques; development of appropriate farming tools and postharvest processing
equipment; studies on farm budgets and production constraints; development of techniques for
multiplication of tree plants; creation of an ethno-botanical data bank; and quantification of natural
pastures and development of improved rations for intensive sheep production for small holders.
2.24  In 1991 the Government adopted a Structural Adjustment Program to improve the
competitiveness of the economy and establish a basis for sustainable development. The actions under
this program concerned the fiscal policy, scope of the public sector, reform of the banking sector, reform
of tariffs and trade policies and liberalization of prices. Realizing the priority that had to be accorded to
the agricultural sector in the new development approach, the Government had prepared already in 1992 a
special adjustment program for this sector and obtained for its implementation an adjustment credit from
IDA and financial assistance from other development partners (para 1.3). The policy paper approved at



8
that time3 emphasizes three objectives for the agriculture sector: (a) modernizing and diversifying
agricultural production; (b) strengthening food security; and (c) improving natural resources
management. Three strategies were adopted to attain these objectives: (a) further intensification of
production and improved management of natural resources; (b) liberalization of marketing and prices;
and (c) restructuring the institutional environment through: (i) redefining of the role of the state,
including the disengagement of the state from functions that can be done by other sectors of society; (ii)
identifying the operators for rural and agricultural financing; and (iii) providing farmers' socioeconomic
organizations with an expanded role; (d) making more effective use of the public finances; and (e)
consolidating the policy and strategies of food security for the nation.
2.25   At present, the policies of the Government for the agronastoral sector are set forth in separate
documents on agricultural research, extension, organization and staff training, land ownership and
natural resources, and equipment and infrastructure. In addition, the Government is planning to
reorganize the agricultural services in line with the strategies expressed in the policy documents.
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), farmer organizations and private entrepreneurs are expected to
take over selected activities that have hitherto been carried out by the state. Such a reorganization would
be gradual to ensure that those assuming the new functions are capable of doing so. (The intention of the
Government to follow the restructuring policies has been expressed in a "letter of intention" sent to the
World Bank. However, in the project preparation report the Government has suggested that the farmer
organizations restructure themselves into stronger units to take over the functions of the Government
agencies. Thus, farmer organizations must demonstrate that they are capable of providing the needed
services).
2.26   The development strategies also emphasize that increased productivity shall be based on
smallholder production and promotion of smallholders' participation in development activities. In
addition, durable agricultural development requires diversified interventions and concentration on local-
level development, which can happen only if administrative structures and responsibilities are
sufficiently decentralized.
2.27   In 1995 the Government approved a new strategy paper ("Plan Strategique de Recherches
Agricoles"-- PSRA) to guide agricultural research. The new strategy covers the planning, programming
and coordination of all agricultural research carried out by different research institutions, technical
ministries, projects and NGOs in Burkina Faso. Its principal objectives and strategies are to: (a) achieve
food self-sufficiency and food security, particularly through increases in agropastoral and forestry
products; (b) improve the income and welfare of smallholders through intensification and diversification
of agricultural production; and (c) conserve and restore natural resources through better policies and soil
management practices. In addition, specific objectives in the environment sector, aim at controlling the
pressure on natural resources, protecting biodiversity and initiating the process of reaching sustainability
in the use of renewable resources.
2.28   Bank Group Assistance Strategy. In its Letter of Intent for Sustainable Human Development
in October 1995, the Government set out its vision of socio-economic development, declaring poverty
alleviation as its long-term goal and focusing on achieving monitorable progress in three objectives, viz.:
(a) increasing income opportunities and productive capacity; (b) developing the social sector through a
more efficient use and better targeting of public expenditure, especially for poor and women; and (c)
strengthening the role of the private sector. Subsequently, the Bank started preparing a new Country
/ La lettre de Politique de Developpement Agricole (LPDA).



9
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was presented to Board in July 1996. The preparation process was
marked by a participatory policy dialogue between the Bank and Burkina Faso and resulted in a broad
commonality of views on the necessity to tackle poverty alleviation much more ambitiously than in the
past. The Bank Group's assistance strategy is focused on supporting the Government's goals of: (a)
maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment in which equitable growth will lead to poverty
reduction; (b) expanding the provision of social services to the poorest regions, particularly in health and
education; and (c) improving productive opportunities to raise incomes and employment. To support
these objectives, the strategy will strive to continuing structural reforms in agriculture, liberalizing the
gold sector, completing the banking sector reforms, and improving public sector management. IDA
assistance will be increasingly directed to non-lending services to improve targeting of public
expenditures and identification of sources of growth. The bulk of IDA's financial assistance in the three
coming years would concentrate on social sectors (education and health), and on creating and supporting
a more favorable environment in which growth opportunities can be realized (agriculture, natural
resources management, mining, water and infrastructure).
2.29   In its support to Burkina Faso's agriculture sector, the Bank Group intends to help the
Government implement policy changes to further liberalize the sector, improve delivery of public
services and develop a gender-sensitive extension program. In addition, through intensified economic
dialogue and collaboration with other donors, the Bank Group will help find sustainable sources of
growth for the sector and resources to finance their exploitation. Under this strategy, the Bank Group
anticipates financing a second Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC II). It would support the
completion of the reforms started earlier to liberalize the sector (on rice, sugar, cotton, trade and
domestic prices) and reforms in the public sector (public divestiture, public investment program and
restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture). Regarding the restructuring of AGRI-RA, there is a strong
linkage between ASAC 11 and the Second National Agricultural Services Development Project (NASDP
II--the object of this report).4 While the process of restructuring would be included in ASAC 11, it would
be followed through with the assistance provided under NASDP 11, which has a special component for
the purpose (para 4.16). The Bank Group also plans to support long-term agricultural growth and to
explore new growth opportunities by starting to prepare, in close collaboration with the Government and
donor agencies, an Agricultural Sector Growth Strategy.
D. IDA-Financed Agricultural Projects and Lessons Learned
2.30   In the first part of the 1990s the World Bank Group financed the following projects in Burkina
Faso's agricultural and environment sector: Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1896-BUR), Agricultural
Services Project (Cr. 1979-BUR), Environmental Management Project (Cr. 2229-BUR) and Food
Security and Nutrition Project (Cr. 2414-BUR). The first two projects will close at the end of 1996 and
1997, respectively. The total IDA financing for these projects is US$83.9 million. In addition, IDA has
financed an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2381-BUR) of US$28 million.
4 / Another project that would benefit from the liberalization efforts and is complementing NASDP 11 is the
proposed Private Irrigation Project for smallholders, to be appraised in FY 1997.
5/ Along with the IDA-financed programs, several other donors support agricultural and rural development
projects. The most important programs are supported by the French, Dutch, German and Danish bi-lateral
agencies and by European Union, IFAD and ADB. The projects supported by them are typically area-specific,
integrated rural development projects, with only a relatively small part of the financing directed to agricultural
extension. Some of these projects are implemented by Government agencies, others by separate implementation



10
2.31   Although major results have been achieved, agricultural research has had limited impact
because of: (a) the lack of a participatory approach for research design and testing; (b) the weak linkage
with extension and end-users; (c) the inadequate attention paid to some important subsectors and to
postharvest techniques; and (d) some organizational and management issues relating to INERA's
responsibilities and decision-making powers affecting implementation of the agricultural research
project. As for extension, actions plans have been improving, but several concerns mentioned by the
1992 midterm review remain: (a) weak linkages between research and extension, along with a inadequate
participatory diagnosis; (b) insufficient supervision and technical back-up of the front-line extension
workers by the project's high-level staff; (c) a tendency to institutional over-staffing coupled with
insufficient presence in the field; (d) delays in implementing impact studies; and (e) weak financial
transparency and budgetary control at the decentralized level (CRPAs). An action plan is now being
implemented to address these concerns; it would be pursued further under the proposed project.
2.32   In December 1994, OED issued a report on lessons and practices conceming agricultural
extension on the basis of experience from Bank-funded projects throughout the world. It identified the
following critical points, which apply well to phase I and are being taken into account in the follow-on
project: (a) limited state fiscal capacity and commitment; (b) specific requirements of different groups
of potential clients; (c) need to adapt the methods of technology transfer to the specific characteristics of
beneficiaries and production systems; (d) analysis of existing and potential stock of adapted technologies
by type of production system; (e) prioritization of extension activities by client groups and region,
according to the available technology; (f) importance of gender issues in the effectiveness of technology
transfer; (g) potential usefulness of mass media and information technology; (h) importance of
participatory diagnoses and linkages with research; and (i) importance of using the potential of private
agencies or organizations to provide extension services.
2.33   To study the situation in Burkina Faso, two detailed evaluations of the perforrnance and impact
of extension services have been carried out by independent consultants in 1991 and 1995. The first
evaluation took place one year after the country had adopted the T&V system. It showed that (a) contact
group members had yields that were 20 percent to 30 percent higher than in the control group; (b)
farmers who were not official contact farmers also participated in demonstration meetings; (c) 46
percent of the sample farmers rated the extension messages as highly applicable, while another 53
percent rated them as applicable; (d) 20 percent of contact group members and 8 percent of all farmers
mentioned that they were involved in on-farm research. However, this study also uncovered areas where
improvements were needed. About 70 percent of contact group members desired that more messages
focus on animal health and production, 70 percent of members expressed a need for more messages that
relate to organic matter, anti-erosion methods and water management and 47 percent of them wanted
more messages for horticulture. The second study, beneficiar,y assessment carried out in 1995,
confirmed in general that the contact farmers are in general satisfied with the extension services offered.
The farmers were forceful, however, in their insistence that the agricultural research and extension need
units as self-standing projects, but, in general, they follow the approved Government policies in regard to rural
development or agricultural extension.
In the area of agricultural research, the most active donors are the Dutch Cooperation (CFAF 226 million in the
next three years) and the European Community (CFAF 196 million in the next two years). Sofitex provides
INERA with FCFA 100 million a year over a longer period, mainly for cotton research. Researchers also have
an access to small individual funds that can complement, in a flexible manner, the operating expenses
budgeted under the IDA Credit.



11
to be directed more to diversification of messages and making them fully relevant to their requirements
and constraints.
2.34  In addition, the following "best-practice" documents from other countries have been reviewed
and their lessons considered during project appraisal: The World Bank: Agricultural Extension in Africa
Discussion Paper AFT Series No. 231, 1994; The World Bank: Agricultural Research in an Era of
Adjustment Policies, Institutions and Progress. EDI Seminar Series, 1995; and The World Bank:
Implementation Completion Report on Kenya National Agricultural Research Project, 1995.
III. AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SYSTEM
3.1    Agricultural Technology Support System. The main institutions involved in agricultural
technology development in Burkina Faso are the Agricultural Research Institute (INERA) (including the
Tropical Agricultural and Foodcrops Research Institute, IRBET, merged with INERA in 1997), universities
and the network of Pre-extension Experimentation Stations (PAPEMs). INERA and the new IRSAT have
a critical role in applied research, benefiting from the basic research done by the international research
institutes, advanced research agencies in developed countries and, to a limited extent, the universities. For
purposes of farming system research and coordination, the country is divided into five agro-ecological
zones, each serviced by one of INERA's Regional Stations that have responsibility for zone-specific
adaptive research and, to a certain extent, for conveying the findings to the extension and farming
community. Within each zone the PAPEMs conduct adaptive research and help disseminate research
results to smallholder farmers. PAPEMs are not directly linked to INERA but are part of the agricultural
extension structure. However, collaboration between the PAPEMs and the research stations is active.
3.2    Thus, there are several tiers of technology development and dissemination: (a) on-farm applied
research (OFR) using the farming systems teams of INERA's regional stations; (b) on-farm adaptive
research (OFAR) by the PAPEMs and other state-level agencies; and (c) technology dissemination through
the unified extension system using the Training and Visit (T&V) methodology of extension management.
3.3    On-Farm Applied Research (Researcher-managed Adaptive Research). Applied research is
conducted by the farming system research and natural resource management teams of INERA's regional
research stations to develop appropriate technologies. This type of research involves researcher-managed
experiments to develop new and improved technologies under various agro-ecological conditions. The
purpose for research and extension teams is to learn how farmers react to introduced changes, to what
extent the introductions are accepted, modified, or rejected, and why farmers respond to new technologies
the way they do. Specific experiments are carried out at research farms, PAPEM farms or on farmers'
fields with as much control of the variables as possible. Combining the understanding of the farming
systems practiced by farmers, the background information on technology development and interaction with
farmers, the researcher teams propose improvements to increase the productivity and profitability of the
farming systems.
3.4    On-Farm Adaptive Research (OFAR). OFAR serves as the bridge between the development and
extension of new technologies. It is used by the extension system and its Regional Centres for Agro-
pastoral Promotion (CRPAs) as the first stage in the technology dissemination process. The technologies
generated from the OFAR recommendations are further tested. Farmers fully participate in these tests, so
that they can adapt them to specific farming situations based on farmers' resource base, technical abilities,
cropping and livestock patterns and farm/household conditions. The OFAR methodology ensures the
acceleration of the adoption of proven technologies; at the same time, it helps to better prepare extension



12
staff on technologies they promote during the mass diffusion stage. It entails more work on farmers' fields,
generally utilizing less expensive staff. It also requires increased expenditures in vehicle purchase and
maintenance, field equipment, elementary agricultural mechanization, multiplication of improved planting,
livestock and fisheries materials as well as simple tools for the trials, daily allowances and incentives. Due
to resource constraints, most of the CRPAs (presently DRARAs) are yet to implement the OFAR approach.
3.5    Technology Dissemination. The dissemination of most agricultural technologies to small-scale
farmers takes place through the Training and Visit System (T&V). It is the responsibility of the DRARAs
under the reorganized and unified extension service. The entire country is currently using the T&V
extension management system, with about 1,000 Base Extension Agents (CAPs) working at the village
levels with CAP-to-farmer ratios typically ranging between 1:800 and 1: 1,200. In each zone of the
DRARA, extension staff have delineated the farming areas into contiguous operational units (circles).
Within these circles, the extension agent works with selected groups of farmers. These farmers are the
"'official" contact group representing the rest of the farmers in the community. The contact groups also
provide the upward linkage from farmers to extension and research. The CAPs, supervised by 145 Zonal
Extension Supervisors, visit the contact groups and other farmers in the sub-circle at regular fortnightly
intervals. During the visits, the CAPs teach the farmers a maximum of three to four carefully chosen
production recommendations that they have learned at Fortnightly Training Sessions (FNTSs). Thus,
under the unified extension approach, a single field-level extension agent, supervised by a zonal officer and
backed by 150 Technical Specialists (TSs) specialized in subject matters typical for the region, is the
farmers' principal contact for the dissemination of all agricultural technologies. There is a team of 4 to 6
TSs in each Province.
3.6    The placement of TSs within the DRARAs helps bridge the gap between the generation of
technologies by researchers and the broad-scale diffusion of improved technologies by extension staff.
The TSs are specialists in such fields as agronomy, agroforestry, plant protection, livestock, farm
management, fisheries, water management and farm implements (agricultural mechanization). Because
the CAPs are generalists, TSs are more cost-effective, if used for training CAPs, than if they were used
as individual specialists working at the farmer level. Unification of extension is of critical importance
given that, in a large majority of farms, livestock, agro-forestry and crop production and processing are
integrated into a single farming system at the farm level. Exceptions are the nomadic pastoral and the
intensive peri-urban livestock production systems which have specialized information needs. In
addition, the front-line staff of the livestock service handles still a combination of control and advisory
functions. It appears that the control functions take a large portion of the staff's time, thus interfering
with the relationship of trust that needs to exist between the extension agent and his client farmers.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale, Objectives and Strategy
4.1    Rationale for IDA involvement. The proposed four-year project would continue the financial
support started by the Bank Group under the National Agricultural Research Project and the National
Agricultural Extension Project. In the field of research, the Bank is committed to support the Framework
for Action (FFA) of SPAAR (Special Program for African Agricultural Research). At the 15th SPAAR
Conference (March 1995), Burkina Faso was identified as part of the next round of FFA implementation.
The Bank is also committed to long-term support of integrated agricultural services in sub-Saharan
Africa. The proposed credit represents the second phase of support for these commitments in Burkina
Faso. The project is consistent with the national strategy for agricultural development, in particular with



13
the LPDA, and with the Country Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso. Approved in July 1996, the CAS
stresses the need for prudent management of natural resources, explicitly supports the continuation of the
ongoing research, agricultural services and natural resource management programs, and includes
Agricultural Services II in the lending program. The CAS also emphasizes that the incidence of poverty,
being highest in the agricultural sector, can only be reduced through efforts to create sustained growth in
this sector (para 2.28).
4.2    Objectives. In coordination with the institutional reforms to be undertaken in the context of the
proposed Second Agriculture SECAL, this project would seek to reduce rural poverty by helping
increase smallholder production through provision of essential services and strengthening the link
between agricultural research and extension. The project aims to: (a) support long-term agricultural
production by maintaining an agricultural research system and reorganizing it to better meet farmers' needs,
including postharvest activities, placing greater emphasis on protection of the environment and integrating
research more closely into the regional and internationalnetworks; (b) increase agricultural and livestock
productivity and farmers' revenues through improved agricultural extension services and empowering
rural women, whose role is critical in agricultural production, food processing and nutrition; (c) improve
natural resource management and promote sustainable production systems; (d) help the Government
implement an improved animal health system, largely based on private veterinary services; (e) promote
and empower, on a pilot basis, representative farmers' organizations that would (i) develop their know-
how in providing services and increase their bargaining power in their participation in agricultural policy
making and execution; (ii) help their members to gain confidence and capabilities to embrace technical
change; and (iii) share on-farm work with the public sector in the field of adaptive research and
technology transfer. In addition, the project would support a pilot program to study the feasibility of
financing village-based initiatives ("small rural infrastructures").
4.3    Project strategy. The project would support the Government's strategy of upgrading the rural
development services. Its design has benefited from the lessons learned from experience in neighboring
countries (paras 2.32) and it is in line with the new generation of agricultural services projects supported
by the World Bank in West Africa. Each of the lessons learned in Burkina Faso during the
implementation of the Agricultural Extension Project (PRSAP) and National Agricultural Research
Project (PNRA) has been considered in the project design (Para 2. 33). Farmers opinions expressed in
the evaluation study of 1991 and beneficiary assessment of 1995 will be addressed in this project,
especially as they relate to more diversified extension messages, messages for livestock owners and
water and natural resource management.
4.4   Implementation of NASDP II would coincide with the restructuring of AGRI-RA involved in
direct support to farmers. In AGRI-RA the restructuring process concerns about 4,100 staff, including
1,000 field staff working in the current IDA supported Agricultural Extension Project. After
restructuring, about 3,100 staff would have been deployed in the various organs of the Ministry, with
much higher emphasis on field postings than earlier. After the staff is replaced, there would be an
overall surplus of staff, most of them now employed under contract. This means that nearly all
contractual staff would have to be laid off, even taking retirements into account. The rights of the laid-
off employees would be determined by the law in effect at the time of severance. To enable the
individual staff members to adapt quickly to their new responsibilities, targeted training would be
provided from the start of the project.
4.5    On the side of agricultural research, the project's effectiveness depends largely on the legal and
administrative environment in which the research agencies operate. A new decree organizing CRNST



14
and its institutes has been elaborated to better define the responsibilities between these agencies. The
Council of Ministers approved it before negotiations.
4.6.   Because resources and implementation capacity are limited, agricultural development initially
requires a project approach. However, once the implementation agencies have gained sufficient planning
and institutional capacity to plan and implement the required development investments in a sector,
financing of development needs can also be done by using an investment program approach. Under the
latter approach, the implementation agencies receive funds for mutually agreed purposes (programs)
rather than for investments decided in advance. It is possible that this approach could be used in Burkina
Faso during the project implementation period. Therefore, before midterm, project funds would be used
to prepare a study on the capacity to plan and implement a program approach.
4.7    Project area. The project would cover the whole country, encompassing all five agroecological
zones with wide variations in population, climate, soils and vegetation. The different activities under the
project would be concentrated somewhat differently in the four zones. Whereas agricultural extension
would cover the entire country relatively evenly, much of the livestock component, particularly
assistance to the transhumant herders, would be in the North and East. The research component, with its
regional centers and field stations, would cover the whole country. The pilot component promoting
fanner organizations and small rural infrastructures would probably start in the agriculturally more
advanced areas and then expand to other regions.
B. Summary Description
4.8    The project has five main components:
1. Agricultural research: Ongoing priority research programs would continue to be supported by
the project. In line with the national Agricultural Research Strategic Plan, the project would pay
greater attention to promising new fields of research such as vegetable and food production,
forestry, postharvest technology and appropriate mechanization;
2. Agricultural extension (rainfed and irrigated crops, livestock natural resource management):
The project would help consolidate and expand the national system of extension and adaptive
research and incorporate gender-specific and literacy programs to support the effectiveness of
the extension program;
3. Animal health and pastoralist promotion: the project would help promote privatization of the
animal health subsector, improve the remaining public sector services and contribute to enhanced
development and distribution information to transhumant pastoral producers;
4. Pilot programs: (a) Promotion offarmer organizations: On a pilot basis the project would help
national, regional and local farmer organizations gain professional and financial strength so that
they can provide services to smaliholders and take part in adaptive research, and, potentially,
become able to transfer technologies and know-how to their members. Also, on pilot basis, the
project would finance: (b) a program for small rural infrastructures to study the processes and
feasibility of financing village-level operations intended for communal usage; and
5. Restructuring of agricultural services: In line with the Agriculture SECAL II appraised in June
1996, the project would carry out relevant supporting measures, including possibly setting up a



15
temporary unit in charge of restructuring, carry out detailed studies for the reorganization of
AGRI-RA, and provide training for both redundant and remaining staff.
C. Detailed Project Description
4.9    Agricultural Research (US$18.8 million, including contingencies). 6 Funding for research
activities assumes that the 125 researchers now available would begin or continue the activities
envisaged under the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research. These researchers are located at INERA
and IRSAT. The project would continue to support the ongoing priority programs. In line with the
Strategic Plan, the project would also cover new areas of research such as research on forestry, farm
mechanization and postharvest technologies. Great attention would be paid to the most promising lines
of research, such as vegetable and fruit production. The project would contribute to improving the
relevance of research from the farmers' viewpoint, quality and accountability for results, and logistical
and financial management of CNRST and its specialized institutes, as well as the degree of autonomy for
the latter. The project would particularly focus on participatory technology development with producer
organizations and extension services.
4.10   NASDP II would finance construction of a few additional buildings or rehabilitation of buildings
to complement and consolidate the infrastructure development of the predecessor project, that is, only on
the sites that were part of the first project. They concern the principal the research centers of Kamboinse,
Saria, Farakoba, Dori-Katchari, Di-Tougan, Kouare, and the research station of Niangoloko. The project
would help CNRST recruit or continue to finance 15 contract researchers, 33 technicians and 10
technical or administrative staff. Several of the administrative staff would be needed to implement the
new financial and accounting system developed under the predecessor project. This staff would
progressively become regular CNRST staff, so that by the end of the project, the IDA credit would no
longer finance salaries, except for a few staff directly related to the project. The project would provide
agricultural and scientific equipment and contribute to the funding of research-related direct and indirect
costs, including managerial costs; long- and short-term training; and costs associated with developing
linkages between agricultural research, extension services and producer organizations.
4.11   Agricultural and livestock extension (US$20.3 million). The extension component covers
extension for rainfed and irrigated crops, livestock production, and natural resource management. The
project would help consolidate the national system of extension by improving the capacity for regional
and local diagnoses, to be carried out with full participation of the benefiting farmers; strengthening
linkages between research and extension to ensure the appropriateness and effectiveness of extension to
farmers; continuing training and support to field extension staff, as well as the supervision of the mobile
staff working with the farmers; involving producers in preparing work programs for their advisers and
in the evaluation of their performance; facilitating access to extension services, especially to women;
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system and the accounting and budgetary control systems of
the implementing bodies. To help broaden the competency of village-level agents, those who are
proficient in crop production would be trained in animal husbandry and the livestock and forestry
specialists would be trained in annual crops. The project would provide vehicles and technical
equipment for staff involved in extension and pay for operating and training costs.
6 / The component cost includes neither the regular staff paid by the Government nor the small parallel
operations financed by various donors.



16
4.12 Women-in-agriculture program. The project would particularly contribute to resolving the
problems that hamper full participation of women in rural development. The measures would include:
(a) formulating extension messages for crops or activities that are performed predominantly by women;
(b) developing special modules of advice on processing of food and on simple agroindustrial activities;
(c) encouraging establishment of female or mixed working groups with a goal of having women make up
at least one third of the group members; and (d) giving a priority to women in the literacy and numeracy
programs, which would be organized in collaboration with the Ministry responsible for adult education.
Women's programs would be incorporated in the unified extension programs which would identify and
recruit more female staff and finance similar investments as under that program; the literacy and
numeracy program would provide funds for training of trainers, technical and classroom equipment,
vehicles, and incremental operating costs.
4.13    Animal health and pastoralist promotion (US$2.5 million). Besides strengthening the
capabilities of the general extension service in the dissemination of livestock technology (para 4.10), the
livestock component would have two subcomponents. The first would strengthen the quality of the
animal health delivery by further supporting the ongoing privatization process, through training and a
review of the current animal health legislation. It would also improve the sanitary control capabilities of
the public service by providing equipment, motorcycles and other vehicles, training, partial salaries and
operating costs to the key livestock departments (DPIA/DSV) and to the virology, bacteriology,
parasitology and epidemiology departments and four regional laboratories of LNE. The second would
develop specialized information services for the transhumant pastoral producers, carrying out a detailed
stakeholder analysis and developing and equipping more appropriate communication channels (radio,
markets) for this mobile group. It would further include the establishment of a small advisory unit for
specialized peri-urban pig and poultry livestock producers. The project would provide training to the
unit's staff, short-term technical assistance to start the unit, and funds for equipment and operating costs
for special training courses for commercial pig and poultry farmners.
4.14   To support these investments, the government would need to agree, at effectiveness, to eliminate
competition by the public livestock service in "private good tasks" (such as curative treatments, non-
compulsory vaccinations and sale of pharmaceuticals) by introducing full cost recovery (including
personnel costs an d transport) for these services during the first project year. These costs would be
updated every year by the DEP of AGRI-RA. Funds are provided to carry out those updates. As a further
support to private veterinarians, and to use its own budget most efficiently, the Government would issue,
before effectiveness, a decree governing the subcontracting ("mandat sanitaire") of public sector tasks,
such as meat inspection and compulsory vaccination to private veterinarians. It would need to agree to
introduce cost recovery for the advisory services for commercial producers.
4.15   Pilot programs (US$4.3 million). Promotion offarmer organizations. On a pilot basis the
project would help farmer organizations (at regional and local levels, and potentially also at the national
level) become stronger and prove capable of providing agricultural support services to farmers. These
services are, in the first instance, expected to be commercial activities such as supplying farm inputs,
marketing cash crops and organizing rural saving and credit facilities. Also, farmer organizations are
expected to take part in adaptive research and, once they are sufficiently strong, participate in the transfer
of agricultural technologies and know-how to their members.
4.16   Considering the relatively weak development and financial levels of the existing farmer
organizations, the project would provide assistance to the Directorate for Promoting Cooperatives and
Rural Legislation (DPCLR) of AGRI-RA to allow it carry out promotional activities more efficiently
than it has done heretofore. Other support would concentrate directly on making farmer organizations



17
more professional and enabling them to provide services to their members and represent them in various
forums where their interests are at stake. Thus, assistance under this component would support: (a)
improvement of the legal and fiscal framework to provide an enabling environment for farmer
organizations to grow; (b) improvement of the members' capability to develop their professional
organizations through a literacy and numeracy program and cooperative and group training; (c)
institution building, by training board members and staff of farmer associations in organization,
management, economics and accountancy and by providing essential equipment and facilities; (d)
technical training of permanent professional staff involved in farmer organizations and their promotion,
including training in participatory technology development and extension; and (e) technology and
logistical support to grass-roots-level savings and credit associations and their vertical organizations.
Particular attention would be paid to identifying and supporting women and youth organizations and
groups, or integrating members of these two groups in other farmer organizations. Wherever possible,
project activities would be linked with existing organizations active in planning and implementing
village land management. The project would provide consultancies, training, vehicles, technical and
office equipment, and assistance to experimental programs that can be used for exhibition and training
purposes, as well as regional/international study tours for board members and selected staff from farmer
organizations.
4.17   Small rural infrastructures. This program finances pilot work on small infrastructures,
particularly "boulis" and related economic activities, whose establishment would also be based on farmer
groups. "Boulis" are small, simple-design dams constructed in natural depressions near the villages with
the help of bulldozers and by doing some compacting and stone/cement strengthening. They provide
water to the village and its animals until or near the end of the dry season, and are valuable for garden
plots, brick laying and composting. Village wells and latrines can be added to the bouli-projects to
ensure the necessary sanitation in regard to water flows. As a social benefit, it has been observed that the
boulis have helped to reduce migration of the young people who are attracted by the better income that
the "new occupation" of small-scale irrigation of the vegetable plots can offer. The program financed
under the project would be a two-year pilot operation, the main purposes of which would be to: (a) study
and record suitable procedures for developing boulis; (b) study their financial viability and the potential
benefits and risks; (c) study the potential to make them into a "bankable" scheme; and (d) help prepare a
larger scheme for the banks and development agencies to finance.
4.18   Restructuring of agricultural services (US$1.4 million). In line with the policies promoted
under the Second National Agricultural Adjustment Credit, the project would carry out relevant
supporting measures to reorganize AGRI-RA activities (para 2.17, 4.4), including possibly setting up a
temporary unit in charge of restructuring, conduct detailed studies for the reorganization of AGRI-RA
and CRPAs, provide training and other assistance for redundant staff. For the livestock service, the
Government would present and implement annual action plans for the separation of the functions of
control and advice of the livestock front-line staff, and integrating the staff available for extension tasks
progressively into the unified agricultural extension system. Because the workload of livestock agents in
the field would continuously change as the privatization of veterinary tasks progresses, action plans
about the division of labor would be prepared every year for each province. The project would provide
funds for consultaricies, training, logistics and operating costs.

V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A.    Project Costs
5.1    The base cost of the project for the 4-year disbursement period is estimated at CFAF 22.5 billion
(equivalent to US$42.7 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$25.8 million. The total
foreign exchange component constitutes about 60 percent of project base costs. Physical contingencies
were calculated on civil works, plant and equipment, training and technical assistance. Price
contingencies of 4 percent for PY 1 and 3.0 percent for the following years were included for all local
costs from FY96 onward, reflecting the local inflationary considerations. Price contingencies on foreign
exchange were 2.3 percent for PY 1 and 2.5 percent for the following three years. Physical contingencies
amounted to US$1.3 million (3 percent of base costs). Cost estimates are based on first-quarter 1997
international quotations (UN Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office--IAPSO) for vehicles and
equipment, machinery and office supplies. Local quotations for the same period covered salaries and
allowances, civil works and office furniture. A nominal exchange rate of US$1.00 = CFAF526 was used
for February 1997 in determining project financial costs with depreciation of up to US$1.00 = CFAF536
during the last year of the four-year investment period. A ten-month lag between project post-appraisal
and effectiveness was assumed. Given these assumptions, total project cost, including all contingencies,
was estimated at CFAF 25.1 billion (US$47.3 million) (Annex 1).

B.    Proposed Financing Plan
5.2     The credit of US$41.3 million would finance 87.2 percent of total project costs, excluding
taxes and duties. The credit would have a maturity of 40 years, including a ten-year grace period. It
would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange, 95 percent of civil works and about 75 percent of other
local costs. In viewofBurkinaFaso'sdifficultmacroeconomicsituation> the IDA credit would finance all



19
capital investments except for 5 percent of civil works, while the Government would finance a part of the
recurrent expenditures (para 5.6). The Government would finance US$6 million equivalent (12.5 percent
of total costs), excluding duties and taxes. The beneficiaries under the rural institutions component
would finance about US$400,000 (20 percent of the direct assistance to farmer organizations under the
pilot operations). The proposed financing plan for the project is summarized below (the farmer
organizations' contribution has been incorporated in the Government financing):

5.3     The components of the project aiming at strengthening the public services amount to
approximately US$43 million (of which about US$38 million IDA credit). To ensure timely availability
of counterpart funds, Government contributions to the project agencies would be specified in the
agencies' annual budgets and would be payable in semi-annual allotments in advance. Because deposits
would be due in advance, the initial deposit in each account would be required to cover three months of
operations for the particular component before the project could become effective. Failure to adhere to the
semi-annual deposit schedule would be treated as a cause for suspension of the disbursements by IDA.
Assurances regarding all these requirements were obtained in the course of project negotiations.
C. Procurementand Disbursements
5.4   Procurement. All the project units involved in implementation include staff experienced with the
Bank procurement procedures. Project procurement would conform with Bank guidelines (January 1995,
modified in August 1996) within the following thresholds: (a) all civil works, except small renovation works,
would be procured through national competitive bidding procedures (NCB). Contracts under the pilot
component, with estimated costs of less than US$30,000 equivalent, would be let out by using the
"community-participation" method, following procedures stated in the Implementation Manual and acceptable
to IDA, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million equivalent; (b) goods would be procured in
accordance with international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures except for: (i) goods estimated to cost less
than US$200,000 equivalent per contract which will be procured through NCB procedures; and (ii) goods
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2
million equivalent, to be procured by local shopping based on at least three quotations. The implementation
units would be requested to prepare a computer-based system to monitor that the aggregate amounts agreed



20
upon will not be exceeded. Goods manufactured in Burkina Faso will be granted a margin of preference in
ICR contracts in accordance with the World Bank guidelines. Contracts for goods would, to the extent
practicable, be grouped into packages of US$200,000 equivalent or more. For consultants, the Bank's
consultant guidelines of January 1997 would be followed. All bidding and contract documents for civil works,
goods and equipment and consultant firms exceeding US$50,000 (US$20,000 for individual consultants) would
be subject to prior review by IDA. The Borrower presented to IDA a draft procurement schedule for the
entire project period at negotiations. The procurement arrangements are further detailed in Annex III.
5.5    Disbursementof IDA Credit Disbursementarrangementsare explained in detail in Annex III.
They will be complemented by a DisbursementLetter by the World Bank's DisbursementDivision
(LOAAF) once the project has been approved.
5.6    To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, the
Governmentwould open Special Accounts for AGRI-RA, INERA and IRSAT in CFAF in a local
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations would amount to
CFAF 600 million for AGRI-RA, CFAF 400 million for INERA and CFAF 100 million for IRSAT, and
would cover about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, CFAF 300 million for AGRI-
RA, CFAF 200 million for INERA and CFAF 50 million for IRSAT will be deposited in the respective
Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the
Credit account and/or Special commitments issued amount to one half of allocated funds for each entity.
The disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be authorized once the institute has implemented accounting
and financial management systems similar to INERA (para 5.7). The Special Accounts would be used for
all payments inferior to 20 percent of the initial deposits. Replenishmentapplications would be submitted
monthly. All replenishmentapplications should be fully documented except for contracts of less than
US$50,000 equivalent for civil works, goods and equipment, consultant firms (US$20,000 for individual
consultants), training, studies and operating costs, which would be claimed on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained at the project
implementation units for review by the IDA supervision missions and external auditors.
E. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
5.7   The implementing agencies, except IRSAT, have participated in IDA-financed projects in the
past and have adequate accounting systems. INERA is putting in place, with the support of an
international accounting firm, an improved financial management system, including cost accounting (by
programs, research centers and stations and source of funding). A system similar to that introduced in
INERA would be installed at IRSAT. Funding required for the recruitment of the financial and
accounting firm for IRSAT would be available after Board approval, while other disbursement of project
funds for IRSAT would be authorized once the financial management system is in place and the manual
of accounting procedures has been adopted by the CNRST Board. All agencies would maintain their
accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect their operations and financial
positions. They would have the accounts including Special Accounts and SOEs, audited by a firm of
independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
audited accounts and the auditors' report, including the Management Letter (long form), and a statement
as to whether or not Bank funds had been used for their intended purpose, would be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of the fiscal year of each agency.
5.8    By September 30 of each year starting with 1997, the implementing agencies would submit to
their respective ministries, with a copy to the IDA, their annual work programs and budgets for the
following year. The report format would adequately portray project activities, unit costs, benefits and



21
productivity and would provide the basis for proper management of the project and operation of a sound
project accounting system. The budget proposal would include quarterly cash flow statements.
Procurement plan for goods and civil works would specify source of funds, timing, and procurement
methods (whether ICB or other), and would be accompanied by an updated Procurement Schedule for the
remaining life of the project. After having been reviewed and approved by the supervising ministries,
the agency budgets would be reviewed by the Steering Committee (para 6.1). The supervising ministries
would then submit the budgets to the Ministry of Finance to agree on the level of annual funding,
financial plan, and allocation of resources. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, by November
30 of each year starting from 1996, the supervising ministries would submit to the Bank for comments a
copy of the NASDP II program and budget for the coming year.
5.9   Each participating agency would submit semiannual reports and management accounts to the
supervising ministry, copied to the Steering Committee and IDA, showing actual and budgeted
expenditures, statements of progress achieved and the objectives for the forthcoming quarter by each
project component. Semiannual reports would contain summaries of expenditures to date and use of
funds by source, plus a forecast of withdrawal of IDA credit proceeds by quarter for the immediate
forthcoming year and by year thereafter.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Overall Organization and Management
6.1   The general oversight of implementationwould be the responsibilityof an interministerial
committee (Steering Committee for the Agricultural Services Project). It would be chaired by the Secretary
Generals of AGRI-RA and MESSRS on behalf of the respective Ministers. The chairmanship would
alternate annually. The committee would consist of 15 persons, representingthe ministries, regional bodies
and research institutes most concerned in project operations (the list of members and the functions of the
Committee are given in Annex VII of the Project ImplementationManual). The Committee would assign
senior staffto take part in the wrap-up meetings of the IDA supervisionmissions. The Steering Committee
would meet, as a minimum, once every six months. In addition to reviewing policy, financial and
coordination issues, the Committee would approve the annual budgets and work plans and receive
information about the appointment of principal staff needed for project implementation (appointment of
the staff would be the responsibility of the respective ministries). The Committee would also ensure,
through the respective Ministries, that adequate counterpart funds would be made available for project
implementation.
6.2     Under the supervision of MESSRS and AGRI-RA, a separate body would be responsible for
coordination of each project component: the Directorate General of CNRST for the research component and
the Project CoordinationUnit for AGRI-RA Services (CU). The DirectorGeneral is already responsible for
coordinating, supervising, monitoring and evaluation of the scientific activities in the Ministry. He would
handle the same responsibilitiesfor the project. The National Coordinatorheading the Project Coordination
Unit at AGRI-RA would be responsible for promoting coordinated actions under the AGRI-RA component,
supervising financial management and procurement, and monitoring implementation of the plans for action.
He would have three subunits to assist him: Finance and Procurement, Internal Audits and Monitoring and
Evaluation. The respective Directorates of AGRI-RA would implement the AGRI-RA components. INERA
and IRSAT, with their Secretary Generals in charge, would execute the research component of the project
with adequate independence and authorization in using project funds and carrying out procurement under the
project. The organization of project coordination and management is depicted in Chart I of Annex IV.



22
B. Operations of the Different Components
6.3    Agricultural Research. 7 INERA and IRSAT would operate under the general guidance of
CRNST Board of Governors. To review the research programs that the institutes prepare within the
framework of the National Agricultural Research Strategy, the Board would rely on a Scientific and
Technical Commission (STC), consisting of 10 to 15 members nominated from renowned national or
foreign scientists.
6.4   STC and the Directorate of CNRST have an important role in the review and approval process, as
well as in the monitoring and evaluation of research. Their role would be made explicit in the procedure
manual of CNRST prepard before preparation. The CRNST Board would need to adopt this manual, as
well as a manual for INERA and IRSAT organizations, before the project can become effective.
6.5    Organization of research andprogram content. The new INERA, which combines the previous
INERA and IRBET, would be organized into five regional research centers--Saria, Farakoba, Di-Tougan,
Kouare, Dori-Katchari--corresponding to the five major agroecological zones, and one national center,
Kamboinse. The national center would house all the major laboratories and would carry out the basic
research activities under the direction of the department heads. The basic research carried out at
Kamboinse would support the applied and adaptive research performed by the regional research centers.
The Kamboinse station would also be responsible for organizing all training for scientists and other staff.
Each regional center would have a multidisciplinary natural resource management and production systems
team in charge of on-farm testing and adaptation as well as a participatory technology development unit to
collaborate with producer organizations and extension services.
6.6   Program planning and review process. INERA is putting in place a program planning and review
process to ensure that research meets the country's needs and is adequate. First, at the level of the
regional centers, researchers review their research results and program the activities of the following year
with a small group of producers and with regional extension and NGO staff--i.e., the users with whom
they usually work on on-farm testing and adaptation. Every other year, each regional center would hold a
large meeting (the Regional Technical Committee) with research clients (producer groups, extension and
development staff and NGOs) to present research results, propose future activities in accordance with the
consultation with the working groups, and obtain agreement on research priorities for the next two years.
This process is intended to ensure that producers participate in the process, so that the research will meet
their needs. The regional research activities are then aggregated, consolidated and reviewed at the
program (national) level. They are reviewed by a Program Commission, an external body, which can also
propose activities and provide feedback. The agreed work programs and budgets are then presented to
INERA's Scientific and Management Council. This advisory body makes recommendations to the
CRNST Board of Governors through the Scientific and Technical Council regarding the funding the
Institute's proposed work program. During the project period, the annual research programs would be
communicated to IDA for prior review before being presented to INERA's Scientific and Management
Council.
6.7   Partnership with producer organizations. Participatory research methods are necessary for
fostering client-oriented research. Equally important is the influence that the producers can exert on the
research agenda, not only for the design of on-farm experiments but also at the on-station stage. In
/ See also Annexes 1.1 and I. 2 in the Implementation Manual.



23
addition to the programming and review process described above, INERA and IRSAT would develop
contractual arrangements with a few producer organizations to develop technologies of interest to these
organizations. These partnerships would be established gradually on a pilot basis as it takes time to make
them permanent (during the past three years, three such partnerships have already been established).
6.8    National and regional collaboration. A number of scientists outside CNRST are affiliated with
the university, special schools such as the Rural Development Institute (IDR), units of other ministries
such as the National Livestock Laboratory, or with NGOs. A line item in the budget, managed by the
Director General of CNRST, would enable CNRST to contract these scientists to collaborate with INERA
and IRSAT scientists (i.e., from institutes in the North or from the regions, or with international research
centers) in implementing the strategic plan and thereby optimizing the use of scarce country resources.
The project also intends to support INERA and IRSAT to adapt and implement the principles of the
Framework for Action of the Special Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR). The project
would also promote the scientists' participation in regional and international research programs and
networks.
6.9   Physical infrastructure and equipment. There would be only limited development of
infrastructure under the project, mainly completing structures in progress and rehabilitating other
facilities. Before architectural and engineering plans are prepared, INERA and IRSAT would prepare
experiment station development plans to indicate the future use of buildings and grounds. A commission
composed of senior scientists and engineers would oversee the development of such plans and monitor
their implementation. Once INERA and IRSAT have prepared an experimental station development plan
acceptable to IDA, disbursement for civil works and land improvement would be made under the IDA
credit for that particular location. Disbursement for equipment would depend on the presentation of an
agricultural equipment profile for the research stations and the results of a laboratory study based on an
analysis of the gap between the existing equipment and the equipment needed to carry out the activities
projected under the Strategic Plan.
6.10   Human resources management. Burkinabe research institutes are part of the African and
Malagasy Council for Higher Education System (CAMES) for researchers' promotion. Proposals to
revise the CAMES promotion system for researchers to make it more responsive to the needs of clients,
rather than being academically-oriented, would be made to the CAMES Council of Ministers. Whatever
the outcome of the negotiations between the MESSRS and the CAMES, the MESSRS would need to
adopt a system of promotion for the researchers with criteria that would encourage development-oriented
research. Agreement to adopt such a system not later than December 31, 1998, was agreed upon at credit
negotiations.
6.11   The decree for establishment of CRNST and its institutes IRSAT and INERA (reglement
d'etablissement) has been developed to include a description of conditions of entry for each category of
staff and researcher. It also contains a system for ongoing evaluation of staff performance, including an
incentive and reward system. Agreement that a performance review system, including incentives and
rewards, would be adopted by the CNRST Board before December 31, 1998, was agreed upon at
negotiations.
6.12   Agricultural extension and other AGRI-RA components. Under the restructured AGRI-RA,
agricultural extension and related activities will be carried out through a "unified extension system,"
which provides a single line of command with five vertical levels. They are: (a) the local level, with
about 1,000 village extension workers (CAPs), each serving about 800 households in 4 to 8 villages; (b)
the zonal level, with 150 supervisors, each working with 8 to 10 CAPs; (c) the provincial level, with 30



24
teams of managers and specialists supervising and providing support to the zonal and village levels; in
each province, there are also 4 to 6 Subject Matter Specialists (Technical Specialists--TS), carrying out
adaptive research, training the CAPs in fortnightly workshops and serving as liaison among farmers,
CAPs and researchers; (d) the regional level consisting of 12 DRARAs, which, besides supervising and
supporting the layers below them, are in charge of evaluating and processing the data collected by
surveyors posted in the provinces; they also carry out adaptive research at PAPEMs and organize training
of the Technical Specialists during monthly workshops, getting expert assistance from researchers and
other resource persons; and (e) the central level. As the extension staff age structure indicates a need to
make preparations for replacements in the near future, the Government has establish a thorough record
and projections of the extension staff and a policy for replacing the aging or otherwise revising staff.
6.13   At the central level, the Directorate of Agricultural Extension (DVA) will continue to have sole
responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the day-to-day operations of extension activities that deal
with crops, animal production, natural resource management and gender-specific activities. The DVA
will also have overall responsibility for the training of extension staff, including producing and using
audio-visual materials; monitoring and evaluation; adaptive research; and maintenance of linkages with
the research institutes. The Director of DVA is assisted by a team of technical managers for training and
extension, monitoring and evaluation, adaptive research and women's activities. The Chief of
Administration and Finance in DVA is responsible for the delivery of timely and adequate resources and
facilities to the entire extension system and for monitoring their efficient use.
6.14   For extension to be effective, the advisory messages must be tailored to farmers' needs. Hence, it
is important that DVA solicit and obtain the participation of the various stakeholders, including the
relevant farmer organizations and NGOs. Specialized organizations responsible for processing, marketing
and exporting commodities, such as SOFITEX for cotton and UCOBAM for vegetables, could contribute
to the content of extension messages by providing information about their concerns and perhaps by
providing resource persons for the training of Technical Specialists. To strengthen the linkages with the
research institutes, Technical Specialists would attend monthly workshops and refresher courses in
adaptive research and training during the dry season. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DVA
would enter into agreements with SOFITEX , INERA and IRSAT, respectively. These accords would
relate to each agency's contribution to the content of extension messages concerning agricultural
technology, training of the Technical Specialists and financial arrangements to carry out this cooperation.
6.15   Regarding livestock extension, the current extension tools (communal demonstration herds, test
herds, demonstration plots, etc.) would be adapted to include use of individually managed entire herds in
demonstrations and tests; greater reliance on producer-led experimentation, information exchange and
producer cross-visits; and greater reliance on mass media. The project would develop, under the
respective responsibility of DPIA, a special information service for transhumant producers and encourage
them to share information on pasture, water and animal health conditions along transhumance routes,
marketing, land-tenure issues and other organizational aspects, and a specialized service for commercial
pig and poultry producers.
6.16     Women in Agriculture Program (WIA). 8 The WIA program would promote agricultural
activities that are either solely or largely carried out by women; these include crop production, livestock,
food processing techniques, and utilization, storage and marketing of farm products and other off-farm
income-generating activities. Appropriate technologies would be generated and developed through the
/ See also Annex 1.3 in the Implementation Manual.



25
agricultural research programs of INERA and IRSAT and through adaptive research at PAPEMs. A
specialist at the national level in AGRI-RA, regional specialists at CRPAs and Technical Specialists at the
provincial level--all integrated into the unified extension system--would implement on-farm and other
extension activities and train the CAPs, including males, and their supervisors in zones. The female TSs
would operate like the other technical specialists, but only in agricultural technologies that are solely or
largely performed by women.
6.17    Other measures to be adopted would include increasing the number of qualified female staff at
all levels (zonal, provincial, regional and headquarters) and accelerating efforts to reach more female
members of the contact farm families and other female farmers with appropriate technologies. One third
of the contact groups would be female. The increase in the number of female staff would be attained by
identifying more female CAPs to address women in groups. The CAPs would make other production
recommendations to the women as members of the contact families in their respective circles. In the
provinces where there is strong inhibition against male extension workers interacting directly with women
farmers, female CAPs would disseminate appropriate technologies to women farmers and select some of
them as contact farmers. The proposed increase in the number of female extension workers at the head
office, regions, provinces and zones would improve the coverage of women working in agriculture. The
mass media would be used extensively in the work with women groups. Female CAPs would be
expected to spend up to 70 percent of their time disseminating technologies on agricultural production and
about 30 percent supporting the processing and use of agricultural produce.
6.18   Livestock health and pastoralist promotion. 9 The livestock component would be implemented
under the general coordination of the Directorate of Production and Animal Industries (DPIA), which
would delegate responsibility for the extension subcomponent to the Directorate of Agricultural Extension
(DVA), the pastoral component to the Division of Pastoral Areas Promotion (SAEP) and the animal health
component to the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DSV). The National Livestock Laboratory (LNE)
would be responsible for implementing of the laboratory component in close collaboration with INERA.
To enable fast and direct disease-reporting links between the regional and national laboratories, the
Government would transfer responsibility for the regional laboratories from DRARA to LNE before
effectiveness. Furthermore, a study would be needed to assess the feasibility of transforming LNE into an
independent administrative entity (EPA). This study would be carried out, and its results implemented, in
the first project year. Specialized training activities could be subcontracted to other government
organizations, regional agencies, or NGOs. Dissemination of pastoral information should be closely
coordinated with other donors projects working in the same field.
6.19   To effectively implement the subcomponent for private animal health and advisory services, the
Government would, as would be agreed upon at negotiation, provide equal opportunities to private
veterinarians and eliminate competition of the livestock service in the "private goods tasks" such as
curative treatments, noncompulsory vaccinations and sale of pharmaceuticals by phasing out all these
services in the areas where a private veterinarian is established and by introducing full cost recovery
(including personnel costs and transport) for all "private goods tasks." Furthermore, the Government
would issue, before effectiveness, a decree governing the subcontracting (mandat sanitaire) of public
sector tasks such as compulsory vaccinations and meat inspection to private practitioners, and introduce
advisory services to private specialized producers under a partial and progressively increasing cost
recovery system.
/ See also Annex 1.4 in the Implementation Manual.



26
6.20   Rural Institutions. The agencies most involved with the rural institutions component would be
the Directorate of Cooperatives and Rural Legislation (DPCLR), Project Coordination Unit and the
National and Regional Advisory Committees for farmer organizations. A portion of the component funds
are allocated to DPCLR, which would implement it independently after presenting its annual work plans
for discussion to the National Advisory Committee (CCN). Besides monitoring the activities and output,
CU would, where necessary, assist in all activities, such as procurement and disbursement of project funds
for the expenses of DPCLR. 10
6.21   Direct assistance for rural institutions would be elaborated on the basis of the studies and plans
under way for the rural credit operations (financed by Swiss and European Union assistance) or prepared
under the PASA II program for the professionalization of farmer organizations. It would be followed by a
national conference to be organized by DPCLR, representative farmer organizations, IDA and other
donors. Based on the overall approach to be recommended by the conference planned for early 1997,
annual plans and assistance programs would be prepared by a subcommittee comprising members of CCN
and staff of DPCM and CU. The endorsement of the CCN and no-objection by IDA would be needed
before project funds are available for each annual program. One of the objectives is to have by the second
half of the project a national-level federation of cooperatives would operate the assistance program
outlined above.
6.22   Farmer organizations would receive grants (against 20 percent own financing) to help implement
small subprojects formulated with the help of the DPCLR's field staff or NGOs. These subprojects would
be approved by the Regional Advisory Committees (CCR). Because the component is a pilot operation,
funds would be insufficient to cover all the needs in the sector, and the CCN would have to use selection
criteria for choosing 5 to 6 provinces for the program, as well as the organizations and activities to be
aided each year. The selection procedure and criteria were agreed upon at negotiations; the criteria would
include a potential replication effect after the pilot phase, suitable size and degree of certainty that the
project objectives can be achieved with the funds available, regional spread, contribution by the members
at 20 percent minimum, availability of competent staff or adequate training facilities, and level of
coverage (number of people involved). Whenever possible, the actual implementation of the subprojects
would be contracted out by the OP to a suitable agency or consultants. A typical example of such
contracting would be the literacy courses that would be best implemented by specialized NGOs (6.29).
The Government has prepared the operational manuals explaining the details of these operations.
6.23   Restructuring of AGRI-RA. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources has approved
a restructuring plan that has been drafted by a specialist team of FAO and thoroughly reviewed and
partially revised by a Steering Committee at AGRI-RA (paras 2.17, 4.4). The restructuring program
would be implemented under direct supervision of the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources.
However, a special coordination unit set up for planning the Second SECAL would carry out the day-to-
day monitoring of the restructuring program. The Steering Committee which oversees this unit is
chaired by the Secretary General of AGRI-RA. Implementation of the actions required under this
component will be initiated under the Second National Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit, and,
consequently, supervision of the implementation of the component will be done in collaboration with
ASAC. During post-appraisal, the Government agreed that it will: (a) complete the establishment of the
organs and management procedures under the restructuring program of AGRI-RA; (b) give termination
/ See also Annex A.4 in the Implementation Manual. The French Ministry of Cooperation is
considering the possibility of offering a Farner Organizations Specialists to AGRI-RA to help,
among other things, in the activities assisted by this project.



27
notice to the 600 contractual staff to be released; and (c) identify the ex-CRPA staff who can be
effectively used in the new DRARAs and make a decision on their transfer. At negotiations, it was
agreed that the Government: (a) carry out redeployment of personnel and organizing the related
transfers as per the reorganization plan before June 30, 1998. (These arrangements would need to
include separation of the control and advice functions at the level of field agents and unification of the
available livestock personnel into the national extension system, based on annual action plans for each
province); and (b) prepare with the help of an audit firm a financial audit of the assets and liabilities of
the CRPAs not later than April 30, 1998; and (c) liquidate the liabilities not later than April 30, 1999.
C. Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation
6.25   The units and systems needed for planning, monitoring and evaluation have been developed and
instituted during the predecessor projects on agricultural extension and research. These units and systems
would be strengthened during the NASDP II. Detailed work programs would be prepared annually for
each unit benefiting from project funds. These plans would include detailed data and information on the
inputs needed and outputs expected. For the AGRI-RA activities, monitoring of the implementation of
the work programs would be based on reports collected and data processed in the channel of zonal,
provincial and DRARA units. The DRARAs would have separate Monitoring and Evaluation Units for
this purpose. At the national level, the M&E unit would be located in the Project Coordination Unit. On
the side of agricultural research, information and data would flow from the field and regional research
stations to INERA and IRSAT where they would be processed for the monitoring and evaluation reports.
A lot of data is already being collected, but they are not always processed adequately to be of benefit for
project or ministerial management.
6.26   For one part, monitoring would focus on assessing the physical implementation of the investments
proposed under the project. For extension (including livestock and gender-specific extension), the key
indicators would include adherence to training and visit schedules, attendance to fortnightly
demonstration sessions (data to be divided by gender), and the number of demonstration plots or herds.
For research, the monitoring system would report, on physical implementation of the respective activities,
as well as on the advancement in each of the research programs. Evaluation of the project impact would
aim at analyzing the meeting of project development objectives. These would be measured by such
indicators as adoption rates and differences in yields and production in with- and without-the-project
situations. As the Agricultural Statistics Directorate is responsible for annual production estimates, and as
yields and production are affected by numerous factors and different agencies, collaboration will need to
be arranged between these agencies and the evaluation units in AGRI-RA, CRNST and the research
institutes to establish the base-line situation and to collect the essential follow-up data and information in
a systematic manner. It is envisaged that consultant assistance would be needed to do all this.
Additionally, independent consultants would be needed to carry out the evaluation studies every two to
three years. The indicators for monitoring project performance and measuring the project impact were
agreed upon at negotiations. Consultants would be recruited to help establish a coordinated monitoring
system and carry out independent impact evaluations.
D. Training and Technical Assistance
6.27    Training. All the components of the project would contain training elements. The project
would put in place an in-service training program to reflect emerging changes and needs in technology
and policy areas. The highest priority for training would be strengthening the management and technical
capacity of staff at all levels through in-house and external (including some overseas) courses. The



28
training program for eligible AGRI-RA staff would be coordinated by the Directorate of Extension (DVA)
I Iand for INERA and IRSAT staff by CRNST. In consultation with each operational unit, these agencies
would be responsible for: (a) managing in-house training activities; (b) establishing procedures and
criteria for determining staff training needs; (c) preparing criteria for selecting training programs and
candidates; (d) developing procedures for evaluating training activities; (e) identifying suitable training
institutions for external in-country and external courses; and (f) organizing a record keeping system for
trainees. The T&V training for extension staff would be planned and executed by DVA, while training for
other AGRI-RA staff would require inputs from other Directorates in the Ministry for planning and
implementing the training program. National institutions would be used to conduct in-country extension
training programs. A prime goal in training policy would be cost-effectiveness; for example, AGRI-RA
and CRNST would try to find suitable locations for training in Burkina Faso, and only if such locations
were unavailable in the country, would they look for outside opportunities, first elsewhere in Africa, then
in other developing countries, and only then, in developed countries. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Human Resource Development Plans would be based on skill-gap analyses and
updated annually, and that the annual training program for each participating agency would be submitted
to the Bank for agreement before implementation.
6.28   Technical assistance. No long-term technical assistance is proposed under the project.
Government agencies in the past have faced, however, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequately
experienced and qualified specialists, such as financial controllers and monitoring and evaluation experts
because of higher salaries in the private sector and shortage of qualified applicants. The local expertise
needed but not available in the Government service, would be obtained through contractual arrangements
with Burkinabe consultant firms or individual specialists; expatriate recruitment would take place only if
the required expertise is unavailable locally. In view of the highly specialized needs of the agricultural
research and some other activities, such as station management and monitoring and evaluation, where
professional skills as well as continuity are very important, institutions with appropriate expertise would
be identified to provide short-term consultants. In addition, short-term consultants for specific studies,
notably to support agricultural research, extension, human resource development and farmer organization
activities, would be hired as needed. The project agencies are expected to enter into contractual
arrangements at terms and conditions, and with the terms of reference and qualifications agreeable to the
Bank with selected institutions or individuals to support project activities.
6.29    Literacy program and group training. The project would provide several activities to address
the functional literacy needs of the officers in farmer organizations and more generally of women farmers,
whose educational levels are low and who therefore have limitations in managing economic activities.
First, functional literacy training provided under PRSAP I would continue under NASDP II with an
emphasis on female participation. Second, group-skill trainers would be appointed at provincial level to
provide training in two main subjects: the management of groups and group activities for group leaders,
and transformation and agroprocessing technologies for group members. Third, regional specialists in
gender issues would serve as a clearinghouse in their areas to put people who have received such training
in touch with NGOs and other projects and agencies that can provide the credit so that maximum
advantage can be taken of the training.
/ If needed, with assistance from the Directorate for Professional Training.



29
E.    Mid-Term and Completion Reviews
6.30    Midterm reviews. The Coordination Unit (CU), with inputs from the benefiting Directorates
of AGRI-RA, would prepare a progress report on the AGRI-RA components of the project before
midterm. Similarly, INERA and IRSAT, with coordination from CNRST, would prepare progress
reports. In addition, the Coordinating Unit of PASA would prepare a report on the implementation of the
restructuring of AGRI-RA. These reports would form the basis for the mid-term review to be undertaken
jointly by the Government and IDA at the end of Project year 2. To facilitate meaningful monitoring,
implementation and impact indicators for all components were agreed upon at negotiations. The review
of the AGRI-RA components would focus on assessing the success of the technology support system in
adapting and disseminating new messages on crops and livestock to farmers to improve total farm
productivity and in promoting sustainable use of land and water resources. Progress in strengthening of
monitoring and evaluation activities in AGRI-RA and results in the program of strengthening and
expanding the farmer organizations would also be assessed. Implementation of the research component
would be reviewed against agreed objectives, particularly the capability of the research system to
develop appropriate technology messages and liaise with other agencies for disseminating them to the
farming community. Also, the operational procedures set in place at INERA and IRSAT would be
reviewed. At negotiation, assurances were obtained that CU and CNRST would coordinate preparation
of comprehensive progress reports and each benefiting agency would prepare their own reports for the
midterm review of the project which would be completed no later than three months after the mid-term
by a joint Government/World Bank team.
6.31    Implementation Completion Report. An ICR would be prepared under the coordination of
the Project Steering Committee, with contributions from the participating agencies. It would assess
achievements of the project in relation to its objectives; field impact of the new approach to liaisons
between the agencies involved; and achievement of a consolidated level of operations by the agencies
benefiting from the project. The ICR would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after
completion of the project.
F.    Implementation Schedules
6.32    During the first year of the project, emphasis in the AGRI-RA components would concentrate
on strengthening the unification of extension services, particularly through improved linking of the
livestock operations and improving quality of the on-farm adaptive research (OFAR) and extension
programs. On the research side, the new administrative and organizational arrangements would take
place (including establishment of IRSAT), together with firming up the programs in line with the new
strategy of agricultural research. Limited civil works and rehabilitation, and procurement of most of the
vehicles, field and laboratory equipment would be carried out during the first two years of the project.
Applications for financing under the farmer organization component would be invited, and the first ones
would probably be appraised before effectiveness of the Credit. A bar chart showing the implementation
schedule for key activities is given in Annex II. Bank supervision mission timing and nature is provided
in the same schedule. The first Bank supervision mission will cover three representative regions and
would confirm with the CU, INERA and IRSAT the practicability of a list of performance indicators
prepared under NASDP II to assess the development impact and the institutional effectiveness of the
project entities.

VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.1   In Burkina Faso, determination of project benefits resulting from an agricultural services project
must include agricultural and livestock activities performed by smallholders, who represent more than 90
percent of the farmers. In the analysis prepared for this project, the agricultural component included an
estimation of farm budgets by agroecological zones and standard types of farms, and an assessment of
overall benefits by aggregating farm budgets, according to assumptions made by the mission on
prospective adoption rates. The livestock component included an estimation of herd and flock budgets
by standard type and an assessment of overall benefits by aggregating herd budgets, according to
assumptions made by the mission on the prospective adoption rates by cattle and sheep breeders.
A. Farm-level Analysis
7.2    Farm/herd models. Primary project beneficiaries would be small farmers currently practicing
low-input, low-output technologies in farming systems. Because cropping systems vary considerably
within the four selected agroecological zones, it was assumed that main project benefits would accrue
from incremental production resulting from adoption of the improved varieties and associated cultural
practices by farmers, along with better livestock health, breeding, feeding and management. To analyze
the financial and economic benefits, six different farm models were prepared, one for each agroclimatic
zone and two more general models. For livestock, four typical models were used in the analysis (Annex
4, Appendices A and B).
7.3    Determination of benefits and costs. A matrix in Annex 4, Appendix A, indicates, by type of
farm, the technical packages and levels of productivity that were used to assess benefits from target
farms and to estimate impact in each agroecological zone. The yield increases were projected to vary
from 14 percent to 41 percent (depending on the region and the crop), and to be achieved over four years
only by the adopting farmers. Three types of cattle herds and one type of flock of sheep have been used
for the economic model. The first corresponds to a transhumant cattle herd of 45 heads located in the
Sahel. The two other types correspond to relatively sedentary cattle herds located throughout Burkina
Faso, which are integrated with cropping activities through the use of ox-drawn cultivation and organic
manure.
7.4   Inputs and financial prices. For cropping activities, the major inputs used in production are
labor, fertilizer, farm chemicals and improved seeds. Labor, the single most important component of
crop production costs in Burkina Faso, accounts for about 60 to 80 percent of total input costs. Fertilizer
use in Burkina Faso is extremely low at 7.5 kg/ha. Prices for these inputs are set by the government
(subsidies were suppressed in 1996, along with an important increase in the farmgate price of cotton).
Other inputs of increasing importance in food crop production are improved seeds and agrochemicals for
seed treatment.
7.5    Output markets and financial prices. The major constraints to efficient marketing of
agricultural outputs are a poor distribution network, which leads to wide disparity between farmgate and
retail market prices and seasonal price fluctuations; inadequate low-cost storage at the farm level; and
inadequate processing capacity at the village level. The project includes research and extension activities
to alleviate a part of these constraints, in particular through farmer organizations. As demand for
domestically produced crops is high, the above project activities would facilitate the market absorption
of the increased production to be generated under the project.



31
7.6    Farm and Herd Financial Budgets. For the agricultural component, the farm-level returns
were estimated on the basis of "with project" and "without project" situations. Six models were
reviewed in the crop production situations and four for the livestock component. All farm budgets
showed a significant increase of returns to farm family; a major part of this increase can be attributed to
project interventions (Annex 4, Appendix A). The benefit/cost ratios (B:C ratios) for the different crop
budgets with the project varied from to 1.06 to 1.95, as against the B:C ratios without the project of 0.92
to 1.91. The ratios were calculated after allowing the present farm salaries to be paid for the family labor
in the without-project situation, and increased salaries for the with-the-project situation. The best B:C
ratio would be possible to reach by cultivating valley-bottom rice (anywhere in the country), followed by
the farm model using oxen power in the West. The weakest ratio would be reached in the Sahel area
with or without the project, the former being, however, higher.
7.7    Moreover, the budgets that were calculated for herds showed significant increases in returns to
breeders, mainly because of project interventions (Annex 4, Appendix B). For instance, in the year 10
after the project start, the herds of the adopting owners would have grown up to 45 percent more
(depending on the type of the herd) in the with-project case than without. The incremental benefit
resulting from the value of milk, meat, hides and manure would be 41 percent to 51 percent higher in the
with-project case.
B. Project-Level Economic Analysis
7.8    Approach and assumptions (Implementation Manual, Annex 4). Economic benefits from the
project were determined on the basis of the following assumptions: (a) a project life of 20 years, 12
commencing with a one-year lag for the accrual of benefits; (b) an investment period of six years,
including the total costs of the research, agricultural service and farner organization components, but
excluding the costs of the support to the restructuring of AGRI-RA; (c) a without-project situation
generally increasing slightly because of inputs remaining from the predecessor project and informal
transfer of technology through other than project channels ( including herds that were assumed to grow
in both cases); (d) all prices of outputs and inputs expressed in 1996 constant economic values; and (e)
an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. For internationally traded commodities such as rice and
cotton, import parity farm-gate prices were used.
7.9    The number of typical farms or herd owners that would adopt technical farm or livestock
packages and benefit from the full impact of this adoption was estimated by the mission on the basis of
the adoption rates reported under the ongoing project (PRSAP I) by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
of the DVA of AGRI-RA. The adoption rates used in the base case of the present economic model are on
average 40 percent higher than the adoption rates reported for Phase I; they vary from 10 to 15 percent
of the total number of existing farms according to the ecological zone and the type of farm. In the farm
models, a farm that adopts the proposed technical package in project year (PY) n is supposed to reach the
yield objectives in year n+4. For each PY, one sixth of the total target standard farms (total target is 10
to 15 percent of the existing farms) are assumed to adopt the proposed technical package. Every five
years the benefits are reduced by 30 percent to take into account periodical drought.
2 / The economic analysis was computed at appraisal for a six-year project period. Because this project is
a second phase of a longer term-program, the computation period was not changed at post-appraisal
when the project period was reduced to four years.



32
7.10   Project costs in the economic analysis. The costs used in the economic analysis of the project
contain incremental costs of investment and recurrent costs, including physical contingencies, for both
the research and agricultural services component. Cost of support to the restructuring of AGRI-RA is
excluded from the economic analysis. The base case takes into account only costs of staff under contract
to be financed by the proposed IDA Credit (which represents a small proportion of the total staffing costs
necessary to implement the project).
7.11   Economic rate of return and net present value. Based on the foregoing assumptions, the
economic rate of return calculated for NASDP II is estimated at 39 percent with a net present value
(NPV) of CFAF 58 billions at an opportunity cost of investment capital (OCIR) of 12 percent.
7.12   The costs of the project's main components can also be expressed as percentage of agricultural
GDP. For agricultural research, the costs are about 0.5 percent of the agricultural GDP and for
agricultural extension a little less. In relation to public expenditure, the demand of counterpart funds for
the implementation of the project, about US$1.5 million equivalent per year, would equal about 2.1
percent of the 1997 government budget for all projects.
7.13   Sensitivity analysis. The following factors were determined as likely to affect project viability:
decrease in assumed incremental benefits linked to lower yields and/or lower adoption rates; increase in
costs of rural labor; increase in project costs; and delayed project impact and benefits. For a given
percentage of variation from the base case of one given variable, the corresponding ERR was computed
(Annex 4, Appendix C). The ERR is not very sensitive to changes in individual variables. For instance,
a 60 percent reduction in the projected incremental farm and livestock output, or both combined, would
still give an estimated ERR of 23 percent, 33 percent, and 19 percent, respectively. A 100 percent
increase in the cost of labor, a 20 percent increase in total project costs, and a two-year delay in project
implementation would still allow an ERR at 30 percent, 31 percent and 27 percent, respectively. The
switching value analysis, using 12 percent opportunity cost of capital, would allow the project costs to
increase by 350 percent before the project net present value (NPV) would be equal to zero.
VIII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Benefits and Justification
8.1    Project benefits. The programs supported by the project are expected to help increase
agricultural productivity and develop sustainable production systems for rainfed crops, irrigated crops
and livestock production for the domestic market and for export. These form a set of direct quantifiable
benefits used in the financial and economic analysis (Chapter 7). Direct but non-quantified benefits
under the proposed project are: improved nutritional status of rural households through diversification of
cropping systems and increase of milk and meat consumption; increased employment; human resource
development, including improved literacy and numeracy; and improved productivity of on rural women
through targeting part of the extension information to women farmers. Indirect project benefits, also not
quantified in this analysis, derive from enhancing of food security in poor rural households, allowing
subsistence producers to replenish stocks of food and seeds, which are usually reduced or depleted
during the lean season. The project would also promote somewhat increased use of fertilizer, leading to
improved soils to better sustain smallholder farming activities, as well as environmentally friendly
farming practices.
8.2    Farmers' access to inputs, availability of credit, and post-harvest technologies are expected to
improve during the project period. Institution building under the project would improve the efficiency



33
and effectiveness of both the public agricultural services and farmer organizations. In liaison with the
Agriculture SECAL, the public agricultural services would be restructured to focus on appropriate
research and extension and become more cost-efficient. By improving the managerial capacity and
economic power of farmer organizations, the program would contribute to improved welfare of farmers
and rural poor, and to increase added value of agricultural products. The project would also promote the
rural private sector by creating an enabling environment for farmer organizations and local traders to
take on roles as marketers of inputs, a role that would be transferred to them from the CRPAs.
8.3.   Environmental issues. The main potential environmental issue concerns the possibility of
longer-term farm land degradation resulting from the adoption of more intensive but not sustainable
production systems. However, the agricultural research, extension, and on-farm adaptation programs
would emphasize sustainable land and water resource management and agroforestry as part of the
technology packages to be promoted to farmers. The project would be closely linked with the Natural
Resources Management Project and would extend the technology developed under that project to more
numerous farm communities. Moreover, adoption of better farming techniques on farmed land would
reduce the necessity of expanding agriculture into more marginal lands. The project would not involve
any resettlement of people or financing of agrochemicals. The proposed project is designed to promote
environmentally sustainable agriculture. At initial project identification and in line with general regional
policy regarding agricultural services projects, this project was classified as Category C. However,
preappraisal review determined that it should be classified as Category B. Consequently, the
Government will need to carry out a targeted environmental analysis according to Bank guidelines. At
the time of negotiations, the consultants for environmental analysis had been invited to make proposals
for the assignment. Completion of this study would be a condition of effectiveness of the project.
(Environmental effects are also discussed in Annex VI of the Project Implementation Manual.)
8.4    Program Objectives and Poverty Categories. The Poverty Profile 1996 shows that the incidence
of poverty is 52 percent in subsistence agriculture, substantially higher than for the population in general
(35 percent). Rural areas must therefore become the focal point of public service delivery and efforts to
improve access to financial resources. The smallholder farmers, including women, being the main target
group of this project, the main program objectives would be the alleviation of rural poverty and farmer
empowerment. The applicable Targeted Intervention Categories are expected to be Raising Productivity
and Poverty Alleviation.
8.5    Participatory Approach. Project preparation relied mainly on documents prepared by the
implementing agencies and experience gained over the last 6 to 7 years in implementing a similar project
in Burkina Faso. Project preparation work was done entirely by staff of the two ministries involved in
the project. Early client consultation started in 1995, at which time AGRI-RA began a process of
preparing a participatory action plan, with an adequate focus on women, as well as obtaining the
viewpoints of the involved agencies, particularly smallholder farmers and their organizations. Work
performed by consultants under this assignment was extensively discussed at regional and national
workshops and conferences before preappraisal. On the side of agricultural research, the research
institutes have been year involving farmer organizations in their work for a year or two by making
contracts on research assignments of direct interest to the members of these organizations. In the future,
farmers' participation in the Agricultural Services Program, including agricultural research, will be
strengthened by enhancing the capacity of farmers' organizations to participate in planning,
implementation and evaluation at different levels, including workshops on a strategy for agricultural
services, regional technology reviews, diagnosis at village and farm levels, program evaluations and
impact assessments. The participatory approach will be based on methodology and experience already



34
well established for developing village land management plans (gestion des terroirs). The principle of
participatory approach has been agreed with the Government at the initial stage of preparation.
B. Risks
8.6    Besides the climatic uncertainties, the main project risks--impossible to quantify--are: (a)
potential reversal of sound economic policies, including implementation of the proposed restructuring of
AGRI-RA; (b) inadequate counterpart funding; and (c) constraints to achieving better efficiency of
extension services, including potential lack of inputs. The approach used in this report was to analyze
the factors involved, assess their impact on project outcomes, establish a subjective probability of their
likely occurrence based on country information and field knowledge, and propose mitigating measures
that can be taken by (he Borrower (Implementation Manual, Annex 4, Appendix C).
8.7    According to this analysis, the high-risk factors for project implementation appear to be the
potential lack of counterpart funding l and less-than-needed efficiency of the project institutions. These
have been taken into account in designing the project as follows:
-    Agricultural policies and restructuring of AGRI-R4. Many of the sector issues that often
hinder agricultural development are unlikely to affect this project. Most of these issues began
to be addressed under the Agricultural Adjustment Credit program (SECAL I) and they should
be resolved during the Second National Agricultural Adjustment Credit program (SECAL II).
They include improvement in the performance of public-sector institutions supporting
agricultural development and competitiveness of key subsectors (rice, sugar, cotton and
livestock). These improvements, if implemented, would support the effect of the investments
under this project. To reduce the risk of implementation failure or delay, the project would
provide funds to facilitate the restructuring of AGRI-RA and would include conditionalities to
ensure that the deadlines are met.
-    Counterpartfunds. Delayed provision of counterpart funds, a problem experienced in the past,
would be reduced by adapting the project scope and the share of recurrent costs to be financed
by the Borrower to the Borrower's financial capacity, and seeking a relatively high level of
IDA financing as requested by the Government. Increasing assistance from other multilateral
and bilateral donors, usually in the form of grants, is also expected to facilitate achievement of
project objectives.
-    The efficiency of the extension services. Inefficiencies could result from a possible lack of
adapted technologies and lower-than-projected adoption rates by producers. These
inefficiencies would be mitigated by implementing regional technology reviews, improving
linkages between research and extension, developing participatory approaches and getting
farmer organizations involved in planning and deciding on the type and quality of agricultural
services and establishing priorities and adapting the pace of program implementation.
13/ The Government has provided the requested counterpart funds under the predecessor projects during
the recent years, but the amounts have been smaller that during the proposed project.

the Management Letter (long form), and a statement as to whether or not Bank funds had been
used for their intended purpose, would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the
fiscal year of each agency (5.7);
(d) the Government would prepare annually work programs and budgets for NASDP II for the
coming year and submit these to IDA for comments (para 5.8);
(e) a Project Steering Committee would be established to provide support to NASDP II and meet at
least every six months (6.1);

contribution to the content of extension messages relating to agricultural technology, training of
the Technical Specialists and financial arrangements to carry out this cooperation (6.14);
(g) a study to assess the feasibility of transforming LNE into an independent administrative entity
(EPA) would be prepared and its results implemented during the first project year (6.18);
(h) when selecting farmer organizations to benefit from project funds, the project authorities would
use criteria and a process acceptable to IDA (6.22);
(i) payment for specialized advisory services to pigs and poultry producers would be progressively
introduced (4.14; 6.19);
(j) preparation of the Human Resource Development Plans would be based on skill-gap analysis and
annual training programs be reviewed by IDA before being implemented (6.27);
(k) consultants would be recruited--using procedures acceptable to IDA--to help establish a
coordinated monitoring system and carry out independent impact evaluations(6.28); and
(I) semiannual progress reports and the midterm review would be prepared within three months
from the end of the reporting period and the Implementation Completion Report within six
months (6.30 -6.31);



36
9.1    The conditions for the effectiveness of the Credit would be as follows:
(a) agricultural research: (i) presentation to IDA of a manual for CNRST on financial control and
external audits and a manual on the procedures of evaluating the researchers; and (ii) adoption
by CNRST of a manual of procedures for the approval of programs and their monitoring and
evaluation; and (iii) adoption by INERA and IRSAT of an internal management manual (6.4);
(b) animal health: improving the enabling environment for private animal health operators with the
following measures: (i)) promulgation of a decree ('arr&e) requiring full recovery of costs by
AGRI-RA for public sector services that can be supplied by private veterinarians (treatment of
animals, non-obligatory vaccinations, sale of pharmaceutical products), including provisions for
their annual updates; and (ii) promulgation by the Government of a decree governing the
subcontracting ("mandat sanitaire") of public sector tasks, such as meat inspection and
compulsory vaccination (4.14);
(c) counterpartfunding: depositing in the Project Account of the respective project implementation
agencies (CU, INERA and IRSAT) the Government's share of project expenditures for three
months (5.3);
(d) audit: employment of independent auditors for the project implementation units (5.7); and
(e) environment: completion of a targeted environmental analysis by consultants (8.3).
9.3    The dated covenants of the Credit would be as follows:
(a) agricultural research: (i) CRNST would take into use the new criteria for evaluation and
promotion of researchers before December 31, 1998 (6.10); and (ii) CRNST would start using
latest by December 31, 1998 a set of evaluation criteria for determining the annual merit
increases for all personnel who contribute to research work (6.11);
(b) disbursement of certain items: (i) disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be authorized once the
institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems similar to INERA (5.4);
and
(c) reorganization ofAGRI-RA: (i) redeployment of personnel and organizing the related transfers as
per the reorganization plan before June 30, 1998. These arrangements would need to include
separation of the control and advice functions at the level of field agents and unification of the
available livestock personnel into the national extension system, based on annual action plans for
each province; and (ii) completion of financial audits of the assets and liabilities of the ex-
CRPAs by an independent /audit firm no later than April 30, 1998; (iii) and liquidation of the
assets and liabilities of the ex-CRPAs not later than December 31, 1998 (6.23).
9.5    Recommendation. With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for
an IDA Credit of US$41.3 million, on standard IDA terms with 40 years of maturity.

IDA guidelines of goods, works and services (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits, January 1995 and as revised in January and August 1996 (Procurement Guidelines) and
Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency,
January 1997 (Consultant Guidelines). Contracts to supply goods and equipment, vehicles, and civil
engineering services for the project would be put up for bid and awarded by the project implementation
units (Project Coordination Unit for AGRI-RA, and INERA and IRSAT for MESSRS), or, if above their
approval limits, by the authorized bodies in the Government system (the respective Ministry and the
National Procurement Office). Preference for domestically manufactured goods in ICB will apply in
accordance with World bank Guidelines.
Contracts for civil works
2     All bidding documents and contracts in this category except small rehabilitationworks and works
for the pilot component "small rural infrastructures"valued at less than US$50,000 each, would be procured
through NCB and reviewed by IDA. Rehabilitationand constructionworks would usually be grouped into
regional lots to enable local small and medium-size enterprises to participate in the bidding, although
overseas firms and firms from elsewhere in the country may also bid. Documentation acceptable to IDA
would be required. Contracts for the pilot components,estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent,
could be made by using "communityparticipation"method, followingproceduresstated in the
Implementation Manual, acceptable to IDA, with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3 million
equivalent.
Contracts for vehicles. goods and equipment
3.    Contracts for vehicles, goods and equipmentwould be grouped by lots. All lots valued at over
US$200,000 would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure based on use
of the World Bank model documentation. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to
IDA could be used for contracts in the range of US$50,000 to US$200,000. IDA's prior approval of the
bidding documents and contract would be required for ICB and NCB procurement. Contracts under
US$50,000 to purchase vehicles and small equipment, which should not exceed a total of US$2 million
during the project, may be awarded on the basis of local or international shopping, provided at least three
competent competitorsare invited to bid. The implementation units would be requested to prepare a
computer-based system to monitor that the aggregate amounts agreed upon will not be exceeded (see
para 5).

N.B.  Figures in parentheses are the amounts to be financed by IDA.
5.    Monitoring of contracts. The Administration and Finance Section of Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) in AGRI-RA, and INERA and IRSAT under CNRST, would set up a computerizeddata base for
monitoringprojectprocurementcontractsand keep it up to dateatall times. A contractstatusstatementfor

each project componentwould be a mandatorypart of the progress report submitted to IDA two weeks prior
to each half-yearly supervision mission. Component contract managers would be invited to take part in the
technical training sessions regularly organized by the World Bank for the benefit of the subregion, the
expenses involved being eligible for inclusion as project costs.
6.     Procurement schedules. Procurement packages will be based on the detailed cost tables of the
project and procurement schedules would be prepared by project implementation units before
negotiations on the basis of the cost tables to be discussed at appraisal. The schedules would be updated
annually and maintained as part of this Annex of the Implementation Manual (Appendices I - 3).

ANNEX III
Page 5 of 7
7.     Measures to ensure adequateprocurementcapacity. The PIU at AGRI-RA and INERA already
have substantial experience in the use of the Bank's procurement guidelines. At the beginning, the
ProcurementOfficerof [NERA would assist IRSAT to get its procurementoperationsstarted. However, in
the longer run also IRSAT needs to engage and train its own procurement officer. The measures to ensure
otherwise high qual ity of procurementoperations include:
- standardprocurementprocessingtimetables,includinggestiontimeforcompletionofdeliveries;
- a draft procurement schedule for the project period, to be updated annually;
- post-reviewsby the Bank staffand a third part (procurementagentsand auditors); and
-      - supplementaryand state-of-the-arttraining ofthe procurementstaff in the implementation units.
8.     Documents to be used:
- for ICB: World Bank Standard Bidding Documents;
- for NCB: Standard bidding documents based on the Bank's SBD;
- for consultants: the Bank's standard contracts; samples for Letters of Invitation (LOI) and
Supplementary Information to Bidders; and
- other documents include: the Bank's standard bid evaluation form and standard general and
specific procurement notices.
B. Disbursementof IDA Credit
9.    In view of Burkina Faso's difficult macroeconomic situation, IDA would finance 100 percent of
project costs less taxes in categories other than civil works, contractual staff salaries and operating costs. In
thesecategoriesthe Government'scontributionwould be 5 percent,25 percentand 25 percent,respectively.
The Governmentwould pay, through budgetaryarrangements,an estimated CFAF 3.1 billion (US$6
million),or 12.5 percentoftotal cost, plus taxes on the items procured underthe project. If therewould be
local purchases of equipment and vehicles, IDA financing would be 90 percent.
10.    The Disbursement Division of the World Bank (LOAAF) would send a Disbursement Letter to
the Government once the project has been approved. The Letter, giving details of the disbursement
procedures, would be attached to the Implementation Manual as Annex III. It would contain, inter alia,
the following information:
(a) Disbzursement conditions: disbursement against all categories of the Credit would be allowed
at the effectiveness of the project, except that: (i) disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be
authorized once the institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems
similar to INERA; and (ii) the research agencies would have authority to withdraw funds
against the civil works, goods and equipment and training after the institutes have prepared a
development plan for the respective Centre, a plan of goods and equipment to be purchased
(both these plans approved by the planning commissions), and an annual training plan (agreed
upon with IDA), respectively;
(b) Use of statement of expenses: all replenishmentapplicationsshould be fully documented except
for contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent for civil works, goods and equipment,
consultant firms (US$20,000 for individual consultants),training, studies and operating costs,
which would be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures(SOEs); and

(c) SpecialAccount.- (denominated in CFAfrancs). theauthorizedallocationswouldamountto
CFAF 500 million for AGRI-RA, CFAF 400 million for INERA and CFAF 100 million for
IRSAT, and would cover about four months of eligible expenditures. IDA would depositthe
authorized allocation as per the Development Credit Agreement in each Special Account upon
effectiveness, except in the case of IRSAT where disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be
authorized once the institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems
similar to [NERA. The Special Accounts would be for payments below CFAF 50 million,
representing 20 percent of the authorized allocation. For direct payment: minimum application
amount would be above 20 percent of the Special Account deposit.

project accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices acceptable to IDA. An annual
audit report of project accounts, including reports of the Statements of Expenditures (SOE) and
Special Accounts, will be submitted to IDA no more than six months after completion of each
fiscal year. They shall be prepared by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and be in
