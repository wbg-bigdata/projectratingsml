F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's specific development objectives are to support actions by the Government of the
Congo to:
 Slow the spread of HIV-AIDS and
                                                       ii
  Strengthen support and care for people infected or affected by HIV-AIDS.

  To reach these objectives, the Project follows the proven approach of supporting action across
several sectors and not just in the health system. (12 sector ministries are involved). More precisely,
the Project supports actions to:
  (i) Support civil society and community initiatives for HIV-AIDS prevention and care;
  (ii) Expand access to treatment of opportunistic infections;
  (iii) Care and support for people living with HIV-AIDS (PLWHA);
  (iv) Care for orphans & other highly vulnerable children; and
  (v) Reduce transmission among high risk groups.

1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       Country context. Despite advantages stemming from its natural resources (especially oil
and forest products) and a relatively small and urbanized population (roughly 60% of the population
live in the major cities), Congo’s development has been hampered by political, economic and social
problems. Decades of single party rule, poor economic management, and falling petroleum prices
during the 80’s contributed to unrest, which led to the National Conference (1990) and the
reestablishment of a multi-party system. Poverty and competition for national resources continued,
however, and contributed to social stresses and three periods of violent conflict: in 1993-94, 1997,
and 1998-99. At the height of the crisis in late 1999, an estimated 810,000 people, or about one-
third of the Congolese population, were displaced. Though a cease-fire accord was signed
December 1999, agreement with the last rebel group was only reached in March 2003.
2.       The recurrent conflicts severely damaged physical infrastructure in the country: (i) about
half the national road network was not passable; (ii) schools, particularly in the south, suffered
considerable damage; and (iii) agriculture was devastated (with an estimated 50% of agricultural
tools destroyed and 75% of livestock lost). Damage to public well-being was perhaps even greater:
(i) life expectancy dropped from about 52 years in the early 1990s to 48.6 years in 2002; and (ii) the
proportion of Congolese living below the poverty line increased from about 30% at the beginning of
the conflicts to 70% at the end. Several groups were considered particularly vulnerable: some 11%
of children under 15 were orphans, about 60,000 women and girls were victims of rape, and 5,000
children fought during the war.
3.      The health sector was not spared. First, more than half of all health facilities were ransacked,
and buildings, equipment, and access to clean water deteriorated for lack of preventive maintenance
or repair. Second, the number of health staff declined (from 7,400 in 1995 to 4,500 in 2002), and the
distribution of personnel (always skewed toward urban areas) became even more concentrated with
over 75% of staff in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. In addition, pay cuts, lack of promotional
opportunities, and insecurity had reduced the motivation of these personnel. Third, the public
agency responsible for procuring essential drugs and supplies (CENAMES, created in 1995) had
never been able to overcome the handicaps of civil disorder, despite assistance from the European
Community.
4.      Beginning in 2003, the country initiated reconstruction (financed by oil revenues and
assistance from the IMF, World Bank and European Union) and political reform (focused on
decentralization to improve service delivery and empower communities). Though GDP recovered
rapidly, social indicators continued to trail significantly behind, and progress was further
complicated by the advent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
5.      HIV/AIDS situation and the national response. HIV/AIDS was first diagnosed in Congo
in 1983 and by the end of 1996 had become a major cause of death among adults aged 15 to 45
(35% of all deaths in this age group, with a total of 10,777 AIDS cases reported). The successive
conflicts reduced the sentinel surveillance system, but a limited survey conducted by the Ministry of
Health (MOH) in 2000 showed that 14.6% of pregnant women were infected with HIV in Pointe-
Noire and 5.4% in Brazzaville. In 2001, UNAIDS estimated that 110,000 people were living with
HIV and that the national sero-prevalence rate was 7.2%. A national HIV sero-prevalence survey
carried out in November 2003 (but limited essentially to urban areas) established the national sero



                                                   1
prevalence rate for the adult population at 4.2% with women 20-35 years old suffering from higher
infection rates 1, and at a younger age, than men.
6.      In response to the growing problem, the National AIDS Program (PNLS) was established in
1987 within the Ministry of Health; the National AIDS Committee was established in 1988 to make
policy. Thereafter, the PNLS launched a series of plans: an emergency plan, followed successively
by a short-term plan (1988), a first medium-term plan (1989-1991) and a second medium-term plan
(1996-1998). The 1997 war prevented any implementation of the second plan and prevented the
collection of regular data on the evolution of the epidemic. There was a consensus, however, that
insecure social and political conditions had increased poverty, weakened health services, and
undoubtedly contributed to increased prevalence.
7.       At the end of 2000, the Government launched a series of important initiatives: (i) on AIDS
Day 2000, the President announced the Government's decision to re-launch the AIDS program; (ii)
in April 2001, he signed a decree creating the HIV Mother-to-Child Transmission Prevention
Project (MCTP); and (iii) in November 2001, he announced the approval of an annual expenditure
of CFAF 1 billion as the Government's contribution to the care and treatment of PLWHA. Congo
also: (i) prepared a three-year plan for 2002-04; (ii) was included in the UN’s "Accelerated Access
to HIV/AIDS Care" Initiative (ACCESS) enabling it to benefit from lower prices for anti-retro-viral
(ARV) drugs from the major pharmaceutical companies; and (iii) participated in the Congo-
Oubangui-Chari Rivers initiative to fight HIV/AIDS. Concurrently, the Ministry of Education’s
launched a project to prevent AIDS in Congo’s schools (PRESIEC) with the assistance of UN
agencies (UNDP, UNESCO, and UNICEF) and others. Finally, UNDP began working with the
private sector to make it aware of the socio-economic implications of the pandemic.
8.      Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. A Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) 2 for 2001-02 was approved by the Board in January 2001 to support the
Government in facing the challenges of: (i) advancing the democratization of political life; (ii)
physically reconstructing the country; and (iii) improving economic management, comprising a
five-pronged approach: (i) strengthening economic reforms, stability and equitable growth; (ii)
reestablishing basic economic and social services; (iii) building capacity of government and civil
society; (iv) fighting the growing threat of HIV/AIDS 3; and (v) providing assistance to war-affected
and vulnerable groups.
9. Overall, the project intended to contribute directly to the fourth strategy and indirectly to the
second and third strategies, by fighting HIV/AIDS, particularly among war-affected and vulnerable
groups (e.g., displaced persons, rape victims, orphans, and PLWA. In addition, the project was
expected to contribute to other areas including: reestablishing social services in parts of the health
system; building the capacity of Government by investing in the development of the National Aids
Council (CNLS), the National Technical HIV/AIDS Commission and its secretariat, funding
HIV/AIDS programs in ministries, and developing the capacity of civil society to initiate actions in


1
  Particularly in the war-damaged Niari Valley towns of Dolisie and Sibiti, where sero-prevalence rates among women
20-35 years old were about 10%. The survey also confirmed the HIV sero-prevalence rate of 7.9 % found in sentinel
sites based on pregnant women.
2
  In the case of post conflict countries, such as the Republic of Congo, a Transitional Support Strategy covering two
years is prepared; it addresses the issues of stabilization, reconstruction and the return to development. A TSS with
similar objectives was completed in August 2003 for FY04 and FY05.
3
  The Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Living Conditions Improvement Project which became effective in
2002 included an HIV awareness component and construction/equipping of two HIV test centers in Brazzaville.

the area of HIV/AIDS.
10. Bank support was justified by several important factors: (i) the lingering effects of civil unrest
which had contributed to persistent social problems (risky sexual behavior, inadequate management
of STIs, etc.) and the lack of partners and potential financing for addressing serious health sector
issues (infrastructure, human resources, drugs, etc.); and (ii) the lack of proven strategies to address
prevention at the grassroots level and the Government’s limited partnership with and inadequate
resources for improving the institutional and managerial capacities of an emerging and untested
civil society network to scale up and intensify prevention efforts.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
11.    The PAD’s specific development objectives were to support the Government’s actions to: (i)
slow the spread of HIV/AIDS; and (ii) strengthen support and care for people infected or affected
by HIV/AIDS. The DGA rephrased these objectives as assisting the Recipient to: (i) limit the spread
of HIV/AIDS and STIs in the Recipient's population; (ii) mitigate the health and socioeconomic
impact of HIV/AIDS and STIs on persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and STIs within
the Recipient's territory; and (iii) build strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.
12.     Project impact was to be measured among key vulnerable groups, as defined in the outcome
indicators, comprising the following:
   Limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs
   • By project end, 60% of adults 15-49 use a condom during their last sexual contact with a
      casual partner;
   • By project end, 90% of people aged 15-49 report knowledge of vertical transmission
      (mother to child) and 90% mention condoms as a prevention measure;
   • By project end, 70% of women attending prenatal consultations will accept voluntary testing
      for HIV;
   • By project end, HIV prevalence among 15-24-year-old pregnant women is <2% and among
      14- 19 year old men 1.5%;
   • By project end, the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) among pregnant
      women decreases to 2%
As shown, only the first PDO was addressed by the indicators under the original grant, and only
pregnant women were singled out to as a vulnerable group.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
13.     The original PDOs were formally revised in May 2009, when additional project financing
was approved to: (i) support priority interventions responding to evidence on the drivers of the
epidemic; (ii) scale up activities targeting higher-risk and vulnerable population groups (orphans
and other vulnerable children, commercial sex workers, widows, youth, indigenous people, sexual
minorities, the uniformed services, and prisoners); (iii) build capacity for sustainability and
incorporate lessons of experience; and (iv) leverage additional government and donor funding and
apply the Bank’s global knowledge and experience.
14.     The revised project development objective was to contribute to the Recipient's efforts to: (i)
limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs in the Recipient’s population; (ii) mitigate the health and
socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS and STIs on persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS
                                                   3
and STIs; and (iii) build strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. One KPI for the first PDO was changed (and two others modified), and KPI were added
for the other two PDO:
      Limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs
      • By project end, 60% of adults 15-49 use a condom during their last sexual contact with a
         casual partner;
      • By project end, 90% of people aged 15-49 report knowledge of vertical transmission
         (mother to child) and 90% mention condoms as a prevention measure;
      • By project end, 90% of women attending prenatal consultations will accept voluntary testing
         for HIV;
      • By project end, HIV prevalence among 15-19 year old women remains at 1.4%;
      • By project end, 80% of pregnant women living with HIV receive anti retrovirals to reduce
         the risk of mother to child transmission;
      Mitigate the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS and STIs on persons infected with
      or affected by HIV/AIDS and STIs
      • By project end, 15,000 PLWHA benefit from ARV treatment and monitoring at the
          frequency in the National Guidelines;
      • By project end, 25,200 of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) have received a package
          of services;
      Build strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic
      • By project end, all regional HIV/AIDS committees (UDLS) report annually on at least 75%
         of the indicators specified in the Project Implementation Manual.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
15.      Five of the eleven regions were included in the project, but the entire population was
expected to benefit from the prevention efforts, particularly: (i) those in the productive age brackets;
(ii) those most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, such as pregnant women, commercial sex-workers, persons
in uniform, long-distance traders, forestry workers and the young in general; (iii) PLWHA and their
immediate families (estimated at more than half a million people); and (iv) orphans and families
headed by children. The PAD identified four kinds of benefits: (i) economic (resulting from
prevention of the spread of the disease among the most productive elements of the population); (ii)
social (resulting from the improved capacity to provide support to groups infected or affected by
HIV/AIDS); (iii) institutional (resulting from the strengthened capacity of key stakeholders and
community groups); and (iv) health (resulting from contributions to the country’s prevention,
diagnosis and treatment efforts 4.
1.5 Original Components
16.    Component 1: Public sector response (US$ 4.70 million). In accordance with the National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, the project was expected to provide support to the Ministry of Health and
12 non-health ministries were responsible for coordinating the public sector response.
17.    Sub-component A: Health sector response (US$ 2.6 million). The Ministry of Health was
expected to strengthen priority actions for: (i) a range of preventive actions; and (ii) an overall


4
    See also Annex 3.
                                                   4
approach to care, support and treatment to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS. The preventive actions
aimed to support:
    •    establishment of a system to purchase, promote, and distribute condoms, using social
         marketing;
    •    programs for diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of sexually transmitted infections;
    •    development and implementation of a national policy on voluntary testing, including
         counseling units with personnel specially trained in psycho-social and cultural aspects of
         HIV/AIDS; and
    •    bio-security measures to improve: (i) blood transfusion services, including the protection of
         health personnel and the provision of emergency therapy in case of accidental exposure; (ii)
         hygiene and prevention in clinical settings by rationalizing the use of injections,
         systematically disposing of needles, etc.; and supporting the proper elimination of medical
         waste.
18.     The overall approach to care, support and treatment to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS had
as objectives to support: (i) a full range of medical interventions comprising laboratory monitoring,
prevention and treatment of opportunistic diseases (including tuberculosis), prescription and
delivery of drugs (for STIs, OIs, and ARVs), and non-medical support to patients; (ii) prevention of
mother to child transmission; and (iii) care for victims of sexual violence. The sub-component
would rehabilitate health units providing counseling, voluntary testing/diagnosis, and treatment
services, support the preparation of guides (on STIs, counseling and treatment of PLWHA, etc.),
and train health personnel.
19.      Sub-component B: Non-health sector response (US$ 2.1 million). The non-health ministries
were expected to: (i) establish five-member teams (including a focal point and an accountant) 5; and
(ii) plan and implement action plans to benefit the vulnerable groups under their jurisdiction both at
both central and regional levels. These plans comprised both “essential? actions and “supporting
actions? (such as training, transport, etc.) necessary to carry out the essential activities. The
ministerial interventions were expected to be phased with: (i) an initial period devoted to support
(specifically six national guides prepared under the PHRD) and training for the teams; and (ii) a
subsequent period focused mostly on social communication and advocacy 6; activities aimed at the
vulnerable groups under their jurisdiction.
20.     Component 2: Civil society sector response (US$ 3.50 million). The project intended to
provide support for the civil society response by financing community-based interventions and the
private sector.
21.     Sub-component A: Community-based interventions. The sub-component was expected to:
(i) channel financing for qualifying micro-projects proposed by civil society (comprising national
NGOs, unions, private sector and community-based organizations such as churches, parent-teacher
associations, traditional leaders, clubs, etc.); and (ii) provide technical support to these CSO through
national or international NGOs which would conduct rapid participative assessments; help the CSO
to identify their priorities and formulate their micro-projects; assure institutional strengthening
(including setting up associations, training personnel, etc.); and assess the quality of the CSO



5
 These teams were not envisioned in the first decree (2002) but were later included in the revised decree (2004).
6
 There were exceptions such as the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of
Communication which focused on other matters as well.

activities.
22.     Sub-component B: Private sector response. Based on initiatives promoted by UNDP and
follow-up contacts by the SEP/CNLS, the employer association (UNICONGO) and other private
sector associations, the Project would provide limited support (including training, especially for
peer education, and provision of educational materials) to enterprises that request assistance the
private sector would receive assistance for training and provision of educational materials to address
the effects of the HIV pandemic on their personnel and their enterprises.
23.    Component 3: Orphans and other extremely vulnerable children (US$ 3.50 million).
With the intention of gaining practical knowledge in assisting OVC and to preparing a larger-scale
component, the project initiated (with assistance from Médécins d'Afrique as well as UNICEF, the
World Food Program (WFP), and the Ministry of Social Welfare) a pilot project to assist about 500
orphans in the poor Brazzaville neighborhood of Moungali. The pilot involved: (i) conduct of
household surveys to identify the most vulnerable children using objective indicators of their
vulnerability (e.g., health, education and economic conditions); (ii) definition and delivery of a
basic package of services, comprising: medical insurance (for visits to health centers and for
pharmaceuticals); fees for enrollment in primary school and early secondary school (along with
school uniforms and textbooks) or skills training; and psychological support groups.
24.    Component 4: Management and coordination, capacity building, and monitoring and
evaluation (US$ 6.3 million). The project intended to provide support for policy development and
management, capacity-building, and data collection, monitoring and evaluation.
25.     Sub-component A: Policy development and management. This subcomponent was intended
to support the structures responsible for management of the program (essentially the CNLS and the
Permanent Executive Secretariat), provide training at the different levels, update the requisite
implementation documents (the National Strategic Plan, the annual action plans, etc.), and finance
the contracting out of essential fiduciary functions (financial management, procurement, and data
collection for monitoring & evaluation) to a reputable international firm reporting to the Permanent
Executive Secretariat to the CNLS.
26.     Sub-component B: Capacity building. This sub-component was intended to support capacity
strengthening and training (as well as supply of related equipment and materials) for the CNLS, the
Permanent Executive Secretariat, Government ministries, and civil society organizations. In
addition, the sub-component was expected to finance the recruitment of both long and short-term
experts for specialized tasks (e.g., communications strategies, training in counseling, prescription of
ARVs, support for OVC, etc.).
27.    Sub-components C&D: Data collection, monitoring and evaluation. Following on the
paucity of data available due to the long period of instability and civil conflict, these sub-
components were intended to support: (i) the conduct of a demographic and health survey by the
national statistical authority of the Ministry of Plan (CNSEE) in collaboration with the MOH, the
SEP/CNLS, and the relevant UN agencies (WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA); and (ii) implementation
of an M&E system based on the model established by UNAIDS but simplified and including only
easy-to-measure indicators guaranteed to provide useful information for all levels (and not just for
the central level). Both the DHS survey and the M&E system were initiated under the Project
Preparation Facility.

1.6 Revised Components
28.      The additional financing of the project did not alter the four original project components.
1.7 Other significant changes
29.      The original Development Grant Agreement (DGA) was amended in 2006 to reallocate the
project proceeds by increasing the amounts for: (i) works to cover underestimates at appraisal and
rising cost of works in the country; (ii) pharmaceuticals to meet the rapid increases in persons
seeking treatment for HIV/AIDS and STIs and the effect of inflation over the previous year; and
(iii) service contracts for the civil society activities to compensate for the “gross underestimation?
of the task of building NGO capacities 7.
30.     The project benefitted from two sources of additional financing: (i) in 2007, the project
received a PHRD implementation grant; and (ii) in 2009, the project received Additional Financing
and the project closing date was extended to June 30, 2012. Following a request from Government
in June 2012, US$2 million equivalent was canceled from the project and recommitted to the Water,
Electricity and Urban Development Project to deal with effects of a catastrophic explosion in
Brazzaville.
2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
31.     Project preparation. Despite the country’s significant post-conflict constraints, the
identification mission (April 2002) proposed an ambitious project and a rapid preparation plan
(envisioning effectiveness by June 2003). The Project Concept Document (PCD) review
(September 2002) raised concerns about: (i) potential project complexity if both HIV/AIDS and
health components were included 8; (ii) essential capacity building actions; and (iii) the proposed
preparation schedule, resource requirements 9, and project risk rating.
32.    By November 2002, progress was slow, and there were concerns about both the
Government’s commitment and its technical and financial capacity to fight HIV-AIDS 10 . In
response, it was agreed to use a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) 11 to recruit technical assistance12
to prepare the health and orphan components, conduct the institutional analysis of the Ministry of
Health and the NGOs, and prepare the project implementation manual and the M&E plan.
Concurrently, a Bank-managed PHRD grant 13 would finance: (i) studies (on sero-prevalence,
condom distribution, socio-cultural and behavioral elements, and socio-economic impacts of the
epidemic); (ii) three national reference guides (for peer education, counseling and psycho-social
support); and (iii) a strategy for social communication (to be finalized before project effectiveness).


7
  This was a major contributing factor to the amount spent on Component 4; see Annex 1.
8
  Project cost was also an issue, but the review meeting maintained the proposed amount of US$14 million. The meeting
further agreed that project financing of ARVs would not be considered until UNAIDS criteria were met.
9
  In view of the amount of preparatory work required, the review recommended that both a PHRD and a PPF be
requested.
10
   In addition, an audit of the EU’s essential drugs procurement agency and evaluations of other EU projects indicated
widespread corruption, particularly in the health sector with allegations of trafficking in medications, notably ARVs.
11
   A first PPF, in the amount of US$600,000, was approved in January 2003; a second PPF in the amount of
US$400,000 was approved in November 2003.
12
   The mission proposed (and the Government agreed) to recruit the firm on a sole source basis because of the time
constraints. It was also proposed that this firm (or another) could assist the project implementation team during the first
year of the project.
13
   The PHRD grant, in the amount of US$628,575, became effective in February 2003.
                                                            7
33.     Subsequently, the pace of project preparation accelerated. In December 2002, the National
AIDS Council (CNLS) was created under the Presidency of the Republic; members were appointed
in September 2003 (including representatives of government agencies and civil society
organizations) and a National Executive Secretariat was staffed. Regional and Local Committees
were set up in line with the ongoing decentralization process. A comprehensive, participatory
HIV/AIDS strategic plan was developed in 2003 for the period 2003-07 and included objectives and
strategies to: (i) contain or reduce the level of the epidemic by 2007; (ii) mitigate the health and
socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels; and (iii)
increase access to prevention services as well as care, treatment and support of those infected and
affected by HIV/AIDS, in particular by developing local responses to the epidemic.
34.     In February 2003, the Government met the remaining MAP eligibility criteria 14 and agreed
with the mission on: (i) the project preparation structures; (ii) the essential technical elements and
geographical scope of the different project components; and (iii) the revised plan and methodology
(including a pilot program for the orphan assistance component 15) for preparing the operational
plans for funding. In addition, preliminary arrangements were initiated to ensure the conduct of a
Demographic and Health Survey by the end of 2003.
35.     The Decision Meeting (January 2004) recommended maintaining the scope of the project
and requested further assessment of the institutional capabilities of the implementing agencies but
did not raise an important issue common to the MAPs, namely the tensions between the National
Executive Secretariat (with newly named staff and supported by consultants, good quality sectoral
plans, and sound arrangements for community-based activities and care for orphans and other
vulnerable children) and the Ministry of Health (with its reduced coordination role, minor
responsibility for procurement of ARVs 16 , weak sectoral plan, and limited participation in
substantive discussions with the Bank). During appraisal, the Bank felt obliged to assist MOH in
revising and completing their action plan and budget, while recognizing the implications for
component ownership. 17
36.   Negotiations were conducted in March 2004, and the project was approved on April 20,
2004.
37. Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis comprised: (i) existing
documentation concerning health sector conditions and risk/vulnerability factors; (ii) studies
financed by the PHRD and PPF; and (iii) current experience with other MAP projects 18. The PHRD
and PPF funds (constituting more than 10% of the total project proceeds) financed several highly
relevant studies between October 2003 and June 2004. Carried out under very difficult
circumstances (which limited some results only to urban areas), these studies enabled the country to
re-establish an HIV/AIDS database 19. Only the preliminary sero-prevalence results were available


14
   The criteria are set out in the Second Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP-2 Report No. P7497AFR of
December 20, 2001).
15
   The NGO Médecins d’Afrique was selected to implement the pilot program for orphan assistance, based on its
experience in the country through UNICEF financing.
16
   Corruption related to the procurement and distribution of ARVs was a major recurring theme, particularly in
discussions with the European Union and in the Back-to-Office Reports to management.
17
   The mission was also concerned by the institutional fragmentation of the Ministry but proposed to wait for the
European Union project to address the issue of ministerial reorganization.
18
   See the MAP-2Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (Report No. P7497AFR of December 20, 2001).
19
   As the studies listed in Annex 9 show, the project contributed to the country’s data base throughout implementation.
This was also a major contributing factor to the amount spent on Component 4; see Annex 1.
                                                           8
to be included in the PAD 20.
38. MAP 1 lessons learned were discussed, including the need for political leadership and
commitment, a multi-sectoral approach, community participation, and effective monitoring and
evaluation. Though the Bank had no Congo-relevant experience for preparing the project, its
discussions with other partners (particularly the Global Fund and the European Commission)
proved useful in identifying complementary as well as problematic areas for project financing. In
particular, during Negotiations, the Bank conditioned any future support for CENAMES (to procure
drugs and other consumables) on progress achieved with EU funding.
39. Government commitment. Though somewhat critical of Government commitment during
preparation, the PAD notes that: (i) support for an HIV/AIDS response had been demonstrated at
the highest levels; (ii) the appropriate coordinating and implementing structures had been
established; and (iii) the necessary measures taken to ensure wide participation in the adoption of
the national strategy and the planned interventions. In addition, Government agreed during
negotiations to finance (beginning in Year 3) some of the additional operational costs of the project,
so as to ensure future financing.
40. Assessment of the project design. Several design options were considered and rejected before
adopting the MAP approach 21. Though there were concerns that the proposed multisectoral and
decentralized design was complex, several measures were introduced to enhance feasibility. A five-
year 22 project was proposed given the limited government and NGO capacity; and the design also
adopted the recommended MAP practices of sequencing and prioritizing project interventions to: (i)
phase in simpler interventions initially while the country was still in a post-conflict mode) and
address more challenging interventions later; (ii) use contracting out and international project
facilitation to provide implementation assistance while building national capacity; and (iii) except
for blood transfusion, limit project activities to five regions (Brazzaville, Kouilou, Niari,
Lekoumou, and Sangha 23 ), comprising about 82% of the population and 91% of HIV infected
persons (according to the 2003 HIV sero-prevalence survey). A comprehensive project manual was
prepared to counter the tendency for MAP projects to lose momentum after Board approval by
strengthening program coordination and implementation mechanisms and commencing pilot
operations prior to effectiveness.
41. Risk Assessment and mitigation. The QEA noted that the PAD did not adequately discuss the
political risks associated with the country’s post conflict situation or the project’s financial viability,
but these criticisms seem somewhat unfair given the country’s TSS. The risk ratings seem, in
retrospect, to have been accurate. On the other hand, the QEA correctly concluded that the proposed
mitigation measures were inadequate to address weak Health Ministry capacity, but its proposal to


20
   Responding to this issue from the QEA panel, the team stated that it chose not to include extensive results which
“would have made the PAD longer without providing an advantage to the users of the results of the studies?.
21
   First, the Emergency Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project and the Transparency and Governance Capacity
Building Project included funds for HIV/AIDS (US$1.5 million for information and sensitization and US$0.4 million
for strategy preparation and operations, respectively), but the team was reluctant to add a multisectoral HIV/AIDS
component to either of these post-conflict projects. Second, given the urgency and magnitude of the HIV/AIDS problem,
a project under the MAP-2 umbrella but with a significant health component (rather than the reverse) seemed more
appropriate to bring the health sector to the standard necessary for the fight against HIV/AIDS.
22
   The PCD meeting proposed implementing the project over more than five years, but other MAP assessments
recommended implementing in less than five years.
23
   The preparation team assumed that Congo’ s re-submission to the GFATM would be approved and that GFATM
funds would allow for the extension of HIV/AIDS interventions to the remaining regions.
                                                         9
recruit an independent agency to implement the component was, as noted by the task team, not
politically or practically feasible.
42. Quality at Entry. A Quality at Entry Assessment was conducted in June 2005 and rated the
overall quality of the preparation as Moderately Satisfactory 24. Also rated Moderately Satisfactory
were: Policy and Institutional Aspects, Environmental Aspects, Implementation Arrangements and
Risk Assessment; Strategic Relevance and Approach, Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects,
Fiduciary Aspects, Poverty, Gender and Social Development as well as Bank Inputs and Processes
were rated Satisfactory.
2.2 Implementation
43. Conditions of effectiveness included: (i) adoption of an implementation manual; (ii) recruitment
off the Financial Management Agency and establishment of an accounting and financial
management system 25 ; and (iii) modification of the CNLS decree. Recruitment of an external
auditor was included as a dated covenant so as not to delay implementation of an urgently needed
project. Because the effectiveness conditions had not been met by August 5, 2004, effectiveness
was extended until November 5, 2004; the project became effective on October 28, 2004.
44. The ISRs (Data Sheet, Section G) rated performance on Development Objectives (DO) and
Implementation Progress (IP) as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory throughout
implementation. The final two ISRs rated the DO and IP as Moderately Satisfactory, in line with the
2010 QALP assessment.
45. Disbursement overview. The project was financed by: (i) the initial grant (H0820) in the
amount of US$19.0 million equivalent, which was signed on May 5, 2004 and expected to close on
June 30, 2009; (ii) a Japanese implementation grant (TF-90324) in the amount of US$967,050; and
(iii) additional financing (H4940) in the amount of US$5.0 million equivalent, which became
effective on January 15, 2010 and closed on June 30, 2012). The borrower was expected to finance
an additional US$2.0 million for the initial grant 26 and an additional US$10.0 million for the
additional grant. On June 22, 2012, the Government cancelled approximately US$2.0 million of the
AF.
46. The context for HIV/AIDS financing changed in three significant ways during project
implementation. First, from 2004-06, the MAP was the single largest source but from 2007 on, the
Global Fund replaced IDA as the single largest source. Overall, IDA’s share of total partner
financing declined from 100% (2004-06) to 27% (2007-09) to approximately 15% (2010 to
closing). Second, strict counterpart financing arrangements under the Additional Financing
(requiring US$2 of Government financing for each US$1 of IDA financing) and delays in
Government contributions reduced IDA’s annual disbursements from about US$2.9 million
annually (under the original grant) to US$0.7 million annually under the Additional Financing.
Third, the complementarity of Global Fund financing as well as the Bank-financed Health Sector
Services Development Project compensated in large measure for the decreased MAP




24
   The QEA’s principal comments (e.g., capacity development through “twinning?, targeting and geographic focus,
donor coordination, etc.) and especially its suggestions seemed somewhat irrelevant as the preparation team correctly
pointed out in its response that they had been addressed in the PAD and during the various review meetings.
25
   While the firm was being recruited, the Project Unit of the PURICV (an urban rehabilitation project financed by IDA
and including a HIV/AIDS component) had responsibility for managing PPF funds and overseeing procurement.
26
   UN agencies were expected to contribute an additional US$0.4 million to the original grant.
                                                          10
disbursement 27.
47. Implementation overview. Despite the continuing constraints of the post-conflict situation,
reviews in 2005-06 noted progress on all of the components (except the health sub-component),
with delays due primarily to mobilizing and disbursing project funds 28. Difficulties with the health
sub-component were attributed to a “dysfunctional? PNLS with institutional and technical
shortcomings 29 ; proposed measures to improve performance were essentially ignored by the
Ministry until February 2006, when financial management issues resulted in the transfer of financial
management responsibilities from MOH to the Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA).
48. Over the period from March 2006 to April 2007 30, several fundamental changes occurred as the
Government: (i) embraced the “three-ones? approach to improve national strategy, program
coordination, and M&E for HIV/AIDS; (ii) organized the national response as a program
(comprising many technical and financial partners, including the newly received Global Fund
financing) rather than a project; and (iii) promoted decentralized planning and implementation of
the 2007 work plans at the regional level 31. The Mid-Term Review consolidated these orientations
for: (i) coordination to reduce persistent conflicts between the Permanent Secretariat and the
MOH/PNLS; (ii) decentralization to accelerate the response to the epidemic in all eleven regions;
(iii) greater involvement of PLWHA to strengthen all aspects of prevention, care (with a focus on
nutrition), and treatment; and (iv) M&E to link resource utilization to results.
49. During 2007-09, the pace of implementation accelerated. First, with World Bank support, MOH
performance improved with the expansion and improved integration of prevention, testing, care and
treatment services (for ISTs, HIV, and TB/HIV co-infection) at the health facility level. Second, the
project complemented the traditional community-level sub-projects with more innovative sub-
projects using new communication channels to reach targeted, vulnerable groups 32 . A Japanese
Trust Fund (awarded in 2007 in the amount of US$0.97 million) contributed to four key elements of
the project: (i) expansion of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) and HIV/AIDS care and
treatment; (ii) community initiatives, and particularly OVC; (iii) better integration of gender issues
in the project; and (iv) strengthening of M&E.
50. Additional Financing was approved (May 2009) and expected to: (i) promote the
complementarity of support from various donors, such as IDA (PDSS, PRAEBASE), GFATM


27
   The Permanent Secretariat was also expected to implement the Avian Flu Project (with the Ministry of Agriculture)
(P105743), but the summary sheet shows no commitments before the project was closed on December 31, 2009.
28
   Delays in effectiveness contributed to a temporary suspension of the orphan pilot project serving 500 OVC, but the
project was restarted without adverse effects on the OVC but with a postponement of the final report (by Médecins
d’Afrique) intended to provide guidance for expanding the program.
29
   These shortcomings were characterized respectively as inadequate delineation of the respective responsibilities of
PNLS, LNSP, CNTS, and CENAMES and insufficient development of a comprehensive strategy comprising care and
psychological support for PLWHA not medically eligible for ARV. The proposed measures included changes in the
legal texts and the establishment of technical commissions within MOH to adopt standard services for HIV prevention
and care and develop a plan for expanding coverage and deploying trained personnel.
30
   This period comprised the mid-term review of the national strategy (March 2006), the initial joint program review
(October 2006), and the project mid-term review (April 2007).
31
   The April 2007 supervision mission noted that all of the conditions necessary for decentralization were not there due
to shortcomings in the training of the regional permanent secretariats.
32
   These included: (i) prevention efforts for sex workers aimed at managing risk; (ii) micro-credit projects for very
young mothers; (iii) dedicated telephone lines (provided by MTN-Congo) to provide information to (generally young)
callers; (iv) mobile testing services; (v) summer vacation activities around the theme of HIV prevention (kersivac); and
(vi) support for the Traditional Mediators, responsible for both marrying couples and resolving familial issues.
                                                           11
(PADEPP and Round 9), EU, etc. for the implementation of the 2009-13 strategic plan; and (ii)
permit the Government to rationalize the use of its own increasing resources allocated for
HIV/AIDS without abruptly ending IDA funding. Delays in the effectiveness 33 and (especially) the
financing modalities of the Additional Financing reduced available project financing and affected
project planning and implementation throughout the remaining project period. Despite these
difficulties, program outputs steadily progressed over the additional financing period (see Annex 2)
as the project capably managed the various sources of funding.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
51. M&E design. M&E was based on: (i) physical and financial monitoring (contracted out to a
FMA); (ii) project monitoring (using the M&E plan, based on the UNAIDS model and financed by
the PPF); and (iii) surveys and studies (including demographic and health surveys/DHS);
establishment of sentinel sites; surveys on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices; etc.).
52. The proposed M&E guide was reviewed by GAMET during pre-appraisal and modifications
adopted 34 . The M&E arrangements were summarized in the PAD and detailed in the Project
Operations Manual. The CNLS would establish a committee of experts (including representatives of
the WHO and UNICEF), assisted by the Secretariat’s M&E expert, to oversee development of the
M&E system.
53. The QEA mentioned three concerns which turned out to be pertinent during project
implementation: (i) that the weak capacity of the Ministry of Health would hinder the data
collection effort; (ii) that greater clarity was needed on the mechanisms for participatory monitoring
at the community level; and (iii) that the use of M&E results for decision-making and program
management were not sufficiently detailed 35.
54. Implementation. Physical and financial monitoring was organized by the FMA, whose
systems worked well from the start and provided timely and accurate information. The single
weakness pointed out by the supervision missions was the inability of the FMA to link expenditures
to outputs, which handicapped any discussion of potential efficiencies from region to region. In
addition to the FMA, the project established an internal audit service which produced a number of
reports on a variety of topics, such as following up Bank supervision missions, evaluating the
performance of the FMA, and examining the use of MAP funds in specific structures (e.g., the
sectoral ministries, the National Laboratory, beneficiary NGOs, etc.). A technical audit was
organized in 2007 to review project implementation but was not subsequently repeated.
55. Though many of the elements of the project monitoring system were in place soon after project
effectiveness, there were some initial delays in training and organizing the DHS. More significantly,
the resignation of the Secretariat’s M&E specialist and weaknesses in MOH’s Health Management
Information System (HMIS) contributed to a shortage of information, particularly in 2004. Progress
accelerated after the 2006 joint annual review: (i) of additional staff were recruited at central and
regional levels; and (ii) the indicators (as well as the sources and methods for data collection) were
better defined. Problems remained however as there was: (i) a frequent turnover of staff of central-
level staff and weak capacity of regional-level staff; (ii) a resulting gap in the organization and


33
   Effectiveness was delayed until January 15, 2010 as a result of delays in: (i) ratifying and promulgating the grant
agreement and the legal opinion; and (ii) depositing the initial advance of US$1.0 million in the project account.
34
   Modifications included: (i) different indicators based on the M&E guide for the national program; (ii) a more efficient
process focused on providing specific information for use at each level; and (iii) simplified data collection tools.
35
   The QEA also noted insufficient discussion about monitoring implementation of environmental aspects of the project.
                                                           12
quality control of the data collected; and (iii) difficulties in using the selected computer tool
(CSPro) for collating and analyzing data 36.
56. For the Additional Financing, the results framework was organized to: (i) take account of
improved sources of data which were not available for the preparation of the original Project, as
well as areas where data availability remains limited; (ii) make the results framework more gender
sensitive by disaggregating indicators to show results for males and females; (iii) clarify certain
indicators for better measurement of the intended outcome, especially for targeted high risks and
vulnerable groups; and (iv) reflect the additional three years of Project implementation.
57. Presentations for the annual joint reviews and final annual reports were available from 2006 on
and provided comprehensive and consistent information on the outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators. The Mid-Term Review was carried out as scheduled (2007), and detailed summaries of
project achievements were prepared at the end of the original grant (2009) and at project closing
(2012).
58. Surveillance and research. In addition to the PHRD studies (2003-04), periodic sentinel
surveillance was carried out (2005, 2007, and 2011). National household surveys including the DHS
(the first ever DHS in the country was financed by the Project) were carried out in 2005 and
2011and an AIDS Indicator Survey (the ESISC) was carried out in 2009. The project also carried
out an ambitious program of research aimed at collecting information on the higher risk
populations. These studies examined: (i) the vulnerability of girls and women (2005); (ii)
knowledge and attitudes of prisoners (2006); (iii) knowledge and attitudes among students (2008);
(iv) behavior and HIV prevalence of military (2009), (v) and extensive integrated behavioral sero-
surveillance survey (IBSS) was conducted among sex workers, MSM, and prisoners (2012), and
(vi) behavior and HIV prevalence of indigenous groups (2012). Extensive research was also
conducted on the education sector, examining its response to the epidemic (2009) and the impact on
students and staff as well as the sector as a whole (2012). Periodic UNGASS reports were prepared,
and an evaluation of the status of the national strategic framework was carried out (2007).
59. Utilization. The PAD proposed arrangements to produce and use M&E information at regional
and national levels (through the HIV/AIDS councils, the project operations committee, and the
thematic groups). While the formal HIV/AIDS councils and the operations committee did not meet
as frequently as proposed in the decree, other measures for sharing and discussing M&E data were
implemented as planned: (i) joint annual reviews were held; (ii) information from the various
surveys and studies was systematically disseminated; and (iii) annual reports and plans were
circulated (though frequently with significant delays). The final project evaluation noted, however,
that no formal feedback of information received from the regions was transmitted to the regions.
60. M&E is rated Substantial. From a situation of the near absence of credible information on HIV,
the project contributed significantly to a better understanding of the epidemic. Appropriate
measures were taken to ensure the regular availability of adequate information to assess the
financial, implementation, and epidemiological results of the project. The timeliness and quality of
reporting (FMR, annual reports) were satisfactory; and a number of important surveys and studies
were conducted on key aspects of the national response to the epidemic 37. The regional and national

36
   The participation of MOH/PNLS was problematic in that the Global Fund project offered financial incentives for
providing the required data while the MAP did not; as a result, MOH was reluctant to provide regular data to the
regional secretariats. Arrangements were made in June 2010 to harmonize the MAP and GF projects.
37
   Several supervision missions noted that the project might have: (i) better analyzed the effectiveness and efficiency of
expenditures to implement the national response; and (ii) monitored the environmental aspects of the project.
                                                            13
structures intended to use the information were not entirely satisfactory, but joint annual reviews
were consistently carried out and Bank supervision missions systematically charted project
responses to past recommendations with indications of how information was used to improve
project performance.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
61. Environment. The environment category of the project at the time of appraisal was B. The
Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) (December 2003) focused on: (i) installation of
appropriate incinerators in facilities supported by the Project; (ii) training of health staff in handling
sensitive materials; and (iii) sensitization of the population about HIV/AIDS waste issues. The
MWMP figured prominently in Schedule 4 of the DGA. This MWMP was considered “overly
ambitious? (by the QEA) and scaled-down to cover only project facilities. Supervision missions
noted institutional issues within MOH over implementation responsibilities. Over the period 2005-
09, ISR ratings of MWMP implementation improved gradually (from MU to MS to S), but an
evaluation the first phase of the project in 2009 concluded that progress had been limited to a few
incinerators, some training, and guidelines (which were never validated) and attributed the lack of
progress to insufficient funds.
62. For the Additional Financing (also Category B), the 2003 MWMP was updated (with similar
activities but more emphasis on monitoring). The last supervision mission confirmed that very little
was achieved during the second phase of the project, though the ISRs were only downgraded from S
to MS. In addition, the Additional Financing’s proposed support for HIV/AIDS prevention efforts
among the Pygmies triggered the safeguard policy on Indigenous Peoples and the Indigenous
People’s Planning Framework (IPPF) was prepared in May 2009. A program tailored to the needs
of this population group was formulated and implemented, and an evaluation of the vulnerability of
this group was conducted in 2012.
63. Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. Though the FMA had initial
difficulties adapting to accepted Bank procurement procedures, its performance on procurement and
financial management was never rated less than MS from December 2004 on.
64. Procurement. Within a difficult overall country context, early missions noted the weaknesses
including: (i) tardy preparation of the procurement plan; (ii) poor organization of the different
tenders; and (iii) insufficient knowledge of Bank procurement procedures. Performance
subsequently improved: (i) though the procurement plan was often received late, it was judged to be
complete; and (ii) the evaluation of offers was judged (with the occasional exception) to be well
done. Other problems included: (i) insufficient attention to the publication of tender announcements
and subsequent awards; (ii) inadequate contract management; and (iii) poor archiving of documents
related to the various tenders. Bank reviews also indicated the absence of measures to fight fraud.
Though many of these problems were observed throughout project implementation, the supervision
missions generally noted efforts to implement the recommendations and progress in each of these
areas.
65. Financial management. Efforts were made to ensure the adequacy of the FMA’s systems,
establish an internal and technical audit capacity, and strengthen the accounting capabilities for the
sectoral ministries and the NGOs providing managerial support. However, the February 2006
mission identified four important FM issues: (i) the complexity of the procedures described in the
project operations manual; (ii) insufficiently transparent project budgeting; (iii) accounting
problems related particularly to outstanding advances, incomplete documentation, and poor
organization of justifications for expenditures; and (iv) shortcomings in the installation of

                                                   14
TOMPRO 38.
66. At the mid-term review (May 2007), it was agreed that the basic FM elements were in place but
insufficient capacity at central, regional and beneficiary levels remained a major constraint. In
addition, the MTR noted the relatively low absorption of project funds and linked this result to
delays in providing justifications for expenditures (particularly by UNDP and PNLS). While the
Bank concluded that the FMA’s performance was “acceptable?, the MTR criticized it for
insufficient personnel, inadequate supervision of the implementing agencies, and rigidity in
controlling NGO expenditures.
67. For the Additional Financing, fiduciary arrangements were modified to move FM under the
direct management of the Permanent Executive Secretariat 39. Minor problems persisted (related to
delays in project budgeting, insufficient justifications for expenditures, and modifications to
TOMPRO) and contributed to a substantial risk rating, but FM was considered satisfactory
throughout the entire period of Additional Financing. During this phase, the financial monitoring
reports (FMR) were received on time and were of satisfactory quality; and annual audits were
received on time and were unqualified. Global FM risk was considered substantial throughout
additional financing.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
68. Government ownership of the strategic and programmatic directions of the national response,
evidenced by the National Strategic Framework (2003-07), became effective in 2007 with the
adoption of the “three ones?. Subsequent revisions of the National Strategic Frameworks for 2009-
13 and 2013-17 as well as the annual performance reviews have strengthened national ownership,
despite some institutional constraints resulting from infrequent CNLS meetings and continuing
problems between the Permanent Secretariat and the Ministry of Health. The linkage of the
Permanent Secretariat to the Office of the President and the Prime Minister should facilitate the
sustainable transfer of full responsibility for financing and supervising the project activities to the
Government of Congo; and the promulgation of the law protecting the rights of PLWHV should
provide the necessary legal framework for future action.
69. Implementation capacity has improved throughout project implementation and particularly since
2009 as a result of the additional staff and increased experience of the Permanent Secretariat. In
addition, the Permanent Secretariat has benefited from: (i) the availability of data to improve
targeting by both the public and private sectors; (ii) the focus on key ministries, proven NGOs, and
the principal association of Congolese businesses; and (iii) the introduction of innovative
approaches and learning by doing approaches.
70. Financing of the national response remains the key constraint, especially given the paucity of
partners contributing to the National Strategic Framework. Government has made progressive
strides to finance treatment 40 and demonstrated its commitment by agreeing to finance almost 75%
of the estimated costs of the National Strategic Framework for 2009-13 (US$80 million of $126
million). It has also budgeted annually almost 300 million FCFA for the HIV/AIDS activities of the
key sectoral ministries (see Annex 2). The Additional Financing paper anticipated funding from


38
   The accounting software adopted by the project.
39
   In fact, the same staff employed by the FMA was simply retained by the Permanent Executive Secretariat.
40
   Between 2003-05, ARVs were dispensed based on a graduated payment (roughly US$10-80) based on the patient’s
income; in 2006, the Government decided to dispense ARVs without charge (though biological testing was still
charged); and in 2008 biological testing was made free of charge.
                                                      15
GFATM Round 9, which was received and has contributed to financial sustainability in the medium
term. Sustainability for the medium to the long term remains positive especially as the HIV/AIDS
effort link to the Health System Strengthening Project and increased GFATM support and Country
commitment.
3.   Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
71. The overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial for both the initial credit and the
additional financing. For each phase, the objectives were (and remain) highly relevant to the
existing political orientations and technical considerations.
72. Relevance of the project objectives. The relevance of the project's development objectives,
components, and specific activities is rated High for both the original and the Additional Financing
based on consideration of the project’s: (i) adherence to the basic objectives of the PRSP, the CPS
and the principles of the MAP approach; (ii) support for Congo's international and regional
obligations (through the MDGs and the Chari River Basin initiative); and (iii) the evidentiary
support for its national policies and directives (including the “three ones?, indigenous populations,
etc.).
73. The project was consistent with Bank strategies throughout preparation and implementation:
from the initial TSS for the post conflict phase (2000-02), through the various interim strategy notes
ending with the FY07-FY09 ISN, and including Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-
FY12 aiming inter alia at strengthening access to service delivery for the poor. Congo’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), adopted in April 2008, includes as one of its five pillars
combating HIV/AIDS.
74. The Government of Congo has also approved a series of National Strategic Frameworks to
Combat HIV/AIDS (CSN), beginning with the period 2001-2003, and continuing with the
Frameworks for 2003-2007, 2009-2013, and 2013-17. These frameworks have aimed to reduce the
incidence of infection in the Congolese population and improve the quality of life of people infected
and affected by HIV/AIDS. They have been accompanied by joint annual reviews since 2006, and
mid-term reviews as well as surveys and studies to confirm the status of the targeted populations
and determine the effectiveness of the interventions.
75. Relevance of the project design. The relevance of the project design is rated Substantial for
both the original grant and the additional financing. The rating for the original grant is based on
consideration of the project’s: (i) use of the PHRD and PPF financing to constitute an evidentiary
basis, prepare a strategic framework, and establish the requisite institutional arrangements; (ii) focus
on five of the priority regions while anticipating additional resources (from the Global Fund and the
Bank for a health project) to finance the national response; and (iii) subcontracting of fiduciary
tasks to a firm and technical elements to NGOs (for treatment, sexual violence, and orphans) while
building capacity to transfer responsibilities to national institutions during the second phase.
76. The QEA noted that the original grant could have had “a more focused strategy to better
concentrate on the prevention of transmission among groups most at risk?, and the Additional
Financing addressed this issue, with increased emphasis on sex workers, MSM, prisoners,
uniformed services, etc. The QEA also noted that in view of “the lack of commitment and weak
capacity of the Ministry of Health, alternative implementation arrangements (might have been)
identified?, and this issue was addressed through the separate Health Sector Services Development
Project (PDSS). Similarly, the project design addressed the issue of drug supply and distribution
only through other projects (EU and PDSS).
                                                16
77. The QALP (2010) for the Additional Financing assessed the likelihood of achieving the DOs as
moderately likely and rated all three sub-dimensions of design (Strategic Relevance and Approach,
Realism of Project Design, and Risks and Fiduciary, Safeguards and GAC Aspects) as moderately
satisfactory (“3?). The QALP also noted that the original results framework was revised to include
better baseline data, clearer outcome indicators, and more realistic targets. The decision to
substantially increase the Government’s counterpart financing requirement was meant to establish
the basis for future sustainability.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
78. Project efficacy is rated Substantial for the original grant and Substantial for the additional
financing. The rating is justified by: (i) the project's results as summarized in in Section F of the
Data Sheet; (ii) the quantitative outputs (as presented in Annex 2); and (iii) the project's weighted
results as a proportion of actual disbursements at the time of the additional financing and at closing.
79. The following table summarizes the results of the data sheet and shows 75% of the PDO
indicators and 91% of the intermediate outcome targets were either achieved or partially achieved.

80. There are three PDO indicators which are important and reasonably easy to measure.
(Prevalence rates were excluded because they were removed from the results framework in 2009).
PDO #1 (condom use) was partially achieved; PDO#4, (HIV testing among pregnant women) was
achieved; and PDO#10 (PLWHA on ARV treatment) was achieved. Prevalence rates, including
among high risk groups, are discussed separately below.
An overview of the level of achievement of the KPI by PDO is presented in the following
paragraphs. Details on annual results (in absolute numbers and percentages) may be found by OI
and IOI in Annex 2.
81. Project Development Objective 1: Limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs. Of the targets
set for the eight outcome indicators, three were achieved:
   •   OI 3: 86.9% of males (91% of the target), 78.2% of females (104% of the target), and 80.8%
       of all adults (90% of the target) were able to identify condom use as a preventive measure;
    • OI 4: 76.8% of pregnant women accepted voluntary testing, which was 128% of the original
        target and 89% of the revised target;
    • OI 5: Though eliminated for the additional financing, the spread of HIV was limited as
        prevalence was estimated at 0.8% among young men in 2009 (as against 1.9% in 2003) and
        at 1.6% among pregnant women in 2012 (as against 2.4% in 2003).
                                                  17
82. Two targets were partially achieved
    •   OI 2: 72.1% of males (80% of the target) and 71.2% of females (79% of the target reported
        knowledge that HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy;
    • OI 8: 60.6% of pregnant women living with HIV (71% of the target) received ARVs to
        reduce the risk of mother to child transmission. .
83. Three targets were not achieved: OI 1: 33.3% of males (56% of the target), 38.7% of females
(99% of the target), and 34.3% of all adults (57% of the target) used a condom during their last
sexual contact with a casual partner, OI 6/STI prevalence among pregnant women (which increased
from 3.0% to 8.2%) and OI 7/HIV prevalence among young women (which increased from 1.4% to
2.1%) and
84. For OI 1-3, results are available from the DHS (2005 and 2011) and from the ESISC (2009)
which used the same methodology as the DHS. The results for these indicators are presented in the
following table and show both the ambitiousness of the targets and slow progress in achieving them:
                             Table 2: Selected outcome results from the periodic surveys
                                                                                   2005       2009     2012

85. Though eliminated as a PDO indicator in 2007, the project continued to collect prevalence data.
For pregnant women, it appears that there has been a substantial decline in prevalence rates over the
past 5+ years:
                                 Table 3: Prevalence of HIV among pregnant women
                                               2007       2008    2009      2010      2011 2012/Q1

86. Among the general population HIV prevalence appears to have a positive down ward trend.
Proxy indicators for both pregnant women and males show a remarkable reduction from baseline
except for women aged 14-19 were there is an apparent increase. On note in the almost 50 fold
reduction in HIV prevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal care between 2007 and 2012.
Overall population prevalence has shown a reduction from 4.2 to 3.3 a reduction of about 23.9%.

87.       Low CSW Prevalence: It appears that Congo has an exceptionally low HIV prevalence
rate among commercial sex workers compared to other countries in Central Africa who have similar
levels of overall HIV prevalence. Table 5 indicates that the 2012 HIV prevalence results among sex
workers in ROC are one third or less of those in other countries (although Burundi has made
progress too in the last few years). This low prevalence rate is not likely due to early mortality
among CSWs as there has been a large increase in the number of people who are on ARVs. While
no baseline data is available for ROC, the 2012 results are very encouraging.

88. All five of the intermediate outcome indicators (related to the availability of services) were
achieved as the project: (i) established 19 functional sentinel surveillance sites (target: 13) for HIV
and STI (IOI 1); (ii) extended the coverage of quality treatment of STIs to 46 facilities (target: 23)
in the five regions (IOI 2); (iii) ensured that no sale points experienced a shortage of condoms in the
last month (IOI 4); (iv) screened 100% of blood units used for transfusion for HIV, HBV, HCV, and
syphilis (IOI 5); and (v) increased the number of facilities providing quality HIV counseling and
testing from 6 to 144 (target: 99) (IOI 6). According to the project’s final report, the number of
persons knowing their HIV status increased from 2,191 in 2004 to 326,089 in March 2012.
89. Finally, several indicators were linked to efforts to limit the spread of the disease among
vulnerable populations. The target was achieved for uniformed persons (IOI 16) as 6267 uniformed
persons (118% of the target) were reached by national HIV/AIDS programs. The establishment of
programs for school and prison populations were less successful:
    •   IOI 14: 291 schools (55% of the target) introduced active out-of-school HIV/AIDS
        programs;
    •   IOI 17: 3 prisons (50% of the target) introduced with active HIV/AIDS programs.
                                                  19
As Annex 2 shows, information on prisoners reached has been available since 2006 and on the other
groups since 2011. In 2011-12, a prevalence and behavioral study of professional sex workers,
MSM, and prisoners 41 was carried out:
    • 96.3% of professional sex workers had heard of HIV/AIDS, but only 24.5% correctly
        answered all six questions about the transmission of the virus. 81% of sex workers had used
        a condom with their last client (though only 21% with a non-paying partner). HIV
        prevalence among sex workers was estimated at 7.5%.
    • 98.7% of MSM had heard of HIV/AIDS, but only 21.9% correctly answered all six questions
        about the transmission of the virus. 64% of MSM had used a condom with their last client
        (though only 40.6% with a non-paying partner). HIV prevalence among MSM was
        estimated at 26.1%.
    • 95.8% of prisoners had heard of HIV/AIDS, but only 32.6% correctly answered all six
        questions about the transmission of the virus. None of the 6 prisoners 6.3% of prisoners had
        used a condom during their last sexual encounter. HIV prevalence among prisoners was
        estimated at 8.3%.
90. Overall, the project’s performance on this development objective was substantial for the original
grant and Substantial for the additional financing.
91. Project Development Objective 2: Mitigate the health and socio-economic impact of
HIV/AIDS on persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and STIs. For those persons
infected by HIV/AIDS, the number of PLWHA benefiting from monitoring and treatment according
to the national guidelines (OI 9) increased from about 5,000 in 2006 to about 22,000 in 2011 (target:
15,000). Of the four intermediate outcome indicators, targets for two were achieved as the number
facilities providing quality HIV/AIDS care and treatment increased from 32 (2007) to 65 (in 2012)
(target: 40) (IOI 7); and the number of TB centers integrating testing and care of HIV increased
from 16 to 24 (target: 24) (IOI 9). Targets for two additional indicators were partially achieved as
the proportion of pregnant women testing positive and benefiting from global care, support and
treatment (IOI 3) rose from 37.8% in 2009 (47% of the target) to 68.7% in 2012 (80% of the target);
and the number infants born positive and treated according to national protocols (IOI 8) increased
from 632 in 2008 to 1,320 in 2011 (86% of the target).
92. For those persons affected by HIV/AIDS, the target was not achieved as the number of OVC
benefiting from the defined package of services (OI 10) increased annually only from about 3,000
in 2006 to 11,500 in 2011 42 (47% of the target). Of the two intermediate outcome indicators: one
was achieved as 17 support organizations for OVC were established (target: 17) (IOI 22); and one
was not achieved as the number of health centers offering care and prophylaxis for victims of sexual
violence remained at 2 during the second phase (target: 18) (IOI 10).
93. Even though only one indicator (partially achieved) was included in the original credit, progress
towards mitigating the health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected with or
affected by HIV/AIDS and STIs performance continued. However, performance was Modest
during the first phase and Substantial for the additional financing.

   The project’s own final evaluation notes that 29,576 OVC received support from the project, but the ICR team was
unable either to independently verify this number or to determine whether this number benefited from some or all of the
services offered in the package.

94. Project Development Objective 3: Build strong and sustainable national capacity to
respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The only outcome indicator (introduced for the additional
financing) was achieved as 12 of 12 regional HIV/AIDS units (UDLS) reported annually on at least
75% of M&E indicators (OI 11). Of the thirteen intermediate outcome indicators, five were
achieved:
    •   IOI 12: 94% of the population (104% of the target) was reached about HIV/AIDS through
        IEC/BCC programs on radio and television;
    • IOI 15: A law protecting PLWHA against discrimination and protecting women against
        sexual violence was adopted and signed in 2011;
    • IOI 19: 264 community-based HIV/AIDS projects (164% of the target) were approved,
        completed successfully, and accounted for; and
    • IOI 20: 50 private enterprises (125% of the target) began offering HIV/AIDS services to
        their workers.
95. Targets for seven of the intermediate objective indicators were partially achieved:
   •    IOI 11: 15 selected sector ministries (125% of the target) and 21 ministries overall
        implemented action plans in 2012; the overall implementation rate for the action plans was
        12% (target: >80%).
    • IOI 13: 33.4% of primary schools (target: 60%), 35.2% of secondary schools (target: 100%),
        and 50% of technical schools (target 60%) introduced the national HIV/AIDS modules;
    • IOI 18: Actual cumulative expenditures for the civil society response (excluding OVC) were
        32.5% of planned expenditures (46% of the target);
    • IOI 21: On average, 5,818,237 condoms were distributed/sold each year from January 2009 to
        June 2012 (65% of the target); and
    • IOI 24: Over the four-year period 2008-2011, the National AIDS Council met once in three
        years; over the same period, the Steering Committee met twice in only one year (and once in
        two others) (50% of the target)
96. The regular collection of monitoring data (IOI 23) was not established by June 2005, but was in
place (as noted previously) by 2006.
97. Overall, the project’s performance on this development objective was modest for the original
grant and substantial for the additional financing.
98. Overall achievement result. Based on the project's initial and revised indicators and the ICR
guidelines, the following table assesses the project's overall efficacy as Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency
99. The PAD relied on the economic justifications contained in the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Program for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR) but did not present an analysis of the
potential impact of the project on the economy. The ICR team concluded that the project made a
concerted effort to ensure that costs were reasonable with respect to both recognized norms (“value
for money?) and benefits; three aspects are important.
100.      First, based on available MAP experience, the project included several management
measures to enhance early project implementation capacity, including: (i) a five-year time frame
and a limited geographic scope; (ii) an emphasis on capacity building in each component; and (iii)
use of contracting out for specific financial and technical components of the project. Later, the
national strategic frameworks and the coordination skills of the national and regional secretariats
improved project performance. In addition, the adoption of the “three ones? strengthened
coordination, increased participation in planning and budgeting, and enhanced the use of M&E
results through the annual reviews.
101.      There were some costs associated with these achievements throughout project
implementation. In particular, the process of reviewing the annual plans consistently postponed
final approval (from January to March or April), which (combined with late counterpart financing,
particularly during additional financing) decreased the time for plan implementation and delayed
disbursements. The result was a decrease in the implementation rate of planned activities:
                    Table 5: Proportion of planned activities implemented during Phases 1 and 2
                                  2004-06     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012    Total

102.      The phasing of interventions did allow the project to manage the number of ministries,
community groups, and private sector entities involved between 2005-08 and to improve the
targeting of groups (particularly sex workers, MSM, prisoners, and local ethnic groups) and the
approaches used (replacing broader social communication with more comprehensive “thematic?
days and peer education) after 2009. The project also piloted and then scaled up effective
communications channels for reaching youths (through youth fairs and the hotline), young couples
(through the traditional mediators), and those without easy access to testing (through mobile units).
103.      Second, as shown in Annex 2 and confirmed by the table presented in Annex 3 (assessing
efficient resource use to avert potential infections 43) the project made important contributions not
only to prevention among MSM and sex workers and in the workplace 44 but also to blood safety,

44
   A rough calculation of expenditures shows that 17% were spent on MSM, sex workers, condom distribution, and
workplace programs.
                                                       22
PMTCT, and VCT. Although the supervision missions noted interruptions in the supplies of
laboratory reagents and insufficient quality (including a lack of qualified staff for counseling, weak
organization of services, inadequate confidentiality, etc.), significant progress was achieved over the
duration of the project and particularly during the additional financing phase.
104.      Third, as summarized in Annex 3, the final supervision mission estimated the economic
benefits of the project for three preventive activities: (i) blood security, (ii) prevention of mother to
child transmission, and (iii) behavior change among professional sex workers. The results are
presented in the following table:
                    Table 6: Economic benefits resulting from selected project interventions
                                     Intervention                       Economic Benefit
                   Testing of Blood Donated for Transfusions                     $ 22 158 044
                   PMTCT                                                            $ 244 000
                   BCC for Commercial Sex Workers                                 $ 2 811 565
                   Total                                                         $ 25 213 609

The results show that the total economic benefit for these three preventive activities exceeds the
amount spent from project funds for the interventions and is slightly less than the total estimated
cost of the project as shown in Annex 1b. Since these activities represent a subset of the project’s
preventive activities, the overall benefit of the project would almost surely exceed the project’s cost.
105.      Despite the measures taken to improve project start-up, the difficulties of strengthening
institutional capacity, managing a variety of multi-sectoral and decentralized agencies, and carrying
out unfamiliar Bank procedures contributed to Modest efficiency for the initial credit. The rapid
expansion of services (despite reduced Bank financing) combined with the emphasis on proven
interventions with demonstrated economic benefits for the country contributed to Substantial
efficiency for the additional financing.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
106.      Based on IEG guidance and the previous ratings of Substantial for relevance, Substantial
for efficacy, and Modest/Substantial for efficiency, the overall outcome rating for the project is
Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
107.      Poverty. Though the PAD viewed the post-conflict situation, the generalized poverty of
the population, and the growth of the epidemic as interrelated elements (with each contributing to
and resulting from the other elements), the project did not explicitly address poverty. The project
did not include the financing of revenue-generating activities (RGA) for associations of PLWHA as
a priority; RGA were mentioned in the original grant but not at all in the additional financing. The
project did address (in conjunction with the World Food Program) the issue of nutrition for
PLWHA. RGA were financed for sex workers, girls with children and OVC, but the effectiveness
of these interventions was not evaluated. Beginning in 2006, however, the Government initiated the
free provision of ARVs, which was followed in 2008 by free medical follow-up of those requiring
ARVs.
108.     Gender. The project addressed gender initially from the perspective of sexual violence, as
some 60,000 women and girls had been victims of rape during the decade of social conflict. To this
end, the project extended the intervention of Médecins sans Frontiers (MSF) to ensure: (i) the
                                                      23
transfer (in 2005) of its rape clinics to the gynecological services of two hospitals (Talangaï and
Makélékélé in Brazzaville); and (ii) the care and treatment of about 360 victims of violence per
year 45. Both the 2006 joint annual review and the MTR (May 2007) raised the issue of sexual
violence, but the project’s focus had turned instead to a broader analysis of women’s vulnerability
(and the feminization of the epidemic), formulation of a legal framework to counter the effects of
the epidemic on women, and better targeting of sensitization and education efforts 46. Resources for
these activities were included in the additional financing, and the results framework was made more
gender sensitive by disaggregating indicators to show results for men and women.
109. Social development. The project’s impact on social development can be seen at three levels.
First, at a societal level, the adoption of legislation provided guidelines for: (i) preventing
HIV/AIDS (among students, health workers, incarcerated persons, women and girls, and other
vulnerable groups); and (ii) protecting the rights of PLWHA (by forbidding discrimination). Second,
among specific populations, the recognition of socially marginalized groups (CSW, MSM, inmates,
PLWHA and their families, OVC) signals their inclusion in the national dialogue about the spread
of the epidemic. Third, among the public and private sectors, the development of an overarching
programmatic response to the epidemic constitutes an important partnership for a common national
response.
110. A particular emphasis on indigenous populations (pygmies) was formally introduced in the
additional financing as part of the environmental and social management framework (ESMF).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
111. The project contributed to establishing and strengthening national and regional institutions
capable of formulating and coordinating the national response: (i) at central level with the National
Committee, the Steering Committee, and the National Permanent Secretariat; and (ii) at regional
level with the Regional Committees and the Regional Permanent Secretariats. Combined with the
series of national strategic frameworks (for 2003-07, 2009-13, and 2013-17), the project has put in
place the necessary instruments for implementing the national response.
112. Within this framework, the project has effectively promoted a multi-sectoral response to the
epidemic by: (i) mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities into the action plans of key sector ministries
and decentralizing resources and responsibility for implementing these activities; and (ii)
strengthening the management capabilities and financing of a range of private sector entities
(including UNICONGO) and civil society associations (the NGO Forum, religious groups against
HIV/AIDS, PLWHA) to improve results at local levels. The project was less successful in forging a
harmonious working relationship with the Ministry of Health.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
113. Though not unintended, the introduction of diverse communications channels proved
effective in reaching the target populations; in particular the youth fairs (KERSIVAC), the
HIV/AIDS hotline (la ligne jaune), and the mobile testing unit (UMODEV) represented, according
to a special Bank mission, “home grown foundations for behavioral change and an improved
national response to the particular HIV/AIDS epidemic profile of the Republic of the Congo?. The
project also supported interventions by the Traditional Mediators, who preside over traditional


45
   Evaluation of the original credit (2009) noted that: (i) data were not collected after 2005; (ii) the problem was thought
to have significantly diminished; and (iii) the integration of sexual violence services in the hospitals had not succeeded.
46
   These points had been raised during preparation in a proposed strategy to establish an “obsérvatoire? to reduce the
vulnerability of girls and women to HIV/AIDS and sexual violence. The “obsérvatoire? was not created.

marriages and use the occasion to sensitize those in attendance.
114. In addition, the project made a significant contribution (in collaboration with UNESCO) to
the development of a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS in the education sector, combining: (i)
studies examining the impact of HIV/AIDS on students, teachers, and administrative staff and on
the sector as whole; and (ii) policies and strategies for an enhanced sectoral response to the
epidemic.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest
115. The risk to development outcome is assessed as modest based on: (i) Government's
commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS; and (ii) the legal, institutional and strategic measures described
previously. Over the past decade, the Government has systematically: (i) promoted appropriate
institutional arrangements and participatory mechanisms (at central, provincial, and community
levels); (ii) developed consistent and coherent national strategies, including the adoption of a
programmatic approach (“the three ones?); and (iii) adopted adequate program policies and
procedures (for testing, care and support, and treatment). Particularly significant progress has been
made in enhancing surveillance and knowledge of the most vulnerable populations, expanding
testing and counseling, acknowledging (and slowly reducing discrimination against) PLWHA, and
providing MTCT prevention and ARV treatment. An adequate ESMF is in place, though progress
on introducing measures for waste management has been slow.
116. Administratively, while delays in planning and budgeting, procurement, and financial
management will continue, adequate measures have been established to ensure effective
implementation by the responsible agencies at central, regional, and community levels.
117. Concerns about the financial future and sustainability of the national response remain.
Historically, Congo has allocated (though not always disbursed) 47 significant amounts of financing
from its own resources 48 ; as a middle income country, it has the means to provide adequate
resources for the national response to the epidemic. The country has also mobilized external sources
from the Global Fund (Round 9) and various UN agencies for HIV/AIDS and other sources
(including the IDA-financed PDSS) for health. However, given the experience with: (i) delays in
disbursing counterpart funding; and (ii) the prospects for financing the national program after the
current Round 9, the risk to development outcome is considered modest.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
118.    From identification (April 2002) to Board approval (April 2004), the Bank's
preoccupations were clear and clearly transmitted to the Government: (i) define and strengthen


47
 Since 2008, allocations to key ministries have averaged 280 million FCFA, but actual disbursements are not known.
48
 UNAIDS data from 2009-2010 estimated the proportion of expenditures as follows: public (37%), donors (53%),
NGOs (3%), and other/out of pocket (7%).
                                                        25
institutional relationships; (ii) strengthen capacity to ensure effective implementation; (iii) focus on
specific vulnerable groups, establish priorities, and sequence interventions; and (iv) establish sound
monitoring and evaluation. Substantial PHRD and PPF funding (US$1.6 million) was mobilized to
prepare an evidentiary base (e.g., KAP and prevalence studies), address key implementation issues
(e.g., communications strategies, condom distribution, support for OVC), draft guidelines for
training and program implementation, and prepare a project operations manual. The PAD was clear
and concise.
119.      A QEA rated the preparation as moderately satisfactory, with: (i) strategic relevance and
approach, technical, financial and economic aspects, fiduciary aspects, poverty, gender and social
development as well as Bank inputs and processes rated Satisfactory; and (ii) policy and
institutional aspects, environmental aspects, implementation arrangements, and risk assessment as
moderately satisfactory. Certainly, the preparation team did not solve all of the problems (notably
those related to MOH participation and drug distribution), but the ICR team believes that: (i) the
policy and institutional aspects deserved a higher ranking; and (ii) the efforts to establish baseline
data and other information under difficult, post conflict circumstances were not sufficiently
appreciated by the QEA panel.
120.      There was a slight delay in effectiveness, but the availability of the PPF mitigated any
delay in project implementation.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
121.     Three TTL (the last based in Brazzaville from 2010-12) assured continuity during project
implementation. Supervision missions were conducted regularly. Informative aide-memoires were
submitted in a timely manner; with detailed component results and list of observations and
recommendations. The task team’s contributions to the project were especially useful for: (i) the
inclusion of HIV/AIDS in school curricula; and (ii) programs for OVC.
122.      The QALP (2010) rated supervision as: (i) satisfactory for the supervision inputs and
process and for candor and realism of ISRs; and Supervision Inputs and Processes); and (ii)
moderately satisfactory for the focus on development effectiveness and fiduciary/safeguard aspects.
The ICR team believes that the individual ISRs were of only average quality and candidness, and
some of the ratings seem to have been too generous, notably for financial management, counterpart
financing, and safeguards. In retrospect, the S ratings for the DO and IP ratings from 2008-11 seem
too optimistic; the MS ratings in 2012 seem more justified. A detailed aide-mémoire was prepared
for the last mission and rated the various components and the project as a whole.
123.      The QALP assessed the likelihood of achieving the DO as moderately likely based on the
changes incorporated into the additional financing (e.g., better phasing, more focus on prevention
among groups most at risk, a more realistic results framework). The QALP also noted that: (i)
earlier approval of the separate Health Sector Services Development Project (i.e., before FY08)
could arguably have strengthened its contribution to the HIV-AIDS program; and (ii) the longer-
term sustainability issue will ultimately need to integrate and mainstream HIV/AIDS activities into
the public health system overall, which will hopefully be one outcome of the parallel Health Sector
Services Development Project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
                                                  26
124.     Based on a Satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry, a Moderately Satisfactory rating for
supervision, the Bank’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
125.      The Government’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Among the
Government's important contributions were: (i) its ownership and commitment to achieving the
development objectives with particularly valuable support from the Prime Minister’s Office; (ii) its
contribution to the development of a common enabling environment (politico-legal, institutional,
technical, financial, and administrative) facilitating the national response by public and private
actors; (iii) its productive relationships with donors, partners, and other stakeholders; and (iv) its
investment in studies and surveys to monitor the epidemic. Though not functional during the
original grant, the National AIDS Council and the Steering Committee met at least annually during
the additional financing phase. The regions developed and approved their annual plans throughout
project implementation. Government performance was diminished by: (i) an inability to improve
cooperation between the Permanent Secretariat and the Ministry of Health; and (iii) delays in
disbursing counterpart financing which reduced the overall amount of project funding and
diminished potential project activity.
126.      Performance by the key ministries (and public sector officials) at central and regional
levels varied but was generally positive as MAP support provided the means for implementing their
annual programs and demonstrating their capabilities to other potential sources of financing.
Though disbursement tended to be slow and justification of expenditures even slower, the
authorities interviewed during the ICR mission expressed satisfaction with what they were able to
achieve.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
127.     Initially, project implementation was shared by: (i) the National Permanent Secretariat
which was responsible for policy, program coordination, and technical oversight; and (ii) the
Financial Management Agency which was responsible for procurement and financial management.
After the additional financing the responsibilities of the FMA were incorporated into the National
Permanent Secretariat.
128.      National/Regional Permanent Secretariats. After initial difficulties, related perhaps to
its post conflict situation, the implementing agencies made significant and sustained progress in
project implementation. The ISRs consistently rated implementation progress in general and project
management in particular as S or MS. Project management: (i) achieved (or partially achieved) 90%
of its objectives; (ii) carried out the major project milestones (the mid-term review, and the
Borrower's ICR) in a timely manner; (iii) adapted to changed circumstances when inadequate
counterpart financing after 2009 required constant adjustments in planning and implementation of
the national response; and (iv) managed a successful monitoring and evaluation system, joint annual
reviews, and a substantial program of studies and surveys. Project management was also successful
in supporting a wide range of private sector and civil society actors; it was less successful in
convening the national and regional coordinating structures and in working with the Ministry of
Health.
129.     Financial Management Agency. In 2007, the project’s internal audit unit assessed the
                                                 27
FMA’s performance as moderately satisfactory: (i) satisfactory on the day to day financial
operations, withdrawal applications, financial monitoring reports, etc.; and (ii) moderately
unsatisfactory on strengthening the accounting tools and FM capacity of staff recruited by the
project. Since financial management was rated satisfactory after the integration of the FMA’s
responsibilities into the Permanent Secretariat, this weakness seems to have been corrected.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
130.    Based on a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the Government’s performance and a
Moderately Satisfactory rating for the implementing agencies, the Borrower’s performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
6.   Lessons Learned
131.      The project provides support for three important lessons involving the importance of: (i)
   establishing an enabling environment for the HIV/AIDS response; (ii) strengthening
   management capacity and promoting innovation; and (iii) ensuring the evidence basis for and
   appropriateness of indicators of project achievement.
132.    Strong political commitment is critical to establishing an enabling environment to
   address the HIV/AIDS challenge in post-conflict situations: As the first major health
   HIV/AIDS response for Congo, the project provided an opportunity to galvanize the
   Government’s institutional and programmatic response to the threat of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
   Through its own achievements, the increasing allocation of its own resources, and its
   commitment to persons infected and affected by the disease (as reflected in the 2011 law to
   protect the rights of these groups), the Government strengthened the platform for future
   technical engagement and established incentives for the contributions of other funding sources
   (and especially the Global Fund and UN agencies) in health and HIV/AIDS. Two aspects of this
   enabling environment are particularly worth noting: a strong political commitment and a
   multisectoral approach.
133.     Strong political commitment. The Government’s initial willingness to address HIV/AIDS
   during the highly volatile post-conflict period was rewarded with progress (on strategic
   directions, institutional and organizational arrangements, and technical results). This
   commitment further enhanced programmatic results (the “three ones?), increased overall
   funding, and contributed to the achievement of many of the project’s objectives.
134.    Multi-sectoral approach in responding to HIV/AIDS. As part of the strong government
   commitment, the Prime Minister’s Office provided leadership in the multi-sectoral response
   across all sectors. Within this overall context, the project has demonstrated the importance of
   focusing on sectors with the greatest potential impact on the epidemic and emphasizing the
   potential contributions of community organizations and the private sector.
135.     Strengthening management capacity and promoting innovation are essential to
   achieve results in low-capacity post-conflict environments. As a result of the post-conflict
   situation, the overall capacity of project management capacity in the country was weak at the
   outset of the project. The recruitment of dedicated staff at central and regional levels, the sub-
   contracting of specific technical and managerial functions to more competent agencies and
   NGOs, and the heavy investment in capacity-building over the initial years of project
   implementation resulted in an increasing capability and confidence at all levels of the response
   to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

                                                 28
136.    These managerial achievements were most visible in the promotion (particularly during
   the second phase of the project) of innovations through: (i) strengthening local managerial
   capacity in both the public and private sectors; and (ii) using diverse communications channels
   to reach marginal but highly vulnerable populations (e.g., MSM, prisoners, etc.) and to
   implement potentially effective interventions (e.g., the youth fairs, the hotline, etc.). As an
   example of how to increase coverage, the project may serve as a useful example for other
   projects in similar post-conflict or capacity-constrained settings.
137.     Ensuring the evidence basis for and the appropriateness of indicators of project
   achievement is key to HIV/AIDS program management. As a post-conflict country lacking
   virtually any up-to-date information on the HIV/AIDS, situation, Congo required significant
   investment during project preparation to ensure that baseline data were collected and a data base
   developed for the purposes of monitoring and evaluation. There were perhaps urban biases (due
   to the security situation) in the information collected during preparation and a tendency for
   overly ambitious targets, and the project should have corrected this situation through a
   restructuring or at the time of the additional financing. Within this overall context, the project’s
   efforts to establish a well-performing M&E system, to carry out annual surveillance and
   periodic surveys (two DHS in 2005 and 2011 and an AIDS indicator survey in 2009), and to
   conduct a number of important studies demonstrates that it is possible to establish an evidentiary
   basis in a post-conflict country.
7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

                               Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
     Like most other MAPs, the PAD for the Congo MAP referred to the economic analysis carried
out in previous reports for the Africa Region 50 and summarized the main findings as follows:
    • HIV/AIDS undermines the major determinants of economic growth (physical, human, and
        social capital) and has a negative effect on productivity levels, domestic savings and overall
        economic growth.
    • HIV/AIDS increases health costs and runs the risks of crowding out other key public health
        programs, such as immunization, maternal and child health, malaria and parasitic diseases.
    • Care and treatment of AIDS patients imposes high costs on families and reduces their
        earning capacity.
    • Family coping strategies may result in children abandoning school or the family cutting
        other health or social expenditures to unacceptable levels.
     In the absence of such analysis in the PAD, one approach is to determine whether the project
focused on the most effective and efficient interventions given the prevailing epidemiological
situation in the country. The table below 51 provides estimates on the potential infections averted
and the cost per infection averted and suggests that Congo focused on the most appropriate
interventions:
                                Central and West Africa (lower prevalence)

                            Education

    As shown in Annex 2, the project made important contributions not only to prevention among
MSM and sex workers and in the workplace 52 but also to blood safety, PMTCT, and VCT.
Although the supervision missions noted interruptions in the supplies of laboratory reagents and
insufficient quality (including a lack of qualified staff for counseling, weak organization of services,

   A rough calculation of project expenditures shows that 17% were spent on MSM, sex workers, condom distribution,
and workplace programs.

inadequate confidentiality, etc.), significant progress was achieved over the duration of the project
and particularly during the additional financing phase.
    The PAD described the project’s economic, social, institutional, and health benefits as follows:
    • Economic benefits: By preventing the rapid spread of the disease among the most
        productive (and sexually active) elements of the population, the project would: (i) improve
        current productivity; (ii) reduce future costs linked to needs for treatment, care and support
        for patients and their families; and (iii) reduce dependency ratios over the long term.
    • Social benefits: By strengthening the capacity of local communities to provide support to
        groups affected by HIV/AIDS, the project would promote the establishment of a social
        safety net, including counseling services, support groups for patients and their families,
        community clinics and assistance in revenue-generating activities for PLWHA. In addition,
        by targeting women, orphans, and persons in uniform, the project would reduce the social
        burden on patients and the affected families.
    • Institutional benefits: By building the capacity of key stakeholders and community groups,
        the project would strengthen civil society by empowering them to: (i) organize and
        implement HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities; and (ii) to deal with the local
        authorities.
    • Health benefits: By contributing to the country’s prevention, diagnosis and treatment
        efforts, the project would: (i) reduce Congo’s burden of disease resulting from sexually
        transmitted infections, tuberculosis, and other opportunistic diseases; (ii) decrease the
        number of HIV-infected newborns (thereby lowering the risk of increasing child mortality;
        and (iii) slow the progression of the disease by increasing the knowledge of HIV status
        (through HIV testing) and able to protect their partners.
     The final supervision mission focused on three of the many preventative activities (including
behavior change communication, distribution of condoms, diagnosis and treatment of STIs, etc.),
and estimated the economic benefits of the project for: (i) blood security, (ii) prevention of mother
to child transmission, and (iii) behavior change among professional sex workers.
     The analysis was based in part on the economic cost of each new case of HIV/AIDS (i.e., the
benefits of each new infection averted as measured by the cost of care for an HIV/AIDS patient
over the lifetime of the patient, discounted appropriately). A detailed study in Burundi found that
the cost of care per year was $590, on average (Basenya and Renaud, 2008). To be conservative,
about half of this estimate ($300) was used in the present analysis for the estimated cost of care per
year, for each new infection averted.
     The analysis was based as well on information from: (i) the National Blood Transfusion Center
for donated blood; (ii) the National Public Health Laboratory for mothers treated; and (iii) the
project for the number of professional sex workers reached. The results are presented in the
following table:
                    Table 6: Economic benefits resulting from selected project interventions
                                     Intervention                       Economic Benefit

                   PMTCT                                                            $ 244 000
                   BCC for Commercial Sex Workers                                 $ 2 811 565
                   Total                                                         $ 25 213 609

The results show that the total economic benefit for these three preventive activities exceeds the

                                                      36
amount spent from project funds for the interventions and is slightly less than the total estimated
cost of the project as shown in Annex 1b. Since these activities represent a subset of the project’s
preventive activities, the overall benefit of the project would almost surely exceed the project’s cost.
     IEG suggests other criteria for assessing the benefits of MAPs, 53 including: (i) enhanced
political commitment to controlling the epidemic; (ii) expanded and strengthened national and sub-
national AIDS institutions for the long-run response; (iii) mobilization of NGOs in the national
response and reinforcement of their capacity to provide access to prevention and care among the
high-risk groups most likely to contract and spread the infection; and (iv) enhanced the efficiency of
national AIDS programs. These were all also positive.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2003, faced with a growing HIV/AIDS pandemic, the Republic of Congo, through its Permanent
Executive Secretariat of the National AIDS Committee (SEP/CNLS), developed a Strategic
Framework for HIV/AIDS Control for the period 2003-2007. A US$19 million grant from the
World Bank enabled the country to implement the strategic framework through the HIV/AIDS
Control and Health Project. This multi sectoral project comprised four components: health; non-
health sectoral interventions (education, defense, etc.); community-based activities with NGOs; and
coordination, monitoring and evaluation. The project was implemented in five (of eleven)
departments: Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Niari, Lékoumou, and Sangha.

In 2009, a new strategic framework for the period 2009-2013 was developed to consolidate the
experiences acquired during implementation of the 2003-2007 framework, and its execution
benefited from an additional financing of US$15 million for the period 2009-2012 (of which US$5
was provided by the Bank and US$10 million by the Government. The project was carried out in
the 5 departments mentioned above and made it possible not only to strengthen the national
response to HIV/AIDS and STDs, but also to acquire some experience.

INSTITUTIONAL BACKING

This Project provided a significant institutional support by drafting policy documents, standards,
manuals and guidebooks in various areas. The national and decentralized coordination benefited by
capacity-building in terms of staff hiring and training, computing and audiovisual equipment as well
as transport. The remuneration of 34% of the staff of SEP/CNLS is supported by the HIV/AIDS
Control and Health Project. SEP/CNLS also benefited from significant capacity-building from the
Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) which provided procurement and financial management
support. NGOs and associations have also been trained and provided with equipment.

PREVENTION-RELATED ACTIVITIES

The Project ensured the training of: (i) health care providers for the treatment of STDs and the
screening of HIV; and (ii) peers, youth leaders and providers for social communication, including
the organization of themed days at the community and Aids Control Units Level. Appropriate
strategies making it possible to reach the targeted groups have been set up by SEP/CNLS. The
various facilities have also been supplied with reagents for HIV screening and medicines for the
treatment of STDs. All these interventions have consolidated the extension and decentralization of
prevention services which made it possible to: (i) treat 57,128 cases of STDs (78%), (ii) screen
100% of blood pouches for the 4 markers: HIV, VHB, VHC, syphilis, (ii) screen 326,089 persons in
the health centres (52,5%), and 19,760 other persons thanks to the mobile unit.

The various sites for STDs treatment and HIV screening have registered shortages of drugs, and
consumables, which made it difficult to reach the targeted groups. At the level of Aids Control
Units, 12,000 students, 41,844 pupils from general education, and 65,753 pupils from technical and
vocational education have been screened. Classes of HIV/AIDS have been integrated in 55.66% of
primary schools, 35.2% of secondary schools and 83.33% of technical and vocational schools. The
                                                40
treatment of AIDS-related disorders and the management of biomedical waste remain low and are
limited essentially to Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire.

TREATMENT-RELATED ACTIVITIES

The treatment of the persons living with AIDS has been strengthened and improved thanks to the
HIV/AIDS Control and Health Project. The Project has thus contributed to the consolidation and
decentralization of the medical treatment of the persons living with AIDS through: (i) training of
providers and laboratory technicians; (ii) procurement of equipment for treatment sites and
laboratories; and (iii) provision of ARVs and medicines for opportunistic infections for the
treatment of adults and children. In total, 108 physicians and 94 laboratory technicians have been
trained or have undergone a refresher course, and 65 or 39 sites carry out respectively adult and
pediatric treatment.

Congo has 16,043 adult persons and 1,206 children living with AIDS who are presently under
ARVs; those who have dropped treatment are around 21.55%. However, some difficulties related to
ARV treatment include: (i) shortages of ARVs and reagents for biological follow-up in the sites; (ii)
the underestimation of the numbers of PLWHA needing treatment; and (iii) an insufficient number
of sites for treatment of pediatric AIDS.

Psychosocial treatment remains insufficient and constitutes the weak link of global treatment of the
persons living with AIDS in Congo. In 2009, the Project provided some support which made it
possible to organize the National Network of HIV+ Associations of Congo (RNAPC) which
includes 8 associations throughout the country and 23 member associations. The interventions of
these associations remain insufficient as regards the psycho-social needs of the PLWHA. The
country has only 3 sites which carry out therapeutic education. Insufficient care and support brings
about the isolation of the persons living with AIDS and might explain the high rate of patients
having dropped treatment.

CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVITIES

Before this project, Congo did not have any national mechanism for financing of community-based
initiatives. To bridge this shortcoming, the project supported the capacity building of the
organizations by: (i) drafting of a handbook which describes the principles and rules governing the
financing of the projects of the civil society organizations; (ii) training recipients in sub-project
management, supervision and follow-up assessment of activities; and (iii) networking associations
to improve information exchange. The funded sub-projects have made it possible to screen a
number of targeted groups: 2,421 sex workers, 540 men having sex with men, and the indigenous
peoples have been screened thanks to the activities carried out by CCC and the promotion of
condoms. The funding of the civil society projects remains insufficient for the implementation of
interventions.

The sale and distribution of condoms has significantly increased since the project was set up. About
45,000,000 condoms have been sold or distributed by the relevant Agency (AISSC). This important
growth is due to the policy of prevention and promotion of the condom. Difficulties in the
promotion of condoms were also related to the shortage of stocks that occurred at the central and
decentralized level.

                                                 41
The treatment of orphans and other vulnerable children was decentralized and implemented by
Support Agencies for the treatment of Orphans and other Vulnerable Children (AESO). As of
March 31st, 2012, 29,576 orphans and other vulnerable children have concurrently benefited from
support by the project out of a target group of 25,000 persons (an implementation rate of 118%).
These results should not however conceal the difficulties registered in the treatment of orphans and
other vulnerable children for the various services and support. Insufficient financial resources and
the late release of funds prevented the orphans and other vulnerable children from benefiting from
all of the services planned. The lack of service indicators (schooling, medical care, insertion and
psychosocial support) makes it impossible to assess the results achieved by the project.

COORDINATION, MANAGEMENT, FOLLOW-UP AND ASSESSMENT

SEP/CNLS has benefited from capacity-building in human resources and equipment to successfully
implement project at central and decentralized levels. Fiduciary Management is now carried out by
the SEP/CNLS management unit at the central and decentralized level which benefited from the
transfer of expertise from the KPMG Consultancy. To improve supervision of the activities, a
monitoring and evaluation plan, data collection and reporting tools have been implemented (DHS,
sentinel surveys, behavioral studies, etc.) and made it possible to assess the results of the project.

The HIV/AIDS and STDs Control Project has made it possible to establish the basis of the national
response to the fight against HIV/AIDS in Congo through its contribution to the financing of the
various strategic frameworks. Many interventions in the framework of prevention, global treatment,
civil society, orphans and other vulnerable children treatment coordination, management and
follow-up and assessment have been carried out and have made possible a number of results and
experiences. However, some difficulties related to the late release of funds (mainly the Government
counterpart funds) and the insufficient financial resources for the implementation of the activities
have posed major challenges for day-to-day operations and the overall quality of services and
interventions.

RECOMMENDATIONS

   •   Involve the various stakeholders and increase the interest of the population to ensure
       political commitment for the fight against AIDS;
   •   Ensure sufficient financial resources to enable SEP/CNLS to make it possible for the
       stakeholders to carry out quality interventions;
   •   Release financial resources quickly with a view to complying with the timeframes of
       interventions and optimizing results;
   •   Provide some assistance to COMEG so that it can fully play its role as purchasing group and
       supply health facilities with reagents, ARVs and other medical products; and
   •   Strengthen the screening and treatment teams within the sites by the community providers
       with a view to strengthening counseling and psychosocial support.
