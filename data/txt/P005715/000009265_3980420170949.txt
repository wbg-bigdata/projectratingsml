Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Education and
Training Project in Tunisia, for which Loan 3054-TUN in the amount of US$95.0 million
was approved on 6 April 1989 and made effective on 30 October 1989.
The loan was closed on 30 September 1996, as compared with the original closing
date of 31 March 1995. Final disbursement took place on 12 February 1997; although we
anticipate a balance of US$1.9 million will be canceled, we are still awaiting explanatory
documents or a refund from Government to fully justify the special account.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Meskerem Mulatu, MNSHD of the Middle East and
North Africa Region with support from Ms. Christine Wong, Procurement Assistant. An
early background document was prepared by Mr. Georges Solaux, Education Specialist
(consultant). This report was reviewed by Jacques Baudouy, Manager, MNSHD; David
Steel, Acting Manager, MNSHD; Marlaine Lockheed, Education Sector Leader,
MNSHD; and Jaffar Bentchikou, Acting Project Adviser, MNI.
Preparation of this ICR was discussed during the Bank's completion mission of
9-20 March 1997. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement,
supervision reports and other material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by commenting extensively on the draft version (in the case of the
Ministry of Vocational Education and Employment a separate document was submitted),
and by endorsing the contents of this joint report.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Loan No. 3054-TUN)
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
Evaluation Summary
1.    Introduction. Tunisia has had a strong and continuous commitment to the development of its
human capital base, and the Bank has been one of its earliest intemational partners in that endeavor. This
project is the fifth one financed by the Bank; the previous four projects focused on expanding access to, and
improving relevance of, primary and secondary schools, and supported the expansion of training to provide
employment opportunities for school leavers and skill upgrading for those in the workforce. Yet, in 1988,
access to nine years of education was not available to all, and improvements were needed in the quality of
education programs and in the efficiencv of educa4iinal administration and management. In vocational
training and technical education, responsibilities were dispersed among various institutions, there was a
weak relationship between training and employment, and resources were limited for improvements in the
quality of training programs. In order to address these issues, and to support the economic adjustment
program it launched in the mid-80s, the Govenmment developed far-reaching reforms in the education and
training sectors and sought Bank assistance in implementing them through this project.
2.     Project Objectives. The major purpose was to support the first phase of the Government's
education and training sector reforms. In education, the project objectives were to: (a) make education
provision more consistent with the country's medium-term development needs, and (b) provide education in
a more equitable and cost-effective manner. In training, the objectives were to: (a) promote pre- and in-
service training in collaboration with companies in the productive sectors, and (b) mobilize additional
resources for training.
3.     To fulfill its objectives in education, the project financed the following components: (a)
rehabilitation of existing primary and secondary schools; (b) construction of school canteens; (c)
construction of new schools corresponding to the second cycle of basic education (7-9); (d) equipping of
the National Maintenance Center; provision of vehicles for regional administrations; and providing micro-
computers to schools on a pilot basis; (e) distribution of books and education materials; (f) institutional
development; (g) curriculum design and development; (h) textbook development and publishing; (i)
teacher training; (j) measurement and evaluation; (k) educational management; (1) maintenance of
buildings; (m) studies to evaluate the reform program; and (n) in-service training for teachers.
4.     To fulfill the objectives in training, the project components were: (a) improvement in the
efficiency of the vocational training administration; (b) strengthening of links with productive sectors;
(c) development of apprenticeship and dual training (alternance); (d) improvements in the quality and
efficiency/effectiveness of training programs; and (e) development of an information system on job
insertion rate of graduates.
5.     Given the ongoing economic adjustment at the time of project appraisal, and the attendant budget
constraints, as well as the pressing needs of the education and training sectors, there is sufficient rationale
for the selection of these objectives. Although the objectives were general in nature, there were specific
activities identified, particularly in education, which are evaluated in detail in the annex tables and
matrices.



6.    Implementation Experience and Results. Achievement of objectives: The project objectives
were satisfactorily attained. In education, activities aimed at increasing the numbers of school places,
improving the availability of equipment, materials and books, enhancing the quality of curricula and
teacher training, and strengthening the management and efficiency of the sector were completed. In
training, although implementation experience was not consistently smooth, the anticipated improvements in
the efficiency of administration, in the availability of training altematives, and in the relationship with
productive sectors were achieved. Costs, financing and timetables: Approximately 98 percent of the loan
was disbursed, for an equivalent of US$93.0 million. In education, disbursements were generally as
planned, and 75 percent of the construction category was disbursed halfway through the project. In
training, there were substantial delays, eventually leading to two extensions of the closing date and the
eventual cancellation of US$1.9 million. The financing arrangements were highly satisfactory, and
counterpart funds (for local expenses) were often disbursed before loan funds were accessed.
7.    Sustainability: It is highly probable that the project achievements will be maintained in the future.
The project emerged from the Govemment's own reform program, and its activities have been incorporated
into the normal functioning of each ministry. The structural changes proposed and executed would have
encountered significant resistance had they not been firmly anchored in the reform actions already identified
by the Government. Subsequent Bank operations have emerged from both the education and training
components, profiting from the foundations established, and the lessons learned, in the implementation of
this project.
8.    Key factors affecting achievement: In both education and training, the most important factor was
the implementation of this project during a transition period in Government's policy-making and
administrative reform process. Although the reforms disrupted the implementation rhythm at key points,
ultimately they resulted in positive outcomes in the organization, management and functioning of both
education and training. Moreover, in education, an important problem was the artificially low budget for
school construction set by the Ministry. As a result, the budgets allocated to certain schools had to be
reduced. Second, there were substantial delays in the launching of training and technical assistance
activities during the first two years of the project. The reduction of training and TA activities, and the
reallocation of funds, enabled the Government to finance the additional expenses due to the budget under-
estimates in construction. However, this meant expected "software" activities could not take place as
planned. Given the importance of such inputs to the long-term goals of education, and given the prevalence
of this in other sectors, high-level Bank missions should take up this issue at the highest levels of
Government. An additional option would be to tie capital expenditures to the fulfillment of specific
requirements that enhance quality. In training, the Government remained reluctant to use loan funds for
extemal technical assistance; consequently, the lack of local expertise in specialized sub-sectors
(particularly in plastics and welding, heating and refrigeration systems) further exacerbated construction
delays and resulted in cost overruns.
9.    Performance: The performance of education component was highly satisfactory. Govemment
staff were motivated, well-informed, and were conversant with Bank procedures. There were few problems
with disbursement, procurement or with the completion of legal covenants. The performance of the trainiMn
component was satisfactory. Changes in organizational structure, in staffing, and in approach as well as
lack of familiarity with the Bank's procedures resulted in several delays in implementation. Ultimately,
however, a more coherent organization of the sector has been created, and subsequent projects (including
one financed by the Bank) are reaping the benefits. Bank performance in both components were
satisfactory: staffing of missions was even-handed, and Bank task managers worked closely with
counterparts to handle problems that arose. There were several shifts in project management and in
disbursement which led to some discontinuity; in addition, in preparation and in supervision, Bank staff
ii



paid significantly more attention to the education component, which commanded 84 percent of the total
loan amount.
10.   Overall project outcome is satisfactory: the project achieved most of its objectives and is highly
likely to achieve substantial development results. There were only a few short-comings, most of which
were sufficiently mitigated by project end.
11.   Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned. The following were the
lessons learned during the implementation of this project: (a) In Bank-Government policy dialogue, it is
important to build consensus during project preparation regarding the major objectives, and to maintain
continuity in the team composition on both sides. Project targets should remain realistic within the political
as well as sectoral realities in the country. (b) In the implementation of civil works, strengthening the
capacity within the Ministry to shepherd appropriate documents through the many Government and World
Bank processing steps, developing good cost estimates of buildings by region, and maintaining adequate
architectural and engineering capacity at the regional level for on-site supervision were crucial. (c) In the
implementation of training and technical assistance, Government preferred not to use loan funds. It will
become increasingly important, therefore, to assist Government in leveraging grant funds for software
inputs, and to build commitment at the highest levels of Government for the inclusion of these inputs in
Banks loans when grant funds are not available. (d) Finally, in project management, training for project
personnel in the areas of strategic planning, budgeting, and supervision should be an integral part of every
project.
12.   Future operations: Two operations emerged from this project: the Secondary Education Project
(FY95) supports the expansion and improvements in the quality of upper basic and secondary schools. The
Second Employment and Training Project (FY96) aims to improve the quality of vocational training and its
links with the market. In addition, the Government requested Bank assistance in studying the major
sectoral issues in education, and the Post-Basic Education Study started mid-way in the implementation of
the project. This study provided important data that informed decisions made in the 8th Plan, in the
remaining years of project, and in the design of the above-mentioned subsequent operations.

Implementation Completion Report
Republic of Tunisia
Education and Training Project
(Loan 3054-TUN)
A. Statement of Objectives
1.    The project was appraised in December 1988 and was presented to the Board of Directors of
the World Bank on 6 April 1989. Its major objective was to support the first implementation phase of
the Government's education and training sector reforms. The project was to achieve its objectives
through the implementation of activities in these two sectors. In education, the project had dual
objectives: (a) to make education provision more consistent with the country's medium-term
development needs, and (b) to provide education in a more equitable and cost-effective manner. In
training, the objectives were: (a) to promote pre- and in-service training in collaboration with
companies in the productive sectors, and (b) to mobilize additional resources for training.
2.    In education, the objectives were clear and realistic, in line with the reform targets of
Government. In training, the objectives were general in nature, reflecting the ambiguity prevalent in
the sector. Whereas the education objectives were accompanied by detailed quantitative and policy
indicators, those for training were more difficult to measure precisely (see tables and matrices in
Annex 1).
B. Achievement of Objectives
3.    Project objectives were substantially achieved, in large part because they were articulated by
the Government in the context of its own reform agendas. The project design was appropriate given the
objectives set for the project. Matrices in Annex 1 to this report give details regarding quantified and
non-quantified targets, and the results at the end of the project. Briefly, in education, almost all of the
education objectives were achieved; project activities to increase school places; improve availability of
equipment and learning materials; enhance the quality of curricula and teacher training, and improve
sector management and efficiency were accomplished. The few quantitative targets that were not
completely met reflected a defining characteristic of the sector as a whole: results were almost always
in the right direction, but the pace was not always as fast as anticipated. In training, the results were
satisfactory when judged against the general targets set, and the project outcomes were an improvement
over the disorganized system in place prior to the reforms.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors generally subject to government control
4.     This project was implemented during a transition period in the government's policy-making
and administrative reform process. Important policy decisions and administrative shifts were made



during the implementation period; although these often disrupted the implementation rhythm of the
project, ultimately they made both the education and training sectors more coherent, putting into place
changes that have already benefited subsequent operations.
5.    In education, the project was appraised at the time the education reforms were being discussed
nationally. The first implementation steps of the Education Reform began in 1989 after project
effectiveness, and the 8th Development Plan as well as the basic education reforms it initiated were put
into place in 1992/93, halfway through project implementation. In training, the Ministry of Vocational
Training and Employment (Ministere de la Formation Professionnelle et de 1 'Emploi or MFPE) was
created in March 1990 as the main locus of TEVT activities. This meant that a more comprehensive
strategy could be definedfor the training sector; however, this change coincided with the most
significant period in the implementation of the project. Although there was broad agreement at the
time of project preparation that having training activities in several major ministries was hampering
efforts to coordinate sectoral policy, the transition periods and the inevitable confusion that surrounds
them created delays. However, these administrative changes, while unwieldy, contributed to the
creation of a structure within which the Government could implement a comprehensive training sector
strategy.
Factors generally subiect to implementing agency control
Education
6.    An important problem in education was the artificially low budget for school construction that
had been set by the Ministry. As a result, the number of classrooms or administrative rooms in certain
schools had to be limited to remain within budget. This problem was acknowledged by the
Government, and subsequent projects have had more realistic budgets.
7.     The delay in training and technical assistance activities in the first two years of the project
meant almost all of the activities had substantial delays. Consequently, funds allocated for these
qualitative aspects were reduced, and the savings were reallocated to the civil works category (in part
because of the budget under-estimates of the latter, as mentioned earlier). The importance of the
software aspects of the project were reiterated at the time of the mid-term review, a revised schedule
for the remaining tasks was drawn up, and most of the planned training, technical assistance and
studies were carried out.
Training
8.     The MFPE was reluctant to use loan funds for external technical assistance. MFPE resisted
hiring relatively expensive international experts to provide training and technical assistance. Instead,
the Ministry preferred to use bilateral grant funds for those activities it deemed to require outside
expertise. It was not always possible to synchronize the timing, objectives, scope and financing
anticipated under the project with those of bilateral donors. In addition, lack of local capacity in
specialized areas (such as heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration, and welding) meant that even
when external firms were hired, supervision could not be adequately carried out by the Government
staff at central or at regional levels.
9.    Due to the delays encountered in the implementation of the project, some elements to be
financed for the sector centers had to be postponed or canceled. These included the technical and
2



sectoral documentation centers, vehicles for transporting trainees to the enterprises for on-site
internships and for visits; the classrooms for general training, and the sport and cultural activity areas.
10.    Although the project was to have been implemented in five years, the construction and
equipping of the last two training centers required two extensions, adding 18 extra months to the
closing date. At present, disbursement records indicate an overall undisbursed amount of US$1.9
million; once final account reconciliations are received from both ministries, a more exact figure will
be furnished; the current estimate is that US$1.9 million will be canceled.
Factors subiect to both implementing agency and Bank control
11.   Disbursements presented several problems, primary among them the confusion between the two
sets of categories (one for education, one for training) in the withdrawal of funds. This was due to the
number of actors: the Banque Centrale de Tunisie (Central Bank of Tunisia) used three or four
numbered systems (not always in sequence), leading to considerable complications regarding which
withdrawal application was being processed; the MFPE requested withdrawals from categories and of
amounts which were inappropriate, resulting in significant differences in the accounts documentation
maintaiped by the MFPE and the Ministry of Education and by the World Bank. There were several
changes in disbursement officers and analysts from the Bank, leading to discontinuity at times. In
addition, procurement actions in training were conducted in a manner that, though within the letter of
the law, showed a willingness on the part of the Borrower to take shortcuts, indicating a lack of
familiarity with Bank procedures.
D. Project Sustainability
12.   It is highly likely that project achievements will be maintained in the future. The project
emerged from the Government's own reform program, and its activities have been incorporated into
the normal functioning of each ministry. The structural changes proposed and executed would have
encountered significant resistance had they not been firmly anchored in the reform actions already
identified by the Government. With respect to policy actions, major actors, implementing agencies and
final decision makers, there is little in this project that is not of the Government. This is one of the
great successes of this project, due primarily to a capable counterpart with a vision of the direction to
be taken in both education and training and the will to get there.
E. Performance of Major Actors
Bank's performance in education
13.   Overall, the performance of the Bank was satisfactory. Bank staff were responsive to the
needs and demands of the education sector. Throughout the identification, preparation and appraisal
stages of the project, a good skill mix was assured between staff members and consultants involved.
The project design was not too complex, and at the time having two implementing agencies under one
project made sense, given the preponderance of overlapping responsibilities in the technical education
and vocational training areas. Few risks arose which had not been identified at the time of project
design. When procurement issues arose (i.e. when local shopping estimates were too low and local
3



competitive bidding expectations at project preparation seemed too optimistic), the Bank worked with
the Government to make the necessary amendments. In those cases where task managers changed,
there were consultants who had worked on the project who were able to provide continuity and
institutional memory as needed. Work with the Ministry of Education was collaborative in nature, and
the close contacts established between the Bank and that Ministry helped in the smooth implementation
of the component. Seeking to take stock of the changing demands of the education sector, the
Government sought the Bank's technical expertise mid-way through the project implementation period
(1993), and a quick but well-regarded piece of sector work was initiated and completed in record time
(the Post-Basic Education Study, issucd as a green cover report in October 1994).
Borrower's performance in education
14.   The borrower's performance has been highly satisfactory. The staff were well motivated and
had had previous experience with the implementation of Bank projects. They were able to process
documents through the various Government and Bank procedures with a minimum of difficulty and
delay. The routine reporting was generally on time, and audit reports were always unqualified.
Project staff did not change during the majority of the project period; therefore, there was excellent
continuity with regard to project objectives and implementation arrangements. Application of both
Government and Bank rules was to the letter, and project management was decisive and thorough.
Bank's performance in training
15.   Overall, the Bank's performance was satisfactory. At the time of project preparation, the Bank
worked closely with counterparts in the sector to identify the interventions which would best
accomplish the objectives as elaborated mutually with the Government. During the first two years,
when implementation progress was slow, the Bank made numerous attempts to help rectify the
situation. During the mid-term review, an extensive review of the sector was done and
recommendations were made to put the program back on track. Changes in task managers and
disbursement staff seem to have been more disruptive to the implementation of this component. With
the approaching closing of the project, and the preparation of other operations (the first of which was
the FIAP project), it became clear that Bank supervision mission concentrated on the completion of the
civil works; little effort was made to enforce the implementation of agreed-on management
improvements.
Borrower's performance in training
16.   The Borrower's performance in training was satisfactory. Changes in organizational structure,
in staffing, and in approach resulted in several delays in implementation, as mentioned above. The
MFPE showed its willingness to seek answers continuously until it arrived at the current structure,
which appears to have resolved the majority of the reasons behind these delays. The Government
showed its commnitment to the attainment of the project objectives by allocating additional budget
resources for the completion of the remaining two centers. Procurement and disbursement difficulties,
encountered at the beginning of the project, were resolved, and procedures have been put into place to
ensure that these problems do not arise again. A committed and competent team is in charge of
projects, and the new Second Training and Employment Project is testament to the confidence that the
Bank and other donors have in the ability of the sector to implement larger and more complex
operations. Audits were always unqualified. Progress reports were not always provided on time, and
during the critical analysis conducted by the ATFP during the last few months of implementation it
4



became clear that the information provided in previous reports was often incomplete and/or incorrect.
This was corrected in the last progress report provided to the Bank mission.
F. Assessment of Outcome
17.    Quantitative targets, actual outcomes and the policy measures of the project, by component, are
provided in Annex 1. In education, quantitative targets were met or surpassed, and activities that
involved construction, rehabilitation or equipment of facilities disbursed quickly and were 75 percent
completed more than two years prior to project closing. This reflects the emphasis placed by the
Ministry of Education (Ministere de I'Education or MEd) on "hardware" inputs over "software" ones
as has been pointed out in numerous other documents. This appears to be a problem in several other
sectors. Although there may be sector-specific solutions, high-level Bank missions (e.g. high-level
planning missions) should take up this issue at the highest levels of Government. In training, the
project objective had been to finance centers which fulfilled the above-mentioned criteria. By mid-term
review, six had fulfilled those criteria, and by project completion an additional two centers could be
financed within the time and budget constraints. Although tracer studies have not yet been done to
assess long-term employment prospects, graduates from the training centers have been found to be in
high demand among the enterprises, and applications to these centers outnumber the places available.
Education
18.    To fulfill its objectives in education (see para. 1 above), the project contained 14 components,
all of which were important but with varying degrees of complexity (ranging from "institutional
development" to "provision of 23 vehicles"). This component is rated highly satisfactory overall.
The targets were substantially met or exceeded. Accelerating construction and rehabilitation of school
facilities allowed increased access to lower secondary. Underserved areas, particularly areas with
relatively low female enrollment, were given priority under the project by the MEd. Thus, the
objective of improving equity was substantially met (see Annex 2 tables and matrices). MEd took the
necessary steps to improve coordination of technical education and vocational training. Technical
streams formerly in secondary education were phased out, and vocational training has been transferred
to the newly created ministry charged with that function. Improvements in the quality of education
were implemented, but were not always timely due to delays in the implementation of TA and training
activities (the matrix in Annex I provides details). Specifically, activities for distributing books and
education materials were successfully carried out; teacher training was expanded and improved, and
training was managed by one sole unit within MEd; new academic programs were developed for
grades 1-9; and curriculum development and textbook preparation processes were institutionalized.
Finally, although it will not be completed until June 1998, the 9-year basic education cycle has been
successfully introduced. Because the introduction did not take place until 1990/91, the first basic
education graduates will not complete grade 9 until September 1998. Therefore, the project
requirement that the rate of promotion of basic school studentsl to grade 10 be reduced from 70
percent to 50 percent may or may not be met. Given the fact that the promotion rate has grown
steadily over the last decade to be near 75 percent at this time, it is unlikely that promotion rates will
fall so dramatically in two years' time. The policy requirement to restrict access to secondary was
rational at the time: the budget was already stretched at all levels, and there was little room for
l I.e. those who entered grade 1 when the reforms were introduced, and who will enter grade 10 in September

expansion of Government expenditures to accommodate the growth in enrollment in upper-basic
schools.
19.    Though cost-effectiveness was a major objective of the project, details regarding which
interventions to assess, and the indicators with which it should be done, were not defined at the time of
project appraisal. Therefore, further conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the cost-effectiveness of
specific interventions. However, there were other noteworthy budgetary issues not specifically
included in the project. Although the share of the total recurrent budget allocated to primary and
secondary education was maintained or rose slightly over the period 1989 - 1995, unit recurrent costs
fell in real terms in secondary from a high in 1992, and unit non-salary unit costs fell in real terms in
both primary and secondary after peaking in 1990. (see Annex 3). Therefore, recurrent cost increases
since 1990 were due primarily to increases in the salary bill and not to higher spending on quality-
enhancing inputs.
Training
20.    To fulfill the objective of the training component (see para. 1 above), the project activities
were: (a) improvement in the efficiency of the administration of vocational training; (b)
strengthening of links with productive sectors; (c) development of apprenticeship and dual training
(alternance); (d) improvements in the quality and efficiency/effectiveness of training programs; and
(e) development of an information system on job insertion rate of graduates.
21.    This component is rated satisfactory overall. The objective of promoting pre- and in-service
training in collaboration with enterprises and professional associations has been substantially met. By
the end of the project, eight sectoral training centers had been created (either through new construction
or through restructuring existing facilities). Each center represented a productive sector selected on
the basis of the following criteria: training agreement with industry associations; economic relevance,
pedagogic organization, feasibility evidence, transfer of technology requirement, and financial criteria.
The sectoral training centers (centres sectoriels or CS) increased both in- and pre-service training
capacity in the selected sectors, played an important role in mobilizing the interest of potential
employers in the training programs and in the graduates, and helped elevate the quality of the
graduates (generally from skilled workers to technicians) resulting in an increase in both employability
and salary possibilities (see quantified achievements in Annex 1).
22.    The mobilization of additional training resources from enterprises and professional
associations has had some positive results. Insufficient attention had been paid at the start of the project
to the process for involving these partners financially. The reform of the vocational training tax (la
Taxe de Formation Professionnelle or TFP) in 1988 involved a reduction from 2 percent to 1 percent of
salaries for the manufacturing sector, with the idea that individual firms would be more motivated to
finance training. By the end of 1993, the reform measure that would reimburse firms for their training
expenditure had been put into place, and the tax list schedule was revised: these measures were to
provide important incentives to enterprises to train their employees. It is unclear, however, what the
impact of these policy changes has been on the participation of the enterprises in the financing of
training within the sectoral centers; moreover, there is little evidence that the amount of training in
enterprises has grown directly as a result of these measures.
23.    Mobilizing additional resources for vocational training from outside the country has been quite
successful; by the completion of this project, the MFPE had generated considerable interest on the part
6



of bilateral partners, who were able to finance a significantly larger program under the Second
Employment and Training Project (effective this fiscal year -- see staff appraisal report # 15515-TUN).
24.   The main unresolved issue is the division of responsibilities between (and the identification of
the target student population for) the education and training systems. With the growing emphases on
involving enterprises in training design and on responding to labor market demands, the training sector
no longer accepts those who have failed out of general education. The Ecoles de Qualifications
Techniques or EQT -- Technical Qualification Schools), created in 1992 after the elimination of the
professional education secondary stream, enrolled up to 18,000 students who had dropped out of
general education in 1995/96. In theory, the EQTs provide pre-apprenticeship training that prepares
their students either to join apprenticeship programs or to enter the vocational education institutions.
However, these EQTs can accept only a fraction of those students who leave the general education
system and who seek admittance elsewhere.
G. Future Operation
25.   As mentioned above, the project was designed within the framework of the Government's
reform program. It is being implemented by mainline Government departments; its functions are
incorporated into their daily administration. Two Bank operations have emerged from both the
education2 and training components, profiting from the foundations established, and the lessons
learned, in the implementation of this project.
H. Key Lessons Learned
Lessons common to both education and training
26.   Bank-Government dialogue: the most important lesson learned, and one which the education
component illustrated particularly well, is the importance of building consensus between the
Government and the Bank regarding the major objectives during project preparation. There had been
considerable consensus-building conducted by the Government while identifying the key reform
activities. The project, therefore, benefited greatly from the congruence between its objectives and
those of the Government and other major stakeholders. There were no fundamental differences in the
development objectives, and the only problems were logistical or administrative in nature.
27.   Implementation of civil works: The capacity within a Ministry to shepherd the appropriate
documents through the many, complex Government and World Bank procurement and disbursement
procedures means that project processing can be handled efficiently. The existence of a well-trained
staff within the MEd who could handle the processing requirements of the project contributed a great
deal to the timely completion of this project; the lack of such capacity at the ATFP hindered project
implementation under the training component.
28.   Implementation of training and technical assistance: These activities were only partially
executed and with significant delays. First priority is given in both education and training to civil
works. External training and foreign technical assistance, when the need for them is acknowledged by
2   The Secondary Education and the Second Employment and Training Projects.

the Borrower, are preferably financed through bilateral arrangements. Therefore, it is important to
leverage, to the extent possible, additional cofinancing in the form of grants to complement Bank
loans. This arrangement will only succeed if there is a strategic plan agreed upon by all donors and
the Government, to be updated regularly, to ensure that training and technical assistance activities are
adequately financed (irrespective of who provides the financing), that they are appropriately sequenced,
and that they remain relevant.
29.   Implementation during transitions: Bank projects, especially those appraised during a
transition period, should set realistic targets. At the time of project effectiveness, the training sector
was still trying to define its role, particularly vis-a-vis the education sector. Many of the planned
activities, though appropriate in terms of their content, would have benefited from closer attention to
the process for implementing them within a transitional environment. This may have led to more
emphasis on project personnel training, and on the involvement of more stakeholders (such as the
enterprises) in the design as well as in the supervision of the project.
30.    Measures of success: Projects should identify indicators and set baseline values to enable
future assessments of whether the project achieved its intended objectives. While the policy matrix
provided a wealth of such indicators for education, they were not as well defined in training. Even in
education, the objective of improving cost-effectiveness was not accompanied by indicators to be used.
It is important to note, however, that the Bank did not require that project impact and process
indicators be included in its projects in 1988.
Lessons in Education
31.    Education quality: The policy requirement to restrict access to secondary was rational at the
time, as mentioned above. To reserve budget resources for expansion of access to upper-basic grades
and to protect expenditures on quality inputs (teacher training, textbooks, etc.), the project
recommended limiting the rate of promotion. The Government's solution was to expand upper-basic
schools but to also continue the expansion of grade 10 and beyond, no doubt due to heavy sectoral and
political pressures. This has, however, squeezed out qualitative inputs to both basic and secondary
education (see non-salary recurrent unit costs, Annex 3). Given the importance of such inputs to the
long-term goals of education, an important lesson would be to secure high-level Government
commitment to their inclusion and, if necessary, to tie capital expenditures to the fulfillment of specific
requirements that enhance education quality.
32.    Civil works: The project would have profited from the existence of good building cost
estimates by region. At the time of project preparation, the apparent lack of such information led to
problems of under-estimation, as discussed above. That has since been resolved, and future projects
will benefit from this lesson (as the Secondary Education Project already has done). The existence of
good architectural and engineering capacity at the regional level, and the ability of regional teams to
review and clear plans for construction and to supervise works, would have helped avoid the budget
under-estimates.
33.   Institutional changes and sustainability: Close collaboration between MEd and the Bank
ensured that the recommended actions were actually carried out in a timely fashion. The structural
changes suggested in the policy matrix would have encountered significant resistance had they not been
anchored in reform actions already identified by the Government. In addition, the director of the
project was also the Director-General of all financial, civil works, and equipment matters; as a result,
his participation ensured that all project activities were integrated seamlessly into the functions of the
8



Ministry. The Bank's and the Government's selection criteria for consultants are well-understood by
Ministry staff. In cases where the studies resulted in recommendations and actions that were feasible
within the financial, political and sectoral priorities of the Ministry, the Government moved ahead with
those recommendations (see Statistical Table 7) and disseminated those results in seminars with the
appropriate stakeholders. Therefore, once the technical assistance bids were launched by the Ministry,
the appropriate steps were taken to institutionalize the results.
Lessons in Training
34.    Government-Bank dialogue: Past experience shows that implementation proceeds most
smoothly in those projects where a core group of the project teams on both sides remain throughout the
implementation period. The Government counterpart at the time of project preparation was the
Ministry of Social Affairs; this soon changed to the MFPE and, with the enactment of the institutional
reform, this included four agencies within that ministry. There were at least four task managers on the
Bank's side as well. Because of these changes, at times the continuity in the policy dialogue was lost.
Therefore, given that such shifts cannot always be avoided, the Bank and its Government counterparts
should strive to raise the awareness of all major stakeholders regarding project objectives; this would
increase the likelihood that project goals are not derailed due to changes within specific organizations.
35.    Project management: It is important to note that, during project preparation and
implementation, neither the Bank nor the Government had anticipated the need for: (a) training of
personnel in project management; (b) the discussion of supervision processes, including modalities for
evaluation as well as performance indicators for the project; (c) additional resources and means for a
project unit (unite de suivi) to continue to play a surveillance role after the dissolution of the Pedagogic
Engineering and Resource Center (Centre de Ressources et de l 'lngenierie Pedagogique or CRIP); and
(d) detailed implementation planning for those projects where far-reaching, structural changes are
expected. These should form an integral part of any project preparation. Given the turnover of staff,
the regular training of project staff in the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures could have
eliminated a number of implementation problems.
36.    Civil works and equipment: It is important to manage with great care the overlap between the
conception, execution and the supervision of projects. As problems arose with the construction and
equipping of the training centers, there was little capacity on-site to recognize and resolve them early
in the process. The supervision and execution of work was to be managed from the central
administration, but sound mechanisms for on-site supervision and tracking progress were not
developed. Thus, problems that would have been easily resolved at the early stages (such as design
flaws in buildings) were allowed to proceed unchecked, resulting in costly remedial measures later in
the process.
37.    Partnership innovations: The use of partnership contracts with the relevant sector enterprises
(conventions) as well as the constitution of a Conseil consultatif (advisory group) for each center
enabled rror- consistent contact between the centers and the ultimate employers of their graduates. It
also enabled ine enterprises to have input at the conception stage of each training program to ensure
that the students were receiving relevant training. This process is still in the early stages, and the roles
of the Conseil consultatif have not yet been adequately internalized by all of the concerned parties. An
important development in the future would be a more systematic financial involvement of the partners
in the functioning of the centers.

Additional Trainin2 Results
The restructured centers are:
* CSF Habillement de Manouba (garments). Considered we;l-established within the
sector, and has excellent reputation with the enterprises. Is running at full capacity.
* CSF Textile Bir El Kassaa (textiles: cofinanced by Hans Seidel)
*  CSFM&anique generale de Grombalia (mechanics)
* CSFPlasturgie, Outillage et Soudure de Sousse (plastics, tools and welding): The
center is not fulfilling all of its functions at this time. Plasturgie (plastics) has not been
fully equipped whereas the Soudage (welding) has not benefited from any project
activities, resulting in its obsolescence.
* CSFEnergetique de Kairouan (utilities): Due in part to the complexities of this
center, it encountered the greatest difficulties, particularly with regard to the
completion of construction and the equipping of the center. After two extensions to
the project closing date, and substantial additional resources from the Tunisian budget,
the center opened its door in May 1996.

The newly constructed centers are:
*  CSF Cuir et Chaussures de Megrine (leather and shoes): This center has doubled its
numbers after the project was implemented and enjoys an excellent reputation with the
professional associations and the employers of its graduates.
* CSFHabillementMohamedAli a Sfax (garments): This center is well-regarded by the
enterprises, and has reached full capacity of trainees.
* CSF Energetique de Djerba (utilities): As mentioned above in the case of Kairouan,
the Djerba center also encountered major difficulties. The center opened in January
1997 after additional funds were provided by the Tunisian budget.
A total of 113 new hires received preparatory training at the CENAFFIF, and 143
trainers already in service benefited from refresher courses in Tunisia and overseas (much
of the overseas training was paid for by bilateral assistance). Not only were the number of
specialties increased (as shown in the table above), but new technologies were introduced
in all of the sector centers, of which CAD-CAM (computer-aided design/computer aided
manufacturing) concepts were an example.
In terms of teaching capacity, the sector went from a capacity to accommodate
994 students with an annual flow of 731 in 1992 (before the first projects became
operational), to a capacity of 2,310 with an annual flow of 1,306 students. In terms of
improving the qualification of the graduates and in increasing the number of subject areas
at their disposal, the following table is illustrative:

Annex 2: Sectoral Issues in Education'
Education sector background
Prior to the Education Reform (Law voted in 1991), the Tunisian education sector
had the following structure: a primary cycle of 6 years and a secondary cycle of 7 years
(the latter was divided into 3 years of lower secondary and 4 years of upper secondary).
After completing 6th grade, students are allocated to either the academic secondary
education stream (I 'enseignement secondaire long) or the professional education stream
(V 'enseignementprofessionnel), based on the student's age.
L 'enseignement secondaire long comprised two cycles: a joint first cycle of 3
years, and a second cycle of (a) general education for 4 years, leading to the school
leaving exam (baccalaureat); (b) industrial education for 3 years, leading to a
technician diploma; or (c) economic education for 3 years, also leading to a
technician diploma.
L 'enseignement secondaire professionnel lasts 3 years. The students with the best
grades from this cycle were authorized to go into technical secondary education
corresponding to their areas of specialization.
Project actions
O6jective 1:   To mak, thie provision of education more consistent with thie country's medium-term
deve(opment needs, andto provide education in a more equita6fe and cost-effective manner
Among the reform program targets set by the Government, the ones most relevant
to the objectives of this project were the following: (a) reduction of enrollments in
primary while maintaining or improving net enrollment rates; (b) increase in enrollments in
grades 7-9, (c) reduction in dropouts in basic education; (d) reduction in the numbers of
teachers in grades 1-6; (e) increase in the number of teachers in grades 7-9; (f) maintaining
the share of the recurrent budget for education; and (g) decrease of unit recurrent costs
per grade 9 completer2. As Table A2. 1 below shows, although the changes were in the
direction mandated by the reforms, the pace was not as fast as anticipated. Growth in
primary enrollments slowed while absolute numbers of primary students continued to
increase. Although dropout and repetition rates fell in all grades 1-6, they did not fall
enough to cause a net decline in enrollments, as had been anticipated. Upper basic (7-9)
enrollments grew as expected, at almost ten times the rate of enrollment in primary. There
All data, unless otherwise noted, come from the Ministry of Education, Dept. of Planning and
Statistics.

was no decline in the numbers of teachers in primary as anticipated by the reform;
however, the increase in upper basic and secondary teachers was twice that in primary.

In addition, other quantitative reform targets were set for basic education and were
mostly achieved. The number of students per class grew by 2.3 percent but was
maintained at acceptable levels (31.2 as compared with a target of 30.5); the dropout rate
in grade 5 showed significant improvements, registering levels 16 percent lower than
expected in 1992/93, and 23 percent lower in 1993/94. Although the dropout rate in
grade 6 fell from 23.4 percent in 1989/90 to 16.7 percent in 1993/94, it did not reach the
target of 15 percent (it reached 15.7 percent in 1995/96).
There were two other goals expressed in the project document: making education
more equitable and more cost-effective.
Equitable education: Over the period 1989-1994, the Government reform
program supported the construction and rehabilitation of school facilities, which in turn
helped expand access to those previously unable to attend school. The project financed
the rehabilitation of 1,600 primary and 330 secondary schools; the construction of 800 and
the equipment of 841 school canteens, and the construction and equipping of 146
secondary schools, comprising a majority of the investment program for education. As a
result of the Government policy, the following trends were seen in expanding access:

It should be noted that in primary and in secondary, the most disadvantaged
gouvernorats were most likely to be those with the largest percentage increases. Tunis,
arguably the most privileged gouvernorat, actually showed a small decline in primary and
only a modest increase in secondary. The two most important exceptions are Le Kef and
Beja which, although disadvantaged, saw actual declines in total enrollment in primary,
and average growth in enrollments in secondary during the period in question. This is
most likely due to demographic declines, and may also be an indicator of increased rural-
urban migration.
Increasing access of girls to education was an important reform achievement: in
primary education, females as a share of total enrollment rose from 45.5 percent of all
students in 1989/90 to 47.1 percent in 1995/96, and represented an additional 65,000 girls
in primary school. In secondary, females as a share of total enrollment increased from
45.5 to 47.1 percent over the same period, and represented an additional 137,000 girls in
secondary school. The increases by gouvernorats are as follows:

Again, the gouvernorats with the lowest enrollments for females were the ones
that saw the highest percent increases in both primary and secondary. The best served

Obective 2:   to improve the quality and rerevance of secondiary education (grades 10-13) white
controirmg access to it.
Quality of education was to be improved through interventions in programs and
curricula, teacher training and teaching practices, and educational resources. The major
vehicles for improving the quality and relevance of secondary education were the technical
assistance and training activities financed by the project (see Table below).
Programs and curricula. The reforms introduced a 9-year basic education cycle,
and have replaced the 6th grade national examination with a regional examination.
Secondary education, too, was restructured, and the distinction between general and
technical secondary education was removed. The 3-year technician diploma program was
phased out, and secondary education was changed to a two-year core program (1 0th and
11th grade equivalent), followed by two years in one of five major streams (humanities,
experimental science, math, technical subjects, and economy-management).
Teacher training and teaching practices. The reform was able to increase the
numbers of primary school teachers to be recruited at the baccalaureat level, and to
provide them with formal pedagogical training: one year of intensive training followed by
a year of combined training and internship. Extensive in-service training was provided to
existing teachers to introduce them to the reform and to changes in curricula, as well as to
new programs of study, textbooks, and instructional materials. Identification of student
weaknesses and remedial instruction was also introduced in all teacher training courses.
For secondary, programs were developed to introduce a year of subject-specific training
for teachers of grades 7-9, and pedagogic training was introduced for graduates who have
already started teaching without such training. Secondary school teachers without
university degrees were provided with refresher courses.
Higher Institutes for Teacher Training (Instituts Superieurs de la Formation des
Maitres), which had replaced the former Teacher Training Institutes (Ecoles Normales
d 'Instituteurs), provided a two-year training course after the baccalaureat and were able
to meet the recruitment demand of the first cycle of basic education starting from
September 1991. An in-service training program was able to sensitize staff already in
place to the curriculum changes introduced by the reform.
For the second cycle of basic education (grades 7-9) and for secondary education
(grades 10-13), the additional demand for teachers was satisfied through the recruitment
of graduates of the Higher Institutes (see above) for all subjects except for French and
history/geography. This strengthened further the qualifications of the teaching corps.
Educational resources: Public resources spent in education in Tunisia, as a share
of GDP and of Government budget, equal or exceed those spent in other countries at
similar per capita income levels. Budgetary allocations for education remain high, and the
sector has been well-protected from fiscal reductions in the past few years. Total



Annex 2
Page 6 of 6
recurrent expenditures in primary and secondary, as well as non-salary recurrent
expenditures, have shown small declines over the past few years. Unit total recurrent
costs in primary have also shown modest increases, whereas there have been small
declines in real terms in secondary in 1993 and 1994 (see Annex 3). Although these figure
do not necessarily reflect improvements or declines in quality, they show that expenditures
on key qualitative inputs (textbooks, education materials, etc.) were not protected during
the period when the project was under implementation.

Cost effectiveness: Although the project sought to improve cost-effectiveness, it had not
identified indicators nor had it set baseline values against which the impact of specific
interventions could have been measured.
The project financed a study to: (a) identify quantitative and qualitative indicators
regarding the internal and extemal efficiency of the system; and (b) establish a methodology for
the evaluation of the education system. In addition, the following tables indicate the trends in
public expenditure in education during the project implementation period.

Annex 4: Sectoral Issues in Training
In 1989, the training sector had no obvious single champion: The Ministere des
Affaires Sociales (MAS - Ministry of Social Affairs) was the location of the Office de la
Formation Professionnelle et de I 'Emploi (OFPE - Office of Vocational Education and
Labor), which was in charge, inter alia, of the majority of technical education and
vocational training (TEVT) activities. However, significant TEVT activities were also
being conducted in the then Ministere de I 'Education et des Sciences (now the Ministere
de l 'Education) as well as some activities within other technical ministries, public
enterprises and private training institutions. The training sector across all ministries was
merely a holding place for students who had failed out of general education, and was
unsuited to prepare its students for jobs in the labor market or to provide them with sound
technical knowledge.
The training component had two major objectives, i.e. to promote pre- and in-
service training in collaboration with companies in the productive sectors, and to mobilize
additional resources for training. The project aimed to fulfill these objectives by: (a)
financing the conversion of existing vocational training institutions into sectoral training
centers catering to specific industries; and (b) by constructing new sectoral centers. The
Pedagogic Engineering and Resource Center (Centre de Ressources et de I 'Ingenierie
P&Iagogique or CRIP) was to prepare, review, and appraise sub-project applications in
accordance with criteria agreed upon at the time of negotiations of the project (criteria
provided as annex to the SAR). Among others, the criteria included an agreement with
industry associations and the establishment of the economic, pedagogic, financial
feasibility.
Between October 1988 and October 1991, the CRIP identified and participated in
the formulation of the sub-projects (i.e. the creation of the new sector centers). Over this
period, the CRIP worked with technical assistants on various missions to design the
project as envisaged during the project preparation period. Contact with the various
sector actors was given great emphasis, which included the enterprises and the relevant
professional associations.
Although the Office de la Formation Professionnelle et de / 'Emploi (OFPE) had
identified two projects that were ready to start at the time of negotiations, the first bid was
not launched until October 1991 due in large part to: (1) the lack of familiarity of the
Borrower with World Bank procurement guidelines and standard documents; and (2)
with changes in policy regarding the criteria to be used to select sub-projects.
From October 1991 to November 1993, the Direction des Equipements et
Travaux (DET - the Department of Goods and Works) was put in charge of the civil
works related to the construction and restructuring of the centers, including the
procurement, disbursement, supervision and final reception of buildings and equipment).



Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
This separation of responsibilities between conception (by the CRIP) and implementation
of projects (by the DET) led to an untenable confusion of roles, and difficulties arose due
to differences in approach between the two entities. The situation was somewhat resolved
when the Ministry decided to merge the CRIP and the DET into one Direction des Projets
de Centres (DPC - Department of Projects of Centers) with all of the responsibilities
ranging from conception of ideas to reception of finished buildings and equipment.
During the implementation period of this project, the strategic planning capacity
was most severely eroded. Project execution was significantly delayed and was
characterized by the following problems:
(1) absence of sub-project directors who were adequately qualified in the sectoral
areas;
(2) absence of an information (tracking) system;
(3) difficulties in synchronizing the actions of various actors; and
(4) lack of commitment to new approach of involving enterprises in the management
of the training sector.
Since April, several fundamental changes have taken place that enabled the
completion of the t . centers that were incomplete at the time of the first closing date.
Subsequent projects, however, especially the Second Employment and Training Project,
that became effective this fiscal year, will benefit greatly from these changes. With regard
to the completion of this project, the new structure was able to:
(1) provide an up-to-date plan of operations to complete the different sector centers
as planned;
(2) install a system of supervision that was computerized and updated frequently; and
(3) a new role for sub-project directors (in the two instances of Djerba and Kairouan,
the last two sector centers and the ones with the greatest difficulties, the sub-project
directors charged with completing the works were also the ultimate heads of the
centers themselves; as the final users of the centers, these sub-project managers were
interested in having the centers constructed well and in a timely fashion).

Etude sur le rendement interne du premier cycle de l'enseignement de base.
Entre le Minist&re de l'Education et la mission de la Banque mondiale qui s'est rendue a Tunis
du 10 au 22 juin 1996, il a ete convenu qu'une etude sur le rendement interne (analyse des abandons) du
systeme educatif au terrne de la sixieme annee de l'enseignement de base serait conduite par les services
du Ministere de l'Education. L'etude est actuellement en cours de realisation sous l'autorite du
Nlinistere de l'Education, et elle est pilotee par le Directeur de la DPS. Une assistance technique
etrangere permet d'apporter un regard exterieur et une experience internationale en la matiere. Le
reliquat du Don japonais pour le secteur social finance l'etude. La situation actuelle du travail entrepris
peut etre resumee comme suit:
(i)   Une premiere etape s'est achevee a la fin du mois de janvier 1997 avec la realisation d'un
Rapport Intermediaire.
(ii) La seconde etape actuellement en cours se caracterise par une enquete aupres des
Directeurs d'ecoles, des families et des eleves ayant abandonn6. Le rapport d'exploitation
de ces questionnaires sera disponible pour fin juin 1997.
(iii) Troisieme etape: les acteurs du systeme educatif seront consultes en vue de recueillir leur
avis sur les voies et moyens a mettre en oeuvTe pour arneliorer le rendement interne du
systeme fin juillet 1997.
(iv) Quatrieme etape: l'etude sera completee en septembre 1997 par les entretiens aupres
d'instiruteurs et de families en vue de recueillir leur analyse du fonctionnement de l'ecole
et des ameliorations a y apporter afin de developper le rendement interne.
Le rapport final sera disponible pour la fin du mois d'octobre. La mission de la Banque tient a
souligner l'inter& et le serieux des methodologies developpees par la DPS dans la conception et la
realisation de cette etude.
Le descriptif plus detaille du deroulement de cette etude est joint en annexe 1. 11 comprend un
calendrier et la situation des depenses previsionnelles. Les questionnaires et la methodologie de
1'echantillonnage sont egalement joints en arnexe.
Concernant le paiement des depenses engagees pour la realisation de l'etude, il a ete convenu
entre la mission de la Banque, les representants du Minist&e du Developpement Economique, et ceux
du Ministere de l'Education que les frais occasionnes par l1'tude seront imputes sur le reliquat du Don
Japonais selon la procedure suivante: le NMinistere de l'Education fait parvenir l'etat et les destinataires
des depenses (deplacements, enqueteurs, expertise, publications) au Ministere du Developpement
Economique. Ce dernier ordonne a la Banque mondiale de payer les depenses sur le reliquat du Don
japonais.

Educ. Spec.                              mission did not pay adequate
attention to the training and
technical assistance aspects of the
project. The Borrower agreed to
send to the Bank the supplements
necessary to bring the progress
report up to date on those aspects.
Training component: Only the
works to be financed by the Bank
had been completed on the two
remaining centers. The mission
noted with concern that neither
center would be completed as
planned, due largely tol
fundamental problems with the
physical restructuring plan in
Kairouan, and with the lack of
several essential elements (and the
remarkably bad planning of others)
in Djerba. The Borrower will keep
the Bank informed as to the
progress of these centers. In either
case, both centers will be
operational before the beginning of
the next school year (November for
Djerba, and early in the new year
for Kairouan).
