MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR AN ANDHRA PRADESH FIRST REFERRAL HEALTH SYSTEM PROJECT
1.    The following memoranum and recommendation on a proposed credit to India is submitted for
approval. The credit, for SDR 90.7 million (US$133 million equivalent), would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years matuity. The credit would help finance an Andhr Pradesh First Referral Health
System Project. The proceeds of the credit would be passed on by the Government of India (GOI) to the
state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) in accordance with standard arrangements for development assistance to
States.
2.    Countr/State/Sector Bd. During the past two decades India has developed a publicly
financed and managed universal basic health service ifstructure. The Government's long term strategy,
as enunciated in the National Health Policy (NHP) of 1983, is to give high priority to the control of
fertility, infectious diseases of public health importance and preventable causes of maternal and childhood
mortality and morbidity. This is an appropriate health policy given India's burden of disease. However,
investment allocations do not reflect the pnorities highlighted in the government's health policy and
implementation has been weak. Key health indicators show that the health status of India's population
remains low. Communicable diseases continue to be major health problems; maternal mortality is high;
acute respiratory and diahrreal disea   continue to be the major causes of childhood mortality; and
preventable mortality and morbidity, especially among the poor, extract a high toll. Moreover, with the
increasing age profile of its population, India is moving into an epidemiological transition with the double
burden of significant commuDicable diseases and increasig non-communicable dieases such as cardio-
vascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and cataract blindness.
3.    With a population of 66.3 million (1991), AP is the fifh most popuous state in India with a health
status and epidemiological profile that are about the national average for India. The public health system
in AP is similar to that in the rest of India, consisting of ree tiers. At the bottom are primary health
care facilities which provide basic health services, with emphasis on preventive and promotive care. In
the middle are first referral or secondary hospitals at the district, area and community levels, which
provide inpatient and ouatient care with diagnostic and treatment facilities not available at the primary
level. At the top are tertiary hoptals, staffed and equipped to provide more specialized treatment.
4.    Overall, the delivery of health services is weak and the health system suffers from a low level of
efficiency and effectiveness. The man reasons for this are: (i) inadequate and suboptimal aRocation of
public resources to the health sector resulting in underfundig of drugs and essential supplies, lack of
mainenance of equipment and shortage of doctors and medical personmel; (ii) neglect of first referral
facilities resuing from an overemphasis on terdary care; (iii) weak management at all levels and lack of
an effective planning capacity; (iv) inadequate support services and infrastruce at first referral facilities;
(v) a poorly functioning referral system providing weak insdtutional and technical linkages;
(vi) insufficient access to health serices, especialy for the poor and underserved populatin; and
(vii) insufficient capacity to enable and monitor the development of the private health sector.
S.    Lesons fom            . Importanc lessons from the experience of social sector projects in
India have been incoorated in the design and implementation of the proposed project Four completed
population, health and nutrition (PHN) projects in India indicate that despite many positive outcomes, the



2
completed and ongoing projects have suffered consistently from a variety of implementation problems,
These have included: late start-up, poor procurement, slow disbursement, frequent management turnover,
untimely and inadequate flow of fumds, poor maintenance of buildings and equipment, and inconsistent
attention to software and qualitative aspects. The design of this project takes account of these concerns
and problem areas. In addition, the proposed project provides linkages with other PHN projects in AP
by complementing and consolidating pevious investments and by coordinating policy and implementation.
For example, the strengthening of the first level referral for obstetrics and child care in this project
through the provision of essendal clinical and diagnostic services will complement the primaiy level of
services being provided under Population VI, Population VIII and the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood
(CSSM) projects. The Staff Appraisal Report provides details regarding these linkages.
6.    IMA Strav and Rationale for lnolvemeit. This project is consistent with the World Bank
Group's Country Assistant Strategy for India (May 12, 1994; Report Nos.IDA/R94-65 or P-6141-IN)
which supports GOI's efforts to provide an enabling environment for broad-based, efficient private sector-
led growth while accelerating the development of human resources. In the health sector, IDA's strategy
is to assist India in reducing the level of mortality, morbidity and disability through a two-pronged
approach. The first component of this approach is to reduce the burden of the most significant
communicable diseases through national programs Scit ac the AIDS Control and Leprosy Elimiation
projects. The second component is to strengthen the performance of state health systems in dealing with
the evolving burden of disease by providing more efficient and effective health care which will mostly
benefit the poorer sections of society who use it the most.
7.    IDA investment in the proposed project is justified for the following reasons. First, the project
would strengthen and upgrade first referral or secondary health facilities without which the primary health
care system cannot implement the various national health progms and provide basic health care in rural
areas. Second, the project will consolidate the investments made by a number of other IDA supported
projects in the PHN sector in AP, and ad I incremental value to its overall health care system. Third, the
proect is consistent with IDA's strategy of strengthening state health systems, since it would help the
sutaes to: (i) optimize resource use; (ii) avoid duplication and wastage; and (iii) reduce overcrowding at
tertiary health care institutions. Fourth, the project is in line with the overall IDA stategy of poverty
reduction in India. The reason for selecting AP as the first state to develop a health systems project is
its fairly representatve characteristics in terms of income level, poverty, demographic indicators and
epidemiological profile.
8.    Project Oblectves. The objectives of the proposed project would be to assist the Government
of AP to: (i) improve efficiency in the allocation and use of health resources through policy and
institutional development; and (ii) improve the performance of the health care system through
improvements in the quality, effectiveness and coverage of health services at the first referral level to
better serve the neediest sections of society. The ultimate goal of the project would be to improve the
health stats of the people of AP, especially the poor, by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability.
9.    Scoe and Approach. The proposed IDA credit would assist the Government of AP to put in
place a sustiable first referral health system which would provide vital support and credibility to primary
health care services and the rest of the health sector. The state's capacity to implement such a program
would be based on two closely related elements. The first is an organizational strure of preventive and
curative aspects of health care that would adequately integrate primary health care services with first
referral hospitals. The second is a program of health sector policy reform to provide the general



3
framework for health sector development. Accordingly, die project would selectively implement some
key sectoral policy reforms. Specifically, these reforms would: (i) enhance the overall size of the health
budget and redress the imbalance in public expenditures between the secondary and teriary health care
levels; (ii) safeguard the operations and maintenance component of the budget to ensure adequate supplies
of drugs and essential medical materials and maintenance of equipment and infrastructure; (iii) implement
service improvements and user charges at first referral hospitals; (v) provide greater authority to the
Andhra Pradesh Vaidya Vidhana Parishad (APVVP), the inplementing agency, to select, employ and
transfer staff; (vi) enhance the capacity of the state government to undertake policy analysis of health
sector issues; (vii) contract-out selected services, especially supporting services; and (viii) undertake a
review of the policy framework for private provision of health services in the state.
10.   Project Descridtion. The three project components would be to: (i) improve the institutional
framework for policy development and implementation capacity; (ii) improve service quality, access and
effectiveness at district hospitals by upgrading 21 district hospitals, updating norms and standards for
clinical and support service, adopting staffing norms in accordance with services provided, adopting a
quality assurance piogram, and enhancing staff skills in clinical and technical areas; and (iii) improve
quality, access and effectiveness at area and community hospitals by upgrading 49 area and 80 community
hospitals and undertaking the improvements as in component (ii). The project would also improve the
referral system by providing better linkages between different levels of health care, strengthening
management of the referral system, implementing referral and clinical management protocols, and
establishing an incentive system for users and staff. Overall, the quality of services provided to patients
at 9,651 existing beds at first referral hospitals would be enhanced, an additional 4,349 beds providing
upgraded services would be added and the quality of and access to outpatient services would be enhanced
at these hospitals.
11.   Prolect Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at about Rs.6,083.2 milion or US$159.0
million equivalent, including taxes and duties esthnated at US$8.8 million equivalent. IDA would finance
about US$133.0 million or about 88.6 percent of total project costs net of taxes; the balance would be
fmanced by the Govermnent of AP. The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$27.5
million. The project would finance civil works, equipment and furniture, vehicles, medical. and laboratory
supplies, medicines, other supplies, MISIIEC supplies, professional services, tra ng, studies and
evaluations, and incremental salaries and costs on a declining basis. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group Operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 13402-IN, dated November 2, 1994, is being distributed separately.
12.   Project hnplementation. The project would be implemented by GOAP within the existing
administrative structure. APVVP would be the main implementing agency and its Commissioner would
be the Project Coordinator. APVVP is a Govermnent agency created in 1986 by a legislative enactment
to manage and improve the functioning of first referral facilities. The initial phase of project
implementation will focus on developmenal activities including project launch, monitoring mechanisms
and performance indicators, strengthening the health MIS system, initiating in-service training of staff in
clinical, management and equipment matters, strengthening the functions and appointing staff at the Head
Office and supplying equipment to improve the quality of services at existing hospital facilities.
13.   Project Sainaility. Incremental recurrent costs, including contingencies, at project completion
would be about Rs.300 million (US$9.6 million at current exchange rates) annaly, a 38% increase in



4
recurrent costs from current levels. These incremental recurrent costs at project completion amount to
only 0.3% of the state's overall curtent budget and about 5.6% of the state's Health and Family Welfare
(FW) budget. Allocations to APVVP amount to about 13% of the state's total Health and FW budget.
Assuming current allocation patterns between the three levels of health care were to remain the same, at
project completion expenditures allocated to APVVP would have to increase by 7 percentage points to
about 20 percent of the total health and FW budget. Fyrthermore, analysis shows that fees fron private
paying wards and user charges, which the Government of AP plans to implement, would generate an
estimated amount of Rs.50 million amnually at project completion. This would reduce the recurrent cost
burden by an estimated 15-18%.
14.   Agreements Reached. At Negotiations, the Government of AP and APWP provided assurances
that they would: (a) carry out the Reform Program including: resource enhancement for the secondary and
primary levels of health care; safeguarding of resource allocation for operations and maintenance purposes
to provide for adequate amounts of drugs and essential supplies, and maintenance of equioment and
buildings at secondary hospitals; selection, employment and transfer of staff; implementation of service
improvements and user charges in accordance with an agreed program and time schedule; and retention
of a third or more of user charges at collecting hospitals; (b) carry out by December 31, 1995, a review
of the policy framework for private provision of health services in AP; (c) carry out, not later than July
1, 1997, jointly with GOI and IDA, a detailed mid-term review of project progress including a
management review of APWP; (d) adopt within six months after upgadation of each facility, staffing
and technical nonns at its district, area and community hospitals to ensure the quality of services; (e) take
necessary steps to strengthen the referral system by July 1, 1995; (f) ensure that allocation of project funds
each year for APWP will be additional to that in FY95, and that APVVP shall be provided resources
for recurrent expenditures on a timely basis; and (g) carry out the project in tribal blocks in accordance
with an agreed strategy.
15.   Project Benefis. First, the policy reforms envisaged under the project would improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of health care services at the community, area and district levels. The
strengthening of AP's first referral health system would optimize resource use by reducing patient flow
and overcrowding at teriary hospitals, where treatment per patient is more expensive, thereby avoiding
duplication and waste. Second, the project will have a direct impact on improving the health status of the
people of AP by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability and thus increase the potential earning
capacity of the poor. Third, strengthening the first referral facilities and making them more client-friendly
would also encourage patients to seek timely care resulting in higher cure rates at lower costs. Fourth,
the strengthening and upgrading of first referral facilities would lend vital support and credibility to the
primary health care system for implemening the various national health programs, and provide basic
health care in rural areas. Finally, an adequately functioning first referral health system at the area and
district levels would encourage a greater participation of the private sector in health care.
16.   Prozrai Objective Categories. Povertv Aspects. A large proportion of project beneficiaries
will be from the poor and underprivileged segments of the state's population. At project completion, the
project is expected to benefit about 14 million outpatients and inpatients annually through quality
enhancement and increased capacity. Gender lssum. In general, the project would provide much greater
access to women, particularly rural women, and improve the quality of services they receive. More
specifically, by strengthening the referral system and linding the community hospitals with primary health
centers, the project will assist in providing timely access to emergency obstetric care, and shorten the
waiting and transportation time. Eighty community hospitals, in addition to the area and district hospitals,



5
will be staffed and equipped under the project to deliver emergency perinatal care. The provision of these
services are critical to reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. Indigenous Populations (Scheduled
Tribes). The project's tribal strategy is aimed at increasing the demand and seeking timely care by
improving the quality of services and providing effective infonnation, education and communications
(IEC) to better inform tribal populations of the benefits of using fist referral facilities. Tribal peoples
would be a substantial beneficiary group. The system's capacity at area and community hospitals will be
increased from 270 beds to 560 beds to serve tribal areas. In addition, the project would: (i) strengthen
linkages between prinmury and secondary health care services; (ii) provide an incentive package to doctors
and other medical staff in tribal areas to encourage them to accept assignment in these areas: and
(iii) increase the appropriate utilization of the non-tribal medical system by tribal populations and reduce
the cost to tribals of utilizing the system. Enironmentai Aspects. The project does not raise any
environmental issues.
17.   Risks. The project carries several risks that are associated with PHN projects in general in India.
These include the basic implementation problems mentioned in paragraph 5. Most of these risks have
been substially reduced through careful project design. There are two additional risks associated with
this project. Institutoral. Since this would be the first project to reorient a state bealth system in India,
the capacity of existing institutions to undertake systemic improvements and to establish a more rational
health delivery system has not been tested in India. The institutional strengthening aspects that are
included in the project are expected to address this risk. Financial. Another risk would be the potental
hurdles faced by the state government to instituting user charges because of the politically sensitive nature
of this issue. The AP Govermment has, however, reaffirmed its commitment to instituing user charges
while protectng those who cannot afford to pay. The overall financial status of the state is a risk in terms
of the adequacy of fimds allocated to the health sector, especially allocations to the secondary level of
health care. The Govermnent of AP, through a Health Sector Policy Letter, has committed to providing
sufficient investment and recurrent resources to meet the financial needs generated by this project.
18.   Reconmmedaon. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and reconmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
