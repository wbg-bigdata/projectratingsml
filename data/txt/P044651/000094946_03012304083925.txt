3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project was an engineering Credit for technical assistance with the objective to: (a) provide the
economic and design analysis for the improvement of the road infrastructure which will improve market
linkages, promote economic growth and thereby alleviate poverty, as well as facilitate access to public
health and education services; (b) establish contract administration capacity within the Road Transport
Construction Department (RTCD) to facilitate private sector involvement in road and bridge works; and (c)
improve the efficiency of RTCD's force account maintenance and construction capacity.
The project objectives were consistent with the Government's road sector development program, which
recognized linkages between road improvements and other objectives such as rain-fed agricultural
development, refugee resettlement and access to education and health services. The objectives were clear
and realistic and provided basic preparatory groundwork for a program of prioritized infrastructure
improvements on specific routes and a prioritized bridge program to safeguard access on other roads. The
project also provided a framework for dialogue with the Government on capacity building and the overall
road sector development program. The specific focus of the project was on strengthening the capacity of
the RTCD in procurement and contract administration organization systems and the Infrastructure
Department of the Ministry of Public Works (MoPW-ID) in the areas of: finance and accounting, contract
administration, highway engineering and project management (MIS). In addition, Bank supported Human
Resource Development Project has recruited staff to strengthen the capacity of MoPW-ID. The focus on
strengthening force account maintenance and construction capacity was appropriate in view of: (a) the need
to improve effectiveness of in-house capacity in road maintenance in the short-run because of an absence of
domestic construction capacity; and (b) deteriorating condition of the equipment. The project supported
strengthening contract management, financial management and procurement arrangements to develop
capacity of domestic private construction industry in the long-run and allow a planned shift from force
account construction to contract works.
Other donor support to the country in the road sector included: (a) UNDP administered Italian Grant
(US$54,395) (July 2000 to December 2001) contributed financing for purchase of essential furniture,
computer, equipment and training and GPS codes needed for establishment of the Inffrastructure
Department; and (b) EU financed technical assistance (February 1996 to September 2000)--Highway
Engineer (US$231,600) to the MoPW to implement Govemment's overall roads development program.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original project objectives were not revised during implementation. However, the DCA was amended
seven times during implementation. On four occasions, it was revised: (i) on May 31, 1999, following
Govemment's request, to permit the Bank's funding of 60% of the local costs of consulting services; (ii) on
July 5, 1999, to provide for up to $1.2 million for the purchase of proprietary parts for specific makes of
equipment; (iii) on February 1, 2000 to increase the limit on purchase of proprietary parts to $1.9 million;
and (iv) on May 15, 2000 to revise the category allocation table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the DCA.
In addition, the DCA was revised three times to extend the closing date by 18 months, from December 31,
2000 to June 30, 2002. The last two extensions were provided, inter alia, to complete the extemal
training.
3.3 Original Components:
The project comprised of the following two components:
1. Infrastructure Strengthening Studies. (i) a feasibility and environmental impact assessment to
- 2 -



determine appropriate design and construction standards for the rehabilitation of the existing
Keren-Barentu-Tessenei road (265 kIn) and upgrading of the Barentu-Mendefera road/track (195 kIn);
to be followed by detailed engineering designs for the agreed civil works; and (ii) a national bridge
condition and structural strength survey to develop a prioritized program of bridge works to remedy the
damage and deterioration of the previous thirty years.
2. Institutional Strengthening. (i) technical assistance and training for RTCD personnel in procurement
and contract administration organization, systems and procedures; (ii) hands-on training to upgrade
mechanics skills, including procurement of spare parts for equipment repairs and training program; (iii)
training for trainers (both in-house and overseas); and (iv) construction of a small training facility and
workshop within the RTCD compound, including basic workshop equipment and training aides.

3.4 Revised Components:
The project components were not revised during implementation.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1  The quality at entry is rated as satisfactory for the following reasons:
3.5.2 Consistency of objectives with CAS. The project was consistent with the Government's objectives
for the roads sector and with the Country Assistance Strategy.
3.5.3  Participatory approach. Throughout project preparation, systematic consultations were held with
the Government (Ministry of Finance and Development and Ministry of Public Works) and with the
Ministry of Agriculture. In case of the Ministry of Agriculture, discussions involved inclusion of about 50
pieces of equipment in the initial assessment and selection of priority equipment to be repaired under the
Credit While no specific participatory consultations were undertaken for this project with the community
groups in the project area, the project directly responded to the key findings of the IDA Participatory Rural
Assessment Study which was undertaken in 1994. The study identified isolation and lack of road links as
substantial constraints to poverty alleviation.
3.5.4 Project design. Overall, this was designed as a small but important project, which was to provide
the foundation for more substantial involvement at a later stage. The Government gives high priority to the
- 3 -



improvement and extension of the road network and developed short, medium and long-term plans. In view
of the size of resources available, the project aimed to prioritize investments, both in terms of timing and
scope of interventions.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project outcome is rated as satisfactory. In spite of the conflict with Ethiopia from May 1998 to June
2000, the project implementation continued satisfactorily, though with some delays and interruptions in the
services due to the border conflict, in consultant mobilization, preparation of feasibility and detailed
engineering design reports and staff replacements resulting from departure of some of the original
consultant staff. The extensions that were necessitated further enabled the achievement of the overall
project objectives. Key project outcomes:
*   Training has been provided to RTCD staff in contract administration, financial analysis, monitoring
and evaluation, stores management and accounting systems. This has resulted in developing contract
administration and procedures manual and establishing contract monitoring procedures. The manuals
and procedures are being used in preparation of bidding documents for road construction and
maintenance works and hiring of consultants.
* Established an organizational structure for MoPW-ID, including definition of functional responsibility,
staffing and a staff training program. The MoPW-ID is responsible for the formulation of policy,
standards, regulations and monitoring of infrastructure operations. The Ministry has a vision for
improving the road sector over the next 20 years and has outlined an ambitious program of road
investments. The project resulted in building capacity and setting up the framework for the Ministry to
extend the outcome of the project's vision into its future comprehensive strategy for the sector.
*   Provided training in mechanical, electrical and equipment operation to workshop mechanics and
electricians, equipment operators, university students and trainers. As a result, major rehabilitation has
been completed on 34 pieces of equipment, with the spare parts procured under the Credit. In addition,
rehabilitation of three more pieces is, on average, 60 percent completed. While the number rehabilitated
is less than the 40 originally proposed to be repaired at appraisal, considering that the repairs required
much more work after more thorough investigation as compared to visual inspections conducted during
appraisal, this is a considerable achievement on the part of the RTCD. Of particular significance is the
fact that rehabilitation continued and even gained momentum in-house after departure of the TA
consultants. The heavy equipment fully rehabilitated under the Credit is in use and performing well.
*   Constructed a training facility ahd almost 90 mechanical and 50 electrical classroom sessions were
organized since July 2000 by the three trainers trained under the project (see section 4.2 for details). A
total of seven university engineering students and 51 workshop mechanics have been trained in
electrical, mechanical and equipment operation.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Road Feasibility, EIA and Studies. Consultancy services are completed for the feasibility studies,
environmental impact assessment and engineering design for the Keren-Tessenei and Barentu-Mendefera
roads. The work on feasibility and design studies for the two roads was commenced on October, 1998 and
expected to be completed by January 2000 at a total cost of $1.85 million. However, as a result of five
addendums made to the main contract, the original contract amount was increased to $2.27 million and the
final detailed designs completed in October 2001. The addendums were made in response to the effects of
the border conflict with Ethiopia which resulted in: (i) de-mobilization of consultant staff on few occasions;
(ii) lack of access to some of the areas along the border; and (iii) carrying out ground surveys due to the
inability to conduct aerial surveys. In addition, detailed design of six bridges on the section
-4 -



Barentu-Tessenei were included, resulting in additional cost and time requirements. The Environmental
Impact Assessment Study (EIA) was submitted in December 1999.
National Bridge Inventory. Bridge inventory/visual condition surveys and strength testing have been
completed, with 165 bridges surveyed and repair/ reconstruction program prepared. The contract
commenced in November 1998 at an estimated total cost of $629,850. The final reports for the national
bridge inventory were submitted in March, 2000. Two addendums to the contract were made because of:
(i) break in project continuity due to border conflict with Ethiopia; and (ii) replacement of candidates for
the bridge engineer during the course of the assigmnent.
Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. The contract for technical assistance and capacity building
was signed in December, 1998 at a total cost of $1.84 million. Two contract amendments were issued to
adjust inputs required from the database expert and master mechanic, without any change in the original
contract amount. The TA resulted in providing training to: RTCD staff in contract administration,
financial analysis, monitoring and evaluation, stores management and accounting systems as well as to
MoPW-ID staff in contract administration and monitoring procedures. The final report of the financial
services expert was submitted to the MoPW-ID in January 2001. The accounting software (Peachtree
Version 7) was bought in September 1999 and installed at the accounting section. It includes transfer
accounts, depreciation charges, advance and retention payment accounts for the recording of transactions
related to contract work. The RTCD continues to use the Peachtree accounting program.
Training. Under training of the trainers program, four persons have been trained as trainers (3 mechanics
and 1 electrician), who in turn have provided training to a number of workshop workers and university
students in the repair of mechanical and electrical equipment. The training involves both classroom
sessions as well as on-the-job lessons and the trained staff have contributed to rehabilitation of workshop
equipment (see para 4.1). The ICR mission confirmed the following training programs:
(a) first program from April 1999 to December 1999, with four mechanical engineering students from
university and eight mechanics from the workshop provided training in mechanical repair of equipment;
(b) second program from January 2000 to May 2000, with three university engineering students and 17
trainees provided training electrical equipment repair;
(c) third program from November 2000 to May 2001, with eight mechanical engineering students from the
university;
(d) fourth program of electrical workshop from November 2000 to June 2001, provided training to 12
trainees, of whom nine were women; and
(e) fifth program in welding workshop from June 2001 to December 2001, trained six female trainees.
All trained staff continue to work in the workshop. In addition, the TA consultancy services resulted in: (i)
developing course material for 17 courses, nine in mechanical and eight in electrical; training course
consisted of 90 mechanical and 50 electrical classroom sessions; (ii) procuring training aids and workshop
equipment for the training workshop (manuals, computers, projector, camera, etc). The University of
Asmara is working closely with MoPW-ID to integrate the training program with students' practical
training requirement on a regular basis.
Spare Parts, Equipment and Vehicles. The procurement of spare parts has been completed mainly through
intemational shopping from equipment manufacturer's agents, including: (i) spare parts for nine caterpillar
units and different workshop and training tools in November 1999 at a total cost of $260,475; (ii) spare
parts for 11 caterpillar units in February, 2000 at a total cost of $232,471; (iii) spare parts for 11 Komatsu
units in December 2000 at a total cost of $538,571; (iv) spare parts for 13 units of Fiat Allis in July, 2000
- 5-



at a total cost of $424,385; and (v) spare parts for four Mitsubishi motor graders in April 2001 at a total
cost of $110,000. In addition, selected stores equipment were procured, including three computers, three
printers, one bar-coding scanner and two forklifts.
Civil Works--RTCD Mechanical Training School. The RTCD fully completed the construction/
rehabilitation of the workshop and a training facility. The training aids and equipment required for
classroom training were procured partly through IAPSO and partly from RUMPTSTAD, and all of them
have been installed in the center. Classroom training commenced in March 1999. Training handouts have
been prepared in both English and Tigrena. So far, 126 classroom daily sessions and 15 additional lessons
in English and Maths have been provided. Workshop facilities were constructed and tools and workshop
equipment procured (setting up of seven repair bays, one injection pump room, one engine rebuild room).
The class room space is adequate for up to 30 persons. An additional seven repair bays are currently being
constructed. At project completion, the RTCD facility was equipped as the best training center in the
country. It holds prospects for the organization and running of future training programs for mechanics and
electricians.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The project was an engineering credit for technical assistance and economic and financial analyses was not
considered to be meaningful.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not Applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a substantial institutional development impact.
*   A good deal of knowledge transfer occurred during the project, through the hands-on training provided
to RTCD workshop mechanics by the technical assistance consultants, in the areas of mechanical,
electrical and equipment operation (see para 4.2).
*   The capacity of MoPW-ID to carry out its mandate has been strengthened, particularly in the areas of
contract management, planning and monitoring. As a result, there are improvements in procurement
procedures, including competitive bidding, transparency and faimess by adoption of standard bidding
documents. The standard bid documents are currently being used in procurement of spare parts and
hiring of consultants. The contract monitoring procedures are being used in the on-going Emergency
Reconstruction Program (roads components) and would allow a planned shift from force account
construction to contract works. However there is still a concem that Government has not fully adopted
transparent and competitive procedures and systematic socioeconomic optimization of public
expenditures. This issue will be addressed as part of the proposed follow-on project.
*   An intensive two-week international study program was organized with the participation of three senior
officials from the Ministry of Public Works. The team held discussions with the Federal Highway
Administration in San Francisco and Denver; and Departnent of Transportation in California and
Virginia. The discussions focused on organizational and management arrangements, contract
administration procedures, monitoring and evaluation arrangements, financial issues, performance
based maintenance systems. Field visits were made to research laboratories and construction sites.
The study tour resulted in an enhanced understanding of the policy, financial and institutional issues in
the development of a road sector program as well as in the private sector participation in long-term
road maintenance contracts.
*   Financial management has been improved and computer based accounting system is now in use at the
RTCD.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
S.) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The border conflict with Ethiopia during May 1998 to June 2000 adversely impacted project
implementation, changed scope of a few project sub-components as originally planned and imposed
physical restrictions on access to parts of the area. Main impact of the border conflict were to: (i) disallow
use of aerial surveys which resulted in adoption of a revised methodology; (ii) delay implementation and
necessitate contract amendments; (iii) temporarily demobilize consultant's senior staff for some months due
to international security warnings; and (iv) increase the time required for preparation of feasibility reports
and preliminary design of approximately 80 km of the Barentu-Mendefera road due to proximity to the
border. One of the key spare parts company insisted on full payment upfront contrary to the provisions in
the contract leading to delay in the delivery of their propriety parts.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Delayed and partial implementation of the Human Resource Development Project (Cr. 30330) to recruit
international staff to strengthen MoPW-ID capacity in engineering design, procurement and evaluation has
imposed capacity constraints in the Department. Of the seven specialists originally planned to join the
Department, only three actually joined.
Delayed return of staff from the border following the cease-fire, further constrained the capacity of the
MoPW-ID and RTCD.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
During the first two years when the border conflict was at its peak, the TA consultant experienced staffing
problems, which impacted project implementation; in addition, staffing delays and frequent staff changes
contributed to detraction from the effectiveness of the technical assistance. The implementing agency
(MoPW-ID) closely monitored the TA consultants and pro-actively took mitigating steps as required within
the contract scope which resulted in reduced adverse consequences of unwarranted staff changes.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost as stated in the MOP was estimated at US$7.2 million. Of this IDA was to finance
US$6.32 million (SDR 4.4 million; 100 percent of the foreign costs of the project), while the Government
contribution was to be US$0.88 million equivalent (100 percent of the local costs). Appraisal and Actual
costs are summarized in Annex 2. An estimated amount of US$59,715 (SDR 44,662) remains
undisbursed, primarily because of delays in implementing the training program.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationaleforsustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project benefits is likely. As part of the strategy to improve the country's
infrastructure, the Government has established, under the Ministry of Public Works, a new Infrastructure
Department (ID), responsible for the formulation of sector policy and strategies, standards, regulations and
monitoring of infrastructure operations. The ID is compiling road standards, road design manuals, draft
bidding documents, and technical specifications for use in future road projects. The training program
financed under the Credit provided training to three trainers, who in turn have trained a number of
workshop staff and university students. The training program is on-going even after the close of this
project, through own resources. The spare parts procurement and management capacity of the ID is
strengthened with the installation of management software program. The training center established under
the project has now been recognized as an important part of the overall vocational training program of the
education sector. The University of Asmara is already working closely with the MoPW-ID to better
-7 -



integrate the training provided at the Center with the practical training of students on a regular basis. The
bridge study and the road feasibility study have provided inputs for the preparation of the Road Strategic
Plan as well as for the on-going road improvements.
Improvements in planning, procurement procedures, financial management systems and contract documents
will support Government's objective of: (a) developing and expanding the domestic construction sector to
progressively take over a higher proportion of the road construction and maintenance; and (ii) gradually
move towards a planned road maintenance regime. To assure sustainability, however, Government would
need to consistently apply systems introduced with all its programs, including those financed from its own
resources. In the past, most road improvements and expansions have been implemented by RTCD on an
emergency basis. The proposed approach is to rely primarily on the private sector for the actual execution
of road works while devoting greater emphasis and capacity within Government for planning, management,
contract administration and overall supervision of the road program implementation.
However, there is a need for: (i) additional training to local staff in developing equipment maintenance
management systems; and (ii) maintaining continuous training programs and design and apply additional
lessons and new knowledge so as to update staff on the newly received equipment.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Most of the project activities have been already integrated into the regular operation of the MOPW-ID,
which has minimized the need for special transition arrangements. The project was envisaged as the first
phase of a longer-term investment program, with an initial focus on strengthening local capacity in
management, engineering design and training methods, procurement and contract administration.
Additional financing would be required to realize the full potential of the processes, systems and skills
which the project has created. A follow-up investment program is under preparation to support the
Government's 15-year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP). A number of studies are on-going to
build on the reforms already under-way.
A PPF Agreement was signed on February 29, 2000, with the objective to prepare a Road Sector Strategic
Plan, a Road User Charge Study, Sector Environmental Guidelines and feasibility studies of components
for possible inclusion in the follow-up project. Italian Cooperation Grant Agreement was also signed on
March 23, 2001 for a Road Safety Study, to be carried out together with the PPF studies. The road sector
strategic plan would assist MoPW-ID in developing a comprehensive strategy for the Eritrean road sector.
The strategy will articulate an overall road network rehabilitation and development program, which will
include both road investment and road maintenance, organizational arrangements within the sector, the
participation of public and private sectors in implementation, the development of domestic road
construction sector and financing arrangements. The study findings will support preparation of a 15-Year
Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) and form the basis of a phased IDA support to the road sector.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification was satisfactory. The Bank clearly identified, prepared and
appraised the project which met the needs of the Borrower and was consistent with the Bank's lending
strategy. The credit was signed on April 24, 1997 and became effective on June 23, 1997.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory. Regular supervision missions took place and
-8 -



detailed discussions were held with the Government, implementing agencies and other stakeholders. The
Bank showed flexibility in amending the DCA during supervision to accommodate the changing context
and respond to the realities on ground. Specialist skills were brought to bear as and when necessary.
The Credit was extended by a total of 18 months (3 extensions of 6 months each) due to implementation
delays resulting from the conflict with Ethiopia; and to allow the MoPW-ID to complete the planned
training, consisting of institutional assessment study tours, for key senior personnel in the Ministry.
The extension also permitted additional equipment to be repaired for which most parts had already been
procured, and also helped in procurement of some additional minor spare part needs.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The overall Bank performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation was satisfactory. The Borrower fully participated in all
aspects of project design.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Borrower's performance during implementation was satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agency was satisfactory. In spite of the conflict with Ethiopia, the
Ministry's project management took actions to continue with project implementation. The EU financed TA
even remained in the country throughout the period of the conflict. The implementing agency has taken all
actions required to ensure effective implementation and for the project to achieve its objectives. The
management of MoPW-ID is both energetic and committed and has been able to achieve large volume of
work with little resources. The first commitment of RTCD was to complete the workshop repair and
training facility in time to start equipment servicing and training sessions as originally programmed.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower's performance was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
*   Flexibility is required in project design when operating in an uncertain enviromnent. The scope of
mechanical repair of the equipment had to be considerably altered during implementation to full
rehabilitation in view of the findings based on detailed inspection of the equipment.
*   Building local capacity through an extended support of technical specialists is critical to sustain the
reform program.
*   When fundamentally new management systems are being introduced, it is useful to build long-term
service contract as part of the original contract design. Inability to fully utilize the stores management
data base (Wintag) occurred as a result of a lack of supplier support after expiry of the initial contract.
Alternatively, where possible, it is more efficient to procure new systems from local providers rather
than the international market. In the present case, with the failure of the Wintag system, Government
procured the required software from a local computer technical service provider. The cost of the
locally procured system was almost one-third of the Wintag system. In addition, continuous
maintenance support is being provided and market for local providers has increased. The stores
manager is satisfied with the new system.
*   Policy reforms and capacity building interventions should be accompanied by investment operations to
-9-



ensure continued leverage in long-term application of the reform agenda. The parallel preparation of
the proposed 15-year Road Sector Development Program would allow a continuing dialogue on sector
management and firther strengthen the reform program initiated under this project Proposals
emerging from the roads and bridges feasibility and design studies will be discussed in the context of
preparing the Road Sector Development Program.
e In the procurement of proprietary spare parts, it was shown that no competitive benefits were
obtainable through International Shopping. Most of the propriety parts were, therefore, purchased
through the respective equipment manufacturer's local agent.

IIo Development Objectives
The primary objectives of the project were to: -
a)     Provide the economic and design analysis for the improvement of the road infrastructure;
b)     Establish contract administration capacity within the RTCD to facilitate private sector
involvement in road and bridge works; and
c)    Improve the efficiency of RTCD's force account maintenance and construction capacity.
IIL Project Components
The project consists of three components: -
a)      Feasibility study, Environmental assessment and detailed design of the
Keren - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera roads to Western Eritrea;
b)     National Bridge Inventory, condition survey and strength analysis of all
bridges and the preparation of a prioritized remedial program of bridge works;
-10-



c)    Technical assistance and capacity building for RTCD to create a contract
administration capacity, improve Procurement and stores management and
train mechanics, electricians, equipment operators and trainers.
IV.   Achievement of Objectives:
The active project life was during the period 1998-2000, which unfortunately is
characterized by the border conflict and war with Ethiopia. As a result, the project has
been highly influenced by the war situation in the country. This was manifested by
additional time, additional cost and changes in the scope of works.
The following are some of the consequences of the situation.
a)    Project components have been interrupted for a short period (2 -3 times) due to
international security wamnings.
b)    Remobilization and resuming activities have consumed extra time.
c)    Additional cost was incurred for air tickets, housing and office accommodation, etc.
d)    Some of the consultants staff refused to come back to Eritrea and have to be replaced
which also took some additional time.
e)    Aerial survey of the project area was not allowed and the consultant had to undertake
limited ground survey, which of course did not provide as much information as the aerial survey.
f)    A section of the Barentu - Mendefera road and some bridges were not accessible due to
proximity to border.
g)    Shortage of local staff was a constraint in all project components and this is mainly due to
the fact that many young engineers and technicians were drafted to the army.
In spite of all the above listed problems, the project implementation continued
satisfactorily. The project objectives have been achieved to a commendable degree.
a)    The feasibility study, environmental impact assessment and detailed engineering design of
Keren - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera roads have been completed and are ready for
implementation.
b)    The national bridge study which included inventory, condition survey and strength analysis
has been completed with 165 bridges investigated and prioritized rehabilitation program
prepared.



c)    The technical assistance component of the project package, which was focused towards
the capacity building of RTCD has covered several work activities of RTCD including equipment
inspection; equipment rehabilitation; training of mechanics, electricians and operators, Stock
management, Financial management, Equipment maintenance management, Procurement of spare
parts, Contract management for the procurement of goods and services, etc....
&Euivment Inspection and Rehabilitation
140 Pieces of equipment were inspected, among which 48 pieces were selected for repair
and rehabilitation.
Equipment inspection revealed more serious damages than originally expected and this
resulted in additional scope of works and costs. By June 30, 2002, 34 pieces of
equipment are repaired/ rehabilitated and 3 pieces are under repair.
e     Training of Mechanics, electricians and Operators
For this purpose, a modest training school has been established within RTCD. It is
satisfactorily equipped with training aids and facilities. This training school is a good basis
for a future training center. If managed properly and its sustainability secured, it will
provide training services not only to RTCD staff but also to staff of other organizations.
Until the end of 2001, four courses of training each of 6 months have been provided to 40
mechanics, 18 electricians and 6 welders. Among the total trainees 15 are females. Three
operator trainers have also been trained.
*     Stock Management
Actions were taken to improve the stock management of RTCD.        Under the
recommendation of the TA, additional space and proper shelving was provided.
In order to strengthen the spare parts and procurement management, a software program
from Wintag Consultants (UK) was installed. The program proved to be useful at the
beginning but late reports described that the present staff of RTCD are unable to fully
utilize the program. To ensure sustainability of the application, continuous training is
required. RTCD should also try to maintain the trained staff at position.
*     Financial Management
A short-term expert's input was provided to improve the financial management of RTCD.
As a result, the accounting system was improved. In order to computerize the financial
activities, an accounting software "Peachtree" was installed and is operational.
- 12-



*     Procurement of Spare Parts
Originally the project planned to procure spare parts for 40 pieces of equipment. But, due
to the findings during equipment inspection and considering the priorities of RTCD, spare
parts from original manufacturers were procured for:
(i)   20 caterpillar units including workshop tools;
(ii)  II Komatsu units;
(iii)  13 Fiat Allis units; and
(iv)  4 Mitsubishi motor graders.
Additional parts were purchased locally to cover minor missing items.
*     Contract Mana2ement
The consultant has prepared a standard contract document for the use by RTCD/ID based
on WB, EU, and ADB documents. The contract documents are prepared for small and big
projects, as well as for international and local procurements as required.
V.    Lessons Learned
1.    This is the first WB financed project implemented by the MOPW. Unfortunately, it is
characterized by the border war with Ethiopia, which defmitely had substantial influence.
Nevertheless, the project did not suffer from termination or serious force majeure claims. This is
mainly due to the cautious handling of the implementing agency and the flexibility displayed by the
WB.
2.    Several staff replacements have been requested by the consultants and were approved by
us. This of course had some changes in the individual expert's input to the project. However, it
was tried, as much as possible, not to affect the overall quality of the work.
3.    Reasonably justified changes in the scope of works, time extension and additional costs
were also accepted by the IA and approved by the WB. This could happen as a result of clear
understanding of the situation in the country, which was compelling to assume flexibility.
4.    Serious understaffing of the implementing agency was one of the main constraints of the
project. Had there been sufficient staff, the MOPW's benefit from the project in terms of capacity
building and transfer of skill would have been far better. This issue should be given serious
consideration during appraisal of projects and commitment of the implementing agency should be
ensured.
5.    For a country like Eritrea, where there is critical shortage of professionals, the assistance
of WB staff in commenting to consultant's reports (feasibility study, EIA, and detailed designs) is
very essential. However, sometimes the commenting is very much delayed such that it doesn't
fit into the time planning of the project. Some consultants complain about such cases.
- 13 -



6.     There are also some complaints from consultants about delayed direct payments. If this is
true, and if there are no reasons to delaying, it is always advisable to effect payments on time.
