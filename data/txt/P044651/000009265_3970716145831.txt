THE STATE OF ERITREA
ROAD SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT
SECTION A
Project Description
Background
1.    Eritrea became formally independent in 1993, after 3 decades of war, and became
a member of the Bank Group in July 1994. Eritrea inherited a shattered economy, an
infrastructure damaged by the war and inadequate maintenance, a neglected social sector,
large numbers of refugees, and limited institutional capacity. This project has been
formulated by the Government of the State of Eritrea (GOE) to address some of the key
issues by establishing the basis for improving essential national infrastructure links, and
building institutional capacity in the road sector.
2.    The road network in Eritrea is limited with approximately 1,400 km of main road
and 4,500 km of rural/feeder roads. 622 km of the network are paved and, in total, less
than 1000 km can be considered as providing all-weather access. The main road network
was mainly constructed during the mid-1930's to geometric designs based upon very
limited traffic. The Government places high priority on improving the coverage and
quality of the network and, with the assistance of the European Union, is in the process of
rehabilitating and widening the main road between Asmara and the port of Massawa.
The improvement of the Nefasit - Dekemhare - Tera Imni road is expected to commence
in 1997.
Project Rationale and Objectives
3.    The overall goal of the Country Assistance Strategy (report # 15324-ER, February
1996) is poverty reduction, to be achieved through seven detailed programs: (i)
establishment of an enabling environment for private sector led growth and employment;
(ii) physical infrastructure strengthening to support private sector development and
market linkages, and to facilitate access to public services; (iii) rural development and
food security; (iv) human resource development (basic health and education programs,
and resettlement of refugees); (v) institutional capacity building; (vi) protection of the
environment; and (vii) macro-economic support.
4.    The project has been formulated to address several of these CAS objectives either
directly or indirectly. The project will establish the basis for major improvements in the
road network which will open up important areas in Western Eritrea to development and
settlement, improve market linkages and facilitate the provision of, and access to basic
social services. The project directly responds to the findings of the 1994 IDA



- 2 -
Participatory Rural Assessment Study, which identified isolation and lack of road links as
substantial constraints to poverty alleviation. The project will also provide the
institutional capacity necessary to meet GOE' s commitment to encourage private sector
participation in the road sector program; a policy fully consistent with the Bank's
experience and advice. It will be several years, however, before the private sector can
assume responsibility for all roadwork and, until that time, some force account
construction and maintenance will be necessary to meet total demands in the sector. The
project will thus also assist RTCD to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of its
own operations.
Project Components
5.    The proposed project consists of three components:
(a)   Feasibility study, environmental assessment and detailed design of the
Karen - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera roads to Western Eritrea;
(b)   National Bridge Inventory, Condition Survey and Strength Analysis of all
bridges not covered by (a), and the preparation of a prioritized remedial
program of bridgeworks;
(c)   Technical assistance and capacity building for RTCD to create a contract
administration capability, improve procurement and stores management,
and train mechanics, electricians, equipment operators and trainers.
(a)   Feasibility and Design Study: Karen - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera Roads
6.    A major improvement in the road links to Western Eritrea is essential to reduce
transport costs and provide the access and market linkages necessary for the development
of rain-fed agriculture and refugee settlement in the Gash Setit region which has major
agricultural potential. According to GOE statistics, over 70 percent of applications (over
100,000 ha.) for commercial land concessions have been made for the Gash Setit region,
and agricultural yields (according to FAO estimates) are almost 40 percent higher than
the national average. The improvement of this road is the Government's highest road
priority; when completed, an improved East-West road route will exist between Massawa
and the Sudan Border, providing not only a primary road axis for Eritrea but also some
potential as a regional transit route. The project proposes to fund the feasibility and
detailed design for both the rehabilitation of the existing Keren-Barentu-Tessenei road
(265 km) and the proposed upgrading of the Barentu-Mendefera part engineered road and
track (195 km). The two roads will form a network connecting Western Eritrea to the
rest of Eritrea.



- 3 -
*  The Karen - Tessenei road is an existing narrow engineered road, primarily
gravel, which has deteriorated very severely; its Telford base is exposed over
much of its length.
*  Much of the proposed Barentu - Mendefera road is presently a track only
passable by four wheel-drive vehicles.
The feasibility study will assess the most economic program of road improvements,
including stage construction, to meet GOE's ultimate objective of a national road
network with 7m pavement and 1.5m shoulders. The environmental assessment will
assess the impact of road improvements on the affected areas and prepare a detailed
mitigation plan to minimize any direct or indirect effects. The feasibility study and
environmental assessment will be completed within four months.
7.    Following agreement on the findings of the feasibility study, the consultants will
prepare detailed designs, engineers' cost estimates, and the bidding documents necessary
for Intemational Competitive Bidding. Preparation of the detailed engineering design
and contract documents will take nine months. Prior to completion of the study, the
consultant will install all soils and materials testing equipment, procured under the study,
in a RTCD provided building, and will train RTCD personnel in its use. This facility will
then serve as the basis for RTCD's central laboratory.
8.    Vehicles and office equipment for the study will be provided by RTCD; the
Consultants will have to rent office accommodation. Training of RTCD personnel in the
use of materials' testing equipment will be undertaken through in-service training, by the
chief materials engineer.
(b)   National Bridge Inventory, Condition Survey, Strength Analysis and
Rehabilitation Program, and associated Capacity Building.
9.    Bridges are critical for transport access, and Eritrea's bridges have suffered
considerably during the last thirty years from both war and neglect. Several bridges were
destroyed and many more are thought to be in a critical condition. To safeguard road
access throughout Eritrea, it is essential that the structural integrity of the bridges is
guaranteed. The situation is aggravated by the lack of any records of the original
design/structural standards, poor construction techniques and inadequate materials. The
national bridge survey will cover all bridges, other than those included in the feasibility
and detailed design study, amounting to approximately 110 bridges. The study will:
establish a complete data base of the bridges including: inventory data, rated
condition of all bridge elements, and any associated road, drainage or river works;



-4 -
*  conduct physical non-destructive testing on all bridges showing signs of distress
and on a representative sample of other bridges (: 25 percent), sufficient to allow
detailed analysis of structural strength and load bearing capacity;
*  identify all bridges in need of repair, strengthening or replacement and prepare
detailed proposals for the necessary works;
*  develop and appraise a prioritized national bridge remedial program; and
*  train RTCD staff (two engineers and two technicians) in all aspects of the work
undertaken so that, by the end of the study, RTCD has the capability to undertake
similar work and analysis.
The national bridge inventory, condition survey, strength analysis and national bridge
works program is expected to take approximately twelve months and result in a
prioritized program of work which would allow, if necessary, GOE to seek external
assistance.
10.   Vehicles and basic office equipment will be provided to the Consultants by
RTCD. To help ensure constant interaction between the Consultants and RTCD staff,
office accommodation will be provided in the main RTCD complex in Asmara. The
training of the counterpart staff in bridge survey and structural strength analysis will be
undertaken through in-service training. Initially the counterparts will work together with
the consultants, but once the basic knowledge and skills have been transferred, the
counterparts will works as a survey team, under the overall supervision of the consultants.
(c)    Technical Assistance and Capacity Building
11.   Contract Administration: It is GOE policy that the construction and
maintenance of roads will be progressively contracted to the private sector, with RTCD
assuming a planning, management and supervision role. This policy can only be
implemented efficiently if RTCD has the capability to administer these construction and
maintenance contracts. This project component is designed to establish the basis for
contract administration within RTCD. The consultant will: (i) provide TA in contract
administration; (ii) develop standard contract documents and recommended contract
administration organization, systems and procedures; and (iii) train a minimum of two
RTCD engineers in contract administration, to create in-house capacity, and provide
seminars to other RTCD engineers and staff. The assignment will consist of an initial 18
month continuous period, followed by short-term interventions over the following twelve
months.
12.   Office accommodation and transport will be provided by RTCD, as well as office
equipment and computers for both the expert and the counterpart engineers. The creation
of in-house contract administration capacity will be developed through: (i) the provision



of standardized bidding and contract documents; (ii) the development of a contract
administration manual for RTCD; (iii) in-service training of RTCD counterparts; (iv)
supervised work experience; and (v) in-house seminars to counterparts and other RTCD
engineers. Counterparts will have early hands-on experience of contract administration
with the contracts to be financed by the European Union, in late 1997.
13.   Procurement and Spares Management: the present system of spares
procurement and management in RTCD results in inadequate identification of critical and
fast moving spares. As a consequence, repairs and overhauls are delayed, leading to the
grounding of equipment and poor equipment availability and reliability. To improve
systems within RTCD and ensure efficient procurement of spares, provide adequate
estimates for budgeting, and improve the monitoring and control of both spares and
equipment, RTCD requires the advice of a procurement/spare parts management expert.
The expert will undertake an initial twelve month assignment, to be followed by short-
term interventions over the following twelve months. A financial management expert is
also required for a short period (two months) to review overall financial management
systems within RTCD and ensure that systems recommended by the procurement adviser
will be compatible with improved financial management systems.
14.   The procurement specialist will work closely with the Chief Warehouse Manager;
office accommodation, office equipment and transport will be provided by RTCD.
Having developed new procurement and stores' management systems, the specialist will
train RTCD staff in their use through: (i) preparation of system manuals; (ii) in-service
training; and (iii) supervised work experience.
15.   Equipment Mechanic and Operator Training: the vocational institutes in
Eritrea produce basic mechanics without the specialist skills needed for the maintenance
of heavy equipment and plant. The project proposes to finance the training/upgrading of
RTCD mechanics, mainly through supervised on-the-job training. The basis of the
training will be the repair/rehabilitation of about 40 units of grounded heavy plant and
equipment over a 12 month period. Two master mechanics and an expert on electrical
systems will provide two 6 month courses to a total of about 32 mechanics. The project
will fund the trainers, training aides and specialized equipment as necessary, and spare
parts (approximately US$1.0 million). In addition, the project will provide for the
training of trainers (three mechanics, one electrician, and one equipment operator). The
overall duration of the mechanic training will be approximately 36 months, comprising an
initial period to survey the equipment and determine the requirement for spare parts
followed, after delivery of the spares, by the twelve month training period, and then
short-term interventions over the subsequent twelve months.
16.   RTCD will provide the necessary training facilities, office accommodation,
equipment and transport. Training of mechanics will be largely accomplished by
supervised work experience: groups of four mechanics will repair/rehabilitate items of
plant/equipment under the guidance and supervision of the external master
mechanics/electrician; each master mechanic will be responsible for two groups in each



- 6 -
training course This supervised work experience will be supplemented by basic
classroom instruction, and selected specialist courses by equipment manufacturers.
17.   The training of a plant equipment operator trainer will be undertaken in Eritrea;
training of the mechanic trainers will be through sending selected mechanics on
appropriate overseas courses. The trainers will then be supervised, on their return, by the
external master mechanics on their follow-up visits.
18.   Training facility: a modest RTCD mechanic training facility will be constructed
as part of the project. It will comprise two classrooms and a small training workshop,
located within the main RTCD complex in Asmara. The construction cost of the facility
will be funded by GOE.
Environmental Issues
19.   This is considered a Category "C" project, with no enviromnental risks. The
Project comprises basically of studies, technical assistance and training; the only civil
works are the construction of 2 classrooms and a small workshop in the RTCD Asmara
complex. The road studies are likely to propose major new construction, with the
potential for adverse environmental impacts. To ensure that environment is taken fully
into account in the planning and design of these road improvements, a full environmental
impact assessment (to IDA's Category "A" standards) will be undertaken, prior to
detailed design. The environmental assessment will be undertaken in collaboration with
the Eritrea Environmental Agency which has agreed the Terms of Reference for the
assessment.
20.   There are no social, gender or resettlement issues associated with the project.
Lessons from Previous Bank Group Involvement
21.   The only completed Bank assisted project in Eritrea is the multi-donor Recovery
and Rehabilitation Project for Eritrea (RRPE), which included a roads component
consisting of: (i) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the Asmara - Massawa road,
financed by the European Union; and (ii) the construction of RTCD maintenance depots
at Karen and Barentu by IDA. The project was highly satisfactory in realizing the
implementation and development objectives, reflecting 'genuine government
commitment' to successful project implementation. The main lessons learnt from the
project were: (a) over-complexity - a simpler emergency project, with clearly defined
objectives and implementation procedures, would have been preferable; (b) a lack of
implementation indicators; and (c) the limited implementation management capacity,
which required the establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU).



-7 -
22.   The design of the Road Sector Engineering Project (RSEP) has taken into account
the lessons of RRPE: very simple project; clearly defined objectives; clear delivery
mechanisms; and implementation indicators for each component. The components of
RSEP are basically free-standing and, given their modest size and complexity, do not
require a PMU. GOE will, however, appoint a suitably qualified project coordinator to
oversee overall implementation.
Critical Risks
23.   There is relatively little risk attached to the Roads and Bridge Studies. IDA
procurement procedures will help ensure that suitably qualified and competent
consultants are employed to undertake these basic technical studies. The risks are much
greater with respect to the technical assistance/skills' transfer components. The Project
includes a substantial component of technical assistance. This is necessary because
Eritrea has just emerged from a long period of civil war, and local capacity has to be
developed. TA projects in Africa have not been particularly successful, for a number of
reasons, the most important being:
(i)   insufficient Borrower ownership of, and commitment to the project;
(ii)  poor design of the technical assistance;
(iii) inadequate technical advisers; and
(iv)  unsuitable institutional/motivational environment.
There are risks attached to any TA project but they are assessed to be relatively modest in
this project, at least, in the short-term.
(i) Borrower Commitment and Ownership
24.   The management of RTCD is energetic and highly committed to the rehabilitation
of the country's roads and bridges, as shown by the very impressive volume of work that
has been achieved with very little foreign assistance. In addition to the widening and
rehabilitation of the Massawa - Asmara road, RTCD activities include:
Asmara - Keren: comprehensive program of pothole and edge repairs and the
re-alignment of about 9 km of road through mountainous terrain;
* Keren - Aderde (Barentu road): rehabilitation of the seriously deteriorated
paved road;
* Mendefera - Asmara: major widening and re-surfacing on mountainous
section;



-8 -
*  Mendefera - Barentu: improvement of existing tracks through the black cotton
soil areas, major earthworks to improve the track through the mountainous
area west of Maidama, construction of numerous culverts and two major
bridges; and
*  spot improvements to open the Massawa - Assab road to bus transport.
These works (not a comprehensive list) have been achieved with six professional
engineers and much of the supervision is undertaken by experienced sub-professionals
and foremen. This commitment is also apparent with respect to the maintenance of plant
and equipment. RTCD maintains its plant/equipment/heavy vehicle fleet of about 600
items with only 12 grade I and 20 grade II mechanics but reports average plant
availability at 60 - 70 percent.
25.   RTCD is committed and has demonstrated its capacity to perform substantial
work without TA, but it has also identified the need for additional skills to administer
contract construction and improve equipment maintenance. RTCD specifically requested
and defined the technical assistance components included in the project. It has developed
very tight terms of reference which give the highest priority to the goal of capacity
building. RTCD management will monitor the TA components very closely to ensure
that the objectives are fulfilled. RTCD recognizes that it has limited capacity to absorb
large numbers of consultants and has consequently planned to stagger the introduction of
consultants over a six-month period. The TA component will be introduced prior to the
bridge and road studies and the contract administration TA will be able to assist RTCD
with the administration of the subsequent contracts.
(ii)   Design of the technical assistance
26.   The TA component has been designed to incorporate best practices identified
from successful projects elsewhere. The Terms of Reference are clear and closely
focused, with considerable emphasis on the need for the transfer of skills. For each
component, there are clearly defined deliverable outputs. The evaluation framework for
consultant proposals places significant emphasis upon the proposed program for the
transfer of skills, and selected consultants will be expected in their Inception Reports to
outline monitorable benchmarks for skills' transfer. Toward the end of their initial
assignments, the experts will be expected to develop clear exit strategies to hand over
responsibilities to their counterparts, and the sustainability of the components will be
enhanced by periodic follow-up visits.
(iii)  Adequacy of technical advisers
27.   RTCD places very high priority on the transfer of skills to its staff. The quality
and experience of experts will form a very substantial part of the evaluation of TA
proposals, especially previous, and successful experience in skill transfer programs. Even



-9-
if qualified personnel are recruited, there is still the possibility that skills' transfer may not
take place. The causes can be various: the expert is not suited to the environment, the
counterpart is inadequately qualified or motivated, or the institutional framework is
inimical. To provide an early warning of potential problems, as well as to monitor the
progress of the skills' transfer, there will be regular confidential assessments, to RTCD
management, of the advisers by the counterparts, and vice versa.
(iv)   Institutional/motivational environment
28.   At present there is great commitment within RTCD, a legacy of the struggle for
independence. Salaries and wages may eventually, however, become the main
motivational factor. The most immediate problem, perhaps, is with respect to the trained
trainers. Trainers, compared to mechanics and plant operators, are often not eligible for
out-station and other operational allowances and, consequently, receive lower total
remuneration. RTCD recognizes the problem and has undertaken, as a covenant of the
Project, to recognize trainers specifically within its salary structure to ensure that
motivation is retained.
29.   There is, however, a much more general problem of salary scales in the medium
term. With the development of the private sector in Eritrea, GOE's policy of contracting
out roadwork, the likelihood of substantial investments in the road sector within Eritrea,
and a massive road development program planned in neighboring Ethiopia, the skills
provided under the project, engineering and equipment maintenance, will be in very high
demand in the region. Salaries and wages in the private sector are likely to rise very
substantially, and there is the very real possibility that trained personnel will be attracted
away from RTCD and possibly also away from Eritrea. The longer term sustainability of
the project is thus at risk.
30.   RTCD recognizes the problem, and the need to maintain salary scales at a level
which will attract and retain key staff. Given GOE's policy of shifting responsibility for
the implementation of road construction and maintenance to the private sector, the loss of
some personnel to the private sector is acceptable (it can be assumed that the private
sector will raise salary scales to compete effectively with Ethiopia). On the other hand, it
will be imperative that RTCD retains the capacity for contract administration as well as
other key personnel. The conversion of RTCD into an autonomous roads' authority,
outside the civil service, will offer RTCD the potential to react flexibly to the changing
economic environment.
Alternative Project Funding
31.   During project preparation, discussions were held with both the European Union
(EU) and UNDP. The EU has already developed a substantial program of assistance for
the road sector, including limited technical assistance. This project will complement the



- 10-
EU on-going and planned activities. UNDP were supportive of the project but the road
sector is outside its priority assistance program.
Actions Agreed
32.   The following conditions for Project Effectiveness have been agreed:
(i)    Confirmation by GOE that the local costs for the first year of the project
have been included in the Budget;
(ii)  Identification of the counterparts assigned to the contract administration
and bridge survey components and confirmation by GOE that these
counterparts will be able to work full-time with the technical advisers; and
(iii)  Provision of the engineering designs for the construction of the mechanic
training facility.
Other actions agreed:
(i)    The positions of mechanic and operator trainer will be suitably recognized
and rewarded within the RTCD salary scales; and
(ii)   A mid-term project review will be held after fifteen months of project
implementation.

SECTION B
Project Administration and Implementation
Project Administration
33.   The project will be implemented by the Road Transport Construction Department
(RTCD) of the Ministry of Construction (MOC). The administrative design of the project
is very simple, comprising: (i) three consultant contracts; (ii) procurement of vehicles,
computers and office equipment; and (iii) procurement of spare parts for the training
component. The day-to-day activities of the Consultants will be managed by the
respective RTCD Head of Department:
Project Component                     RTCD Responsibility
Feasibility study and detailed design:  Head of Engineering Office
Bridge inventory and condition survey:  "       "       "
Contract administration:              -"        "       "
Parts procurement/management:         Chief Warehouse Manager
Mechanic and operator training:       Head of Technical Services and Training
Division
34.   The Head of the Engineering Office will also act as the overall Project
Coordinator, responsible to the General Manager, RTCD. The Project Coordinator will:
*     facilitate GOE's responses to IDA's and the consultants' communications
and requests;
*     coordinate provision of GOE inputs, including: construction of the
mechanics' training school; provision of counterpart staff, trainees,
facilities, equipment and data, consultants' work permits, tax clearance
and customs clearance;
*     monitor, in conjunction with the respective Division Head, the contracts
and outputs to ensure successful implementation;
*     establish, monitor and control project accounting, disbursement and
auditing procedures; and
prepare regular progress reports to be submitted to IDA, and ensure that
audited project accounts are submitted according to the provisions of the
DCA.
35.   Consultants reports, their findings and recommendations for adoption will be
reviewed by a committee consisting of the General Manager RTCD (Chairman), the
Project Coordinator, and relevant RTCD Divisional Heads. Assistance for
administration of the contracts will be provided by the contract administration consultant,



- 12 -
and assistance for the procurement of the spare parts will be provided by the procurement
consultant.
Logistic and Administrative Support Provided by the Borrower
36.   The GOE contribution to the project will consist of the following: (i) a training
facility, 2 classrooms and a workshop, for the in-service mechanic training, as well as
workshop facilities and repair bays for the repair/rehabilitation of the grounded
equipment; (ii) a building for the installation of the soils and materials testing equipment
as the nucleus of a central RTCD laboratory; (iii) vehicles, computers and basic office
equipment to the consultants (procured under the project); (iv) office accommodation for
all consultants, except for the road feasibility and detailed design study; and (v) all local
costs associated with the implementation of the project.
RTCD Counterpart Staff
37.   RTCD will provide to the consultants the following counterparts for the respective
project components:
Project Component                        Counterpart Staff
Bridge Study                            2 qualified civil engineers
2 qualified technicians
Contract Administration                 > 2 qualified civil engineers
Spare parts procurement/management      2 1 senior procurement officer
Mechanic training                       32 mechanics, in 2 tranches
Training of trainers                    3 senior mechanics
1 senior electrician
I senior plant operator
Counterparts will be selected from within RTCD staff, although additional engineers
from elsewhere in the Ministry of Construction may also be attached to the contract
administration component. Candidates for the training as mechanic and electrician
trainers will be selected by RTCD on the recommendation of the mechanic trainers.
Procurement
38.   All consulting services, spare parts, vehicles and equipment will to be procured in
accordance with the IDA procurement guidelines, using IDA's Standard Bidding
Documents:
(i)    Consulting Services: these will be procured following IDA's Guidelines

(ii)    Spare parts: where spare parts for equipment to be repaired/rehabilitated
are commonly available from several sources, Limited International
Bidding (LIB) will be used to procure these parts competitively from
suppliers approved by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). LIB,
using OEM suppliers, will avoid the problem of counterfeit spare parts.
Certain spare parts may only be obtainable from the original equipment
manufacturer and will, therefore, be procured through Direct Contracting
(DC). A provisional sum of US$50,000 (5 percent of the total) will be
included in the consultant's contract for the rapid procurement of
unforeseen spares or materials needed in rehabilitating existing equipment
(spare parts will be procured from the OEM or approved agent);
(iii)   Vehicles, computers and related office equipment: subject to IDA
approval, these will be procured through the UNDP's Inter-Agency
Procurement Service, IAPSO;
(iv)   Civil works: these will be constructed by RTCD, using its own resources.
The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 1.

The proposed project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000, and the Credit
Closing Date will be December 31, 2000. An estimated schedule of disbursement of the
proceeds from the Credit is shown in Table 3. All disbursements will be fully
documented to the satisfaction of the Association. Payments for goods for amounts less
than US$100,000, and for all training, will be disbursed under Statements of Expenditure
(SOE). Documents verifying expenditures under the SOE procedure will be retained for
review by IDA supervision missions. To facilitate the availability of funds for the
Project, a Special Account would be established and maintained on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. An initial deposit of US$200,000 will be made against an authorized
allocation of US$400,000, which will become available when disbursements will have
reached SDR 2,000,000.

Project Supervision
40.   IDA will send a supervision mission to 'launch' the project, soon after project
effectiveness. A Project Launch Workshop will be organized during this mission for
RTCD senior and middle management involved in the implementation of the project.



- 15 -
The mission will ensure that RTCD is fully briefed on the necessary procurement and
disbursement procedures (Special Account operations and replenishments, withdrawal
applications etc.) and that the accounting systems for the necessary project accounting are
in place. Subsequently, supervision missions will be undertaken at approximately 6
month intervals, following receipt of progress reports from RTCD. These supervision
missions will review progress, assess the extent to which the project is meeting its
objectives; and help resolve issues with regard to either the project or IDA procedures.
41.   A mid-term review, approximately 15 months after project effectiveness, will
undertake a more intensive review of project implementation and the achievement of
project objectives. The mission will agree measures with RTCD and GOE to remedy any
unresolved problems, decide on the utilization of any uncommitted funds, and develop an
action plan for the remainder of the project. The mission may also be an opportune time
to discuss further IDA assistance to the road sector.
42.   During the six months prior to the closing date of the project, an Implementation
Completion mission will assess, with RTCD, the success of the project in meeting its
objectives, as the basis for preparing the Implementation Completion Report (a
requirement for all IDA projects) within six months following the closing date.
Accounts and Audits
43.   The Project Coordinator will be responsible for the maintenance of accounts for
the project (including counterpart funds) and for arranging their annual audit. Accounts
will be maintained using computer based accounting software; the software and systems
developed for the Eritrean Community Development Fund Project are thought to be
adaptable to the needs of this project. For the efficient management of project resources,
the accounting system will allow: (i) the production of annual financial statements in
accordance with International Accounting Standards in a forrm suitable for audit and
include integrated accounts; (ii) reflect the performance of each component of the project,
in comparison with annual budget and project appraisal estimates; and (iii) permit
efficient management of external funds by category of expenditure and in the currency of
the funding. Trial Balances and financial reports, summarizing this information, will be
produced by the 15th of each month following the month to which they relate.
44.   Annual Financial Statements will include a Balance Sheet and Statements of
Operating Expenses and movements of Funds. They will be audited, in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to the
Association. The audit report will be provided to IDA no later than six months following
the end of the Government's fiscal year. The auditor's report will include a statement on
the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal controls, and the
reliability of statements of expenditure as a basis for credit disbursement.



- 16 -
Project Reporting
45.   The primary project components consist of consultant studies or technical
assistance. Progress reporting on the details of the project will form part of the Terms of
Reference of the study consultants or technical assistance experts. In addition to the
specific technical reports (feasibility study, detailed design, bridge inventory, contract
manuals etc.) the consultants will prepare (a) inception reports within one month of
mobilization; (b) bi-monthly progress reports; and (c) final reports.
46.   RTCD will also prepare a six monthly report for submission to IDA. The report
will outline the progress in project implementation, the status of each of the components,
the financial commitment and disbursements made under the project, and any issues
which have to be resolved. The report will also summarize RTCD management's
assessment of the "knowledge and skills' transfer and any further actions required. The
report will forn the agenda for the subsequent IDA supervision mission.
47.   A mid-term review report will be prepared by the Borrower as the basis for the
mid-term review.

THE STATE OF ERITREA
ROAD SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT
TRAINING PLAN
Introduction
1.    The need for increased institutional capacity has been recognized as a priority in
Eritrea. The staff of the Road Transport Construction Department (RTCD) are highly
motivated but lack expertise in certain important areas: (i) the administration and
supervision of works undertaken, under contract, by the private sector; (ii) modem spare
parts' management and procurement systems; (iii) the specialist mechanical skills
necessary for the maintenance and repair of heavy plant and equipment; (iv) soils and
material testing; and (v) bridge condition and structural strength analysis. This project
will address these skill areas and provide capacity building and training in order to
remedy the identified deficiencies.
Recruitment of Trainees
2.   In almost all components, the staff for training will be drawn from the regular
staff of RTCD. The exception will be in the component for training in contract
administration under which: (i) additional personnel from other branches of the Ministry
of Construction may be attached as counterparts; and (ii) seminars by the contract
administration expert may be given to a wider audience of GOE officials involved in
contract administration.
Training Mode
3.    Training in most project components will be undertaken through in-service and
supervised work experience training. The technical advisers will be provided with small
groups of full-time counterparts with whom the expert will work and transfer the requisite
skills and techniques. The basic exceptions to the small counterpart group approach are
with respect to the training of mechanics and the training of mechanic trainers. A formal
training approach is adopted for the mechanics, although most of the training will be
provided by closely supervised work experience. The training mode(s) in each of the
project components is detailed below:

Trainer             Basic pedagogic skills
For the training of mechanic trainers, candidates will be selected from the existing Grade
I mechanics and sent to appropriate courses overseas. These will be the only overseas
training courses provided under the Project.
Training Design and Monitoring
4.    The broad design of the training program will form part of the technical proposals
from the consultants and will be evaluated as part of the selection process. The detailed
training program will form part of the Consultant's Inception Report and will be
discussed and agreed with the RTCD. With regard to the training of trainers through
overseas courses, the Consultant will identify the potential courses and make
recommendations to RTCD management for decision.
5.    The training programs will be monitored by the Heads of the relevant Divisions in
RTCD and by the overall project coordinating committee. To assist with the monitoring
both the technical experts and the counterparts will complete regular assessments of the
training program, detailing the achievements and problems with the program as well as
the performance of the expert/trainer and the counterparts/trainees.

Expected Results of Training
6.    The training under the project will provide RTCD with in-house capacity for soils
and materials testing, bridge structural testing and analysis, and contract administration.
In addition, the spares' management and procurement systems will be improved and staff
trained in their use, and RTCD's mechanical maintenance capacity and capability will be

throughout the training period.
