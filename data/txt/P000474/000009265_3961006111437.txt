MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNAT1ON OF TIE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATON
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE CENTRAL APRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT AND RANGELAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.       1 submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Central African Republic (CAR) for SDR 11.5 million (US$ 16.6 million
equivalent) on sand IDA terms with a matft of 40 years to help finmae a livestock development
and rangelnd management project. Tie project was prepared in close collaboration with the International
Fund for Agricltural Development (WFAD), the French Ministy of Cooperatmin (MAC) and the
European Development Fund (EDF), who will provide the equivalent of US$4.9 million, US$3.8 mfllion
and US$5.1 million, respectvely, towards its fincing. Project beneficiaries and their teprofei onal
Livestock Developme  FPund (FIDE) would also conute to project financing.
2.        5mr bwdd. The CAR is a landlocked country of 623,000 k, with a population
esimated at about 3.1 million, growing at 2.5 percent per amnnm   The CAR*s per cita GNP was $389
in 1993. Ihe primary sector, including agriculture, forestry and fisheries, is the mainsay of the
economy, accounting for about 40 percent of GDP and estmated to provide employment for about 80
percent of the active population. Ming, anui      and utilities account for 16 percent, while
services represent 44 percent of GDP. Diamonds account for 60 percent of exports. Labor productivity
is generally low as a result of a weak human capital base, particularly in agriculture, where it has not
improved over the last thirty yeas. Life expctac at birdi, 47 years, is below the average for Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA); the adult literacy rate (38 percent) primary and secondary school enrolment ratios
(60 percent and 11 percent, respectively) and health indicators are all below average for SSA.
3.       The CAR's economy declined severely in the late 1970s and eady 1980s as a rest of
inappropt economic  ficies. Agricul    producton and most other activities suffered from falling
domestic and world prices, excessive state intervention in virtually all economic activities, an oversized
civil service, inefficient rural dev,*lopment agencies, and rapidly deteratig services and infastructure.
Efforts to promote economic recovery and restore macro-economic balances bega in 1982. They were
supported by three IBE Stand-by arangements and a three year ESAP arangement agreed in 1987. The
Bank has supported the ecori'c refom program with three structur adjustment credits and a otton
sectr adjustet credit, totaling $130 million. Other domrs have also prvided substan  finacia
assistance. These programs did not lead, however, to a recovery of economic growth. GDP grew at an
average rate of 1.1 percent per year from 1986 to 1990 and dropped by an average 1.5 percent per year
between 1990 and 1993, and per capia income declied. Tbis poor economic perormance was due to
the weak implementaIon of the reform process, bureucratic hiertia, dterioratng terms of trade, loss
of compei tiveness due to the overauation of the CPA Franc and sodal and political tensions.
4.        The new Governmet fonmed aer elections in September 1993 (which ended several years
of political unrest) has affirmed its commiment to economic and social reform. As a first step, and in
concert with other member counties of the CPA franc zone, the CAR devaued the CFA fanc by 50
percent effective Januay 12,1994. To ensure that the devuation succeeded, the authorities adopted an
adjustmnt program for 1994 with fiscd, monetary and structur  policies geared to presving the
economy's improved competiveness and creating the conditions for suinable growth. The IMP
supported this program with a one-year Stand-by argement In March 1994. By end-April, conditions
were met for the release of the second tranhe of the latest of the stctural adjustment credits. The



2
economy has improved in 1994 owing to higher world ewket prices for diamonds, lumber and wood
products eported by the CAR, increased public investment and an incipient supply response to the
devaluation Real GDP is expected to increase by 5.5 percent this year. Domestic prices, which had
increased by 45 percent in the wake of the dewuation, appear to have stabilized. Short- to mediumterm
economic prowects are favorable, provided there is furthe Government action to implement economic
reforms and exercise fiscal restaint, tem of trade remain favorable for the main exports of the country,
and investmenu are made possible through appropriate Official Development Assistance.
5.        fm=  Assistance Sg          of the Bank. The Ban's strategy of assistance to the CAR was
lat dissed by thte Board in May 1992, during the presenation of the Agricutural Services Project-Cr.
No. 2368-CA. The objectves of the strategy were defined as: (a) restring cmpetiess by means
of a strategy based on growth; (b) introducing measures to induce nd sustain growth led by private
nstmn; (c) adopting a long-term stategy for capadty building for public sector managemet; (d)
developing human re'our  with a view to strengtening the human capital base and reducing poverty;
and (e) proetg the .avlorent. In view of the govermment's weak imple  n capacity, the poor
macroeconomic enviroment and limited budgetary resources, the staegy was underpinned by a core
prgram for FY93-95 to support projects in: O human resources development, with special emphasis on
health and the role of women in development; (i) livestock development and wildlife management; and
(iii) ura infrasucture. A higher case program could be triggered by the adoption of a medium-term
framework that would restore compeiiveness  d lead to susained growth in per capita
icome while keeping the fiscal and current account deficits at a sustinable level. A Bank/IMP mission
is acundy in the field evaluating the economic fmework and discussng a reform program takng into
account the mc  and policy environment following the devaluation of the CFA franc in
Januay 1994. A new CAS wil reflect the fidings of this mission and be presented to the Board during
the third guarter of FY95 along with the prposed Bangui Municipal Development Project.
6.        Sector a      d. Agriuture is based on small farm units of about 2 ha, growing a wide
variety of crops, compld by the products of hunting, fishing and gathering, activities on which
frmers spend a lot of tme. Tehology remain essenly underdeveloped, and yields are very low.
The country's ladockdw position and high transport costs reduce its competitiveness for crop exports.
Food production is preotiminanty for subsistn, only 30 percent being exhaged or marketed; barter
is com=m, especially between fanners and herders. Livestock production is generaly not ingrated into
crop fami  systems, and is mostly in the hands of migrtory heders. Livestock contibutes one third
of agrclura value added, iLe., as much as food crop production, and accounts for a large share of the
monetized segment of the natona economy and of foreign exchange receipts. The cattle herd is
es_mated at 2.4 milIon head. Thanks to the control of tryposomias, the CAR possesses abundant
grazi   d, estimated at about half the area of the country, in a regionthat is sparsely populated. This
makes the livest  sector a major focus of growth of the CAR's landlockd economy, and the recent
CPA franc d uaon has already resulted in greater regional trade. Grazing prssue remains low in
large parts of the cony dwugh some areas near the border with Cameroon, where a major market for
animals   found, have already been overgrazed.
7.        Catte herding is carried on mainly by some 25,000 families (270,000 people), of wb:hi about
80 percent are b tsm    Bororo Peubls attracted to the region by its resources and the availability of
veterinay sevices. Herders are found everywhere in the county, except in the eastem  hird, which is
resved as a Wiife Maagement Area (ZIC). Nearly half of the herders suffer serious capial
depledon as a resut of legimate as well as arbirary levies (the latter in the form of compusory
paymns in kind of relious taxes, oft  mi   by the Waitonal leadhip) and the fall in
meat prices (retng from deteriorating economic condiions in the region) at a time when their cost of
livhg incsed. Thus herders   eingy enpge in sbsistence farmig, whle    us  sedentary



3
farmers are also taking up various forms of stock-raising for trade or draft cultivation. This evolution
entails dhanges in life style and closer co- existce between the two populaton groups. As the process
of settling spreads among herders, guaranteed access to land will become important, both to avoid
disputes between tbe two groups and to avoid a deterioration of natural resources. The poorest herders
need help in diversifying into food crop producdon, while the women, responsible for milk and meat
production, need improved equipment and technology.
8.        The major constrain  to the development of the sector concern amial health and nutrion.
Rinderpest and bovine            have practically been eliminated. Vaccinaion, paid in half by the
users and half by the State, is compulsory, but the number of aimals actually vaccinatd has been
decreasing because of the improper levies perceived during these campaigns. Border controls are also
needed on herds coming from Chad and Sudan  Fiancing of measures tQ imrr-  iuimal health is
curently being appraised by the EDF. The diseases cont     to cause heavy e xonowic ' sses are blood
and digestive parasites, for which means of treatment are available. ;are is &1to a Pi; of itoduction
of East Coast Fever, which is so far unknown in Central and Western Africa but could penetate there
in the absence of border control or if the ZIC were no longer to provide an effective buffer zone.
Despite high quality rainy season forage, the anmas suffer from seasonal protein deficit. Rational
rangeland management is therefore necessary. The corresponding tehniques are now well known, but
there is a need for land tenure secrity and in-depth consultaion and collaboration among the various
users of the range areas (herders, farmers and hunters) to plan for opdmal land use, and, in parficular,
to estblish appropriate bush buring calendars.
9.        CAR herders are organized into a federation (FNEC) around Herding (GIP) and Mixed
Farming Interest Groups (GIAP). Administrative and technical support is provided by the Miistry of
Agriculture and Livestock (MAE) tirough its National LAvestock Development Agency (ANDE). Ihe
FNEC, a non-profit organzation established 20 years ago, ensures the supply of veteriary and animal
husbandry inputs as wel as the management of 58 livestock markets. The number of its members varies
year after year around 6,000, including representatives of share herders and small livestock and poultry
raises. Ihe Govenment has recently reduced its role in the Executive Board of the PNEC, whose
stutes have been revised to ensure proper grassroots representation through the GIPs and GIAPs. Other
professional organitions of the sector include the National Associaton ot Butchers (ANBC) and the
Association of Livestock Traders (ACCB). Both are practically unkown outside the capital, Baui, and
both remain under strong MAE supervision. A Livestock Development Fund (FDE), set up under ANDE
in 1989 to ensure the sustainability of essential husbandry and veterinary activties, was financed
exclusively out of the market and sanitary fees paid by the herders and animal traders rather than through
fiscal or para-fiscal levies, and collected by the herders' organization itself.
10.       The concept of Agro-Pastoral Action Areas (ZAGROP), areas of about 40,000 ha each where
herders share access to resources with farmers and where rangeland management practices would be
improved based on investments and detailed action plans agreed to between all local users, was developed
in 1986 under the first IDA-financed Western Livestock project in order to reduce the causes of rangeland
deterioration, initate a process of settling of herders and recognize the rights of herders and farmers to
the land and other natural resources of the areas. Two ZAGROPs have been officially established so far,
and a third is operating unofficially. They have resulted in increased productivity, better relations
between herders and farmers, and protected access and disciplined management of land under rules and
budgets established by the administration.
11.       The great majority of the sparse rural population has io access to bank credit. Outsie  the
cotton sector, which receives targeted credit from cotton processing and marketing agencies, the other
(NGO- or project-financed) credit systems are more or less formal, very small and thus very expensive



4
to manage. Ihl banking sector bas practically no activities outsIe the capital, Ban$u}. The lnternatonal
Mutu  Credit Center (CICM), fanced by Frnch Aid, has begun  Ipmenting a pilot project to
establish twelve muual savings banks over a perod of three years. The first, opened in Janay 1994,
has met with a higher m   qxrpected response. Five others are scheduled to open very soon. Savings are
rare and discreet among herders, and their credit requiremeits vary with the cycle of their life. They
are most often for day4o-day socal needs or consumpton dring the         periods, with few
individual or collective investment requiremt.
12.       Pm      i j    The projects thre man objectives will be (a) to raise livestock
productivity, by expanding animal health services; (b) to alleviate poverq among herders, by rebulding
herds of viable size and broadening the herders' activities to include crop faming; and (c) to ensure the
sustainable management of natoral resources. The project would focus its support on all herders and
agro-pastoralists who obtan the bulk of their income from herding (the IDA-financed Agricultural
Services project and the IFAD-financed and Food Savanna Developmen project are already anding to
the needs of f3mers engaged mainly in crop production), i.e., some 25,000 households, who all have
incomes below the averageper capita fDP. Herd productivity would be improved through better control
of animsl diseases, rational pasture management practices and the introduction of feed supplements for
milkig cows. Poverty alleviation would be achieved through herd rebuilding assistance through
natching grants to some 1,8  families identified as owning fewer cattle than they would need to live
off their herd, the provision of agricultural extension services to herders compelled to grow food crops,
the creaion of a mutu  savings and loan system, which would benefit most the poorest herders, the
mofication of PNEC statutes to ensure greater grassroots involvement, greater land tenure security,
most needed by the poorest herders, as well as assistance targeted more specifically to women. The
esablishment of ZAGROPs wil eventually have a major impact on the conservaton of savanmas and an
mnrease of coniuous rangeland occupation density. Measures to keep the ZIC free from transhumat
herders, assistance to local sedentary villagers in replacing poaching by small livestock production, and
a study for a future project to protect the ZIC comprise the project's other components in favor of naural
resources preservation.
13.      PrThect desdon.Ihe project has been designed around two main lines of action: (a)
implementation of up-front administrative and policy reforms; and (b) financial support for a packzge of
development support actvites. The adninistrative and policy reforms are set forth in a Livestock Sector
Policy Letter, which has been agreed upon between the Borrower and the donors, and was signed by the
Minister of Agriculture and Livestock on July 26, 1994. The Borrower has (a) replaced the FDE,
depleted because of improper allocations and weak supervision, by an Inteprofessional Liveswck
Development Fund (MIDE) and supervised by an Interprofessional Coordination Commitee (CIC)
bringing together the FNEC, ANDE, the MAE and, eventually other organizations of the sector (M7DE
would be financed by the market and sanitary fees and would act as the nexus of the financing of the
project and be responsible for the annual planing of fund allocations to its member organizations); and
(b) conducted an information campaip among herders periodically using the ZIC, to direct them in the
future exclusively to rangelands outside the ZIC. The formal creation of ZAGROPs requires that their
current legislation be amended to better define the respective rights of all users of these areas. The MAE
has meanwhile recognized the rights of the herders and farmers living within the future ZAGROP areas
to enter into contracual agreements under Herder and Farmer Associations for the purpose of initiating
all investment and planning activities leading to the establishment of a ZAGROP. The stues of the latter
have been drawn up. The FNEC has held elections based on revised statues which give better
represenaion to its grassroots membership and free the organization from excessive political pressure.
MAE has prepared the t',rns of reference and bidding documents to recruit a qualified provider of
services to assist in setting up the mutual savings and loan system.



5
14.       On the basis of these reforms, six major components are to be financed. ITey include:
(a)  rationalizing rangeland management by setting up and administering 21 ZAGROPs,
providing them with access and penetration roads and village and water infrastructwe,
preparing agro-pastoral development programs within a recognized land-tenure
framework and implementing methods of combating invasive plants (weed science) (31
percent of project costs);
(b)  strengthening the animal health services and setting up veteinary checkpoints at the
country's borders (12 percent of project costs);
(c) implementing a grassroots capacity development program among herders and their
wives to help them organize themselves into GIPN or GIAPs and to participate more
effectively in setting FNEC policy (13 percent of projec costs);
(d)  seting up and running a mutual savings and loan scheme and a line of financial
assistance for herd rebuilding (14 percent of project costs);
(e)  technical support to livestock activities, by (i) setting up an animal husbandry
extension service, and animal production and health action studies; (ii) providing
agricultura extension to herders settling into crop farming; and (iii) providing
assistance for the propagation of trypanotolerant catde and for small ruminant
husbandry activities in villages within the ZIC (10 percent of project costs); and
(f)  ensuring the proper administration of the above activities, by providing (x) tining of
supervisory staff of the livestock-sector professional agencies and organizations, and
(ii) direct project administraton costs (needed means of wansportation and related
Incremental operating costs); (20 percent of project costs).
15.      Project Bonancin. IThe project would be financed by IDA (US$16.6 million, 51 per cent of
project costs), IFAD (US$4.9 million, 15 percent), French Aid (US$3.7 million, 12 percent), EDF
(JS$S.1 million, 16 percent) and the beneficiaries, either direcdy or through the FIDE (US$2.0 million,
6 percent).
16.      Proect impleo. Pursua  to the policy undertaken by the Government of the CAR
of deregulating the economy, reducing governmet charges on te budget and d    instum ,
execution of the various components of the project would be entrusted to both private and public
agencies, under the aegis of the MAE. Project funds proviWed by the donors would supplement those
deriving frm the beneficiaries' own contrbuions, either direcdy Qabor for the construction of ZAGROP
infastructure and cash or animals for the herd rebuildig component) or through F1DE (market and
santay fees to be used to finance part of most project components), in order to ensure the sustnabiity
of the acivites undertken. Ihe FIDE has been set up as an institution with juriical personality. The
method of collecting the market and saty   fees,  trusted by FNEC to private collectors and supervised
by ANDE, will be simplified tD reduce collecdon cost. The Fiancia Coordintion Unit of the MAE
(UCF) would montor on behalf of the Borrower the financial opatn of FIDE and admitr
disburemet requests and special accos in accordance with donor procedures. ANDE would remain
responsible for the inspecdon of animal products, quarantine and animal husbandry  oesion services.
Grasoots development activities have been trasferred from ANDE to FNEC. Extension services would
continue to be provided by ANDE, with help from the crop extension services of MAE, until the end of
the project, at which time they would also be tramsferred to FNEC. The beneficiaries are substnay
involved in the design and implentation of the project. Grassroots capacity development, provided at



6
the herder camps in their language, would aim at enabling them to usefully participate in the management
of their professional, credit and marketing organizations.
17.      The mutual savings and loan system would be managed during the first years by a private
provider of services which has already developed some credit management experience in the rural sector
of the CAR. Each savings and loan unit (Catsse mu.uele) would be funded by the savings deposited by
its members. Interest rates would be of the order of 4 percen for deposits and 24 percent for loans, as
in other countries of the region. The fimding, under matching grants, of rebuilding the herds of the
poorest herders would be maged by FIDE in cooperation with FNEC and ANDE, independendy from
the savings and loan system. FIDE would allocate the funds, FNEC, which is most accountable to the
beneficiaries, would identify eligible beneficiaries, and ANDE would monitor the utilization of the funds
for their appropriate purpose, as defined by a prior study.
18.      L,ocal ,onsultants or, if not available, ANDE staff would be responsible for helping the
ZAGROP committs draft and implement anmual and multi-anmual operating programs based on maps
from satellite imagery. The ZAGROPs would undertake to avoid degrading the natural environment and
maintain the infrastructure made available to them.
19.      The CAR Government has already concluded technical cooperation agreements with the EDF
and the French Aid, which provide for (a) high level assistance to senior CAR officials in support for the
instllaton of new structures and procedures introduced under the project; (b) volunteer assistance to stat
up field implementation of various project financed activities while locld officials are being trained; and
(c) young volunteers of the French Cooperation Service, who would work in direct contact with the
herders and their wives. In addition, IDA, jointly with IFAD, would finance short-term epert consultant
missions, recruied locally so far as possible, totaling about six man-years, for technical and lega suldies,
training courses, ZAGROP planning, work supervision and project evaluation. Ihe Borrower would
prepare annual staff traing programs and has presented to IDA the first of these programs.
20.       Proectsustainabift. Prspects for project sustainability have been enhanced by (a) involving
the gassroots beneficiaries during project preparation in the planning and implementation of the
compoen  from which they benefit directly; (b) reqiring up-front financing through FIDE of sector
development actes by the beneficiaries and their organizations, donor contributions being viewed as
complementing those funds; (c) decentralizing sector development activities and seeking greater
involvement of professional organizations and the beneficiaries; (d) demo ing professional
organtons and reducing Govemnment supervision; (e) establishing structures allowing the collaboration
of various professional and edhic groups in acdvities to their mutua bnefit; and (t) giVing attention to
the preservation of the natural resource base.
21.       Lessons from     u IDA imsghlment. Experence from previous IDA (and other donor)
projec  (paicularly as reported in OED's No. 12791 Performance Audit Report for Credit 894-CA and
the Project Completion Report for Credit 1681-CA) has shown the need for more detailed preliminary
sociological studies and the posibity to (a) strengthen and iprove gsroots participation in
professina organiations; (b) separate regalian functions and the provision of credit from commercial
services, and grassroots development eforts from extension servces; and (c) provide specia attenion
to the poore herds  of the county. It has also demonstrated the need to closely supervise the allocation
and use of donor, as well as beneficiary, fimds. All these points have been taken into account in the
design of the project
22.       Rationle fr IJDA             Ihe CAR is one of the few countries in Africa which stll
possess exceptional livestockl development potentia, deriving from (a) favorable agrostologic conditions



7
(b) a largely homogeneous, energetic and discipline  herder popuation; (c) three professional
organizatioDs, one of which, the FNEC, has already proved its worth; and (d) the success in alleviating
some of the animal health constraints. The recent adjustment in the parity of the CFA franc should also
benefit livestock production for export. Although there is ample potial to increase livestock production
in the CAR, the optimal utilization of natural resources is essential to long-term m ece of CAR's
forage and fauma capital. Within the project's target group, there is need for special emphasis to be gen
to women and the poorest households. Finally, the project was spciay included in the core program
described in the May 1992 CAS and Is in agreement with the objectives of IDA's country assitance
strategy defined in k (pam  5): the project would (i) restre the competiiveness of the herders through
improved animal health and more efficient resource use; (Hi) favor private Investment through the FIDE
and herder organiions; (idi) build up the capacity of the livestock agency of the MAE; (iv) develop
the human resources of the national herder organization and its gatssroots units; and (v) help improve
the use of rangeland resoures and protect the buffer zone of the ZIC.
23.       Agred actions. During the negotiations the Borrower and IDA have aged on (a)
arrangements for the financing and monitoring of the FIDE; (b) estabishing the mutual savings and loan
system by December 31, 1995; (c) drafidng model statutes for the ZAGROPs within two years of Credit
effecdveness and submitting amendments to their legislation to Parliament; (d) caing out by December
31, 1996 a legal and sociological study aimed at stremlining the procedures for the establishment of
ZAGROPs and providing land tenure security to the herders and farmers established in those zones and
implementing its rec nons promptly thereafter; (e) FNEC not modifyig its statutes without prior
consultation with IDA; (t) carrying out by June 30, 1996 a study of tradtonal subsistence and
commercial huning patterns in the wfldlife management area and prompdty thereafter implementng its
recommendations; (g) submission for review by IDA, by October 31 of each year, of the annual training
programs and ZAGROP development plans; and submitting to IDA by April 30 of each year a report on
the results of the implementation of these plans; (h) the MAE making th  food crop speists available
to ANDE's etsion services; and (i) signing a Subsidiary Financing Agreement between the Borrower
and FIDE. Conditions for credit effectiveness would be (a) the effectiveness of the IFAD loa
agreement, and (b) the start up of FIDE's operations with appropriate maagemnt and fiacing. The
implementation of the herd rebuilding study would be a condition of Jisbursement against that component.
24.      Enviomental aects. Because of its potetial, largely positive, to affect the enviroment
of the CAR, the project has been given a Category A classification. A complete study of the impact of
the project on the enviomnent has been conducted by the Borrower and presented to IDA's Board Ihe
study confirmed that the project would have an appreciable favorable impact on protection of the
country's natural resources, by (a) training the professional groups in the most appropriate development
approaches; (b) introducing more rational forage and water management; and (c) preseving te buffer
zone of the ZIC, which, whfle avoiding the transfer of the East Coast Fever t westem Africa, would
also enable the Govermnent to instiute sound wildlife management. The project would address the
negative Impact riss through (1) spex   assistance to the poorest herders to avoid ovegrazing and
develop enomentally suitable food cropping techniques; (i) taining of the staff of the organatons
and insttutions in eironmental management; (iii) the proper alignment of ZAGROP access roads; and
(iv) appropriate management of the brushfire calendar and measures to reduce the adverse consequences
of uncontrolled fires. The environ t stdy also stressed the need to instite hman health preventive
measues. These woud need to be addressed under future, possibly IDA-financed, operations.
25.       fti oc&tiv        a . All of the members of the target group of the project have a per
cqapa income below fte average of the country, ad 40 percent of them have an income below half that
average. Manprject componets provide services  d inftuc    pacly tgd to the poorest
herders, such a8 (a) assistance to rebuild depleted herds; (b) mutualistic credit to meet short tem needs



8
(which is more useful for the poorer herders); (c) crop extension services for heers forced to diversify
into agriculture; (d) the reform of the FNEC which would give a greae say to its grassroots members;
and (e) increased land tenure security, the lack of which hurts the poorer herders most. For these
reasons, te proposed project belongs to the Program of Targeted Interventons.
26.       &Wra benefits. 'Me economic and financial beneft of the project would comprise (a)
increases in both assets and income of the herders and the women of the herder communities ths  to
improved animal health and extension services; (b) the possibility, especially for the poorer herders, to
cope with ficial contingencies without, ar in the past, having to reduce the size of the herds when
emergencies occur, thans to the mutual sn.ngs and loan system; aid (c) for the poorest households,
either an enlargement of their herds through trgeted grants, or etension assismce to diversify into crop
production. Development of the ZAGROPs would allow keeping some 800,000 ha of land under
permanent livestock production rather than being abandoned with litde alternave use after a period of
some seven years while elsewhere overgazig is already being observed. Increased tenure security i
the ZAGROPs should also benefit most the poorer herders. Animal health activities would reach two
thirds of the herds, compared to one third currently. Ihis could reduce calf mortality by about one third,
raise fertility by 10 percent and entail an annual incremental value added of the order of $2.5 million in
meat plus some $1 milion from  milk. Much of the latter would help improve family nutition. lhe
incomes of the 7,000 herder families most direcdy affected by the project is expected to increase on
average by some $500 per annum, or close to $50 per person. Women could see their income increase
by about $150 per year, subject to favorable market conditions. The project would also have a noa-
quantifiable social impact deriving from (1) the assistance funished to the most disadvanaged herders;
(ii) the attention given to the developmen of the capacity for the production of milk and cheese by
women; Ciii) greater grassroots involvement in the maagement of the FNEC, and decentralization of the
livestock sector's administration; and (iv) inrased collaboration and reduced risk of land tenure disputes
between herders and villagers in the ZAGROP areas.
27.       RAks. The risks of the proposed project are primarily political in natue. Its success depends
on a smooth trnsiion to deentralized management and phased transfer of support seriices to the
professional organiations and private sector. The measures which have already been taken (para. 13)
should help reduce dtose risk. A prolonged drought in neghbborg countries cod tge an additonal
flow of herds, with a negave Impact on animal and human health, civil safety, the economy of the sector
and natural r -mrces.  The proposed remedies cmprise stengthened border controls, ber
disseminaon of ifmatin  and better services provided to the heders. Ihe soci risk of deioraton
of relafions between au        and aliogenous popuatio  is catered for through measres to (a)
diversify the ethnic base of the professional organizadons and the ZAGROPs; and (b) seek prior
agreements between the grassroots beneficiaries, based on their mutual advantages, on land-use rights,
trade flows and sharing the benefts created by the project. Ihe risk of failure of professional
orgaizatons would be reduced by phasing in their new responsibite, the revision of their staes and
the instllaton of FIDE as the organ of official coordnation of all liveock sector development activities.
28.                    .  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Associaton and recommend that the Exective Directors approve iL

PORTFOLIO ASSESSEN
The lawt County Potfolio Pefom          e Review (CPPR) with Govnment officia  was held in May
1994. Projec performace was found to have imprved and potfolio rating has acoodingly improved to 2.2 from
a 2.6 rating in September 1993. This was manly due to civil servants rouning to work and being paid regulary.
Main diswsions centered an use of tncal assistance, project monitoring and procuremenL  Areement was
reached that (a) the Goverment would set up a dat baso of national and regional expertise avilable i the CAR
so that the adminattion, donors and NOOs might consider these candidates pror to recruiting non-Afican
expatrtes; (b) exiing moitoring structu   in technical mines would be reactivated to review ptogress of
investment opetons jointly with their Ministy of Plan colleagues (c) the Government would make an imedite
effort to reduce procuement delays, which it atttibuted to socid unrest and stilkes durmg the past two years; and
(d) project codinao  would meet periodically, under the coordinaion of the Economic Maagement Project's
diector, to exage exiences in the mnagem t of IDA-financed opertions. Thee has already been one
project coordination meeting. During FY 1994, a disbursemet mission of IDA visited Bangui to help resolve
problems associa    with the high rejection rate of disburement applications and to review the functioning of the
special acco. A follow-up semia is plnned, and in the m                 e several project prsnnel have atded a
regional procuremendisbursement seminar held in Abidjan.

Notwithstandng a long period of unrest preceding the recent change in Government,
disbursements against ongoing IDA-financed credits have proceeded moderately well. They have
furthermore improved in general over the last few months. The projects most affected by the past
political sitation were the Economic management project, with a 28.6% disbursement lag, and the
Education m project, which suffered from extended strikes, with a 26.6% disbursement lag. The
relatvely receny initiated Enteprise Rehbilitation and Development Project, where the Central Bank
of CAR has proven reluctant to manage the apex line of credit, and the Agricultural Services Project,
where the planned reorganization of the insutions concerned was only achieved after the new
Government took office, show relatively high lags (32.6% lag on $4.2 million originally expected to be
disbursed to date for the former and 39.9% on $4.8 million for the latter). Otherwise, three projects
(Transport Sector, Energy and Social Dimensions of Adjustment) have lags varying between 8.4% and
12.7%, and two other projects (Natural Resources and the SAL M) are slightly ahead of schedule on their
