I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of India (GOI) has requested a Bank loan to help
finance the cost of the initial development of the Dudhichua open pit coal
mine located in Singrauli, at the state border between Madhya Pradesh and
Uttar Pradesh (Map IBRD 17252). The Dudhichua mine will have a final capacity
of 10 million tons per year (tpy) which is to be developed in two phases, the
first of which (5 million tpy) is included in the proposed project's scope.
The project will be owned and operated by Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. (CIL), a Government undertaking.
The Dudhichua mine forms part of GOI's plan to increase the utilization of
indigenous energy resources. In order to meet coal demand for power
generation, the Government has chosen the strategy of basing the expansion of
coal production on the development of large scale, mechanized open pit mines,
such as Dudhichua.
1.02     The financing requirement of the Project, including escalation,
contingencies, interest during construction and working capital, are estimated
at US$373 million, of which about US$128 million is in foreign exchange. The
proposed Bank loan of US$151 million would cover about 40% of the financing
requirements. The balance of US$222 million will be provided from internally
generated funds of CIL and from Government resources.
1.03     The proposed project was submitted by GOI for the Bank's
consideration in July 1982, and a pre-appraisal mission visited India in
September/October 1982. It was appraised in March 1983 by a mission
comprising Messrs. J. Barrientos (Chief), P. Kotschwar, B. Stenberg and J.
Strongman of the Industry Department, Mr. S. Luode (YPP), and Messrs. B.
Samuelson and P. Smallman (consultants).
Il. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Supply and Demand
2.01     Coal is India's most abundant indigenous energy source.  Total coal
resources 1/ are estimated at over 112 billion tons equivalent to about 61
billion tons of oil equivalent (toe). Of these resources, about half
(30 billion toe) are considered to be technically and economically recoverable
reserves given present conditions. By comparison, India's prognostic
recoverable hydrocarbon reserves were recently estimated at 6.5 billion toe.
Based on its abundant coal reserves, the Indian economy has developed over
time with coal as the main energy source. In 1981/82, India produced 125
million tons of coal and 6 million tons of lignite which accounted for 54% and
1% respectively of commercial energy supply. Hyoroelectric and nuclear power
generation provided 12% of primary energy supply and oil represented about 33%
of energy supply as shown in Annex 2-1 and summarized in the table below.
About 55% of petroleum products were of imported origin and the cost of
imported oil represented a major burden for the balance of payments, amounting
to US$6 billion in 1981/82 or over 70% of merchandise export earnings.

B. Energy Sector Strategy
2.03     GOI's energy policy has been based on the principle of maximizing the
development of indigenous resources and also, more recently, on encouraging
improved efficiency of energy utilization. A comprehensive study on India's
future energy supply and demand prospects undertaken by the Working Group on
Energy Policy (WGEP) was published in 1979. The findings and recommendations
of the WGEP are given in Annex 2-3. In line with this policy, GOI is
emphasizing the development of coal and of power generation utilizing coal or
hydro resources, and has substantially increased the investment in these
sectors in recent years. Preliminary figures call for coal production to
increase to 232 million tpy by the end of the Seventh Plan representing an
annual growth rate of 8.0% and for electric power generating capacity to more
than double to 74,000 MW with 59% of the incremental capacity by coal-fired
units, 39% by hydro and 2% by nuclear. Based on GOI's estimates coal will
continue to be the most important energy source in India in the future and its
contribution to the country's energy requirements will remain at about 50%
over the next decade. GOI is also making a concerted effort to accelerate oil
and gas development both through national oil companies and by foreign oil
companies who have been invited to submit bids for exploration and production
sharing on many blocks both offshore and onshore. However, despite these
advances, India will remain dependent on imported oil to meet a significant
part of its primary energy requirements, in particular, for the growing demand
in transport.
2.04     The Bank's role in the energy sector has been most extensive in the
power sector. In the past thirty years fourteen loans totalling US$1,133
million and fifteen IDA credits totalling US$2,096 million have been made for
India's power projects. A basic account of the Bank's role in the power
sector is given in Annex 2-4.
2.05     More recently, the Bank has expanded its assistance into the oil and
gas sector, responding to changes in the needs and priorities of the Indian
energy sector over the past decade. Four loans totalling US$940 million have
been made to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) for oil and gas
exploration and development; a US$200 million loan was also made in April 1982
for the modernization of several refineries. The Bank's role in the oil and
gas sector has addressed several inter-related aspects including providing
policy advice on hydrocarbon exploration, development, processing and
utilization and strengthening the technical capabilities and financial
positions of project entities.
C. The Coal Sector
1.   Background
2.06     The coal industry in India originally developed with a large number
of small, independent mines. In 1956, some of the producers were taken over
and consolidated into one larger government-owned company (the National Coal
Development Corporation). Subsequently, in the early 1970s almost the entire
industry was nationalized and in 1975 the Coal India Ltd (CIL) group of
companies was formed which accounted for 88% of India's coal production in
1982/83. In addition to CIL there are three other coal producers and one
lignite producer. The other coal producers are Singareni Collieries Ltd.
(SCL), with 10% of total coal production, which is owned by GOI and the State



- 4 -
Government of Andhra Pradesh, and captive coking coal mines of the
privately-owned Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) and the government-owned
Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) - 1% each of total coal production. In
addition to coal production, lignite is produced by the 100% government-owned
Neyveli Lignite Corporation in the state of Tamil Nadu which produced 5.9
million tons of lignite in 1981/82.
2.07     The Department of Coal, Ministry of Energy (DOC) is in charge of
policymaking in the coal sector, and it monitors and coordinates activities in
the sector. This includes all matters pertaining to the production, supply,
distribution and prices of coal. The DOC is responsible for the
administration of various Acts relating to coal and lignite production in
India, as well as for approving the annual production targets and investment
and operating budgets for the government-owned coal/lignite mining companies.
The Planning Commission (PLC) scrutinizes and reviews the coal sector
production and investment program and sanctions linkages between new mines and
major consumers.
2.08     The Bank has made one loan for a coking coal project to the Indian
Iron and Steel Company in 1961 for US$35 million (Loan 290-P-IN). Activity in
the sector resumed with a Sector mission in 1980, following which the India
Coal Sector Report, Report 3601-IN, September 1982 was issued.  That report
provided a basic introduction to the sector and addressed various issues
regarding coal exploration, production, investment, transportation,
consumption and pricing which were considered important to the future
development of the sector. In particular the report proposed a number of
recommendations designed to (i) improve the efficiency of existing coal
exploration and mining operations; (ii) reduce transportation bottlenecks for
coal; (iii) improve project implementation capabilities and maximize
production growth; and (iv) establish the industry on a sound financial basis
through economic pricing policies and appropriate financing and resource
mobilization strategies. Subsequently, the GOI accepted many of the
recommendations and has taken steps to implement them as well as requesting
Bank assistance in financing certain projects in the sector. The proposed
project would support further improvements in the sector, first, by providing
financing to the sector and, second, by supporting a number of important
actions or studies on which subsequent action will be taken, regarding coal
transportation (para. 2.16), supply/demand and linkages (para. 3.13), pricing
and resource mobilization (para. 3.28), operating efficiency of open pit mines
(para. 4.10), cost control and budgeting (para. 4.07) and project management
(para. 5.20). The GOI has also requested Bank financing for a second project,
the Jharia Block 2 Coking Coal Project, and this is being processed separately
on a later timetable.
2.   Reserves
2.09     India's coal reserves 1/ are estimated at 86 billion tonnes of which
78% are thermal coal, used primarily for heat and steam generation, and 22%
are coking (i.e. metallurgical) coal used in steel making as shown below:
1/ Contained in seams of 1.2 metres and above and at depths of up to 600
metres.

2.10     Basic geological exploration is undertaken by the Geological Survey
of India (GSI) which is responsible for regional prospecting/reserves
assessment. Detailed exploration including proving up reserves for mine
feasibility work is undertaken by the government-owned Mineral Exploration
Corporation (MEC) and by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute
(CMPDI), a subsidiary of CIL. India's coal reserves are found mainly in the
eastern part of the country (MAP 17252) where extensive exploration has taken
place in the past. More recently, the rapid growth of demand by consumers in
western India, especially in the Bombay area and in Gujarat, has generated a
need for new coal developments in central India. In order to meet this need,
priorities have been adjusted to emphasize coal exploration in Maharashtra and
western Madhya Pradesh. This is a sound approach. As new deposits are
identified and subsequently developed in these areas over the next decade,
this strategy is expected to be successful in making coal supplies more
readily available without the long transportation linkage from the distant
eastern coalfields.
2.11     Much of the known reserves in eastern India are located in deep
deposits in Bihar and West Bengal which result in difficult mining
conditions. A priority has also been given to identifying large coalfields
with shallow deposits which can be developed with large scale open-pit mining
technologies. This is a sound strategy which has resulted in several such
deposits being identified in recent years. The largest of these are the
Karanpura and Singrauli coalfields with estimated coal resources of 15 and 10
billion tons respectively. Other important areas are the Obra coalfield (4
billion tons), the Wardha valley (4 billion tons) and the Ib valley (2 billion
tons). So far, of these various areas only the first three have been
developed. The other two are presently being explored.
2.12     There is a wide variation in the quality of thermal coal reserves.
Useful calorific value 1/ ranges from 1,300 kcal/kg to over 6,200 kcal/kg.
There is also a wide variation in the quality of coking coal reserves with ash
content varying from 18% to over 35%. The bulk of the thermal coal reserves
are in the 3,500-4,500 kcal/kg range of useful calorific value, the bulk of
coking coal reserves in the 26% to 32% range of ash content. To date, the
coking coal reserves have been relatively more extensively explored and
developed than the thermal reserves, and as a result, coking coal reserves
account for about 39% of proven total coal reserves. Reserves of high quality
thermal and coking coals are limited and both are in short supply. Most
thermal coals require certain preparation before use, which generally takes

allowing penalties for ash and moisture content.

the form of separation of shale and rock from the coal by hand picking and
some screening of material. About 90% of the coking coal needs to be washed
in order to reduce the ash content to more acceptable ranges for feed to the
steel mills.
3.   Coal Production and Transportation
2.13     Coal production was 130.6 million tons in 1982/83, of which about 60%
was from underground mines and the balance from open-pit. Total employment in
the coal sector in India in December 1982 was about 723,000 employees of which
about 50% were in clerical or unskilled manual grades. The degree of
mechanization in Indian underground mines is low compared to the major
underground coal producing countries in the world. About 96% of underground
coal mining in India is by manual methods and only 4% by mechanized
operations. All of the mechanized underground mining has been introduced by
CIL since its formation and is still under implementation and has not reached
full production. Output per manshift (OMS) averages 0.55 tons in underground
mines compared with 1.5-3.0 tons in the deep older mines in Europe and 8-12
tons in the new, shallower, highly mechanized underground mines in Australia,
South Africa and North America. Given the relative shortage of capital and
surplus of labor in the Indian economy, it is not economically justified for
Indian underground mines to try and reach a similar degree of mechanization as
the capital intensive mines in industrialized countries since the relative
values of capital and labor are different. The Indian industry is
nevertheless targeting a 10-20% improvement in average underground OMS by the
end of the decade. This is considered appropriate and achievable based on
relatively simple measures to increase mechanization of coal extraction,
handling and loading and on improved training of the work force and upgrading
of unskilled to semi-skilled capabilities.
2.14     Most Indian open-pit coal mines are presently small to medium size
(1-3 million tpy) compared with the world coal industry. Consequently, Indian
equipment (35-85 ton trucks, 4-10 m3 shovels and 10 m3 bucket/50 m boom
draglines) are presently somewhat smaller than can be found in large open-pit
coal mines worldwide (120-200 ton trucks, 15-20 m3 shovel and 30-40 m3
bucket/90-120m boom draglines). The Indian coal industry is progressively
moving towards larger mines and equipment. This is a desirable policy since
larger operations offer economies of scale and lower unit production costs.
Progress has been cautious since the use of very large equipment brings with
it an inherent risk that the breakdown of a single piece of equipment will
cause a much greater production loss than the failure of a small item of
equipment. The move to larger equipment has also been impeded by a lack of
foreign exchange since the largest equipment must, for the most part, be
imported.  Further, in the case of dump trucks, moving to sizes above 120 tons
capacity involves a shift in technology from mechanical to electrical drive
and, therefore, requires the acquisition of new skills and maintenance
procedures which are now being developed in CIL. Some of the new open-pit
mines presently under construction will have ultimate capacities of 5-10
million tpy (para. 4.17) as in the case of Dudhichua (para. 5.06) and larger
equipment is already being introduced in some of these mines.
2.15     Coal is transported primarily by rail (70%) followed by roadways
(25%) and, to a very limited extent, by coastal barges and ropeways. In
1981/82 the average haulage distance for coal was 566 km.  About half of the
coal is carried over short to medium distances of up to 500 km since many



industrial consumers, most steel plants and a large number of power houses are
located in the eastern area, near to the major coalfields. One third is
transported to consumers located 500-1,000 km from the mines and the remainder
over 1,000 km to consumers in northern, western, and southern India. These
distant consumers are located in four main geographical areas. One is a group
of northern states around Delhi, i.e., Punjab, Haryana and northern Uttar
Pradesh. A second is the emerging industrial belt in Gujarat. The third is
the western portion of Maharashtra, including Bombay, and the fourth is the
southern tip of India in Tamil Nadu especially along the eastern sea coast.
2.16     The performance of Indian Railways (IR) in carrying coal and other
bulk goods deteriorated sharply from 1976/77 to 1980/81 when originating
traffic declined from 239 million tons to 220 million tons. An account of the
operational difficulties which contributed to this declining performance
together with the efforts of GOI and IR and assistance from the Bank to
overcome them is provided in Annex 2-5. While the measures taken to improve
IR's performance are espected to result in future improvements in coal
haulage, no systematic analysis has been undertaken which would indicate how
well the railways will be able to deal with the anticipated coal haulage
requirements by the end of the decade. Recognizing the major difficulties
facing the railways, there is an urgent need for an overall system study of
how the railway system can be best utilized for carrying coal in view of the
importance of coal transportation for coal consumption by consumers in
northern and western India. Such a study would (a) define improvements in
systems for handling and transporting coal including fixed loading and
unloading facilities, wagon design and wagon utilization; (b) establish an
optimal investment program based on reviews of investment priorities and
payoffs; and (c) identify what alternative modes of transportation will be
necessary to make up any shortfall in railway carrying capacity for coal. GOI
has agreed to initiate the necessary studies, before April 30, 1984 after
exchanging views with the Bank on the terms of reference. These studies are
expected to be completed in December 1985, and the Bank will be given an
opportunity to comment on the results prior to the implementation of the
recommendations.
III. THE MARKET FOR INDIAN COAL
A. Indian Coal Supply/Demand Situation and Prospects
3.01     India is the world's seventh largest producer and fifth largest
consumer in terms of tonnages of hard coal. However, India's participation in
the international trade has been minor. It has occasionally exported small
quantities of thermal coal (0.1-0.7 million tpy) to neighboring countries and
more recently, has become a minor importer of coking coal (1.0-1.5 million
tpy). In both cases, India's contribution is less than 1% of world trade.
For the future, similar levels of coking coal imports are expected to be
required because steel production growth is expected to stay ahead of new
coking coal mine development (para. 3.11). With regard to thermal coal, given
that there will be little surplus coal production compared with domestic
requirements in the next five to ten years (para. 3.11) and that coal
transportation infrastructure is highly constrained (Annex 2-5) it is unlikely
that India will develop significant coal exports. Even with a concerted



effort, India's exports might not be expected to exceed 2 to 3% of production
within the next decade. For reference, an introduction to the world coal
market and future supply, demand and price trends is given in Annex 3-1.
1.   Coal supply
3.02     Coal production in India has increased from 56 million tons in
1960/61 to about 130 million tons in 1982/83 an average annual growth rate of
4.0%. Thermal coals comprise 77% of production, up from 71% in 1960/61 as

3.03      Coal production takes place predominantly in the Bihar/West Bengal
coalbelt (Map 17252). However, coal production is increasing in other states,
and Madhya Pradesh has recently overtaken West Bengal as the second largest
coal producing state as shown below:

3.04      Since its inception in 1975, the CIL group has accounted for about
90% of Indian coal production, the balance coming from SCL (which produces
only thermal coal) and TISCO/IISCO (which produce only coking coal). SCL with
new operations in Andhra Pradesh has grown most rapidly while production has
increased only slightly at TISCO/IISCO which operate old, deep mines in the
Jharia coalfield.

3.05     The bulk of Indian coals are relatively poor quality by international
standards with an average useful heating value of about 4,000 kcal/kg for
thermal coal and an average ash content of about 29% for run-of-mine coking
coal. Grade definition and CIL's planned production by grade for 1982/83 is
shown in Annex 3-2.

3.06      The Sixth Plan (1980/81 to 1984/85) originally included a target
production of 165 million tons for 1984/85, (representing an average annual
growth of 7.7% from the production level of 1980/81). However, based on the
production trends to date, a target of 153 million tons is considered a more
realistic assumption. A set of longer-term supply projections to the end of
the Seventh Plan have recently been prepared by the Central Mine Planning and
Design Institute (CMPDI), the engineering and planning subsidary of CIL (see
para. 4.04). These projections indicate a total coal production of 232
million tons by 1989/90, including 200 million tons from CIL. Although this
estimate already incorporates a cut-back of about 15% from previous figures,
it still appears optimistic. An examination of the status of formulation and
implementation of CIL's projects indicates that in some cases the production
build-up of some of the new open pit mines is optimistic. Given the early
stages of preparation in particular for six projects to be included in the
plan, a production of about 193 million tons by 1989/90 is considered a more
realistic production projection for CIL. This translates in a supply
projection of 224 million tons for all India, as shown below:

2.   Coal Demand
3.07     The most important consuming sector is the power sector which
accounted for 34% of coal consumption in 1981/82 up from 23% in 1974/75. This
includes not only state and central government-owned power houses but also
non-utility captive power houses for major industrial consumers (such as steel
mills and aluminum plants) which accounted for about 3 million tons (7% of
power sector) coal consumption. Other important consuming sectors are steel
(for coking coal) whose share of consumption has remained constant at 21%, and
other miscellaneous industries and small users whose share has declined from
35% in 1974/75 to 26% in 1981/82 as shown below:

(grades A, B and C) 1/ which are supplied on a priority basis to the railways
(35%), certain older power plants mainly in eastern India (20%), cement kilns
(15%) and selected small industrial users and fertilizer plants (30%). The
bulk (about 55%) of the lower grade thermal coal (grades D-G) is supplied to
the power sector and the remainder to miscellaneous industries and certain
fertilizer plants.
3.09     Unlike production, where 58% is concentrated in Bihar and West

Consumption in the northern states is provided largely from mines in the Bihar
and West Bengal with most transportation by rail. Consumers in Maharashtra
and Gujarat are supplied as much as possible from mines in Maharashtra and
south western Madhya Pradesh with balancing supplies being provided from mines
in eastern Madhya Pradesh, including the Singrauli coalfield. Consumers in
the southern states receive their coal from SCL and from the CIL coalfields in
West Bengal by coastal shipping through the port of Haldia at Calcutta.
3.10     Based on recent trends in the power and steel sectors, the coal
demand projection for the end of the Sixth Plan (1984/85) has been assessed at
153-158 million tons, a reduction by 10-15 million tons from the original
target in the Sixth Plan of 168 million tons. By 1984/85, therefore, thermal
coal supply and demand are expected to be broadly in balance although some
shortages may occur. But 1.0-2.0 million tpy coking coal imports are likely
to be required. With regard to longer term projections, CMPDI 's most recent
coal demand projections indicate a demand of 232 million tons for 1989/90,
i.e. by the end of the Seventh Plan. CMPDI's projections for 1989/90 by main
consumption sectors are shown below:

A further breakdown of projected coal demand in 1989/90 by sector and by
producer is given in Annex 3-3.
3.11     The CMPDI estimates are based on latest information regarding the
development plans of the various consuming sectors for the Seventh Plan
period. These are based on an underlying GDP growth rate of 5-5.5% per year.
The compatibility of these estimates with projections for the rest of the
economy has not been closely checked and it is to be expected that they will
be modified as the preparation of the Seventh Plan progresses. Fuller details
of the specific assumptions for each sector are provided in Annex 3-4. While
the CMPDI demand projections do not seem unreasonable, they may be somewhat
over optimistic given the substantial expansion called for in the various
consuming sectors. Past experience with previous coal sector projections
indicates a tendency to overestimate future supply and demand. The relatively
high growth rates projected by CMPDI may also be an indication of a continued
tendency towards over-estimation. While there is insufficient information on
which to make a specific adjustment, future demand estimates could well be
overestimated by anywhere from 5 to 15 million tons in 1989/90. Given that
the preparation of the Seventh Plan is still in a preliminary stage



- 13 -
and that there are inherent uncertainties associated with future economic
growth predictions, the margin of uncertainty would appear greater than the
difference between the 1989/90 supply projection and demand projection. On
the basis of present knowledge it is concluded that thermal coal supply and
demand can be expected to be broadly in balance from now until 1989/90,
although occasional surpluses and shortages may arise in particular years.
For coking coal, it appears that shortages in the order of 1-2 million tpy
will persist, although the exact size of the gap will depend on the timing of
future increases in steel production vis-a-vis coking coal expansion. A more
detailed treatment of coking coal supply and demand is to be undertaken as
part of the Jharia Block II Coking Coal Project which is presently under
preparation.
B. Coal Supply Allocation and Marketing
1.   Supply Allocation
3.12     The supply allocation and marketing of coal in India takes place
within a set of formalized procedures whereby supply allocations and long-term
linkages are administered by GOI rather than by the producers. With regard to
the allocation of coal supplies to major consumers, such as steel mills, power
houses and cement plants, monthly and quarterly interministerial operational
meetings are held to establish allocation priorities and match available
supplies with requirements. Allocation of coal to small consumers is
undertaken by the producers in accordance with priorities set by GOI. With
regard to long-term linkages between coalfields and major consumers, it is
GOI's practice to establish them through a formalized set of planning
procedures. Preliminary linkages for new mines and/or coalfields are proposed
by the project sponsor to the DOC at the time of feasibility preparation.
Subsequently, linkages between new mines and major consumers such as new
power, steel or cement plants are finalized by an interministerial Standing
Linkage Committee (SLC). The SLC, which is chaired by the DOC, meets four
times a year. Linkage proposals are submitted by representatives of the
various ministries responsible for the new projects requiring coal and
supplies are allocated by the SLC from available sources based on least-cost
criteria taking into account available transportation facilites.
3.13     While the linkages proposed by the SLC provide an optimal solution to
match new coal consumers with new large-scale mines on an incremental basis,
only limited cross checks are made to see if linkages need to be revised.
Furthermore, because of the size of the system, no cross check is available to
ensure that the totality of linkages satisfies optimality criteria. In order
to establish the least-cost solution for the entire system, an analytical tool
such as a computerized mathematical model is required to manipulate the data
and generate a solution. Such analytical tools exist but have not yet been
applied to the Indian coal production/transportation/utilization network. GOI
has agreed to initiate the necessary studies to develop such a model, as soon
as terms of reference are prepared and discussed with the Bank. These studies
will be completed before December 31, 1985, by which time the findings will be
reviewed with the Bank.



- 14 -
2.   Marketing
3.14     Given that supply allocations, linkages and pricing (para. 3.17) are
administered by GOI, the main marketing functions undertaken by the coal
producers relate to the booking of orders, dispatch of coal, invoice for
orders, receipt of payment, monitoring coal quality and ensuring that grade
and delivery specifications are satisfied. In some cases penalities for
sub-grade deliveries are agreed with consumers. These functions are
undertaken by each of the CIL subsidiaries for their own production and by
SCL. The CIL subsidiaries also operate coal stockyards in different parts of
the country to satisfy the needs of small consumers. For the CIL group, there
is a Central Marketing Organization (CMO), located in the CIL headquarters
which is responsible for establishing marketing policies and procedures and
for coordinating and overseeing the operations of the marketing departments of
the subsidiary companies. CMO also assists with formulating national fuel
policy, assessing the demand for coal, undertaking long-term sales planning
and marketing research and promotion.
3.15     Traditionally, the coal producers have provided coal to consumers
without specific market contracts. In recent years CIL has been attempting to
introduce contracts with major customers which will specify volumes and
premiums and penalties with regard to variations in coal quality within
existing grade ranges. So far, the only user to enter such an arrangement
with CIL has been the State Electricity Board in Gujarat. The more widespread
use of such a contract is desirable in that it can provide incentives for the
producers to improve the quality of coal being provided to consumers within a
particular grade.
3.16     The major issue within coal marketing is that major consumers report
that there has been a growing incidence of poor quality feed to power plants
and other consumers of thermal coals. The main reason appears to be that
insufficient concern has been given to coal screening, deshaling, stockpiling
and dispatch methods. Also the economics of washing thermal coals has not
been sufficiently studied. Poor coal quality can result in operational
inefficiencies and increased transportation costs for consumers because of
having to ship extra quantities of coal to make up for lower qualities. In
July 1982, GOI set up a committee (the Fazal Committee) to carry out a study
on coal quality basically focussing on these issues and their incidence on the
power sector. The study was completed in late 1983 and is currently under
review by GOI. Some of the main recommendations emphasize the need for
reviewing linkages periodically, improving loading and transportation
facilities, making more extensive use of coal preparation plants, improving
sampling arrangements and introducing quality related bonus and penalties on
supply contracts. All these are very positive steps to improve coal quality
supplied to the power sector. GOT expects to complete its review of the
Fazal's report in May 1984, at which time it would be made available to the
Bank for comment.
C. Pricing
1.   Prices and Pricing Policy
3.17     Coal prices were placed under GOI control in 1944 under the Colliery
Control Act and have been directly or indirectly administered by GOI ever



- 15 -
since. From 1944 to 1975 average prices were generally sufficient for most
producers to generate small profits. In July 1975, in an attempt to keep the
price of coal low to the consumer thereby encouraging the substitution of coal
for oil, and to put pressure on the newly formed CIL to be cost efficient, a
new price schedule was issued by GOI which only covered cash operating costs.
No provision for depreciation charges was made. The government's policy was
to provide investment funds from central sources and the government did not
appear to be concerned about the financial viability of the producers. During
the next four years prices were kept unchanged. Over this period, CIL's
average production cost increased by 36% from Rs 69 per ton to Rs 94 per ton.
As a result in 1978/79, CIL incurred losses of Rs 2.4 billion on sales of Rs
5.4 billion (para. 4.14) and unplanned government loans were required to cover
CIL's cash losses in addition to the funds provided for investment
requirements.
3.18     A new direction in energy pricing was introduced in the 1980 Sixth
Plan document which states, "in the past the pricing of energy has not always
reflected either the true cost to the economy or helped to ensure the
financial viability of the energy industries. This cannot be allowed to
continue for long." Starting in July 1979, and continuing in February 1981,
May 1982 and January 1984 the GOI authorized four price increases which
provided a net price increase of 55% in real terms compared with the price
levels prevailing during 1978/79 and which enabled CIL to become profitable in
1981/82 and 1982/83 (para. 4.14) after five successive years of losses.
3.19     The Government's basic pricing policy for public enterprises is to
ensure financial viability and to provide for a reasonable rate of return on
capital employed under conditions of efficient operation. In the case of the
coal sector, consideration has been to bring CIL and SCL to an acceptable
financial position, generating sufficient funds to cover their respective
financial needs, including servicing of long-term debt and mobilizing funds
for future investments. Accordingly, the May 1982 price adjustment was based
upon the principle of recovering the full cost of production, subject to
satisfactory operating norms, and allowing for a 10% return on assets. 1/
3.20     In order to more fully examine the implications of its pricing
policies for the coal industry, to define mechanisms to implement those
policies and to see if any alternative policies warrant consideration, in
early 1982, the GOI commissioned the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices
(BICP) to undertake a detailed study of coal pricing. BICP's basic tasks
included examining the efficiency of various coal mining operations to derive
production cost standards, and reviewing alternative principles and procedures
for setting minehead coal prices and producer retention prices. BICP's
1/ This approach was fully in line with pricing policies proposed for
Government enterprises by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), which
recommended to provide a fair rate of return which has generally ranged
from 10-14% post tax on net worth depending on factors such as risk,
priority, growth prospects, etc. For coal and certain other basic
commodities, BPE further recommends that prices must be regulated to
prevent a cascading effect on prices in general.



- 16 -
approach included consideration of basing coal prices on long run marginal
cost of production as well as on the BPE's pricing policy of return on capital
employed as described above. Based on preliminary findings, BICP officials
recognize the need for coal prices to continue to increase in real terms in
order to further improve CIL's financial position and resource mobilization in
the sector, and to reflect more adequately the cost of coal to the economy.
BICP also favors a gradual adjustment of prices to minimize the inflationary
impact on the rest of the economy. A draft report was submitted to DOC in
July 1983 but more specific details will not be available until the report has
been reviewed, finalized and released by GOI. After initial consideration of
the BICP Report, the Government prepared and issued a new price schedule in
January 1984. Since consideration of the BICP Report has not yet been
finalized, the January 1984 price increase was not based on an announced
pricing criteria. In practice, however, the new price schedule can be
expected to provide a reasonable rate of return and resource mobilization for
the sector. GOI has also indicated that a further review of prices will take
place by March 1985.
3.21     The present coal price schedule is basically for seven grades of
thermal coal and eight grades of coking coal. Coking coal prices are given a
premium over thermal coal which takes account of the relative scarcity and
higher costs of production for coking coal as compared with thermal coal.
Coal prices (at minehead) for the different grades of thermal coals range from
Rs 61 to Rs 284 per ton and are based on useful heating value. For coking
coal the range varies from Rs 175 to Rs 450 per ton, depending on ash
content. 1/ The differentials for higher grades of both coking and thermal
coal have been substantially increased compared with lower grades of coal in
the latest price increase. This is considered an important improvement to
bring the relatively scarce better grades of coal more in line with its
opportunity cost. A separate schedule is also provided for high grade thermal
coals from the coalfields of ECL reflecting the more difficult geological
mining conditions generally found in ECL mines compared with thermal coal
mines of the other producers.
3.22     Prices are set on a minehead basis with consumers paying freight
costs from the mine to the point of consumption. In addition to the basic
price, consumers also pay certain sales taxes and levies (Annex 3-6) to the
central and state governments which on average amount to about 14% of the
minehead price. About 15% of these are subsequently returned to the producers
as subsidies for stowing operations, mine workers' housing and medical
facilities.
3.23     GOI is also concerned that the individual CIL subsidiaries (see para.
4.01) should be able to operate as viable entities. In the past some
subsidiaries have made 'Large losses (Annex 4-2) due in part to difficulties
relating to mining conditions, infrastructure and other factors generally
beyond their direct control. In order to normalize differences in mining
costs due to such factors, GOI has extended its coal pricing policy to include
the individual CIL subsidiaries by introducing in March 1983 a retention
pricing system for the CIL group. 2/ Under this system, each CIL subsidiary
1/ The present price schedule is presented in Annex 3-5.
2/ This pricing change was in line with the recommendation in the Coal Sector
Report (13601-IN), September 1982.



- 17 -
is annually assigned an internal accounting price based on estimated
production costs and efficiency standards for that subsidiary. These
production and cost standards will be revised each year and improvements in
operating performance will be required if they are to be achieved. They are,
therefore, expected to induce more cost efficient operations. Each of the
subsidiaries should, thus, be able to operate in a viable manner.
2.   A Rational Approach to Coal Pricing Policy for Indian Coals 1/
3.24     A rational coal pricing policy requires that prices be set in a
manner that satisfies basic economic criteria. The basic economic principle
for pricing energy products--or any product--is that its price should reflect
its opportunity cost to the country. For tradeable commodities, and for
non-tradeable commodities that are substitutable for tradeables, the
international or border price of the tradeable (or substitute) is considered
to be the economically efficient price. For non-tradeables where no such
substitution opportunities exist, long run marginal cost is the efficient
pricing principle.
3.25     In principle, all Indian coal is tradeable and therefore should be
priced at opportunity cost. With regard to thermal coal, however, the bulk
(about 75%) of thermal coal production is of lower grade thermal coal which is
not expected to be economically tradeable under any condition because of its
low quality. Although technically these coals could be considered a
substitute for tradeable fuels (mainly higher grades of thermal coals), the
net-back export parity is lower than the long run marginal cost, after
adjustments for quality differences and transportation costs. That is not to
say these low quality coals should not be produced. Such coals are economic
compared with other possible sources of energy for the Indian economy such as
imported coal or oil, i.e., the estimated import parity price is above long
run marginal cost. In these circumstances, in view of the abundant reserves
of this low quality coal, the economic efficiency price becomes the long run
marginal cost (measured in border prices) which will have a value somewhere
between the export parity and import parity price levels.
3.26     With regard to coking coal, however, border prices do represent
efficiency pricing because domestic coking coal (about 20% of Indian
production) can be directly substituted for imported coking coal (para.
3.01). The present price schedule of coking coals has incorporated increased
grade-wise differences by adding a substantial premium to higher grades. The
implementation of this formula has reduced considerably the gap with net-back
border prices, and it is also expected to act as an incentive for improving
quality control at the mines.
3.27     Estimates of possible future coal prices have been prepared on the
basis that prices approximate long run marginal costs. Following this
approach, it has been calculated that the average (minehead) coal price would
be Rs. 197 per ton (in 1984/85 terms) based on an incremental analysis of
CIL's investment program and production costs that derive from it. This would
imply by 1989/90 an increase of 7.6% above the present average price of Rs.
183 per ton. For the purposes of comparison, price estimates were also
1/ Energy pricing including coal is also addressed in Economic Situation of
India and Resource Mobilization Issues (Report 4375-IN), April 1983.



- 18 -
prepared on the basis that CIL would achieve a 10% return on net worth
according to the pricing policy as advocated by BPE (para. 3.19). In this
second case, it was found that coal prices would average Rs. 193 per ton in
1989/90, an increase of 5.5% above present price levels. These analyses
indicate that both approaches would result in similar price increases by
1989/90 in the range of 5.5-7.6% above present levels. Further analysis based
on preliminary data for projects presently under formulation, indicates that
the long run marginal cost approach would result in additional real price
increases in the 1990s due to the next generation of new coal projects being
more costly than those presently under construction or awaiting implementation.
3.28     As well as satisfying basic economic criteria, a rational pricing
policy, should enable producers to operate in a sound financial manner and
should provide an adequate level of resource mobilization in the sector. A
gradual increase of coal prices reaching by 1989/90 a level 5.5% higher in
real terms than present prices would imply that CIL would be in a sound
financial position during the period (para 7.10). Also, the resource
mobilization in the sector would increase from 45-50% of investment
requirements at present to about 70% by 1989/90, as shown below.

3.29     In conclusion, GOI's pricing policy, whether it be based on return on
net worth or long run marginal cost, effectively meets basic economic criteria
and provides for the financial viability of the coal producers as well as
generating adequate resource mobilization in the sector. GOI has agreed to
review coal prices periodically in order to ensure, under conditions of
efficient operation, the financial viability of CIL and also to progressively
increase the level of resource mobilization in the sector.
IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
A. Coal India Ltd.
1.   Organization and Management
4.01     The CIL group of companies was organized by GOI in September 1975,
following a restructuring of the coal companies which were nationalized in the



- 19 -
early 1970s. The group was established as a holding company (CIL) and five
wholly-owned subsidiaries, 1/ Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL), Central
Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL), Western Coalfields Ltd
(WCL), and the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), and its
activities are regulated under the framework of the Companies Act of 1956.
CIL operates semi-autonomously under the direction of an eleven-member Board
of Directors, headed by its Chairman appointed by the President of India. The
Chairman also acts as Managing Director, responsible for the day-to-day
direction of the Group. The Board of Directors also include the chairmen of
CIL's subsidiaries, and government representatives. The Board has also
appointed a Technical Committee, responsible for reviewing and recommending
development projects and bid awards for imported equipment.
4.02     According to its articles of incorporation, CIL is required to seek
GOI's approval, inter-alia, for specific investments of Rs 50 million or more,
five-year and annual plans of development and capital budget, and its
operating budget. Otherwise, CIL operates with autonomy for carrying out its
operations, including the implementation of new projects. CIL is functionally
organized with managers for production and safety, engineering and supplies,
corporate planning and project monitoring, coal marketing, personnel and
finance. The Technical Director and Finance Director are also Board members.
An organization chart is shown in Annex 4-1.
4.03     CIL's subsidiaries also operate under the direction of a Board of
Directors, headed by a chairman, who also acts as Managing Director, appointed
by the President of India. Four of the subsidiaries namely BCCL, ECL, CCL and
WCL are coal producing units organized functionally with managers responsible
for production, corporate planning and projects, finance, marketing and
personnel. For each company, mining activities are organized into small
regional areas, each under the supervision of an area manager. Presently,
these subsidiaries operate 384 mines, grouped in 51 areas with an average
production of about 2 million tpy per area. A more detailed description of
CCL is provided in paras. 4.22 to 4.31 and for BCCL, ECL and WCL is shown in
Annex 4-2.
4.04     CMPDI is the planning and engineering arm of the CIL group of
companies. It also provides consulting services to outside groups. CMPDI was
originally established in the mid 1950s and was incorporated into the CIL
group in 1975. CMPDI has its headquarters in Ranchi (Bihar) and four regional
institutes attached to each operating subsidiary. Its scope of activities
include detailed exploration for mine planning, reserve evaluation, conceptual
and detailed planning and design of open pit and underground mines, design of
coal handling and beneficiation facilities, corporate planning activities
(including assessment of coal demand and perspective production plans), and
advisory services in mining technology. CMPDI presently employs a staff of
about 1,800 persons, of which about 30% are university graduates and 45% field
staff for exploration activities. It is a well managed and competent
organization. In fact, during the late 1970s, CMPDI has been instrumental in
strengthening project preparation activities and creating a pipeline of coal
projects, which are well prepared according to international standards.
1/ CIL also has one other small subsidiary, North-Eastern Coalfields Ltd.
(NEC), which is organized as an operating division directly under CIL
headquarters.



- 20 -
4.05     In addition to setting general policies for its subsidiaries and
retaining authority regarding the typical managerial functions of a holding
company, CIL directly manages the financial resources of the Group. All
contributions from the Government (about US$800 million in 1982/83) in the
form of new equity and long-term loans to fund the expansion programs are
channeled through CIL, which decides on the allocation to the subsidiary
companies depending on priorities and their cash position. Under this scheme
CIL is the borrower of all long-term loans (which currently are coming only
from GOI), and as such it has ultimate responsibility for servicing the
long-term debt. In practice, this is done through the cash management
function, determining the allocation of debt service which corresponds to each
subsidiary, and effecting the appropriate transfer of funds. Since CIL is
responsible for decision-making on financial and administrative matters, and
is the borrower of all long-term loans, it has been considered as the primary
beneficiary of the proposed Bank loan.
4.06     The CIL group is a very large and complex organization.  Since its
inception in 1975, and particularly during the last five years, CIL has made
progress in terms of consolidating the organization, implementing accounting
and other operational control systems, expanding production, improving the
operational efficiency (particularly labor productivity), and strengthening
its capability for project preparation and implementation. During this
period, steps have been taken to decentralize the operations giving more
autonomy to subsidiaries and its operating arms, mainly regarding operational,
marketing and personnel matters. These efforts have resulted in steady
improvements in CIL's functioning and CIL is now able to play a major role in
decentralizing from the Government the coordinating function for the
implementation of sectoral policies. The question has been raised as to
whether or not it would further strengthen CIL to decentralize the group and
create several autonomous companies. Such a move would not per se provide any
substantial improvement in CIL's operations at least at the present time and
could retard the progress already made. It would also mean that the
coordinating function for the sector would have to be absorbed through
strengthening and expanding the bureaucracy of the central government. There
is, however, further room for improvement in CIL's organization. A more
effective approach would be to assist CIL in making further progress in
strengthening its operations under the present organizational structure. To
this end, three specific operational and managerial issues are addressed under
the proposed project. These relate to budgetary and cost control systems
(para. 4.07), the operational efficiency in open pit mines (para. 4.10), and
project management (para. 5.20).
4.07     CIL introduced a cost control system for its operation three years
ago, which is generating standardized cost information at the mine level.
However, by and large the system is not being used as a managerial tool.
Production managers' attention is mainly oriented towards meeting production
targets, and tend to view the cost control system as an accounting exercise.
To address this problem, CIL has agreed to undertake a study to review the
systems and procedures for formulating and controlling the operational budget
at all levels of the group, and to recommend a plan of actions to implement
improvements. The scope of work for such study is described in Annex 4-3.
The study will be carried out by CMPDI and local consultants and it will be
completed before June 30, 1985. CIL has also agreed to exchange views with
the Bank on the findings of the study before implementing the recommendations
arising from the study.

2.   Operations
4.08     During 1982/83 CIL produced 114.8 million tons of coal, of which 87.8
million tons were thermal coal (77%), and the balance, 27.0 million tons
(23%), coking coals. The contribution of each subsidiary to CIL production
was shown overleaf.

4.09     Underground mining accounted for 53% of CIL production in 1982/83.
CIL is undertaking a program to rationalize its underground production,
basically aimed at reorganizing several small mines into larger units and
introducing mechanization both in coal extraction and transportation. This
program is a sound strategy which is expected to contribute to reducing unit
production cost as well as providing some increases in production. At
present, 17 reorganization/mechanization projects are at different stages of
implementation, and some other 20 projects under preparation. These would
imply both the mechanization of the room and pillar method and the use of
long-wall technology. It is expected that the share of underground production
that will come from mechanized mines will increase from about 5% to 35%, when
these mechanization projects are implemented, by the early 1990s.
4.10     Open pit mining accounted for 47% of CIL production during 1982/83.
In open pit mines, operating efficiency of major equipment is below
international standards, particularly with respect to dump trucks. The
reasons for this low efficiency appear to be inadequate field supervision, and
poor service scheduling in relation to shift schedules. Other areas for
improvement are blasting techniques, haul road construction and maintenance,
truck dispatching, preventive maintenance routines and equipment general
overhaul schedules. In order to improve the operational efficiency of open
pit mines, CIL has agreed to retain technical assistance to undertake several
studies of its operational practices, with the aim of defining specific
measures to address the issues outlined above. It has been agreed with CCL
that this technical assistance will be financed with the proposed loan. The
terms of reference have been agreed following the scope of work for this
technical assistance presented in Annex 4-4. The overall coordination will be
the responsibility of CMPDI, under the direction of a steering committee.
About 48 man-months of foreign consultants will be retained according to
procedures acceptable to the Bank, to address the operational practices and
maintenance of mining equipment. Additionally local consultants will be
retained to assist in organizational aspects and railroad construction. The
studies will be completed before June 30, 1985.

4.11     Coal beneficiation operations of CIL, include twelve washeries, 1/
eleven of which process coking coals for the steel industry, reducing the ash
content from an average of 29% to about 20%. About 14.5 million tons of
run-of-mine (ROM) coking coals are beneficiated annually in these washeries,
yielding 9.0 million tons of clean coal.
4.12     In 1981/82, CIL provided employment to 631,000 personnel.  The
composition of the staff is as follows:
CIL - Staffing 1981/82

4.13     CIL directly operates seven training centers specialized in
management, open pit and underground technologies and coal beneficiation.  In
addition, the subsidiary companies operate sixteen training centers covering
managerial, technical and vocational training activities. During 1981/82, the
training program in these centers comprised about 4,500 courses given to
96,700 participants, of which about 85% were workers, and the rest managerial
and supervisory staff.

4.15     Up to 1980/81, CIL had been in a loss situation, which derived from
the low level of coal prices (para. 3.17), an emphasis on increasing coal
production without due regard to cost effectiveness and high production costs
for BCCL and ECL due to difficult mining conditions in Bihar and West Bengal
(Annex 4-2). In the five-years from 1976/77 to 1980/81, the Government had to
provide Rs 4.6 billion as non-plan support to cover cash deficiencies
originated by this situation. Following the improvement of CIL's financial
position in 1981/82, the Government agreed for these non-plan loans to be
repaid over seven years starting in 1984/85 with interest payments waived.
During the last two years, CIL's financial position has improved considerably
following the February 1981 and May 1982 price increases. The internal cash
generation has recovered to acceptable levels, showing a long-term debt
service coverage ratio of 1.4 in both years. Also, new equity contributions,
as part of the financing of the expansion program, have improved the long-term
debt to equity ratio to acceptable levels.
4.16     The accounts of CIL, as well as its subsidiaries, are audited
annually by statutory auditors (a partnership of independent chartered
accountants) appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India. These arrangements are
satisfactory. Statutory auditors are appointed for a period of three years at
the end of which they must be changed. At the completion of their audit, the
statutory auditors express their opinion on the fairness of the financial
statements, which is included in the Company's annual report. The auditing
standards and procedures followed are those laid down by the Indian Institute
of Chartered Accountants. An additional audit is conducted by the Audit Board
of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. This is both a



- 24 -
financial and a management audit and the comments of the Audit Board are also
published with the financial statements of CIL.
4.   Development Strategy and Investment Plan
4.17     As discussed earlier (para. 3.06), CIL's coal production is expected
to increase from 115 million tpy in 1982/83, to 193 million tpy by the end of
the Seventh Plan (1989/90), representing an average annual growth rate of
7.6%. In order to achieve this substantial expansion of production, CIL has
adopted the strategy of basing the expansion program on opening and expanding
some 35 open pit mines, which are planned to add about 60 million tons to its
productive capacity by 1989/90. The remainder (about 18 million tons) would
be covered by the expansion (including reconstruction and mechanization) of
its underground mining capacity, and production increases from existing
mines. Details on the main projects under formulation and implementation in
CIL's investment program, together with their expected contribution to total
production by 1989/90 is presented in Annex 4-6.  The contribution of open pit
mines to CIL's production would increase therefore from 53.7 million tpy at
present (47%) to about 107 million tpy by 1989/90 (55%).
4.18     Basing the expansion program on open pit mines provides a sound
strategy for a rapid expansion of the sector. Firstly, the time required for
bringing new open pit mines into production is considerably shorter than for
underground mines. Secondly, open pit mines can be designed with much larger
capacities than underground mines -- most of the open pit mines in the
expansion have final capacities in the 2-10 million tpy range. Because of the
resultant economies of scale, large open pit mines, although capital
intensive, have substantially lower production costs than new underground
mines, leading to higher rates of return. For underground projects included
in the investment plan the aim is to increase total output and reduce
production costs by reconstructing and reorganizing small mines into larger
units and introducing mechanized methods for coal extraction and
transportation.
4.19     Project selection is basically sound.  As soon as geological
information becomes available from the exploration efforts, preliminary
development plans for specific mines are drawn and basic project parameters
are estimated to assess the technical and economical viability. After this, a
decision of whether to pursue projects any further is made, first at the
subsidiary level and then at CIL's Technical Committee. This process of
project selection has led to the implementation of projects in an adequate
sequence. An analysis of the capital and operating costs of projects in CIL's
investment program (Annex 4-6) indicates that CIL's sequence of mines
preparation and development has generally followed the least-cost solution in
terms of the economic cost of production.
4.20     The total investment during the period 1983/84 to 1989/90, associated
with the expansion plan and for replacement of existing assets, has been
estimated by CIL at Rs 96 billion (US$9.9 billion) in 1982/83 terms. This
investment program is a major undertaking by any standards and will only be
achieveable if (i) CIL is able to continue making satisfactory progress in
improving its management practices, especially regarding open-pit operations
(para. 4.10) and project management (para. 5.19-5.20); and (ii) CIL can obtain
the necessary financing. The Government is planning to finance these
investments with 50% in the form of long-term debt from GOI to CIL (15 years
maturity, 12.75% interest rate), and the balance with equity contributions and



- 25 -
internally generated resources. Based on the analysis of GOI's coal pricing
policy and its implications for resource mobilization (para. 3.27) it is
expected that internally generated funds would increase from about 20% of the
investment program at present to 46% in 1989/90 (para. 3.28). Thus, providing
the GOI's pricing policy is implemented in a timely fashion, CIL's investment
requirements should not be an undue drain on central Government finance.
4.21     CIL's seven-year investment program includes an estimated foreign
exchange requirement of about Rs 18 billion (US$1.9 billion) which are
required mainly for large-scale open pit mining equipment and mechanized
underground mining equipment that are not available from domestic manufaturers
in India. Since CIL does not generate any foreign exchange, the foreign
exchange required for the investment program must be obtained from other
sources. GOI's policy for foreign financing is, on the one hand, to associate
specific projects with individual financing sources on a one to one basis, for
example, Amlori has British financing, 1/ Kusmunda has Russian financing and
Dudhichua is proposed for Bank financing; and on the other hand, to group
requirements for particular types of equipment in large packages to be
financed by a single source. CIL and the GOI are discussing equipment
financing for different coal projects from several bi-lateral sources as well
as from the Bank. Since the international market for mining equipment is
presently very slack and is likely to remain so, suppliers are ready to assist
in arranging financing in order to improve their competitiveness. There are
good prospects, therefore, that such funds will be available for CIL's
investment program. To the extent that GOI is willing to make use of
available financing sources, the CIL investment program should not be a major
drain on Government foreign exchange sources.
B. Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL)
4.22     CCL is the subsidiary of CIL that is responsible for the development
and operation of the Dudhichua project. CCL has effectively been in existence
over twenty five years. CCL's origins are found in the National Coal
Development Corporation which was formed in 1956 as a public sector coal
mining company with eleven collieries and a production of 2.9 million tons per
year. Subsequently, in 1974, NCDC became the Central Division of the Coal
Mine Authority Ltd. and in 1975 was incorporated into the CIL organization
with the formation of CCL. CCL's organization is shown in Annex 4-7.
4.23     CCL's headquarters are in Ranchi, in the state of Bihar.  Today, CCL
operates 57 coal mines, four coal washeries and two coke-ovens. Most of CCL's
mines are located in Bihar in the Karanpura, Bokaro, Ramgarh and Giridih
coalfields.  In addition to its mines in Bihar, CCL is also responsible for
the development and operation of the various mines in the Singrauli coalfield
in Madhya Pradesh/Uttar Pradesh and for the operation of the Talcher coalfield
in Orissa. CCL's coalfields contain an estimated 39 billion tons of coal
resources (35% of India's total) of which about 70% are located in Bihar, 20%
in Madhya Pradesh/Uttar Pradesh and 10% in Orissa.
4.24     Since the formation of the CIL group, CCL has achieved the best
production and productivity increases of any of the CIL subsidiaries. From
1/  CIL recently signed ai65 million line of credit for Amlori open-cast mine
with a British banking consortium. GOI is the guarantor of the credit.



- 26 -
1974/75 to 1981/82 CCL's production increased by 64% and output per manshift
by 73% compared with 39% and 34% for the CIL group overall. During this
period the share of open pit mining in CCL's production increased from 67% to
76%--compared with 42% for CIL overall in 1981/82. In 1981/82, CCL produced
33.1 million tons of coal of which 22.6 million tons (68%) were thermal coals
and the balance 10.5 million tons (32%) were coking coals.
4.25     CCL has considerably lower unit production costs than the average for
CIL overall. In 1982/83 CCLts total production costs were Rs 115 per ton of
coal, which is about 23% below the average for CIL (Rs 150 per ton). CIL's
superior operating performance compared to other subsidiaries is partly
explained by CCL having easier mining conditions and a higher proportion of
open pit mine production than for the other CIL subsidiaries. However, CCL's
development has also benefited from a strong management team who have
emphasized on the one hand cost control measures in the labor intensive
underground mines and, on the other hand, rapid development of new capital
intensive open pit mines. Specifically, to control labor costs in underground
mines, CCL has closed four uneconomic mines and transferred 300 workers to
other operations, re-trained and transferred another 5,000 surplus workers
from older mines to new projects and encouraged over 3,000 female workers to
take voluntary retirement following mechanization of coal loading and
transporting arrangements. As a result from 1974/75 to 1981/82 CCL's
employment increased by only 3% (from 110,412 to 114,173) whereas production
increased by 64%.
4.26     CCL has also taken several initiatives to improve its utilization of
open pit mining equipment and, in particular, to reduce spare parts shortages
which affect maintenance especially for heavy earth moving equipment and to
expand the availability of equipment-related training courses. In order to
improve the availability of spare parts, CCL has started placing orders for
requirements up to two years ahead with a phased delivery schedule, has
encouraged major suppliers to open depots in Ranchi and Singrauli and has
developed indigenous supply sources for several thousand item of imported
spare parts partly through its own workshops and partly by assisting local,
private enterprises to set up manufacturing facilities for such items. With
regard to training, CIL has developed various courses to train open pit mining
equipment operators and maintenance staff at the Singrauli Training Institute
where a large number of operators are trained from the other subsidiaries as
well as from CCL's own workforce.
4.27     Of the various CIL subsidiaries, CCL has the most experience in open
pit mine operation and development as well as the largest open pit mine
development program. Although slippage has occurred in project timetables,
CCL has been able to avoid the long delays that have occurred for several of
the projects undertaken by BCCL and ECL especially. CCL has generally good
technical capabilities which would be enhanced by the project since CCL would
be the major beneficiary of the technical assistance program proposed in para.
4.10. CCL is considered to be well receptive to the proposed technical
assistance, and it is expected that project management and operational
improvements could thus be readily transferred to other large CCL open pit
projects and, subsequently, to the other CIL subsidiaries.
4.28     CCL has been profitable since 1979/80 and has made substantial
profits in the past two years. It is currently in a sound financial
position. Based on minehead prices, CCL was expected to make a profit of Rs



- 27 -
1.1 billion in 1982/83. However, following the introduction of the retention
prices, CCL would show a small profit for 1982/83 as shown below:

4.29     For the future, CCL is expected to almost double its production from
30.1 million tons in 1981/82 to 58 million tons in 1989/90, an annual average
growth rate of 8.5%. Based on this projection, CCL will account for 33% of
CIL's expected production growth from 1981/82 to 1989/90. Of the additional
28 million tons of CCL production, 24 million tons (i.e., 70%) would be open
pit production. By 1989/90 CCL's production would be approaching 40 million
tpy from the Bihar/Orissa coalfields and 20 million tpy from Singrauli. Given
the geographical isolation of the Singrauli coalfields a separate company may
be called for by then.
4.30     Basing the expansion on open pit mines provides a sound strategy for
CCL (as well as for the sector as discussed in para. 4.18). For CCL, this
development strategy includes the development of four open pit mines at
Singrauli namely Dudhichua, Jayant and Khadia (with an ultimate capacity of 10
million tpy each) and Amlori (with an ultimate capacity of 4 million tpy) plus
nine open pit mines in Bihar with final capacities of 1.0-2.5 million tpy
each. By 1989/90, the Singrauli mines would have reached just under 50% of
their ultimate capacity whereas the Bihar mines--which have shorter
implementation periods because they are smaller--would have achieved about 70%
of final production capacity.
4.31     As in the case of CIL overall (para 4.19) the analysis of CCL
investment program indicates that CCL's sequence of mine development is
generally following the least cost solution in terms of the economic cost of



- 28 -
production. The investment required for these mines in the period 1981/82 to
1989/90 is in the order of US$1.5 billion. While this is a large program for
a single company, by world standards, it is considered achievable providing
CCL makes adequate progress regarding its open pit operations and project
management practices (para 4.20) and providing CCL receives the necessary
finance from CIL and GOI. Furthermore, although the retention pricing system
has cut back CCL's profits compared to earlier years, CCL is nevertheless
expected to remain in a relatively healthy financial position and to
re-establish good profits during the rest of the decade. Financial
projections for CCL are discussed in para. 7.14.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
5.01     The strategy adopted by GOI for responding to the required increase
in thermal-power generation is to accelerate the expansion of thermal coal
production by developing large scale open pit mines (para. 4.18). This
strategy is justified because (i) it leads to lower cost options for feeding
thermal-power plants with indigenous resources; (ii) it enables the rapid
expansion of electricity supplies at low cost; (iii) it allows the
diversification of technologies used in coal mining; and (iv) it increases the
productivity of operations in the coal sector.
5.02          The proposed project is an integral part of this strategy of
developing large scale open pit mines to feed thermal power plants. It forms
part of the master plan for developing the Singrauli coalfield, which is
expected to produce about 40 million tpy of thermal coal in the mid 1990s,
from nine open pit mines, representing about 25% of CIL's production of
thermal coal by that time. About 80% of Singrauli's output has been allocated
to the power sector. In particular, the initial project output has been
earmarked for the consumption of three power plants in western India:
Trombay, Kota and Wanakbori (Map 17252).
B. Project Description
1.   Location
5.03     The Singrauli coalfield is located about 500 km west of Calcutta.
There is a master plan for development which divides the coalfield into 11
blocks (Map 25057). The interstate boundary between Madhya Pradesh and Uttar
Pradesh passes through the Dudhichua mining block which constitutes the
project area. A new railway branch line connecting the new Jayant mine,
immediately west of Dudhichua, with the Eastern Railway's network runs
adjacent to the Dudhichua block which is also accessible by roads both from
the south and the north. From the plains in the southwest a steep escarpment
rises about 70 m, forming a plateau at an average elevation of about 390
meters above sea level. The topography of the part of the plateau which
constitutes the proposed mining area is gently undulating with elevations
varying from 375 meters to 400 meters above sea level with one hill reaching
450 m. The area is drained in the rainy season mainly by the south flowing
Balia river.



- 29 -
5.04     The climate of the area is tropical with dry and severe summer months
(March-June) with temperatures varying from 210C to 480C (700 to 1180
F). In the winter (November-February) the temperature can be as low as 40C
(390F). The average annual precipitation is about 1000 mm out of which 95%
falls in the rainy season (June-September).
2.   Reserves
5.05     Exploration in the Singrauli area began in 1958 when the GSI carried
out regional drilling. This was followed by additional drilling undertaken by
Indian Bureau of Mines and GSI and a comprehensive investigation by CMPDI in
1975/76. In total, 142 bore holes totalling about 14,000 meters have been
drilled in the Dudhichua block achieving a bore hole density of 16 holes per
sq. km. which is adequate for coal reserve estimation. Three coal seams have
been identified and will be mined under the proposed Project. Mineable
reserves 1/ for the three seams are summarized below:
Dudhichua - Mineable Reserves
Average                Mineable
Thickness               Reserves
Seam                (m)               (Million tons)
Turra                   20                      202.7
Purewa Bottom           12                       91.4
Purewa Top               9                       50.9
Total                                      345.0
The Turra seam is outcropping in the escarpment and will yield coal during box
cut preparation. The seams are dipping about 2-3 north, the combined ash
content varies from 26 to 37%, moisture is about 7% and the sulphur content is
less than 0.6%. The coal is classified as grade E coal with an average useful
calorific value of 3,400 kcal/kg.
3.   Mining
5.06     The proposed open pit will in its final stage cover an area of about
8.7 sq.km. with a maximum depth of 235 m and an overall stripping ratio 1:3.29
t/m3. Due consideration in pit planning has been given to the one major
fault that affects the mining area which is otherwise tectonically
undisturbed. Mine planning has been done in sufficient details and the
selection of the main mining equipment for overburden removal and coal mining
is basically sound. The mining plan calls for a production level of 5 million
tpy (Stage I) in year 11 and of 10 million tpy (its final capacity) in year
16. The deposit will be opened up from southwest with the box cut in the
center of the mining block. The long development period is due to the
topography (in the box cut location) which necessitates substantial overburden
removal during initial years of mining. During Stage I, the overburden
consisting mainly of sandstones (90%) and some shales (10%) will be drilled by
four electric large-hole rotary drill rigs, blasted (ammonium nitrate based
explosives provided from a central facility which also supplies other mines in
I/ In situ proven reserves less mining losses.



- 30 -
the Singrauli coalfield) and removed by two draglines, 31 m3 and 24 m3
bucket respectively, assisted by seven 10 m3 electric rope shovels and a
fleet of sixty-two 85 ton off-the-highway trucks. Coal, after blasting, will
be loaded by three 8 m3 hydraulic shovels and hauled by eighteen 46 ton coal
haulers to a crusher station (primary and secondary) just outside the pit.
Belt conveyors connect the crusher station with the coal handling plant which
has sufficient capacity to receive, store, reclaim and transport 5 million tpy
of crushed coal to a train loading station located at a new railway spur (Map
25055). The train loading station will be similar to the one presently being
operated at the adjacent Jayant mine which has a capacity of 5,500 tons of
coal per hour and is of proven design. Each train set will consist of two
locos and 44 coal cars of 55-ton capacity each. Permanent haulroads will be
paved. Mine development work and in-pit road maintenance will be performed by
a fleet of track dozers, road graders and wheel loaders. Agreement has been
reached that CCL will complete a study on optimizing the size and efficiency
of the dump to be used in Dudhichua mine and early procurement of 85-ton
trucks is limited to 35. CCL will exchange views with the Bank on the
findings of the said study prior to ordering any additional trucks.
5.07     The main sump and associated pump installations for pit drainage will
always be constructed ahead of the initial box cut and in-pit haulage road
construction and bench preparation in order to ensure proper drainage. The
estimate of required pump capacity is based on rain statistics and experience
of ground water occurrences in other operating mines in the Singrauli
coalfield. Overall final pit slope angle is estimated at 450 assuming a
safety factor of 2, which is reasonable.
5.08     The mine and other industrial facilities will work 300 days a year, 3
shifts per day and 8 hours per shift. The total manpower requirement at a
production level of 5 million tpy is then 2,340. Workers constitute 70%
(1,643) of the total force and a breakdown of required skill level is shown in
the table below:
Dudhichua - Worker Skill Level
Category               Number             % of Total
Unskilled                  61                 3.7
Semi-skilled              678                41.3
Skilled                   468                28.5
Highly skilled            436                26.5
Total              1,643                100.0
Training has already started in the General Excavation T-raining Institute in
Singrauli. A satisfactory training plan has been prepared which calls for
training of 304 persons annually providing a total of 1,824 man-months (50% of
the time in class and 50% on-the-job training). Agreement has been reached
that CCL will furnish to the Bank, on January 1 of each year commencing
January 1, 1985, an annual training report for the project addressing inter
alia the past year's results compared with the planned target, and forecast
enrollment for the coming year and measures to be taken to rectify any
unsatisfactory performance.



- 31 -
4.   Infrastructure
5.09     Adequate maintenance, warehouse and service facilities will be
constructed south of the mine and adjacent to the existing railway (Map
25055). One of two planned central workshops for the Singrauli coalfields is
being constructed only about 5 km from Dudhichua main workshop which will
greatly facilitate components and equipment overhauls. The project will
require about 3,000 m3/day of industrial water and about 1,100 m3/day
potable water which will be supplied by the integrated water supply system for
the Singrauli coalfield which is drawing raw water from the nearby Rihand
reservoir. The peak electrical demand is estimated to be 15 MW and the annual
energy requirement of about 50 million Kwh. The power will be provided by the
Electricity Boards of the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
Permission has been granted by the two state governments to utilize power from
one source in the other state and vice versa for the purpose of the project.
This arrangement as well as the availability of power in the area is
satisfactory.
5.10     In line with CIL policy guiding provision of housing and service
facilities for the work force, a total of about 1,600 dwellings and associated
service facilities, e.g., primary and high schools, hospital, community center
will be constructed in a new 200 acre large residential area west of the
existing Jayant township (Map 25055). All land required for the project,
industrial sites and township, in total about 7,900 acres has been acquired,
and is available. CCL has agreed to provide the Bank, not later than
September 30, 1984, with a schedule for the provision of these housing and
welfare facilities.
5.   Consumers and Transportation
5.11     The nine mines under development or planned at Singrauli are linked
to sixteen thermal power projects with an estimated coal requirement of 27.8
million tons by FY1989. As shown below, at full production, the first stage
of the Dudhichua project will supply 95% of the coal requirements of three
projects in western India namely Wanakbori (6x210 MW in Gujarat), Kota (2xllO
KW in Rajasthan) and Trombay Extension (lx500 MW in Maharashtra). This latter
plant which is being financed with Bank assistance (Loan 1549-IN) has a
capability for being fired with gas. In view of the substantial gas
discoveries offshore Bombay in the past two to three years, the possibility
cannot be excluded that at some future time it may be appropriate to switch
this plant to gas firing. This is not considered as a major problem since it
would only affect 20% of the Dudhichua output which could be re-allocated to
other users without difficulty or economic cost. All these power plants are
well under construction and will be commissioned in advance of the development
of Dudhichua.
5.12     The three power plants are located at long distances from the project
area: Kota - 827 km, Wanakbori - 1,186 km and Trombay - 1,324 km. As
discussed earlier (para. 3.12), the linkages of coalfields and mines to main
consumers are established seeking to minimize the transportation involved and
the overall situation is acceptable. In particular, the linkage of
Dudhichua's output to the power plants indicated above provides, at least
during the 1980s, the best option to supply the coal necessary to meet the
additional demand of these power plants. There are no existing mines or new
projects with the potential to provide a timely coal supply. However, CIL is



- 32 -
intensifying exploration and project preparation activities in coalfields in
Maharashtra and southwestern Madhya Pradesh, which are better located to
supply western India. If viable projects are defined in this region, or if
Trombay is switched to gas, part or all of the linkage of Dudhichua would need
to be reexamined, and the Project's output eventually reassigned. Agreement
has been reached that GOI shall continue to review at appropriate intervals
the linkages from major coalfields to main consumers, including those of
Dudhichua, and take all actions necessary to ensure optimal allocation.
5.13     The linkage to the three power plants creates a major requirement for
railway carrying capacity. Analysis of the railway routes for this coal
traffic has identified several potential bottlenecks that will require
improvement. Steps have been taken by Indian Railways (IR) to improve railway
capacity on the various routes in question by adding track sections in
critical areas, by completing electrification of certain links in the mid
section of the country and by improvements in motor power and equipment
reliability (Annex 5-1). Some of these capacity improvement measures are
included in the proposed Railway Electrification Project now under
consideration by IR and the Bank Group.
5.14     One bottleneck which requires special attention is a severe grade
(ghat) which exists between Bombay and Kasara where delays in the downward
direction (towards Bombay) occur due to inefficient brake systems. This
problem was recognized at the time of the Third Trombay Power Project (Loan
IN-1549) when the Government guaranteed to take, or cause to be taken, all
such action as necessary to ensure the availability of rail transport
facilities for up to two million tons of coal each year to serve that
project. Further measures have been taken to overcome the rail capacity
problem and provide for a more effective coal movement on the gradient
section, including the utilization of improved brake systems. Additionally,
re-routing of the coal traffic is also possible to by-pass the ghat, although
this would lengthen the journey from Dudhichua. Agreement has been reached
that GOI will take all actions necessary to provide adequate railway
facilities for timely transporting the Dudhichua output to the designated
consumers.
6.   Environment
5.15     The planning of environmental protection measures to be undertaken is
vested in CMPDI and guided mainly by the Water (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act of 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act
of 1981. Both acts prescribe measures and tolerance limits that are in line
with acceptable standards in the industry. Environmental management is the
responsibility of CIL through its subsidiaries. In general, pollution
problems are not expected to be severe. CIL and CCL will ensure that the
design, construction and operation of the project is carried out with due
regard to ecological and environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank.
5.16     The land which will be affected by the mining activities is
characterized as forest land although very arid. Only very small quantities
of topsoil are present and soil conservation will be done whenever feasible.
Erosion control and prevention measures, such as placing of rip rap, turfing
and revegetation will be undertaken on waste dumps and exposed slopes. This
will also assist in reducing surface water run off. These measures will be
done in consultation with the Soil Conservation Department and the Forest



- 33 -
Department of the State Government as well as the Environmental Research
Institute of Forest Research Station in Dehadrun.
5.17     With regard to surface run off water from the open pit, solid
retention dams will be built and relocated as the mining progresses. Water
quality will regularly be monitored. Dust is the only air pollution hazard,
and will be controlled by adequate measures. Haulroads will be periodically
watered by special trucks. In other dust generating areas, e.g., crushers,
receiving hoppers, transfer points, ground bunker, coal piles and trainloading
station appropriate dust suppression and/or dust extraction equipment will be
installed. Air quality will be monitored on a weekly basis.
C.  Project Execution and Implementation
5.18     The project will be implemented by CCL under the direction of a
Project General Manager reporting to the General Manager for Singrauli who has
a technical director level within CCL's organization. The project management
group is comprised of staff from CCL and CMPDI, and the organization is shown
in Chart 5-1. The Project General Manager is supported by managers
responsible for (i) mining and general engineering; (ii) cost and scheduling
control; (iii) administration; and, (iv) a deputy project manager, directly
responsible for project implementation. The total organization comprises 150
staff which is fully staffed and mobilized. The Project General Manager has
been appointed and is considered adequately qualified and experienced.
Agreement has been reached that CCL will ensure that the organizational
structure, staffing, powers and responsibilities of the Project Management
Unit shall be such as necessary for timely and efficient implementation of the
project.
5.19     Although the CIL group has experience in implementation of large open
pit mines (particularly through CCL in the Singrauli basin) some strengthening
is required in procedures for project monitoring and control. To this effect,
CCL will prepare, by June 30, 1984, a project implementation manual (Annex
5-2) and exchange views with the Bank on the said manual before it is adopted
by September 30, 1984.
5.20     The project management group will be directly responsible for all
activities related to detailed engineering, procurement of local goods
(excluding mining equipment) and services, equipment erection and
commissioning, construction and mine development. Procurement of mining
equipment and other imported items will be carried out by the CIL central
procurement organization, in direct collaboration with the Project General
Manager with progress reports provided to the CCL Technical Director and to
the CIL Project Monitoring Unit. CCL has past experience with similar mining
methods and equipment. CCL has a generally good record of project
implementation and the organization of the project management function has not
been a cause of delays in project implementation. Some slippage in project
timetables has, however, occurred due to bureaucratic delays regarding import
approvals and foreign exchange allocations and to other external factors
beyond CCL's control. In order to minimize the impact of such external
factors, blanket waivers have been granted for using ICB procedures for all
Bank-financed items.
5.21     The implementation schedule for the project is given in Chart 5-2.
This has been based on a detailed analysis of interrelationship of different

activities and is found to be realistic. Acquisition of the first dragline
and hydraulic shovel, trucks and dumper are on the project's critical path. A
detailed and satisfactory schedule for immediate procurement actions has been
prepared and procurement documents have been reviewed by the Bank.
5.22     Overburden removal started in 1982 with temporarily assigned
equipment. Access roads, temporary residential buildings, maintenance
facilities and office/service buildings have been constructed. Sufficient
electrical power for construction as well as water are available at the site.
5.23     Based on the schedule for deployment of mining equipment, the project
is expected to reach the initial capacity of 5 million tpy in 1993/94 and its
final capacity of 10 million tpy in 1998/99. The production build-up
(learning curve) shown in the table below is considered achievable considering
that mining conditions are generally favorable and that CCL has past
experience with similar mining methods and equipment.

5.24     Due to the topography in the box-cut area about 9 million m3 of
overburden will have to be removed before the first coal can be released in
1987/88. Coal production then gradually increases as the seams become
accessible and additional coal mining equipment is deployed. The increase in
overburden removal in 1990/91 is associated with the first dragline coming
into full production. Further increases in overburden removal in 1995/96 and
1996/97 are required to prepare for the increase in coal production to meet
the Stage II coal production level of 10 mtpy by 1998/99. Although the
stripping is high in initial years of operation, the overall ratio for the
deposit is 1:3.29 t/m3 (para. 5.06) which is considered favourable.

VI.  CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost Estimate
6.01     The total financing requirements of the first stage (5 million tpy)
of the Dudhichua project, including physical contingencies, price escalation,
working capital and interest during construction are estimated at US$373
million (Rs 3,640 million), of which about US$128 million is in foreign
exchange. The additional base cost required to complete the project (10
million tpy production) is estimated at US$234 million 1/ which represents 90%
of the base cost of the first stage (US$259 million). The detailed capital
cost breakdown for the first stage is given in Annex 6-1 and summarized below.

6.02     The Project's capital cost estimates were prepared by CMPDI and
are based on cost information related to recent orders for similar
equipment and actual cost data for on-going projects and are found to be
satisfactory. The original estimate as of February 1982 was updated
subsequently in October 1982 and November 1983. The cost for outside
technical assistance for operational aspects in open pit mines, including
fees, travel and subsistence expenses, has been estimated on the basis of
an average rate of US$14,000 per man-month, with an estimated 48
man-months required (para. 4.10). The accuracy of the cost estimates at
this stage is considered relatively high, particularly given the degree of
design and specifications for mining equipment. For this reason, a
provision for physical contingencies of 5% over the base costs is provided
for mining equipment and 10% for other cost items. Price escalation has
been based on the phasing of expenditure consistent with the time schedule
for implementing the project and projected local and foreign escalation.
Local inflation rates have been projected at 7% for 1983/84 to 1985/86 and
6% thereafter. Foreign inflation rates have been estimated at 8% for
1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% thereafter.
6.03     Requirements of working capital was estimated at US$10.3 million
(Rs 100 million), using realistic assumptions on the level of current
assets and liabilities required by the project until it reaches its rated
capacity. Interest during construction has been estimated at US$10.3
million (Rs. 101 million), assuming capitalization of interest up to the
end of 1986/87 (when coal production is expected to start), and loans of
US$186.6 million (Rs. 1,820 m-llion) from GOI on terms specified in
para. 6.06.
6.04     The total capital cost for the Dudhichua first stage 5 million
tpy output, excluding price escalation, working capital and interest
during construction is about US$55 per annual ton of coal output. It has
been estimated that depending on the type of deposit, geology and
topography, new open-pit coal mines in LDC's require investment costs
ranging between US$50-80 (1982 terms) per annual ton capacity. Thus the
project compares favorably with other coal mine developments in LDCs.
B. Financing Plan
6.05     The financing plan for the Dudhichua project is summarized as
follows:
India - Dudhichua Coal Project
Financing Plan
US$ Million        %
A. Equity
1.  Government of India                            141.9          38.0
2.  CIL Cash Generation                             44.8          12.0
Total Equity                                   186.7          50.0
B. Long Term Debt
1.  IBRD                                           151.0          40.0
2.  Government of India                             35.6          10.0
Total Debt                                     186.6          50.0
Total Financing                               373.3          100.0



- 39 -
6.06     According to current Government practice, overall financing of
project costs (including interest during construction, but excluding
working capital) is generally provided in the ratio of 50% debt and 50%
equity. Under this formula, the proposed Bank loan of US$151.0 million
would supply about 40% of the financing to be provided for the Dudhichua
project, with another US$35.6 million coming from the Government, in the
form of long term debt. Given the GOI's policy of linking specific
projects to individual financing sources (para. 4.21), it is expected that
there will not be any co-financing for the Dudhichua project per se. With
respect to equity contributions the financial projections of CIL (para.
7.10) indicate that the Company should be able to generate funds to
finance about 24% of the equity contributions required by its investment
program up to 1989/90 and this same proportion has been applied to the
Dudhichua project. Thus, CIL would provide about US$45 million equity out
of its internally generated funds and the balance of about US$142 million
would come from Government funds. However, because of the Government's
control on coal pricing and its incidence on internal generation of funds,
as indicated in para. 3.29, agreement has been reached with GOI on
maintaining coal prices at levels which ensure CIL's financial viability
and adequate resource mobilization for the sector.
6.07     It is recommended that the proposed Bank loan of US$140.3 million
equivalent be made to GOI at the standard Bank interest rate for 20 years,
including five years of grace. GOI's practice is to make loans to CIL for
15 years, at an interest rate currently of 12.75% 1/ per year and not to
grant grace periods. Considering the project's requirements in terms of
its long implementation period and associated cash flow, it is desirable
that a normal grace period be applied in this case, as has been the
practice in other loans to the energy and industrial sectors. It has been
agreed that GOI on-lend the funds for a period of fifteen years including
a grace period of five years at current interest rate mentioned above.
Additionally, in line with present policy, GOI would assume the foreign
exchange risk on the on-lent funds. The conclusion of a satisfactory
subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and CIL and a satisfactory financial
arrangement between CIL and CCL are conditions of effectiveness.
6.08     The Government has agreed to provide the debt and equity
requirements indicated above and whatever additional debt and equity funds
which might be needed (in both local and foreign currency) to complete the
Dudhichua project promptly.
1/ This interest rate has recently been adjusted to 13% per year; there
is a 0.25% per year reduction in interest rate for timely payments.

C. Procurement and Disbursement
6.09     Equipment and erection services financed by the Bank will be
procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank guidelines and consist mainly of a dragline, shovels, trucks, dozers,
rotary drill rigs and a coal handling plant. These goods are grouped in
27 bidding packages (averaging US$5.2 million each). Qualifying domestic
suppliers/manufacturers would be afforded a preference in bid evaluation
of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower. The list of goods to be
financed by the Bank is shown in Annex 6-2. Specifications are being
prepared for items on the project critical path by CMPDI in consultation
with CCL, and a procurement schedule is shown in Annex 6-3.
6.10     As this would be the first project undertaken by CIL with Bank
financing, all packages for goods over US$5.0 million equivalent as well
as the first ten packages to be procured will be subject to the Bank's
prior review of procurement documentation, resulting in a coverage of
about 87% of the total estimated value of goods contracts to be procured.
The balance of contracts would be subject to post review by the Bank
after contract award.
6.11     The Bank loan of US$151.0 million will finance goods and services
as shown in table below.

It is expected that for those items to be financed by the Bank, about
US$59 million (or 40% of the Bank loan) will be for contracts awarded to
local suppliers following ICB.
6.12     Disbursement profile (Annex 6-4) is in line with the historical
country industrial sector profiles as well as the historical mining sector
profile. Stage I of the Dudhichua coal project is expected to be
completed in 1993/94. The Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by
March 1991, when all Bank financed items would have been physically
delivered or completed.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01     While the Dudhichua coal project qualifies as a large scale coal
mine by international standards, it represents a relatively small fraction
of CIL operations both in terms of investment and production. Total
project costs are estimated at about Rs 2.9 billion in 1983/84 terms,
representing less than 2% of CIL's estimate of its total investment
program during the period of 1981/82 to 1992/93. With regard to coal
production, when the project reaches the rated capacity of its first stage
in 1993/94 (5 million tpy), it would represent only about 2.2% of CIL's
total planned production for that year, and 3.6% of CIL's coal production
from open pit mines. Even at the level of CCL, the subsidiary responsible
for implementing and operating the project, Dudhichua does not represent a
very significant proportion of its activities. In terms of investment,
the project represents about 6% of CCL's total estimated investment during
the project implementation period. With respect to production, by 1993/94
Dudhichua would account for 7.1% and 8.3% of CCL's total and open pit coal
production respectively.

7.02     CIL investment outlook and financial prospects are discussed
below in the context of basic assumptions required for preparing the
financial projections for the Company. These refer to production forecast
and related investment program, structure of production costs and coal
prices. Other specific assumptions are described in Annex 7-1
7.03     As discussed earlier (paras. 3.06 and 4.17), coal production is
expected to increase from 110 million tpy in FY1981 to 193 million tpy in
FY1989, an increase of 83 million tons in eight years representing an
average annual growth rate of 7.3%. As noted in para. 3.06, the original
CIL estimate for 1989/90 of 200 million tons has been adjusted downwards,
following a detailed review of about 80 projects included in the Company's
investment program for the rest of this decade. The following table shows
the adjusted production forecast for open pit and underground mines.

1987/88               88.0            82.0        170.0
1988/89               99.0            83.0        182.0
1989/90              107.0            86.0        193.0
7.04     The expansion of coal production is backed-up by an investment
program, whose structure and financing has been discussed earlier in paras.
4.17-4.21. CIL's total investment included in the Sixth Five-Year Plan
(1980/81 to 1984/85) has been recently re-assessed at about Rs. 37 billion
(US$3.8 billion) in 1982/83 terms, which represents 2.4% of GOI's total
investment included in the Sixth Plan. About Rs 18 billion (49%) have already
been invested during the first three years of the plan, and a further 23% has
been committed for the current fiscal year, giving a reasonably high degree of
confidence that investments under the Sixth Plan would basically materialize
and that the financing required will be available. Financing to CIL has been
provided entirely by GOI in the form of long-term debt and equity (para. 4.20)
from GOI's general budgetary allocations for capital expenditures.
7.05     Total coal sector investment during the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1985/86 to 1989/90) has been preliminarily estimated at Rs 69 billion (US$7.1
billion) in 1982/83 terms. About 70% of this amount would be for the
expansion of CIL's coal mining capacity and is in line with the projected
production indicated above. The balance would be used for investments in new
washeries, exploration and infrastructure requirements. It can be noted that
the estimated investment during the Seventh Plan is 85% higher, in real terms,
than the corresponding amount for the Sixth Plan. As noted earlier
(para. 4.20), this investment program is a major undertaking whose success is
heavily dependent on CIL's ability to continue to improve its managerial
capability and on GOI providing the necessary financing.
7.06     In the past GOI's practice has been to finance CIL's investments with
equity contributions and long-term debt, with each covering 50% of the
required investments. It is expected that GOI will continue to finance 50% of
investments through long-term debt, and the balance would be partly provided
by CIL from its internal resources (about 12%) and partly from equity
contributions. CIL's generation of internal resources has been estimated
based on average coal prices for CIL increasing by 5.8% in real terms over the
next 6 years, in line with the discussion on coal prices in Chapter III (paras
3.19 and 3.27). At the same time, it is expected that the resource
mobilization in the sector would continue to improve with total resources
generated by CIL increasing from 45% of the annual investment at present to
69% by 1989/90.



- 43 -
7.07     CILs average production costs, on a per ton basis, are expected to
increase from the present level of Rs 150 per ton (US$15.4) to Rs 160 per ton
(US$16.4) in real terms by 1989/90 as shown in the table below.

Total Production Costs        149.6        100.0          160.1    100.0
In addition to this rnarginal increase in unit production costs, a major
change is envisaged in the cost structure, which is due to the shift in
production from underground to open pit mines and to the capital intensive
nature of the investment program. This explains the reduction in the
contribution of salaries and wages, which is more than offset by the
increase in depreciation and interest charges.
7.08     CIL's operating costs compare favorably with those of major
producing countries, even when the comparison is made on the basis of tons
of coal equivalent (tce) 1/ which penalizes the cost of Indian coals
because of their relatively lower calorific value. This comparison has
been made on the basis of operating costs i.e., excluding depreciation and
interest charges, since these concepts normally show wide variations for
different producers depending on specific company policies and practices
and the tax legislation of the various countries. The following table
compares average operating costs per tce for producers in selected
countries.

It can be noted that CIL average operating costs per tce (at mine-head)
are lower than the average for producers in USA and Australia. Basically
the lower labor productivity in CIL mines is more than offset by the
relatively lower level of wages. South African producers have, on
average, lower operating costs due primarily to a lower cost of labor
reflecting a higher labor productivity.
7.09     The average coal price for CIL in 1982/83 and for the first nine
months of 1983/84 was 150.5 Rs/ton. For the last three months of 1983/84
a price of 183.0 Rs/ton is effective based on the last price increase of
January 1984. For subsequent years, the average coal price for CIL has
been projected assuming that it will be gradually increased in real terms
so that, in any year, at least the full cost of production (including
depreciation and interest charges) would be covered, and by 1989/90, CIL
would earn a 10% return on net worth 1/, providing certain production,
labor productivity and unit operating cost standards are achieved. As
discussed earlier (para. 3.27) the average coal price for FY1989
calculated using these criteria is in line with an estimate of the
long-run marginal cost of production, based on an incremental analysis for
the expansion program. The average coal price in current terms is
projected as follows:
CIL - Projected Average Coal Price
(Rs/ton - Current terms)
Fiscal Year    Average Price
1984/85           183.0
1985/86           197.2
1986/87           211.7
1987/88           227.1
1988/89           243.7
1989/90           261.4
7.10     Based on these main assumptions, CIL financial projections have
been prepared which are shown in Annex 7-2. The key financial data are
summarized below:
1/   Net worth has been defined in the Indian context as average net fixed
assets (excluding work-in-progress) plus working capital less
long-term liabilities, excluding those allocated to work-in-progress.

7.11     The recent price increase effective as of January 8, 1984 came too
late in the fiscal year for CIL and CCL to be profitable.  As shown in the
table above (and for CCL in para 7.14) both are expected to show losses in
1983/84. This reinforces the importance of periodic and timely revision of
coal prices. Such price increases together with the continuous provision of
financing and CIL's successful implementation of the investment program are
critical to further improve the financial position of the CIL group. As noted
earlier (para 3.20) GOI has indicated that the next price review will take
place in March 1985.
7.12     As additional production comes on stream, the ratio of net income to
revenues for CIL is expected to increase from 0.6% to about 5% by 1989-90.
The current ratio, which is presently relatively high (1.4) mainly due to
large coal inventories (10 weeks), is expected to improve further because of
changes in the regulations for releasing the sales taxes collected on behalf
of the Government. The long-term debt to equity ratio, currently at 58:42, is
expected to improve to a more conservative level of 48:52 in 1987/88 and
stabilize at that level. This improvement is explained by a decrease in
accumulated losses, as well as the financing plan for the investment program.
Debt service coverage is broadly satisfactory throughout the period. Although
the financial position of CIL deteriorated somewhat during 1983/84 due to the
reasons mentioned above, a recovery is projected starting 1984/85 and the
long-term debt service coverage is not expected to fall below 1.2 after that
fiscal year.
7.13     Agreements have been reached with GOI and CIL on financial covenants
that will ensure that the financing for the project is adequate and that CIL
will follow prudent financial practices and maintain a satisfactory financial
position. Agreements on the project's financing plan are discussed in paras.
6.06 to 6.08. Regarding the financial position of CIL, it has been agreed
that CIL will on a consolidated basis: (i) maintain a long-term debt to
equity ratio not greater than 60:40; (ii) maintain at all times a current



- 46 -
ratio of at least 1.2; and (iii) that it will take all actions necessary to
ensure a debt service coverage of at least 1.3. Additionally, CIL will be
requested to have its accounts audited, by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, and to submit certified copies of its consolidated financial
statements (together with the auditor's report) as soon as available, but in
any case not later than 9 months after the end of each fiscal year.

7.14     CCL's projected financial position is summarized below.  These
projections have been prepared on the general basis discussed in Annex 7-1,
and incorporating the recently implemented system of retention prices for CIL
subsidiaries (para 3.22). Detailed financial projections for CCL are given in
Annex 7-3.

7.15     CCL is basically in a sound financial position although some losses
are anticipated in 1983/84 due to the delay in the price increase (para
7.11). In prior years CCL had been generating an adequate level of profits,
mainly due to production costs being some 23% lower than the average for CIL,
and with similar average coal prices. For future years CCL is expected to be
in a sound financial position. However, since in the case of CCL the new
retention prices system would tend to adjust prices downwards, CCL would have
reduced control over the internal generation of resources, and only marginal
improvements in the financial position are expected. Long-term debt to equity
ratio would remain below 50:50, and long-term debt service coverage would stay
above 1.3 throughout the period.
7.16     As discussed earlier (para 4.05), given CIL powers and responsibility
for decision-making on financial and administrative matters, and because it
borrows from GOI all long-term loans for the Group, CIL has been considered as
the primary beneficiary of the proposed Bank loan.  For these reasons no
specific financial covenants are considered for CCL with the exception that
CCL will be requested to have its accounts audited, by independent auditors



- 47 -
acceptable to the Bank and to submit certified copies of its financial
statements (together with the auditor's report) as soon as available but in
any case not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year. In
addition, a contingent provision will be made that if the status of CCL and/or
of the Dudhichua Project should change in the future (para. 4.29) the same
financial covenants would apply to CCL and/or the new corporate operator of
Dudhichua.
C. Oudhichua Coal Project
7.17     The operating cost estimates for the Dudhichua project were developed
by CMPDI based on comparable cost data for CIL's open pit mines, adjusted to
reflect FY1982 price levels. The table below compares the estimated operating
costs for production levels of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 million tpy.

(Rs per ton - 1982/83 terms)

(US$/tce)           13.0        8.6       7.7
a/ Production forecast for 1990/91 is 2.8 million tpy.
The estimated operating costs (per tce) compare favorably with average
operating costs in the major producing countries. As seen earlier
(para. 7.08) average operating costs per tce in the U.S. and Australia are in
the US$20-30 range, and Dudhichua's operating costs are lower than the average
South African cost (US$11.7/tce) by about 25% for the 5 million tpy case, and
by 35% for the 10 million tpy case.
7.18     The project's operating costs (per tce) also compare well with those
of some 15 new open pit mines for which GOI's approval is currently being
sought. Operating costs for these projects range between US$6.0 and US$22.0
per tce depending primarily on the mining conditions (overburden to coal ratio
being the main parameter) and coal qualities (heating value), with only four
of these projects having lower operating costs per tce than Dudhichua. This
is also a clear indication of the cost trends that CIL would be facing in the
1990s when these and future projects come fully on stream. It is envisaged
that this situation will reverse, during the 1990s, the declining trend in
CIL's average operating costs projected for the rest of this decade.

7.19     The financial rate of return of the Dudhichua project is 10% for its
final capacity of 10 million tpy. For the initial stage of 5 million tpy the
financial return has been estimated at about 7%. The difference between both
rates is explained by the relatively long implementation period (11 years) for
the initial stage to reach its rated capacity. This is due to the
configuration of the deposit requiring considerable development work, which is
common for both stages. In fact the final capacity (10 million tpy) is
reached only three years after the development work for this stage begins.
Detailed financial cost and benefit streams and the assumptions used, together
with those of the economic analysis, are included in Annex 7-4.
7.20     The financial rates of return and sensitivity tests are summarized
below.

7.21     Of the various factors used in the sensitivity tests, coal price is
clearly the most critical, and is beyond CIL's domain of control. Prospects
of coal price increases taking place in a timely manner are discussed below
(para. 7.22). For other factors, while 10% variations cannot be excluded and
are within a possible range of fluctuations, increases in capital and
operating costs are less likely because these costs have been based on firm
estimates and also rely on CIL's experience in open pit mines in the Singrauli
area, from which operating parameters were derived. Furthermore, the
technical assistance on open pit mines operations (para. 4.10) is expected to
yield benefits which ultimately would translate into lower operating costs.
7.22     The project faces minimal technical risks since (i) a thorough
drilling program has reduced the geological risk to a minimum and reserves are
well established; and (ii) mining plans and equipment selection are based on
well known technologies presently being used in other open pit mines in the
Singrauli area. As to marketing risks, the Dudhichua mine is a captive
supplier of three power plants, and therefore only minor fluctuations can be
expected in the sales volume. With regard to coal prices, while GOI is
committed to a pricing policy, there is some risk that it may not be
implemented in a timely manner, which may affect not only the project, but the
financial position of CIL. In anticipation of this problem, extensive
discussions have taken place with GOI who has expressed its commitment to a
pricing policy to ensure the financial viability of CIL (para. 3.29).

VIII.     ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01     The project is an important step in the implementation of GOI's
objective of a rapid growth of power generation which is a cornerstone to the
future development of the Indian economy. The development program in the
power sector is largely based on thermal generation using indigenous coal.
Within this context the Dudhichua project will play an important role in
supplying about 20% of the additional coal requirements for power generation
in western India in the early 1990s. Power shortages are especially acute in
this region and the project will help to alleviate such shortages and the
associated losses in industrial output. Additional benefits will accrue from
the project including (i) the institutional development of CIL in the areas
of open pit mining, project management and budgeting and cost control; and
(ii) addressing sectoral issues related to coal transportation.
A. Least Cost Solution
8.02     Based on the demand projections in Chapter III, an incremental
thermal coal requirement of 110 million tpy is projected from FY1981 to
FY1989. Based on a regional analysis of this demand it is estimated that
about 47% (52 million tpy) would be required by consumers in the northern and
eastern states. These consumers would be supplied with incremental
production from ECL, BCCL and CCL mines in the Bengal-Bihar coalbelt. 16%
would be required by consumers in the eastern states of Madhya Pradesh and
Orissa, which would be supplied by CCL and WCL mines in those states and 15%
would be required by consumers in the southern states which would be supplied
largely by SCL mines in Andra Pradesh.  The remaining 22% (24 million tpy)
would be for consumers in the western states of Rajasthan (2 million tpy),
Gujarat (8 million tpy) and Maharashtra (14 million tpy). The most economic
sources of coal are (a) WCL coalfields in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh for
consumers in Gujarat and Maharastra and (b) the Singrauli coalfields of CCL
for consumers in Rajasthan.  But supply projections based on the present
status of exploration and project preparation indicate that the WCL mines
will at most be able to provide 16 million tpy. The balance of supplies for
consumers in Gujarat and Maharashtra (8 million tpy) would need to be
supplied by Singrauli coalfields. Singrauli would then account for about 25%
and 30% respectively of total coal consumption and power sector coal
consumption in the three western states.
8.03     Up to now, five open pit mines have been developed in the Singrauli
coalfield (Map 25057): Jhingurda, Gorbi, Bina, Jayant and Kakri. These
mines have a rated capacity of about 20 million tpy, which is expected to be
reached in the early 1990s when the implementation of some expansion plans
are completed. Feasibility studies for Dudhichua and two other mines (Khadia
and Amlori) have been prepared by CIL and presented to the Government for
approval, while the remaining three blocks (Marrak, Nigahi and Moher) are at
early stages of project preparation. Nigahi and Moher have similar
overburden to coal ratio and coal quality as Amlori, and therefore the three
projects can be expected to have a similar cost per tce. Amlori was given
priority in its development because of its more favorable location with
respect to a proposed nearby power plant. With respect to Marrak this site
has a similar coal quality as Khadia, but a higher overburden to coal ratio,
given the topography of the area, making it less attractive.



- 50 -
8.04     The Dudhichua project constitutes the least cost alternative for
gradually meeting the additional coal demand of 5 million tpy from the
Singrauli coalfield. As shown in the table below, Dudhichua has a
substantial lower marginal cost per tce when all capital and operating costs
are expressed in economic terms 1/ and the marginal cost per ton is
determined as the ratio of the net present value of the cost and production
streams discounted at the opportunity cost of capital, estimated at 12%.
Given the wide difference in the marginal cost per tce between Dudhichua and
the alternative projects no sensitivity test is warranted.

B. Economic Rate of return
8.05     The economic rate of return of the Dudhichua project has been
calculated in real terms, based on the streams given in Annex 8-1. The
return has been based on capital and operating costs used for the financial
rate of return, except for (i) exclusion of all identifiable taxes and
duties; (ii) application of a standard conversion factor of 0.80 to locally
supplied equipment and materials; (iii) application of a shadow wage rate of
0.60 for unskilled labor. In addition, project revenues have been calculated
on the basis of projected coal sales volume and domestic sales price paid by
consumers at minehead (i.e., including sales tax and levies).
8.06     As discussed earlier in Chapter III (para. 3.25), the appropriate
pricing policy for the bulk of India's thermal coal production is based on
the long run marginal cost of production. The economic price for Dudhichua's
coal (Grade E) has been assumed to be the projected sales price paid by
consumers 2/ given that for this project it was assumed that by 1989/90 the
1/ Conversion factors and other criteria used for expressing costs in
economic terms are indicated in Annex 8-1.
2/ The question may arise whether consumers would be willing to pay higher
prices or whether these prices clear the market (i.e., no scarcity and
rationing arise). Although coal supply in India has been pressed at
times to satisfy domestic demand at prevailing level of prices, due to
the structure of demand it appears reasonable to assume that at the
projected prices no scarcity will develop. In addition no attempt has
been made to estimate consumer surpluses, conferring a conservative bias
to the economic rate of return.



- 51 -
average price for CIL would be in line with the long run marginal cost (para.
3.27). This will tend to slightly underestimate the price during 1985/86 to
1988/89, but given that production will start in 1987/88 its impact on the
rate of return is minimal. After 1989/90 it has been assumed that prices
will increase at an average annual rate of 1.2%, following the general trend
of the long run marginal costs dictated by the new projects under formulation
being costlier than those presently under implementation.
8.07     The economic rate of return is 16.3% for the final capacity of 10
million tpy and the projected return remains above 14% over the reasonable
range of adverse assumptions. For the initial stage of 5 million tpy the
economic rate of return has been calculated at 13.6%. The rates of return
and sensitivity tests are summarized below and underlying assumptions are
provided in Annex 7-4:
Dudhichua - Economic Rate of Return
(%)
Initial Stage            Final Capacity
(5 million tpy)         (10 million tpy)
Base Case                        13.6                     16.3
Capital Cost up 10%              12.6                     15.2
Operating Cost up 10%            12.9                     15.7
Operating Cost down 10%          14.4                     17.0
Revenues down 10%                11.7                     14.4
Revenues up 10%                  15.4                     18.0
Higher price trend after
1989/90                          14.0                     16.8
8.08     It can be noted that the economic rate of return is six points
higher than the financial rate of return. This is clearly an indication
that a substantial portion of the economic rent accrues to central and state
governments, suppliers and to the work force rather than to CIL.
Specifically the.difference is explained by, on the one hand, sales prices
being some 8.5% higher in the economic calculations when the applicable
sales taxes and levies are included and, on the other hand, capital costs
and operating costs being reduced by about 31% and 18% respectively after
applying conversion factors and eliminating customs duties on imported
equipment.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01     The following agreements have been reached:
(a) With the Government that it will:
(i)    initiate before April 30, 1984, a study of coal
transportation and distribution, and it will exchange views

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP ON ENERGY POLICY
1.        The most comprehensive study, to date, of India's future energy
supply and demand prospects and policy alternatives was undertaken by the
Working Group on Energy Policy (WGEP). The WGEP Report, which was
published in late 1979, assessed:  (i) whether the availability of energy
may become a serious constraint to India's economic development; and (ii)
what would be the likely impact of an active energy conservation program on
India's future energy balances. The findings of the Report were as
follows:
(i) commercial energy availability may become a serious constraint to
economic development, either because domestic resources would be
insufficient to meet the anticipated demand or because the effort
required to develop domestic resources would imply human and
financial inputs which are not likely to be available;
(ii) a coordinated and all-encompassing energy conservation/demand
management program would have a significant impact beyond the
late 1980s and could possibly reduce commercial energy demand by
as much as 20% (the main reduction being in the demand for power
and in the demand for petroleum and petroleum products across the
entire economy, but especially in he transport sector); and
(iii) the most critical aspect of India's future energy policy will be
to contain (within economic limits) the demand for oil at as low
a level as possible.
2.        In order to improve future energy prospects the WGEP Report
recommended a number of policy measures emphasizing improved energy
utilization and consumption as follows: (i) improvement in the efficiency
of energy utilization; (ii) introduction of fuel-efficient technologies;
(iii) reduction of transportation demand through improved planning of
production and consumption location; (iv) reduction of the energy intensity
of industries; and (v) inter-fuel substitutions from commercial energy to
noncommercial and renewable energy. The Working Group considered that such
measures, supplemented by appropriate pricing policies, would permit India
to reduce commercial energy consumption without affecting economic growth
with the possibility that the ratio of energy use to GDP would decline by
50% between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. the energy saving measures
outlined above supported by detailed implementation plans and an
appropriate pricing policy, could substantially reduce waste and improve
energy availability in the future.

NOTE ON INDIAN POWER SECTOR
1.        Central Electr'city Authority (CEA) which comes under the
Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy, is responsible for
developing national policy for the electricity supply i'ndustry. Power
facilities in India are planned, constructed and operated by State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) in each state to meet local needs. In addition,
the GOI has established two companies, the National Thermal Power
Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to be
responsible for the design, construction and operation of large
centrally-owned power stations and the associated transmission facilities.
At present, most of the facilities of NTPC (8,000 MW) are under
construction and NTPC is expected to contribute about 13% of total power
generating capacity by the end of the 1980s.
2.        The total installed generating capacity in India as of March 31,
1981 was 33,000 MW, including about 2,700 MW of non-utility capacity,
mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial consumers to meet their
own needs.  Over 60% of the generating capacity *s conventional thermal,
mostly coal-fired generation as shown in the table below:

(e) Estimated.
3.        Power shortages have been a constraining factor on economic
growth in India.  During the 1970s power demand outpaced supply and average
annual deficits ranged between 5% and 15%.  These persistent shortages in
power generation were largely the result of poor capacity utilization in
existing plants combined with project implementation difficulties and
delays in commissioning new plants as discussed below. A fuller treatment
of issues in the power sector can be found in India Economic Issues in the
Power Sector, Report 2335-IN, April 1979 and Economic Situations and
Prospects in India, Report 3827-IN, April 1982.

ANNEX 2-4
Page 2 of 3
4.         There has been a steady decline in thermal capacity utilization
from 55% in 1976/77 to 44.6% 4n 1980/81.  Much of this was due to a drop in
plant availability which 4s basically explained by forced outages following
the postponement of scheduled maintenance (such as annual boiler overhauls)
due to pressure to avoid aggravating existing power shortages. Capacity
util4zation has also been lowered by difficulties with new units resulting
i'n limited availability of new plants during the first year of operation.
Other factors included a decline in coal quality and coal shortages in the
late 1970s which have lowered thermal efficiency in boilers and, in some
cases, increased wear and tear due to higher ash content.
5.         The delays in commissioning new plants have been caused by
several factors including inter alia financial constraints, shortages of
basic materials such as cement and steel, delays in procurement and land
acquisition, and scarcity of qualified technical manpower.  Another
contributing factor has been the shift in thermal generation technology
from 110 MW un its to 210 MW equipment units.  The relatively rapid industry
growth combined with this major shift in generation technology has not
allowed the industry to devote full attention to inherent design and
quality problems in equipment being installed.  Problems due to project
implementation difficulties have been worsened by sub-optimal resource
allocation due to the lack of an integrated and long-term energy
perspective. Power planning has been done essentially at state levels
despite the diversity of power resources and loads in different states.
This has contributed to the slow development of an integrated national grid
which would allow interstate power exchanges and provide for an optimal
system development strategy.
6.         The GOI is determined to improve the operations of the power
sector. CEA is currently preparing a 15-year power plan, incorporating an
optimal mix of thermal, hydro and nuclear generation.  There is also a
parallel effort to translate the 15-year plan into an investment plan to
assess the long-term financial requirements of the sector. The GOI is
increasing the role of the Central sector in both generation and
transmission areas to overcome current financial and planning constraints.
The share of the Central sector in generation is planned to increase from
12.0% in 1979/80 to 15.0% in 1984/85 and 26.0% in 1989/90.  CEA has also
taken new initiatives to help SEBs in improving project management. Among
others, detailed formats to monitor projects and new guidelines to ensure
quality control of the various materials purchased, erected and
commissioned have been prepared and sent to SEBs. SEBs have also been
asked to prepare contract planning timetables to help reduce contract
delays. Furthermore, plans, procedures and other management tools
successfully used by NTPC are being disseminated to the interested SEBs.
The problem of poor generation from the recently commissioned 200/210 MW
units is receiving utmost attention and a task force has completed a
plant-by-plant study of the problem in cooperation with the major equipment
manufacturers and drawn up a special program for action. In addition, a
special technical committee has selected 55 older thermal plants with a
total installed capacity of 6,672 MW for upgrading.  Finally GOI is



- 59 -                        ANNEX 2-4
Page 3 of 3
implementing a development program, designed to increase generating
capacity to 74,000 MW by 1989/90 with 59% of the incremental capacity for
coal fired units, 39% for hydro and 2% for nuclear.
7.        The Bank's role in the energy sector has been most extensive in
the power sector.  As well as providing substantial financing, the Bank
Group's strategy in the Indian power sector has been to fully cooperate
with GOI in finding solutions to the many difficult problems confronting
industry and in planning the future development of the Sector. More
specifically, the Bank's objectives in the sector are:
(a)  to eliminate power shortages by the installation of generation
and transmission capacity, and the promotion of measures to
improve the operation and maintenance of existing plants;
(b)  to introduce long-range system planning on a nationwide basis so
as to assure implementation of a least-cost power development
program;
(c)  to promote improvements in sector organization and training; and
(d) to strengthen the finances of the institutions in the sector,
particularly the State Electricity Boards.
A fuller description of the Bank Group's role an activities is contained in
the most recent power loan, Central Power Transmission Project, Report
4293-IN, April 1983.

INDIA - DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
NOTE ON INDIAN RAILWAYS
1.        The performance of Indian Railways (IR) in carrying coal and
other bulk goods deteriorated sharply from 1976/77 to 1980/81 when
originating freight traffic fell form 239 million tons to 220 million
tons. During this period the share of total coal traffic carried by IR
fell from 75% to 70% with a resultant increase in coal traffic being
carried by road--which is relatively more expensive and directly increases
the need for imported petroleum products. During this period, IR
experienced a variety of difficulties including labor unrest and work
stoppages, coal shortages and power interruptions and delays in wagon
turnaround time due to inadequate maintenance, marshalling yard delays,
equipment breakdown and user difficulties. In 1981/82 fre-ight traffic
increased to 245 million tons as labor problems and coal and power supplies
improved.  Even so, IR sti1lfaces demand in terms of inadequate line
capacity, obsolete track technology, aging rolling stock, poor maintenance
facilities, insufficient staff training program and lack of fully
computerized real time train operating systems and management information
systems. Further, these constraints have been worsened by under-investment
over the past decade or so. Railway investment declined from an average of
Rs 5.2 billion per year in the Third Plan to Rs 2.3 billion per year in the
Fifth Plan.
2.         Both GOI and IR place a high priority on improving the railways'
performance and expanding carrying capacity.  Specifically, operational
*mprovements to increase train speeds and sizes have been achieved over the
past five years through innovations such as introducing dedicated unit
trains for bulk goods such as iron ore and coal, more careful sorting of
wagons to remove from service wagons in a poor state of repair thereby
reducing breakdowns and delays, greater segregation of wagons to increase
train speed by having homogeneous wagon groupings and increased
end-to-end" running, i.e., running goods tra4ns from origin to destination
without having to adjust the train length or change locomotives at any
point in the journey. In addition to these types of operational
improvements, IR's investment program i*ncludes major allocations for the
acquisition of new rolling stock, track renewal, electrification, workshops
and plant modernization, real time computerized operating system and
upgrading the telecommunication system.
3.        While these are all sound measures, the Plan allocation of Rs 51
billion for 1980/81 to 1984/85 is insufficient.  the Sixth Plan envisages
the acquisition of 780 new locomotives of various types, 5,680 coaches and
100,000 wagons. Meeting the full traffic demand by 1984/85 and starting to
reduce the backlog of investment (retirement of over aged rolling stock,
shop modernization, etc.), with an assumed level of efficiency as good as
the best level achieved in the 1970s, would require about three times as
locomotives and coaches, and over twice as many wagons.  Domestic wagon
building capacity is estimated at 25,000 units per year.  Full utilization



-61-
ANNEX 2-5
Page 2 of 2
of this capacity would produce enough wagons to meet the Plan target, but
not enough to satisfy the demand forecast. Further, unless annual
allocations are increased to compensate for cost excalation, meeting the
Plan targets will be increasingly difficult. As Plan targets themselves
are below estimated requirements, these shortfalls would imply a worsening
of capacity shortages, and through a failure to replace and modernize the
aged or outdated assets, would limit the scope for future efficiency
improvements.
4.        The Bank Group has approved seven loans and nine credits for IR,
totalling US$1,486 million. The two most recent loans have been for the
First and Second Railway Modernization and Maintenance Projects,1/ in 1978
and 1982 for US$190 million and US$400 million respectively. Through these
projects, the Bank Group has directly assisted IR in tackling some of its
most pressing and long overdue issues in terms of (i) maintenance
organization, levels and procedures; and (ii) technological design
obsolescence of IR's motive power and rolling stock. Specifically, for the
second project, the GOI requested Bank Group to assist IR in (a)
modernization and improvement of diesel electric locomotive maintenance and
reliability; (b) improvement of technology and performance of mainline
electric locomotives; and (c) improvement of technology, design and
operation of heavy bulk movements including construction of high capacity
wagons for bulk freight movement.

WORLD COAL MARKET
1.        World production and consumption of coal grew from 1,475
million toe in 1970 to 1,825 million toe in 1980 - an annual average growth
rate of 2.2% as shown below.  During this period the overall contribution
of coal to primary energy supply fell from 29% to 27%. For the future,
coal has become more competitive with oil following the large oil price
increases of the 1970s and latest projections indicate that coal will
provide 36% of incremental energy production and consumption from 1980-1995
and will account for 30% of world energy requirements by 1995 as shown
below:

2.        About 65% of coal consumption is thermal coal for power
generation, 20% is thermal coal for industry and commercial/household use
and the remaining 15% is metallurgical coal used for steel making. Coal
will continue to be the most important source of energy for major coal
producers with coal based economies, such as India, USA, USSR, China, South
Africa and Australia. It will also become an important fuel for countries
with substantial reserves but presently low to moderate production, such as
Yugoslavia, Turkey and Colombia.
3.        In 1980, total coal trade was only 8% of total world production.
About three-quarters of the coal traded (180 million tons) was coking coal
for steel making purposes and one-quarter (about 60 million tons) was
thermal coal for heat or steam generation and cement making. Major coal
importers are industrialized countries such as Germany FR, France, Italy
and Japan. Major exporting countries are Australia, South Africa, Canada
and the USA. It is expected that there will be a significant growth in
thermal coal trade in the next one to two decades and imported thermal
ccoal could become an important source of energy for countries which have
only limited or high cost indigenous coal reserves for example, Brazil and
Republic of Korea.
4.        International thermal coal prices increased strongly in the mid
to late 1970s and early 1980s as consumers shifted to coal following the
1973 and 1979 oil price hikes. More recently, ccoal prices have dropped
sharply due to oversupply and depressed demand. But for the future, there
are good long run supply prospects for coal and plentiful reserves
available for development in Australia, South Africa, Canada and the United
States. the long run marginal cost curve is considered to be fairly flat
and thermal coal prices are not expected to increase significantly in real
terms in the long run.  Latest projections are for these prices to increase
by 1-2% per year in real terms over the next decade, as shown in the table
below.  It is also expected that international thermal ccoal export prices
will continue to exhibit short term cyclical behavior in response to the
market supply-demand balance, though no attempt has been made to project
the timing and amplitude of such cycles.  Coking coal export prices are
expected to follow a similar trend to thermal coal prices.

ANNEX 3-4
INDIA-DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN COAL DEMAND PROJECTIONS
A.  Steel Sector
The projection of steel industry coking coal requirements is based
on an industry production of 18.0 million tpy hot metal in 1989-90. This
assumes the completion of expansions which are well in hand at Bokaro
and Bhilai and the construction of a new plant at Vizag where construction
is underway. It does not include any production at a second greenfield
planned at Paradip.
B.  Power Sector
The power sector demand projection is based on   plant-by-plant
requirements for both utilities and captive power plants provided by
CEA. In order to allow for possible slippage in the power plant program,
CMPDI has cut back the estimates by nearly 10%, when calculating the final
estimate of 107.4 million tons.
C.  Railway Sector
The railway requirement for coal is based on railway plans to slowly
phase out steam locomotives and replace them with electric and/or diesel
traction.
D.  Cement and Fertilizer Sectors
The cement and fertilizer demand is based on project-by-project es-
timates for new plants expected in the Seventh Plan.
E.  Other Industries
The consumption for other industries is derived by CMPDI based on
expected GDP trends, population growth, industrial production and sub-
stitution with other end use fuels and electricity. Colliery consumption
is based on future coal production projections.

INDIA - DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF CIL SUBSIDIARIES 1,
Introduction
1.        CIL was formed in 1975 as a holding company with five fully owned
subsidiary companies, namely Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern
Coalfields Limited (ECL) Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Western
Coalfields Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute
(CMPDI).2/ BCCL, CCL, WCL and ECL are coal producing companies whereas
CMPDI is a technical services company responsible for the planning and
design of mining projects. A typical organization chart for the CIL
subsidiaries is given overleaf. Each company has a Chairman/Managing
Director and a separate Board of Directors. Three of the subsidiary
companies, namely BCCL, ECL and WCL have been split into two regions - each
headed by a regional Director of Operations.
2.        A description of the production activities and financial
situation of each subsidiary was given in the India Coal Sector Report
(3601-IN), September 1982. This Annex provides updated financial
statistics and production projections for 1984/85 (end of Sixth Plan) and
1989/90 (end of Seventh Plan). The financial data are summarized for
1980/81, 1981/82, and 1982/83. For 1982/83 two sets of data are given:
one using actual prices, one using subsidiary specific retention prices.
As noted in para. 3.28 of the main text, from April 1, 1982 a retention
pricing system was introduced which provided each subsidiary with a single
average accounting price (per ton of coal) based on predetermined
efficiency norms for that subsidiary. The system was designed to adjust
for the wide differences in mining conditions - and consequently production
costs - between different subsidiaries and thus even out the financial
performance of the various subsidiaries.
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL)
3.        BCCL is a major producer of coking coal accounting for 58% of
CIL's coking coal production in 1981/82. BCCL operates all of the mines in
the Jharia Coking Coal field with the exception of some small collieries
operated by TISCO/IISCO. BCCL's headquarters are in Dhanbad. BCCL's
operations are divided into 37 mining areas which are organized in two
Operations Divisions, namely Western Jharia Division and Eastern Jharia
Division. BCCL runs six coal washeries and has three washeries under
construction. In addition, it has three by-product coke plants, over 2,000
hard coke ovens and a pilot pellet plant for production of smokeless fuel.
1/  This Annex provides an account of the activities of BCCL, ECL and WCL.
A fuller description of CCL, together with a brief description of
CMPDI, is provided in the text of the main report, Chapter IV.
2/  In addition, the North Eastern Coalfields (NEC), which is part  *-
CIL Headquarters, has small mining operations in Assam.

18.7 million tons were coking coals (81%) as shown below:

Underground mining accounts for 68% of BCCL's production, which is higher
than the average for CIL overall (57%).
5.        BCCL is currently undertaking an investment program to
rationalize its underground production by integrating small mines into
larger units and by increasing the degree of mechanization both in coal
extraction and transportation and to develop new open pit mines. In
1989/90, BCCL is expected to produce about 35.5 million tons of coal, which
represents an average annual growth of 5.6% from 1981/82. Because of the
substantial predevelopment work and land acquisition required to develop
the open pit mines, several will be in the early stages of starting up in
1989/90 and will only contribute small amounts to BCCL's production.
Therefore, BCCL's expected production growth is less than for the other
subsidiaries. Underground mining would still account for most of the
production (65%) at that time. During the 1990s, however, the share of
open pit production will increase strongly and new production would be
increasingly coming from open pit mines. The share of coking coal
production would remain high (66% of total production).
6.        BCCL is currently in a relatively weak financial position.  It
has been incurring severe losses in the past due not only to the low level
of coal prices, but particularly to generally more difficult mining
conditions and therefore higher production costs than the average for CIL
mining operations. In 1982/83, BCCL's total production costs (including
depreciation and interest charges) were estimated to total Rs 184 per ton
of coal, which was about 23% higher than the average for CIL overall (Rs
150 per ton) and about 12% higher than the estimated average minehead
purchase price for its products . However, with the introduction of the
retention price system, BCCL is expected to about break-even in 1982/83.

7.         BCCL's labor productivity, as measured by output per manshift
(OMS), is expected to be about 0.65 tons, which is 18% lower than the
average for the CIL group (0.79 tons). However, with the implementation of
the investment program, which emphasizes rationalization of existing
underground mines and developing new open pit production, OMS is expected
to increase to 0.8 tons by 1989/90 and the financial position of BCCL is
also expected to improve.
Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL)
8.         ECL has its headquarters at Sanctoria, West Bengal.  It covers
the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal and Mugma Rajmahal coalfields in
Bhihar. These are older, deep minefields with superior quality thermal
coal, but difficult high cost mining conditions. ECL markets substantial
quantities of its production to the railways and other industries needing
relatively higher grades of coal. ECL's operations have been organized
into two geographical regions, each placed under a Director of Operations.
During 1981/82, ECL produced 24.2 million tons of coal of which 22.7
million tons were thermal coals (94%) and the balance, 1.5 million tons
coking coals (6%). Underground mining accounted for 74% of ECL's
production, which is substantially higher than the average for CIL overall
(57%), as shown below:

9.         ECL's investment program consists of reconstructing  its older,
deep underground mines and developing certain new open-pit mines inclualng
the Rajmahal mine to feed the Farraka super-thermal power station i,A
northern Bihar. Because of the geological conditions and the age of the
workings, there is only limited opportunity for increasing product'on from
the underground mines and the emphasis of the reconstruction pro-.am is
therefore on cost reduction. There are also fewer undeveloped coal
deposits in the regions operated by ECL, and ECL's development program,
like BCCls, is much smaller than CCL or WCL. By 1989/90, ECL is expec"'d
to increase production to 38.0 million tons, average annual growth of 5.8/
from 1981/82. Open pit mining would increase its share considerably from
26% in 1981/81 to 42% in 1989/90.
10.       Like BCCL, ECL has incurred heavy losses in the past, mainly due
to unfavorable mining conditions and therefore higher producJion costs than
the average for CIL mining operations.  It has also experienced production
cutbacks due to labor unrest, and external factors such as power shortages,
which have also contributed to the low productivity and weK finacial
position.  In 1982/83, ECL's total production costs (inclVding dep-l-eciation
and interest charges) were estimated at Rs 196 per ton of coal, wh.ch is
about 31% higher than the average for the CIL group (RS i50 per tor), and
22% higher than the average minehead purchase price for its production
resulting in an expected loss of Rs 802 million for cue y'eaL based on
minehead purchase prices.  With the retention priciL    --,   thwever, ECL
is expected to operate around breakeven as shown beijw

10.       For the future, ECL faces the most difficulties of the various
CIL subsidiaries in improving its financial situation.  Providing
production improvements are realized, ECL should be able to operate
profitably.
Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL)
11.       WCL is an important producer of thermal coals for Central and
Western India. WCL, which has its headquarters at Nagpur, operates all
coalfields in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh (with the exception of
Singrauli) plus the Ib River coalfield in Orissa. WCL operates through two
Divisions--having headquarters at Nagpur and Bilaspur--each under a full
time Director. A Regional office of the company is also functioning at
Chindwara. There are 65 coal mines and one non-coking coal washery under
the jurisdiction of WCL. In addition, the Medium coking coal Nandan
washery is under construction. During 1981/82, WCL produced 31.6 million
tons of coal of which 30.2 million tons were thermal coal (96%) as shown
below:

13.       Underground mining accounted for 70% of WCL's production, higher
than the average for CIL overall (57%). WCL's underground mines are newer,
shallower operations with much easier mining conditions than those of BCCL
and ECL. With the implementation of the investment program, which
emphasizes the development of new open pit mines, the total coal production
of WCL is expected to increase to about 59.7 million tons by 1989/90
representing an average annual growth of 8.3% from 1981/82. The major
feature of the plan is a substantial growth in open pit coal production
which would increase its share from 30% in 1981/82 to 52% of total
production in 1990/91.
14.       WCL is currently in a relatively sound financial position.  It
has been able to earn moderate profits since 1979/80. In 1982/83, WCL's
total production costs (including depreciation and interest charges) were
estimated at Rs 116 per ton of coal, which is about 22% lower than the
average for the CIL group (Rs 150 per ton) and 5% lower than the estimated
average minehead purchase price for its products. The introduction of the
retention pricing system is expected to further improve the financial
position of WCL.  The financial position of WCL is summarized below:

INDIA - DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
OUTLINE OF SCOPE OF WORK FOR STUDY ON BUDGETARY SYSTEMS
A. Objective
To assist the CIL group in improving the process for formulating
and controlling the operational budget at all levels of the organization.
B. Scope of Work
The consultants should assess the systems and procedures used by
the CIL group for formulating and controlling the operational budget,
defining specific recommendations and assisting in their implementation.
The work will be limited to five selected areas which are considered as
representative of the different type of situations found in the CIL group.
The assistance should cover the specific following areas:
(a) Definition of Cost (Profit) Centers. The consultants should
review the existing definition of cost (profit) centers in each
of the five areas. The linkage between cost centers and the
organizational structure should be established in order to assess
the definition of responsibilities for individual cost centers.
The consultants should make recommendations for improvements and
assist in their implementation.
(b) Basic Procedures. The consultants should review the basic
procedures presently used for formulating and recording the
budgetary and cost information with particular reference to the
chart of accounts, rules for recording inter-center transactions
(maintenance), and recording and control of coal inventories.
The adequacy of these basic procedures to record and interpret
variances in important cost items should be established, and
recommendations for improvements should be made.
(c) Budget Formulation. The consultants should review the process of
budget formulation with particular reference to the role and
participation of staff directly responsible for cost centers.
The active participation of production and maintenance staff in
the definition of targets and standards is considered a key
element for achieving both commitment and accountability. The
consultants should assess the adequacy of present practices and
recommend modifications where appropriate.
(d) Reporting. The consultant should review the budgetary and cost
control reporting system presently used by the CIL group for the
control of its operations. The scope, contents and timing of the
several reports prepared for different hierarchical levels in the
organization should be assessed. Also the interaction of budget
and cost reports with the operational reports (production,



- 80 -                      ANNEX 4-3
Page 2 of 2
equipment utilization, maintenance performance, etc.) should be
evaluated. The most generalized practice in the mining industry
is for cost/budget reports to reflect the responsibilities, to
highlight significant and controllable variances, and to enable a
correlation of these variances with integrated performance
reports. The consultants should make recommendations to improve
the efficiency of the reporting systems.
(e) Control Mechanisms and Corrective Actions. The consultants
should review the control procedures presently being used at
different levels of the organization. Particular emphasis should
be given to the analysis of variances between actual costs and
budgets, how they take place at different levels within the
organization, and procedures for formulating action plans with
corrective measures. Based on this analysis, the consultants
should provide recommendations and assist in the implementation
of procedures and measures to establish control mechanisms
leading to a higher degree of cost consciousness at all
hierarchical levels.

INDIA - DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
OUTLINE OF SCOPE OF WORK FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
ON OPERATIONAL PRACTICES IN OPEN PIT MINES
A. Objective
To assist the CIL group to improve the operational efficiency of
open pit mines, with particular reference to the Singrauli coal fields.
B. Scope of Work
The consultants should recommend and assist in the implementation
of measures to improve the efficiency of CIL's major open pit coal mines.
The work will be limited to the open pit mines in the Singrauli coal fields
and the organizational structure under the General Manager for the
Singrauli area. The technical assistance should cover the following areas:
(a)  Operations Management.  The consultants should review the manner
in which the mining operations at Singrauli are organized. The
line of responsibility and communication from the Area General
Manager to foreman and operators and the interaction of different
departments e.g., operations, planning and maintenance, should be
assessed in terms of its effectiveness and efficiency. The
consultants should make recommendations for improvements and
assists in the implementation of specific measures adopted.
(b) Equipment Efficiency. The consultants should investigate ways to
increase the effective operational time for equipment and to
minimize downtime. The planning and control systems for
deployment of excavation,haulage and auxiliary equipment should
be assessed. In parallel with this the consultants should also
assess the requirements for an operational control office,
including a truck dispatch system.
(c) Equipment Maintenance. The consultants should review maintenance
and servicing procedures and schedules, assessing the adequacy of
relevant facilities and make recommendations for improvements.
This analysis should include an evaluation of standardization of
mining equipment. Experience in large open pit mines has been
that significant advantages can accrue from a system that
minimizes unscheduled maintenance through using a program of
carefully planned preventive maintenance. This can increase
equipment availability and extend the period between major
overhauls ensuring that the maximum economical operational life
can be extracted from equipment components. Based on these
considerations the consultants should establish a maintenance
planning system for all major excavation, haulage and anciallary
equipment.

ANNEX 4-4
Page 2 of 2
(d)  Haulroad Construction and Maintenance.  The consultants should
review CIL's haulroad construction and maintenance practices and
recommend modifications where appropriate. Design criteria
should be established which are commensurate with internationally
accepted good practice. The adequacy of haulroad construction
should be assessed to ensure that adequate provision for
construction equipment is made in new project reports.
Procedures and equipment for haulroad maintenance should be
reviewed and techniques to maintain a good running surface with
efficient drainage should be determined. Priorities for haulroad
watering should be established. The adequacy of available
equipment for haulroad maintenance should be assessed.
(e) Blasting Design and Practice. The consultants should review
existing blasting design and practice, with particular attention
to fragmentation and minimization of secondary blasting. A study
should be undertaken to assess the economic merits (in terms of
improved shovel/dump truck utilization) of blasting practices
including drill patterns, hole sizes and specific charges.
Variations in these parameters should be evaluated through
testing their effectiveness in field trials.
C. Timing
It is estimated that the work described should require about 4-6
man-years of consulting assistance over a two year period.

INDIA - DUDHICHUA COAL PROJECT
OUTLINE OF TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL
A. Objective
The project implementation manual for the Dudhichua Project has
the objective of integrating in a single document the general philosophy,
mode of implementation, procedures to be followed, records to be maintained
and controls to be exercised for the efficient implementation of the
project.
B. Scope
The Project Implementation Manual should include the following
aspects:
1.   Project Description
2.   Organizational Structure of Project Management Function
3.   Planning & Monitoring
4.   Cost Control
5.   Procurement
6.   Mine Development
7.   Mine Ancillaries & Infrastructure
8.   Recruitment & Training Plan
9.   Environmental Management
1. Project Description
The PIM should include a summarized description of the project
scope as sanctioned by the Government, the approved investment and
implementation schedule. The main project milestones should be identified,
and programs for overburden removal and coal release should be indicated
until the year when the mine is expected to reach its rated capacity.
2. Organizational Structure of Project Management Function.
The organizational set-up for the project should be described
here, including the key positions under the Project General Manager, and
its links with other relevant positions within the subsidiary and CIL. Job
descriptions should be provided for the Project General Manager and, as a
minimum, all positions in the two hierarchical levels below this position.
Job descriptions should include objectives, duties, authority and
responsibilities, and hierarchical links with other positions in the
organization. The scope, content and frequency of reports to be issued
should be summarized here, indicating responsibilities for preparation, as
well as other communications procedures.
3. Planning & Monitoring
This should include the following subsystems: time-schedule,
procurement follow-up and cost control. These subsystems should form the
initial element for project control. The basic time-schedules to be used
should be specified here, as well the design of a consolidated progress

chart which should summarized a comparison of actual versus planned
progress (in terms of percent complete) and forecast impact on project
completion. This could also be supplemented by a major milestone chart to
summarize project status. The procurement follow-up subsystem should
enable a close monitoring of the progress of procurement during major
phases: tendering process (including preparation of technical and
commercial documentation), manufacturiia, dispatch and erection/startup.
The cost control subsystem should provide an adequate recording of project
expenditures, a comparison with approved budgzts, and enable a continuous
assessment of the impact of deviations on total project costs.
4.  Cost Control
The detailed procedures for preparing and updating cost estimates
for the total project (broken down into foreign exchange and local costs),
annual budget estimates, control of expenditure, and payments to suppliers
and contractors. This should also include procedures for disbursements on
World Bank financed packages.
5. Procurement
Relevant parts of the Materials Management Manual should be
reproduced here, supplemented by special provisions pertaining to World
Bank procurement guidelines. Standard formats for bidding documents
(invitations to bid, instruction to bidders and terms and conditions of
purchase) should be attached to the procedures.
6. Mine Development
The PIM should include the mine plan and equipment schedules
which will be implemented. Procedures for preparing detailed programs and
modifications to plans and schedules should be specified, indicating
explicitly the role, authority and participation of CMPDI staff assigned to
the project. Detailed procedures for recording and reporting progress in
mining activities should also be specified here.
7. Mine Ancillaries and Infrastructure
The scheme of implementation of workshops, buildings, railway
siding, coal handling plant, loadout facilities, power supply, housing and
other ancillary and infrastructure facilities should be established.
Procedures for carrying out engineering design, construction contracts,
construction schedules, quality control and monitoring should be
specified.
8. Recruitment & Training Plan
The policies and plans of recruitment and training of personnel
should be included here. This should include an assessment of manpower
requirements and its phasing, a definition of recruitment policies for the
project identifying sources and procedures for selection, and the training
requirements in terms of organization, facilities, contents and schedules.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.   Projection Period
1.        The financial projections have been calculated for the 1984/85
through 1989/90, i.e., until the end of the Seventh Plan.
B.   Escalation
2.        All projections have been prepared in current terms.  An average
annual inflation rate of 7% has been used from 1982/83 to 1985/86 and 6%
thereafter. The same rates have been applied to all revenues and costs.
C.   Production Plan
3.        Production plan for the CIL group is based on a target production
of 193 million tpy in FY1989.  The adjusted production plan for CIL and its
subsidiaries is given in the following table:

E.   Coal Prices
5.        CIL: The projected average coal price for CIL (ex-mine) has been
assumed to be gradually increased so that, in any year, the full cost of
production (including depreciation and interest) would be covered, and by
1998/90, CIL would earn a 10% return on net worth, if it meets specified
efficiency norms regarding production levels, output per manshift and unit
operating costs. The average coal price for CIL is projected as follows:
CIL - Average Coal Price
(Rs/ton, 1982/83 terms)
Fiscal Year           82/83  83/84  84/85  85/86  86/87  87/88  88/89  89/90
Average Price          150.5  148.3  159.8  161.0  163.0  165.0  167.0  169.0
F.   Production Costs
6.         Salaries & wages, including base salaries & wages plus social
amenities and fringe benefits (calculated at 21% of the base salares &
wages), have been increased by 26% in real terms, representing an average
annual growth of 3.4% and explained by the following factors:
- increase in the number of employees               13.0%
- increase in the base salaries & wages             10.3%
- change in the composition of labor                 1.4%
In calculating the base salaries and wages for each employee category a 5%
increase in real terms has been assumed in 1983/84 and 1987/88 due to the
scheduled renewal of CIL's labor contracts.
7.        Administrative overhead  a major portion of which (about 70%) is
administrative salaries, is assumed to increase at the same rate as the
salaries and wages.
8.        Consumables, power, transportation of coal, sand and other
materials, and other costs/revenues are calculated on a variable cost
basis.  The unit cost for consumables, which includes spares, explosives,
timber, diesel fuel, lubricants and other general operating materials, have
been slightly increased from the base due to the increase in open pit
production with higher than average material consumption. All other
variable unit costs have been assumed to remain constant throughout the
projection period.
9.         Depreciation has been calculated using the 1982/83 figure as a
base for existing assets and adding 8% of new investments incorporated into
the gross fixed assets each year.
10.       Interest expense has been calculated based on the following
average annual interest rates:

- Existing long-term loans
- planned portion                   11.5% p.a.
- non-planned portion                0%   p.a. a/
- New long-term loans                 12.5% p.a.
- Short-term loans                    19.0% p.a.
a/ A subsidy equal to the interest payable is
received from the Government. Hence neither
interest nor subsidy are included in the
financial projections.
G.   Income Taxes
11.       Accumulated losses from previous years have been carrie
forward.  In addition, an investment allowance, up to 40% of the  annual
investment, has been assumed in calculating the annual taxable income. A
50% income tax rate has been applied to the taxable *ncome (if any).
H. Balance Sheet
12.       Current assets have been increased from the base at the same rate
as the growth in total operating expenditures.
13.       Current liabilities have been assumed to follow generally the
same pattern as current assets.  However, since labor costs are expected to
increase and only moderately, other current liabilities (which include
ma4nly wages and bonuses payable at the end of the year) has been increased
at a lower rate than the average growth in operating expenditures.
14.       Fixed assets have been increased by adding 80% of the annual
investment to the previous year's balance. This addition is assumed to
include both the direct addition from the annual investment and a transfer
from previous year's capital work-in-progress.  17% of the investment has
been assumed to equal the net increase in capital work-in-progress and 3%
of the investment the net increase in loans & advances.
15.       Long-term debt liability for CIL overall consists of the
following loans:
Amount Outstanding
March 31, 1983
(Rs Million)
Existing loans a/
- Planned                                  8,149
- Non-planned                              4,327
Sub-total          12,476
New loans b/                                 3,900
Total              16,376
a/  Loans taken before April 1, 1982; fully repaid
according to a fixed schedule in about 10 years.
b/ Loans taken in 1982/83 (and after); 50% of annual
investment; repaid in 15 years.

INDIA - DUDHICHUA PROJECT
RATES OF RETURN - ASSUMLTIONS AND CALCULATIONS
1.   Introduction
The financial rate of return (FRR) and economic rate of return
(ERR) for the project have been calculated in real terms on an annual basis.
Considering the staged production profile of the project, two scenarios are
defined to assess its viability, one for 5 million tpy and the other for 10
million tpy.  For this purpose, the period from 1983/84 to 2012/2013 is taken
as the life of the project. Cost and benefit streams of each scenario are
shown in tables attached.
2. Cost Streams
Capital Costs
Capital costs are based on project implementation schedule and
equipment deployment plan.  Replacement investments are estimated according
to useful life of major equipment deployed.
Operating Costs
Operating costs are derived from production schedule together with
fixed and variable cost components applied to overburden removal and coal
release.
Working Capital
Working capital requirement is derived taking into consideration
the level of minimum cash, inventory of consumables, stock of coal,
receivables and payables.
Conversion Factors
For the calculation of ERR, all identifiable duties and taxes are
excluded. In addition, to reflect the concept of opportunity cost, the
following conversion factors are applied to each category of costs:
Conversion Factor                      Category of Costs
1.0               Imported Equipment (CIF)

3.   Revenue Stream
Revenue stream is derived based on coal sales volume and prices.
For Dudhichua project, present price specific to grade E coal is increased
during 1985/86 to 1989/90 in line with trend of average price for CIL. After
1989/90, an increase of 1.2% p.a. in real terms is assumed, following trend
of long-run marginal cost.
For the calculation of ERR, price stream is adjusted upward by 8.3%
to include 4% sales taxes levied by central government and 4.3% royalties and
cesses by state government.
