I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (the Government), has requested a Bank
loan of US$100 million equivalent to help finance the cost of a new paper
mill (the Project) to be located at Pugalur in the State of Tamilnadu,
about 300 km southwest of Madras (Map IBRD 15475R). The Project will be
owned and operated by Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Limited (TNPL), a new
company, with 47.4% of its shares to be held by the Government of Tamilnadu.
Two sugar companies and a paper company will be minority equity shareholders
in TNPL holding a combined total of 6% of its shares. The balance of the
shares will eventually be offered to the public. Initially they will be
held by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) in a consortium with
three other Indian financial institutions.l/ The proposed Bank loan would
cover approximately 42% of the estimated total financing requirement of
US$238 million, and about 87% of the total foreign exchange needs of US$115
million. The remaining foreign exchange costs together with local cost
financing will be provided by the Government of Tamilnadu, the minority
equity shareholders, the consortium of Indian financial institutions,
and local commercial banks.2/
1.02      The Project has evolved as a direct result of policy measures adopted
by the Government aimed both at expanding the domestic production of paper (and
in particular newsprint) to meet growing domestic demand, and at using bagasse
as a raw material for paper manufacture.3/ The plant will use bagasse from five
existing sugar mills to produce 50,000 tons per year (tpy) of newsprint and
40,000 tpy of printing and writing paper, to be marketed throughout India. The
bagasse is now being used as a fuel for generating steam in the sugar mills; to
obtain its release for paper production, the Project provides for the installa-
tion and operation of coal-fired boiler systems at each sugar mill at the Pro-
ject's expense. Bagasse has been widely used to produce printing and writing
paper for many years; the technology for bagasse-based newsprint manufacture,
however, is relatively new. To date, two such plants have been built (in Peru
and in Mexico), and a third (in Argentina) is under construction. Although the
plants have had technical difficulties in operation, these are being corrected
and the Tamilnadu Project will benefit considerably from this experience. More-
over, the Project design allows for the production of newsprint and printing
and writing paper in variable proportions, insuring against the risk of possi-
ble initial technical problems with newsprint production (paras. 5.02 and 8.07).
The Project will be located in a designated "backward area". It will provide
direct employment for some 2,000 persons and indirectly support some 4,000 jobs
in forestry, transportation, and marketing. In addition, up to 3,000 workers
will be employed during construction.
1L/ The Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI); the Life Insurance
Corporation of India (LICI); and the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India (ICICI).
2/ Local commercial banks will finance the bulk of the working capital re-
quired.
3/ The Government's particular interest in bagasse has come about as a re-
sult of increasing shortages of the traditional paper-making materials
in India (bamboo and wood).

1.03      The Project was identified and preappraised  in April 1980, on the
basis of a feasibility study prepared for TNPL by its Indian Project Consultants,
Seshasayee Paper and Boards Limited (SPB), a company with a paper mill and a
consultancy operation in Tamilnadu. The Project was appraised in November
1980, by a mission comprising representatives of the four Indian financial
institutions (para. 1.01) and the Bank. The Bank mission consisted of Miss V.
Bates, Messrs. S. Saukkonen and K. Zamani of the Industrial Projects Department,
and Mr. A.J. Ewing, consultant.
II. THE INDIAN PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY
A. Industrial Sector
2.01      In terms of its importance to the economy, India's industrial
sector is second only to agriculture, with manufacturing output contributing
about 17% of GDP in 1979/80. Industrial employment amounts to about 26% of
the work force in the organized sector or about 2% of India's total work force.
In 1950, when the First National Plan was initiated, industry was heavily
oriented towards the production of consumer goods, with traditional industries
such as textiles and food processing responsible for about half of industrial
output. Over the next 15 years, manufacturing output expanded by 6-7% per
annum, with particular emphasis being placed on the expansion of capital goods
production, including industrial machinery and transport equipment, and "basic"
industries, such as steel, cement and fertilizers. Since then, although growth
in manufacturing output had slowed down to an average of about 5% per annum
(1970-79), its growth has still exceeded that of GDP which reached only 3.5%
per annum over the same period.
2.02      Economic performance in 1979/80 deteriorated sharply; GNP fell by
about 3%, agricultural production declined and industrial production stagnated
despite strong demand and underutilized capacity. Industry was plagued by
labor unrest and a vicious circle of supply bottlenecks. Persistent power
and transport shortages aggravated short supply conditions in key industries.
During 1980/81 public infrastructure and the supply of certain basic commodities
continued to be a constraint to industrial production. Railway transport
was perhaps the most severe bottleneck. These constraints can be largely
attributed to past cutbacks in investment in transport facilities and basic
industries, in favor of irrigation and other agricultural infrastructure.
Although there could be some improvemeits in capacity utilization in these
industries, this in itself will be insufficient to provide the additional
output required to meet India's needs. Several other measures are necessary
in order to accommodate India's current circumstances. First, the industrial
sector must adapt itself to higher energy prices by improving the energy
efficiency of existing and new plants. Second, efforts are needed to expand
export and import-substituting industries where domestic resources are best
used. Finally, many industries, including the paper industry, require modern-
ization and substantial new investment to overcome supply shortages.



- 3-
2.03      The Sixth Plan (1980/81 to 1984/85) gives high priority to the cre-
ation of additional capacity in such basic industries as steel, non-ferrous
metals, capital goods, fertilizers and petrochemicals. The public sector will
continue its major role in the expansion of these industries.  The private,
joint and cooperative sectors are expected to contribute significantly in ce-
ment, paper, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, drugs and pharmaceuticals. Pro-
duction of natural gas, petroleum and coal, and rapid growth of industries
based on these resources (particularly fertilizers) are expected to lead to
structural shifts in the pattern of industrial output in the 1980s. Rapid
growth is also expected, in many cases from small bases, in plastics, synthe-
tic fibers, synthetic rubber and other petrochemicals. A major expansion in
the electronic industry to profit from the comparative advantage of a large
pool of technically qualified personnel is also envisaged. While the expan-
sion in metal and engineering industries will continue, the chemical and elec-
tronic industries are expected to assume the leading role in industrial in-
vestment and lroduction.
2.04      Bank Group direct investment in India's industrial sector over the
past 12 years has to date been limited to the fertilizer industry where con-
tributions totalling US$882 million have been made to eleven projects.l/ Al-
though some of the earlier projects suffered completion delays of up to two
years, and cost overruns of 34-45%, the more recent Trombay project (completed
in 1977) and the Sindri project (completed in February 1981) were completed
within a few months of schedule, and at costs close to appraisal estimates.
These projects have added substantially to India's domestic nitrogen fertiliz-
er production capacity but growth in demand has continued apace and imports
still account for about 40% of fertilizer consumption.
B. Background of the Paper Industry
2.05      Within the constraint imposed by shortages of suitable raw materials,
India's pulp and paper industry has been relatively successful in achieving
one of its principal objectives: that of efficiently and economically maintain-
ing a high level of self-sufficiency in domestic paper production. In 1979,
there were approximately 100 plants in operation, producing a total of 1.1
million tons of paper and paperboard or 80% of total paper consumption. Domes-
tic production accounted for some 98% of India's requirements of printing and
writing paper, and 96% of industrial paper and board. Imports of those grades
were limited to specialty products. Substantial imports of newsprint are still
required however, and in 1979, domestic production accounted for only about 15%
of the total consumption of 300,000 tons.
2.06      With total output currently valued at some Rs 6.0 billion annually,
the pulp and paper industry contributes about 2% of industrial outpit in India
and employs about 100,000 people. In addition, at least twice that number are
engaged in peripheral activities such as the collection of fibrous raw materi-
als. With real output having increased at an annual average rate of more than
6% over the past 20 years, the rate qf growth of the industry has exceeded that
of the economy as a whole, reflecting rising literacy rates, expanded educa-
tional programs and increasing use of paper for packaging of food and other
commodities. Nevertheless, India's average per-capita consumption of paper, at
less than 2 kg per annum, is among the lowest in the world.
1/   The most recent operation was an IDA Credit of US$400 million for the
Hazira fertilizer project which was approved in March 1981 (Report No.
2852-IN).

C. Historical Growth of the Industry
2.07      The paper and paperboard industry in India was started by
missionaries in the nineteenth century. By 1913, seven mills were in operation,
producing about 25,000 tons of paper annually. Raw materials in use at that
time were grass, hemp, rags, jute and imported pulp. The first mill to use
bamboo commenced operation in 1918.  Further encouragement to the expansion of
domestic production capacity, based on bamboo, was provided by the Bamboo
Paper Industry (Protection) Acts of 1925 and 1932, which levied duties on
imported papers. By 1940, total annual production was approaching 90,000
tons, and imports of most grades of paper and paper board had been reduced to
negligible levels.  The industry continued to expand at a modest rate through                  4
the 1940s, with production reaching 110,000 tons by 1950. In the ensuing
three decades domestic production of paper and paperboard, based almost
exclusively on bamboo and indigenous hardwoods, expanded to over 1 million
tons annually.
2.08      The following table illustrates the pattern of growth in the
Indian pulp and paper industry since 1950.

2.09      As the above table shows, the period 1977-1979 saw a rather rapid
increase in the number of small plants, with 26 new plants coming on stream of
an average annual capacity of less than 10,000 tons per unit. As further
discussed below (paras. 2.24-2.27), these developments were the- direct



- 5 -
outcome of Government policies designed specifically to stimulate expansion of
the industry, that were biased in favor of small-scale producers. The table
also shows a decline in capacity utilization over the past two years. Although
a number of the newly installed mills are suffering from shortages of raw
materials, this trend is also a reflection of the rapid expansion of capacity
and the fact that many of the new mills are still in their start-up phase. As
further discussed in para. 2.24, almost all of the existing capacity is in
the private sector, whereas most of the new capacity which will come on stream
in the next 2-3 years will be in the public sector.
D. Fibrous Raw Material Supply
2.10      The development of India's pulp and paper industry has largely
been governed by the nature and location of the rather limited domestic
supplies of fibrous raw materials which are available for paper-making.
Government policies for the development of the sector have been shaped by these
considerations. For an assessment of the sector, it is therefore important
to understand the fibrous raw material supply situation.
2.11     The pulp and paper industry consumes about 2.5 million tons of
fibrous raw materials annually, in approximately the following proportions:
India - Fibrous Raw Materials for Paper-Making (1979-80)
Fiber                      %
Bamboo                        65
Indigenous Hardwoods          20
Grass                           6
Bagasse                         3
Coniferous Woods                1
Other                           5
Total                    100
1.  Bamboo
2.12      As noted above (para. 2.07), bamboo provided the basic raw material
for the expansion of India's pulp and paper industry in the past and it is
still by far the most important fiber used by the industry today. Bamboo
contains a unique combination of short and long fibers, and is thus well
suited for the manufacture of a wide range of paper and paperboard grades.



-6-
2.13      Bamboo grows as an understory in India's natural forests, where it
covers some 10 million hectares (ha), mostly in the states of Madhya Pradesh,
Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Almost all of
the bamboo is owned by the various State Governments who control its allocation
to users. Actual production is about 3.0 million tpy, of which some 50% is
utilized by the paper industry; potential production is estimated at 5.5
million tpy. Although there would therefore appear to be ample unutilized
bamboo, which could support further expansion of the pulp and paper industry,
the further use of bamboo is inhibited by a number of factors including:
(i) Accessibility. About two thirds of the unutilized bamboo is in the
relatively remote areas of Assam and Tripura, where the costs of
establishing new mills are high. Nevertheless, the Government is
establishing two mills in Assam which will utilize about 0.4 million
tpy of bamboo;
(ii) Competing Uses. In Indian villages, bamboo is widely used in house
construction for reinforcing inside walls, for roofing, for partitions,
and for door and window frames. The State Governments give priority
to these uses, and this has tended to restrict the supply of bamboo
available to paper mills in some areas. Bamboo is also used in urban
areas, on construction sites for scaffolding and for other temporary
structures. Given the high price of substitutes (hardwoods, steel),
users of bamboo for this purpose can readily attract supplies away
from the paper producers; and
(iii) Gregarious Flowering. The bamboo plant of any given species flowers
on an unpredictable schedule (10-40 years) and then dies. Subsequently,
for 5-6 years, until the bamboo re-establishes itself, a paper mill
may be without any fiber.l/ There is clearly reluctance to make
major investments in new large plants where there is a risk of
bamboo flowering.
2.14      Although, as noted, the Government is establishing new paper mills in
remote areas where bamboo is still available in excess of current requirements,
opportunities for any major expansion of the industry using this raw material are
limited. Most new developments are, therefore, likely to be based on other
types of fiber such as plantation wood, or bagasse, as further discussed
below.
1/  The situation is often mitigated when a mill is using more than one species
of bamboo, as different species flower on different cycles. Otherwise the
mill would have to look for other types of fiber, import pulp, or shut
down.

2. Wood
2.15      In India, wood represents the second most important raw material
for paper making, and for many grades of paper, a mixture of bamboo and
hardwoods provides an optimum quality product. Although forests (largely
State-Government controlled) cover some 70 million ha, or about 20% of the
land area of the country, only about half of this area is classified as
"productive" forest. Most regions of the country are desperately short of
wood for fuel (for cooking, and in some areas, for heating), for construction
purposes, and for pulp and paper production. About one quarter of the total
forest land is in Madhya Pradesh; other states with significant forests are
Orissa, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh (each with about 9% of the national
total), Arunachal Pradesh (7%), and Uttar Pradesh (6%).  The area of forest
land is shrink ng due to overcutting, conversion to agriculture, inundation
through the implementation of irrigation schemes, and the construction of
roads, power lines, towns and factories.
2.16      Total wood consumption, representing both recorded and unrecorded
removals, is estimated at 215 million cubic meters per year (m3py), of which
less than half of 1% is used by the paper industry. Reliable production and
consumption statistics are scarce but an approximate balance is as follows:
India - Production and Consumption of Wood
(million m3py)
Production                        Consumption
Indigenous hardwoods  213.0         Fuel                  200.0
Coniferous woods         2.0        Sawnwood               10.0
Posts and poles        4.0
Pulpwood               0.7
Panels                 0.3
Totals (rounded)      215.0                              215.0
2.17      The use of indigenous hardwoods for paper manufacture is relatively
new in India. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken which
demonstrates that most of the 600 species of hardwood found in India can be
used, in mixtures with bamboo, to make good quality paper. However, except
in relatively sparsely populated areas (such as the Bastar region of Madhya
Pradesh), the pressure of demand for other uses, particularly fuel, will
continue to place serious constraints on the availability of hardwoods
for paper manufacture. Coniferous woods are by far the best and most



- 8 -
versatile raw material for papermaking, particularly for newsprint, and for
grades of paper where strength is a primary requirement, such as kraft paper
for cement sacks. In India, however, most coniferous forests are found in
the remote areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh, where substan-
tial investment in infrastructure would be required to increase extraction.
Moreover, the coniferous species are so valuable as a raw material for
sawnwood production, that only poor quality logs together with logging and
sawmill residues, should be used as a raw material for paper-making. Expanded
use of indigenous coniferous wood for the paper industry can, therefore,
only be considered as an adjunct to expanded logging and sawmilling operations.
2.18      It is apparent that opportunities to expand wood-based production
of paper in India are limited by the availability of forests, by the cost
of access to those forests which are at present underutilized and, most
importantly, by competition from other end-uses. Some progress in expanding
wood supplies for paper-making has been made by State-sponsored plantation
schemes, and by companies which are encouraging small landholders to plant
fast-growing species, such as eucalyptus, in areas adjacent to their mills.l/
However, such schemes have relatively long gestation periods, and are possible
only where suitable land is available. The opportunities for expanding wood-based
paper production, at least for the short term, are limited.
3. Bagasse
2.19      India is one of the world's largest sugarcane producers.  If all
of the cane produced were crushed, and the bagasse made available for paper
production, this fiber could support an output of about 7 million tons of
paper annually, or almost six times present domestic consumption. In fact,
only about one third of the available sugarcane is delivered to organized
sugar mills, the balance being processed in small village crushing units.
Moreover, most of the bagasse which is produced in sugar mills is used
internally as fuel for generating process steam. Although about five paper
mills have been constructed in India with the intention of using bagasse for
at least part of their fibrous raw material, only one is using bagasse on a
large scale today.2/ Apart from the bias in favor of small-scale printing and
writing paper production inherent in existing regulations (paras. 2.24 and
2.26), the principal reasons for this lack of widespread use are:
1/ In Tamilnadu, for example, the Tamilnadu Forest Plantations Corporation
(TAFCORN) supplies plantation eucalyptus to the Project Consultant's (SPB)
paper mill, and will supply the Project with eucalyptus to complement the
bagasse fiber. In addition, SPB operates its own nurseries, provides
seedlings to local landholders, and undertakes to buy the resulting pulpwood.
2/ The Mandya National Paper Mills Ltd. in Karnataka produces about 11,000
tpy of printing and writing paper from 95% bagasse pulp. At one time SPB
was supplying oil to a sugar mill, in order to release bagasse for its
paper mill operations, but the high cost of oil (the boiler could not
burn alternative fuels) forced an end to this exchange. SPB continues
to use a small quantity of surplus bags3se.



-9-
(i) Sugar mills in India are generally small. A mill, or concentration
of mills, crushing approximately 12,000 tons of cane per day would
be required to support a paper mill of 80,000 tons annual capacity.
This constellation rarely exists;
(ii)  The sugar mill owners are concerned about giving up a fuel (bagasse)
over which they have direct control for another fuel (coal) where
they must rely on others, such as mining and transportation
agencies, to ensure supplies; and
(iii)  The private sector, which until recently has implemented almost
all of the expansion in the pulp and paper industry in India, has
been reluctant to take responsibility for the investments and
coordination which a bagasse-based project requires.
2.20      Nonetheless, the Government is determined to stimulate the expansion of
bagasse-based paper manufacture for the following reasons:
(i) As noted above (paras. 2.12-2.18) supplies of bamboo and wood for
paper-making from natural forests are becoming increasingly tight,
and opportunities for significant expansion of capacity in the
short and medium term, based on these traditional raw materials,
are limited;
(ii)  Bagasse is an annual crop generated on land already dedicated to
sugar production. Unlike forest plantations, no new areas of land
need be set aside for fiber production;
(iii) As demonstrated in Mexico, Peru, the Philippines and elsewhere,
bagasse is well suited for the production of a wide range of paper
grades; and
(iv)  Coal, which can be used in the sugar mills to economically replace
bagasse as fuel, is available in India, although supply and
delivery problems cannot be ignored as further discussed in paras.
5.17-5.19.
2.21      To conclude, despite the impediments listed above (para. 2.19),
it is clear that if India is to remain largely and economically self-sufficient
in paper production, bagasse is one of the few domestic fibers of suitable
quality and quantity to support the necessary expansions.



- 10 -
4. Other Fibers and Conrclusions
2.22      Other fibers now used in India for paper manufacture include grass, straw,
jute, cotton linters and waste paper. Although in certain locations, and under
certain circumstances, expansions based on these materials will be possible, none is
capable of producing paper in the quantities and of the quality required for India's
growing domestic market.
2.23      From the foregoing it is apparent that future expansion of the industry is
likely to be based on indigenous wood and bamboo in the few areas where such resources
are still available, on plantation wood in areas where suitable land can be allocated
for this purpose, and on bagasse, provided that the economics of fuel replacement can
be sustained.
E. Government Sectoral Development Policies
2.24      In the early 1970s there was a worldwide shortage of paper, and India faced
extreme difficulties in importing newsprint, and even the marginal requirements of
printing and writing paper, to supplement its domestic production. Private investment
in the pulp and paper industry was lagging as a result of rising costs, shortages of
accessible fiber, and Government controls on prices and production which had led to
serious financial problems in the industry. Concerned that shortages of paper would
constrain the country's educational and commercial development, the Government initi-
ated a number of important actions aimed at stimulating the sector's growth. Speci-
fically:
(i)   The wholly Government-owned Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited
(HPC) was created with the objective of establishing new pulp and
paper mills in the country. HPC has taken over (and is now expand-
ing) one ailing mill from the private sector, and is implementing
four other large (average capacity 80,000 tpy) projects, which will
be coming on stream in the next 1-2 years. Of the 500,000 tpy of
new capacity coming on stream in the next two years, HPC accounts
for 320,000 tons or 64%; by 1983 HPC will be the largest single
producer in the country;l/
(ii)  In order to stimulate private sector development of mills using raw
materials other than bamboo and wood, such mills have been exempted
from between 33.3% and 75% (depending on the mill size, with the
larger exemptions going to smaller mills) of the excise duties which
would otherwise be levied on their production. Small mills are also
relieved of the requirement to sell part of their printing and writ-
ing paper production at concessional prices (para. 2.26);
1/ Implementation of these large projects by HPC has not been problem-free;
cost overruns and delays are apparent in all four'projects. The Government
is not considering further expansion of HPC's role until those projects now
being implemented are in operation.



- 11 -
(iii)   In order to stimulate developments based on bagasse, a mill pro-
ducing paper containing at least 75% bagasse will, for an initial
period of three years beginning in December 1981, receive excise
duty exemptions, and exemption from production and sales controls;
and
(iv)   Mills designed to produce newsprint have been declared priority
investments and hence allowed to import equipment at a concessional
rate of duty. Furthermore, a 15% import duty (5% in the case of
small newspapers) has been levied on imported newsprint.
2.25      These measures have resulted in a rapid expansion in the sector,
as illustrated both by the substantial additions to capacity experienced in
the past 2-3 years, and by those projected for the next several years.
F. Production and Pricing Controls
2.26      In order to ensure availability of certain educational grades of paper,
the Government has instituted some mandatory production requirements which affect
most mills:l/
(i)   Although the domestic price of most grades of paper is not now
controlled by the Government and in fact is close to international
prices (paras. 4.16 and 4.18), mills with a capacity in excess of
10,000 tpy of printing and writing paper, must make 30% of their
production as white printing paper, to Government specifications,
and deliver it to specified consumers of educational paper at a
fixed price. This price is currently Rs 3,500/ton (US$438) which
is about 50% of the free market price net of excise duty for
similar grades; and
(ii)   These same mills must produce five other specified grades of print-
ing and writing paper to the extent of an additional 33% of produc-
tion, although this production can be sold freely on the open mar-
ket.
2.27      Apart from white printing paper, paper prices are free to float with sup-
ply and demand. Imports are strictly controlled, but the prices (including excise
duty) prevailing in the Indian domestic market are about the same as the notional
duty-free import parity prices (paras. 4.16 and 4.18). Excise duties are applied
to domestic production at rates which generally range from 20-40% depending on the
type of paper. However, no excise duty is applied to newsprint and, as noted in
para. 2.24, certain small mills and mills using primarily bagasse as their fibrous
raw material are exempt from some or all excise duty on printing and writing papers,
as well as the mandatory production requirements noted above.
1/ These provisions do not apply to mills using "unconventional" raw materials
(including bagasse) for at least 75% of their fibrous raw material, nor to
new mills, for at least the first five years of operation.

G. Bank Role and Involvement of Other Lending Agencies
2.28      To date the Bank has not financed any projects in India's pulp and paper
sector. However, in addition to the Tamilnadu Project being considered here, the
Bank has been actively involved in the preparation of a project in the Bastar region
of Madhya Pradesh, and has helped to finance a detailed feasibility study for that
project, through the Madhya Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project (Credit
609-IN). Although the study has been completed, and further consideration by the
Bank is planned, certain outstanding issues (in particular those related to the
project's environmental and social impact) have yet to be resolved. The Bank is
also proposing to undertake an overall review of the pulp and paper sub-sector in
India, beginning early in 1982.
2.29      Given the growing shortage of traditional fibers for local paper manufac-
ture, and the widening gap between demand and supply of major paper categories an-
ticipated in the second half of the decade and thereafter (paras. 4.06 and 4.09),
the proposed Project will provide a model for the successful transfer of bagasse
from energy generation in sugar mills, to a more economic use in the production of
paper, in line with Government objectives (paras. 1.02 and 2.24). Furthermore, if
the process to produce newsprint is successful (paras. 5.02-5.08), it will provide
a prototype for bagasse-based newsprint production, not only for India, but for the
developing world in general. Thus, indirectly, it will both promote India's abili-
ty to offer technical assistance, and the Bank's ability to assist other developing
countries to develop bagasse-based newsprint manufacturing capacity.
2.30      Swedish bilateral assistance is helping in the modernization of India's
sole newsprint mill, the HPC owned Nepa Mill in Madhya Pradesh (para. 4.08). The
Canadian International Development Agency is identifying suitable areas for invest-
ment. In addition, the UNDP and FAO are assisting the Government in the preparation
of a detailed study of various fibrous raw materials for paper-making.
III. THE SPONSOR
A. Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Limited
3.01      The Project sponsor is Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Limited (TNPL)
which is a Public Limited Company, promoted by the Government of Tamilnadu. TNPL
was incorporated on April 16, 1979.   The shareholders of TNPL will be the Govern-
ment of Tamilnadu (47.4%), a consortium of Indian financial institutions (46.6%)
(para. 1.01), two cooperative sugar mills who will be supplying bagasse to the
Project (3.7%), and SPB (2.3%). The affairs of the Company are currently managed
by a Board of five Directors, appointed by the Tamilnadu State Government, includ-
ing the Managing Director of SPB who is Chairman of the Board of TNPL. The Board
will be expanded by the addition of four Directors to be appointed by the Indian
Financial Institutions, and two non-official individuals to be appointed by TNPL.
The Executive Director is the Commissioner and Secretary of the Tamilnadu Govern-
ment in the Department of Industry, and is also on the boards of a number of State
industrial enterprises.



- 13 -
3.02      Efficient management of the new enterprise is clearly essential for
successful project implementation and operation. The Government of Tamilnadu
and IDBI have agreed that as principal shareholders of TNPL, they will take
or cause to be taken all such action as may be appropriate to maintain the pro-
fessional character of the management of TNPL. In this regard, both the Gov-
ernment of Tamilnadu and IDBI have agreed that their respective equity share-
holdings in TNPL will be maintained at less than 50%. The Chairman, the Ex-
ecutive Director and the Project Manager have already been appointed (paras.
3.01 and 5.25), and are all experienced individuals of high professional stand-
ing. Other professionals capable of fulfilling day-to-day management functions
have been identified.  Assurances have been received from the Government of
Tamilnadu and IDBI that in addition to these organizational undertakings, they
will assist TNPL in meeting its obligations with respect to the Project.
B. Seshasayee Paper & Boards Limited
3.03      As previously noted (para. 1.03), most of the planning for the
Project, as well as the feasibility study, was carried out for TNPL by
Seshasayee Paper & Boards Ltd. (SPB). SPB operates successfully a 55,000 tpy
paper mill at Erode in Tamilnadu. This company, which was established in 1960,
is owned 30% by the Government of Tamilnadu through the Tamilnadu Industrial
Investment Corporation, 20% by Indian financial institutions and the remaining
50% by over 12,000 private shareholders. SPB has been retained as Project
Consultant to TNPL and, as noted above, the Managing Director of SPB has been
appointed to the position of Chairman of the Board of TNPL. SPB will continue
to be retained as Project Consultant to TNPL, and will act on its behalf through
the implementation and the first five years of operation of the Project. A
detailed description of the proposed arrangements for project implementation,
including the roles of SPB and TNPL, is contained in Chapter V.
3.04      SPB established the first integrated paper mill in Tamilnadu, pulp-
ing a mixture of bamboo, bagasse and mixed hardwoods. The plant has been ex-
panded twice from its original capacity of 20,000 tpy and is now one of the
most profitable pulp and paper companies in India. The most recent expansion
was planned and implemented by a team of technical and financial executives,
who now form the nucleus of the TNPL Project team. The expansion was complet-
ed ahead of schedule in 1979, at slightly less than the budget estimate of
some Rs 180 million (US$22 million equivalent). SPB has both the capability
and the staff to provide adequate support to TNPL during implementation and
operation of the proposed Project.

4.02      From 1970 to 1975 production increased at an average annual rate of only
about 2% (as shown in para. 2.08, only 16 small mills were constructed during
this period). However, since 1975, as a result of the Government's programs
to stimulate new capacity, production has been increasing at an average annual
rate of 5.6%. As more new mills come on stream over the next three years,
domestic production is expected to expand by about 10% a year.

b/  Newsprint represents about 90% of all imports.
4.04      This data shows the steady increase in paper consumption over the
period (averaging 6.4% annually); the effect of the Government's ban on exports
to try to ease the domestic supply situation; and the rapidly increasing level
of imports (primarily newsprint) required to supply growing domestic demand.
B.   Printa-ig a   tiriting Paper
4.05       Printing and writing papers represent about 45% of all paper consump-
tion in India and 57% of domestic production. The Government considers this
grade the most strategically important. Regulations require compulsory produc-
tion of certain grades (para. 2.26), and the Government has, from time to time,
imposed price con:rols as well as temporary restrictions on the use of paper
for such non-essen.ial purposes as calendars, diaries, etc. At the present time,
shortages of printing and writing grades are occurring, and the Government has
been forced to make arrangements, through the State Trading Corporation, for im-
ports. The imported paper is being distributed, through the marketing network
of the Hindustan Paper Corporation, at a fixed price which is essentially the
same as the free malrket price for domestically produced grades.
4.06      Actual growth in consumption during the period 1974-1979, was 5.5% per
annum implying a demand elasticity with respect to GNP of about 1.7.  This rate of
growth was close to the official Government projections for the period.  The offi-
cial projections contained in the sixth Five-Year Plan, 1979-84, indicate an aver-
age anriual increase in demand of 6.5% through 1984, falling to 5.8% in each of the

subsequent five years (through 1989). These projections have been reviewed by
Bank staff, and are realistic. Using them, and taking into account known
capacity additions (including the Tamilnadu Project being considered here), the
supply gap which will have to be met from either imports or other new projects,
is shown below:

b/  Including the Project.  Calculated assuming projected start-up
dates and normal production build-up to 90% of rated capacity
(55% in the first year, 70% in the second year, 80% in the third
year and 90% thererafter) for new projects now under construc-
tion or in advanced stages of planning.
4.07     These projections indicate that as HPC's large new projects are brought on
stream through 1982, supply and demand will remain more or less in balance. However,
by 1984 (when the proposed Tamilnadu Project will be starting up), shortages will
begin to recur, and capacity additions of at least 40,000 tpy will be required in
each year after 1984, to keep domestic production capacity in line with demand.
Because of the relatively long lead time required to establish a pulp and paper
plant, new projects would now have to be in the advanced planning stage if they are
to help close the supply gap projected for the mid-1980s. Apart from the Tamilnadu
Project, the only substantial capacity addition planned is that of the Madhya
Pradesh Pulp and Paper Project, which could add 50,000 tpy to printing and writing
paper capacity in 1985 or 1986. Even if this timing is achieved (and assuming the
Tamilnadu Project comes. on stream in 1984) no problem is foreseen in finding a
domestic market for the 40,000 tpy of printing and writing paper to be produced by
the Project. In the unlikely event that the market does not develop as quickly as
envisaged, India is in a good position to resume exporting small quantities of
surplus paper to neighboring countries.



- 17 -
C. Newsprint
4.08      The present annual newsprint consumption in India is about 300,000
tons, while the effective capacity of the only operating newsprint mill in
the country (the Nepa mill in Madhya Pradesh) is about 60,000 tpy. This
mill is over 20 years old, and is currently able to produce only about
45,000 tpy, as paper and pulping capacities are unbalanced, and the power
and steam supply is inadequate. A modernization program assisted by SIDA
(para. 2.30) has almost been completed and production should expand to about
60,000 tpy by 1981.
4.09     Two newsprint mills (based on wood) are presently under construction.
HPC's Kerala newsprint mill has a projected output of 80,000 tpy, and is ex-
pected to start up in late 1981; Mysore Paper Mills, a public sector company
of the Government of the State of Karnataka, is constructing a 65,000 tpy news-
print mill which is also scheduled to come on stream towards the end of 1981.
No official forecasts of newsprint demand have been prepared and the best es-
timate of future growth is probably the 8% annual rate experienced over the
past decade. However, even if a much more conservative growth rate of 5% is
assumed, a substantial domestic supply gap will develop, as illustrated below:

4.10     The new newsprint mills coming on stream will reduce imports
required to meet domestic demand, but as the above table indicates there
should be little difficulty in marketing the 50,000 tpy of newsprint from
the TNPL Project, particularly as there is every indication that its quality
will be superior to that from any of the other Indian producers.



- 18 -
D. Marketing and Distribution
4.11      TNPL's printing and writing paper will be marketed through a network of
agents, covering the entire country. This system is similar to that used by SPB to
market the 55,000 tons of paper produced each year by its Erode Mill. Price lists
are established on an ex-factory basis. Typically, the agent receives the order and
passes it to the mill, where arrangements are made for direct shipment to the customer,
who must pay the freight costs. Depending on the financial standing of the customer,
immediate payment for the order in advance of shipment may be required, or credit for
30-45 days may be extended. The agent takes the risk of late payment or nonpayment in
cases where credit is extended.  Agents' commissions normally range from 3-1/2 to 10%
of the ex-factory price. In the estimates prepared for this Project, a 5% commission
on sales of printing and writing paper has been allowed.
4.12     The marketing of newsprint in India is controlled by the Government through
the Registrar of Newspapers, which allocates Nepa's production and imports to newspapers,
periodicals and magazines, in an attempt to distribute the various qualities equitably.
Once the allocation has been made (generally annually), consumers must deal directly
with the producer. Because of these arrangements, selling expenses for newsprint are
minimal. A nominal allowance of Rs 50 per ton has been included in the estimates
prepared for the Project. Most shipments will be made by rail, although trucking is
envisaged to customers close to the mill.
E. Prices
1. General Market Influences
4.13       About 75% of the world's pulp and paper is produced and consumed in
Western Europe and North America, hence international prices are largely determined
by supply and demand balances within and between these regions. Although prices have
in general kept pace with inflation through the past decade, there is considerable
fluctuation around the longer term trend caused by short-term imbalances. Frequently,
the magnitude of price variations is greater for exports to developing countries;
these markets are less significant from the Western European and North American pro-
ducers' point of view and in times of even modest shortage, prices can rise by as
much as 50%. Conversely, in periods of oversupply, producers may lower prices for
developing country markets while simultaneously trying to hold price levels in their
principal markets. In comparing domestic prices with import parity prices under
these circumstances, it is important to determine whether the prices of imported
paper at any given point in time are above, below or at the long-term trend levels.
4.14     The current situation in the market for printing and writing paper reflects
a number of structural changes which are taking place in the industry. Many Scandina-
vian producers of pulp have decided to increase the value added to their scarce wood
resources by making paper rather than just pulp. Consequently, they are integrating
downstream and building new paper mills at an unprecedented rate. Thus, while in
1979 the industry enjoyed one of its best years, by mid-1980 the first signs of an



- 19 -
oversupply situation were in evidence, and the first 2-3 months of 1981 saw
prices for printing and writing grades in European markets dropping by as
much as 20%. The European CIF price for wood-free printing paper, for
example, dropped from over US$800 in June 1980 to as little as US$700 in
March 1981 although it has subsequently recovered substantially. The
long-term trend price (in 1981 prices), and the price which also yields
customary returns on investment, is of the order of US$800 per ton, which
equates to a landed cost in India of US$950 (Rs 7,600) per ton. The North
American market is virtually self-sufficient and the price for similar
grades has not declined in parallel with that of the European market. The
current deiivered price for printing paper in the US is about US$830 per
ton, which is close to the long-term trend.
4.15      For newsprint, the situation is somewhat different.  The long-term
trend price and that necessary to cover costs and yield customary returns on
investment is about US$550. However, current delivered prices in both the
USA and Europe are only of the order of US$520. These prices are holding
firm, despite the general downward movement in prices of some other grades.
However, a number of new mills are under construction in the USA, and demand
forecasts suggest a considerable excess of supply over demand in North
America in the next few years. This will lead to more aggressive marketing
of Canadian newsprint in foreign markets. Under these circumstances, the
current price, which is about 5% less than the long-term trend price, is
likely to continue to hold (in real terms) for the next several years. This
price (US$520 per ton) equates to an import parity price in India of some
US$700 (Rs 5,600) per ton.
2. Printing and Writing Paper
4.16       In India, the prices of most grades of printing and writing paper
are freely set by the leading producers on an informal basis, at levels
which cover costs and allow for nominal dividends of approximately 12%. The
current list price for a standard creamwove grade is Rs 6,100 (US$760) per
ton, which, with a 20% excise duty, gives an ex-factory price to the consumer
of Rs 7,320 (US$915) per ton. This price (and the price for other grades
of printing and writing paper) is close to the landed (duty-free) cost of
equivalent imported grades (para. 4.14). For the proposed Project, TNPL has
prepared a projected grade mix, which includes sheets cut to size as well as
specialized grades of printing and writing paper.  The ex-factor prices of
these grades vary from about Rs 7,000-8,750 per ton, giving a weighted
average price for the projected product mix, after deducting a 5% sales com-
mission, of Rs 8,040 (US$1,005) per ton. These prices are based on paper
produced from a normal (in India) fiber mix of wood and bamboo. Paper pro-
duced from bagasse is likely to be of somewhat higher quality but no price
differential on this account could probably be sustained and none has been
assumed.



- 20 -
4.17       As noted previously (para. 2.26), the larger mills producing
printing and writing paper must sell 30% of their production to designated
(primarily educational) customers, at a concessional price of Rs 3,500
(US$438) per ton. However, as an incentive to use bagasse, any mill producing
paper containing more than 75% bagasse is exempt from this requirement. More
importantly, the incentives announced by the Government to encourage the
establishment of bagasse-based projects also include exemptions from excise
duty.l/ With these exemptions, paper from mills using bagasse as their
primary fibrous raw material is sold at prices competitive with those of
other mills, where a 20% excise duty is included, but some or all of the
excise duty is not paid. The concessions are of benefit to all mills using
bagasse as well as to the Project, the price of paper from these mills
to the consumers is the same as from other types of mills, and close to the
duty-free import parity price. The concessions thus amount to the removal
of artificial price distortions rather than creation of protection. The
weighted average net price for the proposed product mix (Rs 8,040 per ton -
para. 4.16) is, therefore, used for both the financial and economic analyses
of the project.
3. Newsprint
4.18       The current price of newsprint in India is not controlled, and
fluctuates with international prices as described above (para. 4.13). A
15% customs duty was placed on newsprint imports in March 1981. The current
average CIF price (before duty) of imported newsprint is Rs 5,030 (US$630)
per ton. This price is based on imports from a variety of sources, includ-
ing the USSR and Bangladesh, and relates to a lower overall blend of quali-
ties than is found in European and North American markets. Because of this
quality differential, the average duty-free price is about 10% lower than
the current import parity price of Rs 5,600 (US$700) per ton (para. 4.15).
The newsprint produced by the Project should be of higher quality than the
newsprint imported from Bangladesh and the Soviet Union and could substitute
for newsprint imported at Rs 5,600 per ton. Accordingly a duty free price
of Rs 5,600 has been used in the economic analysis. In the financial analy-
sis however, to be conservative, and since it is not clear to what extent
the market is willing to pay for quality improvement, the prevailing duty
free import price of Rs 5,030 has been used as a basis for calculating
financial prices. After adding 15% duty and deducting Rs 50 per ton selling
expenses (para. 4.12), the net ex-factory price of newsprint is Rs 5,740 per
ton.
1/  The exemption currently amounts to 100% of excise duty up to December
1983, and is likely to be extended beyond that date. If there is no
extension, the exemption would drop to 33.3% of excise duty. The
financial implications of these policies are examined in the sensitivity
analysis (para 7.08).

V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The-Project consists of the establishment of an integrated pulp and paper
mill, which, operating at 90% of design capacity, could produce 100,000 tpy of news-
print or 80,000 tpy of printing and writing paper, or any intermediate combination
of the two, using bagasse (about 80% overall) and eucalyptus (20%) as fibrous raw
materials. Facilities to be provided include: bagasse depithing equipment and a
chemical pulp mill for bagasse, chipping equipment and a chemical pulp mill for wood,
full chemical recovery facilities, a bleach plant, a dual-purpose paper machine and
associated stock preparation equipment, pollution abatement facilities, and some
supporting infrastructure. In addition, coal handling equipment and coal-fired
boilers will be installed and operated at five sugar mills, to release bagasse for
use in the paper mill. At full production, a product mix of 50,000 tpy of newsprint
and 40,000 tpy of printing and writing paper is envisaged. This mix is arbitrary,
and can be adjusted to meet technical and market requirements.l/ The mill will be
located near the town of Pugalur, in central Tamilnadu State, about 300 km southwest
of Madras (IBRD Map 15475R). The site has good road and rail links with the rest of
the country.
A. Project Concept and Choice of Technology
5.02      The Project was conceived specifically to meet the Government's twin
objectives of expanding production of both newsprint and printing and writing paper,
and of utilizing bagasse as a fibrous raw material. Bagasse has been widely used to
produce printing and writing paper in other parts of the world, and to some extent in
India, but its use for the production of newsprint is relatively novel. The additional
investment required to permit such production, is however only about US$8 million
equivalent, or about 3% of the Project's total financing requirement. Further, such
investment is concentrated in ancillary pulping equipment which is bypassed during
the production of printing and writing paper, such that were it to fail, the Company
could readily switch to printing and writing paper production. The process of
switching from one grade to another takes only a few hours. Furthermore if the mill
was totally unsuccessful in producing newsprint, this would be at the cost of only
minor lost investment. The plant could concentrate on the production of printing and
writing paper (80,000 tpy) for which a ready market exists (para. 4.06), and under
which circumstances the projected financial and economic performance would be
entirely satisfactory (paras. 7.08 and 8.03). Notwithstanding the existence of this
secure fall-back position, particular attention was devoted to the technological
aspects of bagasse based newsprint production, throughout Project preparation.
5.03      There is a long history of efforts to produce newsprint from bagasse.
Experimental tests in the USA, France and the Caribbean, date back to the nineteenth
century, but they generally involved full chemical cooks on bagasse from which the
pith (the nonfibrous component) had not been removed and the results were less than
satisfactory. Then, in the 1950s, trials of four processes using bagasse for newsprint
production were initiated in the USA. All four processes involved chemical pulping
1/ However, these tonnages are contained in the Industrial Licence issued by the
Government of India to TNPL and cannot be changed without prior approval of
the Government.



- 22 -
of bagasse, (from which little or none of the pith had been removed) and the
addition of clay filler and titanium dioxide to the sheet, to improve
opacity and to reduce printing show-through from one side of the sheet to
the other. Although the results of these trials were mixed, they led to the
construction of two commercial bagasse-based newsprint mills in the 1950s.
A 100 tpd mill in Cuba, which depithed much of the bagasse and used large
amounts of clay and other fillers, proved too expensive to operate and soon
switched to the production of printing and writing paper. A second, 60 tpd
mill in Louisiana, tried to operate without depithing but results were not
encouraging. Subsequently, full depithing was added, and the mill switched
to the production of printing and writing papers. Other trials for the
production of newsprint from bagasse were carried out in Peru, Sweden, the
USA, Germany and India. In most cases full chemical pulping was used but the
products were less than satisfactory, usually because of high cost, low
opacity and poor printability.
5.04      In the early 1960s, a new process was developed by Dr. D.S. Cusi
of Mexico, which essentially involves the pre-impregnation and partial
cooking of bagasse, andthe separation, by screening, of the pulp into two
fractions. One fraction comprises fibers which have been chemically separated
as a result of the cook, while the other consists of screen rejects which
can be refined to provide the mechanical proportion of the pulp fed to the
paper machine. The two components are recombined, chemical woodpulp (up to
20%) is added to improve strength, and small amounts of filler and mineral
are added to increase opacity. Successful experimental runs were conduct-
ed using this process, and two new newsprint mills, each of 100,000 tpy
capacity (Sociedad Paramonga Ltda. at Trupal, Peru, and Mexicana de Papel
Periodico near Vera Cruz, Mexico) have recently commenced operations.
5.05      In 1979, the mills in Peru and Mexico were visited by TNPL and
SPB.  The mill in Peru was found to be producing a satisfactory grade of
paper for use as newsprint, using 85% bagasse pulp and 15% kraft pulp.
However, because of equipment problems, neither the impregnation nor the
fractionation--essential components of the Cusi process--were being properly
utilized. The bagasse pulp was thus essentially a full chemical pulp, and
so production costs were high. Equipment modifications are, however, in
progress, which should enable the plant to operate according to its ori-
ginal design parameters, and to produce a high-yield bagasse pulp at lower
production costs. The Mexican mill is similar to the mill in Peru, but
started up only in August 1979, and was not in full operation at the time of
the TNPL Project team's visit. Nevertheless, it was apparent that the
Mexican mill was encountering some of the same problems as the Peruvian mill
in the impregnation and fractionation stages. In view of these problems,
the mill is, for the moment, producing printing and writing paper alone, to
meet a large order from the Mexican Government. Plans to overcome equip-
ment deficiencies are under way.
5.06      The TNPL team held detailed discussions with mill personnel in
Peru and Mexico, with the designer of the process, Dr. Cusi, and with
engineers and equipment suppliers in the USA and Europe. As a result of
such discussions TNPL concluded that in principle, the Cusi process is
suitable for the production of newsprint and that most of the problems in
both Peru and Mexico stemmed from lack of coordination among the various
suppliers of know-how, basic engineering and equipment. Moreover, in



- 23 -
discussions with one supplier it was postulated that one important modification to
the Cusi process, separation by screening of the bagasse into two fiber components
prior to any chemical treatment, would likely lead to reduction in process problems
while still achieving the objective of a high-yield low-cost bagasse pulp. Subse-
quent pilot scale trials carried out in the USA have demonstrated that this modifi-
cation is effective, and gives important side benefits in the chemical recovery pro-
cess. Trials are continuing with a view to further refining the design of the neces-
sary equipment but the basic decision to proceed with this process has been taken.
5.07      The Bank has made an independent assessment of the technology, beginning
with a review of the operation of the mills in Peru and Mexico. In September 1980,
a technical team consisting of a Bank consultant, and Bank staff visited both coun-
tries. The team's report (Project File, Item B4) concluded that on the basis of
experience to date, it is technically feasible to make newsprint using a substantial
proportion of bagasse pulp, that becau-se of equipment problems neither mill had yet
produced a satisfactory high-yield bagasse pulp, and that under these circumstances
newsprint production in both mills was not economic. In subsequent discussions,
the Bank's technical staff has reviewed TNPL's proposals in detail, and particular-
ly the changes proposed to overcome the problems experienced in the Peruvian and
Mexican mills. Visits were made to Dalton, Massachusetts and Beloit, Wisconsin to
monitor pilot-scale pulping and paper-making trials specific to the Project and
carried out by the Beloit Corporation. These trials were considered successful and
newsprint with good strength characteristics was produced. Opacity was slightly
lower than international standards but was not significantly deficient and was ful-
ly acceptable for the Indian market.l/ Although the newsprint ran well on the
experimental paper machine at a speed equal to that proposed for the Project ma-
chine, it is recognized that the bagasse pulp furnish has an inherently low wet
web strength and this shortcoming could contribute to more paper breaks than nor-
mal during commercial production.f The addition of 15% eucalyptus chemical pulp
is proposed to improve wet web strength, but if this addition proves inadequate,
the use of approximately 10% imported long fiber pulp would overcome the wet
strength problem.
5.08      Nevertheless, as noted in para. 5.02 if problems persist, and satisfac-
tory newsprint cannot be produced, the mill has been designed (and the market is
available) so that production could be 100% printing and writing paper.2/ The
justification for taking such risks as do remain is that if the technological
problems can be successfully overcome, the potential benefits to be obtained by
India and other developing countries with bagasse resources, are substantial.
B. Project Description
1. The Mill
5.09      It is planned that the mill will produce:  (i) 50,000 tpy of newsprint
from 85% high-yield bagasse pulp and 15% hardwood chemical pulp; and (ii) 40,000
tpy of printing and writing paper from 75% bagasse chemical pulp and 25% hardwood
chemical pulp. Bagasse chemical pulp an'U hardwood chemical pulp will be produced
using the conventional sulphate process. High-yield bagasse pulp for newsprint
production will be manufactured according to the prjcess described in para. 5.11.
1/ If considered essential, opacity could be substantially improved by using
about 10% mechanical wood pulp.
2/ The financial implications of this technological fall-back position are
examined in Chapter VII.



- 24 -
5.10      A suitable mill site has been acquired on the Cauvery River, near
Pugalur, at distances ranging from 5 to 140 km from five sugar mills, whose
combined crushing capacity is adequate to meet the bagasse requirements of the
Project (paras. 5.12 - 5.15).l/ The minimum flow in the Cauvery is of the
order of 15 cubic meters per second, some 15-20 times the mill process water
requirements, and the Tamilnadu Government has confirmed that the Company will
be permitted to draw water from the river to meet the full requirement of the
Project and its housing colony. The mill's requirement for purchased power will
be obtained from the 110 kilovolt (kV) substation at Pugalur. The population
in Pugalur, and other towns in the area, will provide a stable work force for
the mill, although certain categories of skilled and experienced workers will
have to be recruited from other regions. Staff housing and other social infra-
structure will be provided by the Project as further detailed in para. 5.23.
5.11      A detailed technical description of the plant is contained in the
feasibility study prepared by SPB (Project File, Item B1). Briefly, bagasse
will be depithed through a combination of moist and wet techniques to achieve
maximum depithing efficiency, and subsequently washed, prior to storing. From
storage piles, bagasse will be cleaned, compressed to a high consistency,
partially refined, and separated into a coarse fraction (about 65%) and a
fine fraction. The coarse fraction will then be cooked, washed and bleached
following normal bagasse pulping and bleaching procedures. The fine fraction
will be brightened, but not otherwise treated, and the two fractions will
then be recombined. Wood pulp will be produced in batch digesters, bleached,
and blended with the bagasse pulp in the stock preparation system ahead of
the paper machine. The paper machine will be a dual-purpose, twin-wire unit,
capable of producing either 300 tpd of newsprint or 240 tpd of printing and
writing paper. Services within the mill will include water and effluent
treatment plants, process steam and power supply systems, and maintenance and
technical support services. All of the specialized bagasse pulping equipment,
together with the paper machine and basic engineering services for the entire
Project will be provided by a consortium of engineers and equipment suppliers.
This package is central to the success of the Project, and thus the Project
sponsors, with their consultants and advisors, have gone to great lengths in
preparing the specifications for tender documents. Arrangements for the pro-
curement of this package are detailed in para. 6.08.
2. Fibrous Raw Material Supplies
5.12      Bagasse will be obtained from five sugar mills located in the vici-
nity of the paper mill site.  Information on the location and capacity of
these mills is shown on the following page:
1/ Three of the sugar mills are privately owned, the other two are coopera-
tives under the control of the State Government.

5.13      On average, sugarcane yields about 30% bagasse and thus these
five mills generate a total of some 485,000 tons of bagasse annually. The
owners of the Sakthi mill wish to reserve 60,000 tons of bagasse annually
for a small paper mill which they are planning to construct, but the balance
of 425,000 tons annually, which is more than sufficient to meet the Project's
requirements of 420,000 tons at full production, has been contracted for by
TNPL. Although there is little apparent safety margin in the proposed
bagasse supply, there are at least five more mills within a 150 km radius of
the plant site, from which additional bagasse could be obtained if required.
To assure this additional supply, TNPL has already entered into an agreement
with a sixth sugar mill (Arigna Anna Sugar Mills Ltd.) for about 50,000 tpy
of bagasse. It has no immediate plans to install the necessary boiler at
this mill as for the first several years of operation TNPL will be operating
at less than full production and the demand for bagasse will be correspond-
ingly reduced. Hence, during this period, both the supply of bagasse and the
mill's requirements will be closely monitored and, if necessary, arrangements
made to take deliveries of bagasse from the sixth sugar mill or others.
5.14      TNPL has agreed to use its best endeavors to secure and maintain
the necessary bagasse supplies. Agreements have been signed with each of
the sugar mills for the supply of all of their bagasse 1/ to the Project
provided that TNPL:
(i) Installs the necessary new coal-fired boilers and associated
equipment;
(ii) Accepts the responsibility for procuring and delivering coal to
these boilers, for operating the boilers, and thereby, for sup-
plying steam to the sugar mills, as and when required; and
(iii) Accepts the responsibility for handling bagasse at the sugar mills
and transporting it to the paper mill.
1/ With the exception of 60,000 tpy from Sakthi (para. 5.13).



- 26 -
The incentive for the sugar mills to go along with those arrangements is the
prospect of a steady and reliable steam supply at less cost.l/ Crucial to
the success of these arrangements is the ability of TNPL to ensure coal
deliveries, discussed in paras. 5.17 to 5.19. Assurances that TNPL can
continue operating in the event of a shortfall in bagasse, for whatever
reason, are discussed in para. 5.19.
5.15      A Bank consultant has undertaken a detailed study of arrangements
for the transportation of bagasse (Project File, Item B5). His study con-
cluded that although rail transportation would be feasible for shipping
bagasse from two of the sugar mills, the additional handling involved, and
the potential for delay and disruption of deliveries, would cause excessive
and unnecessary problems.  The road network in Tamilnadu is well developed,
and there is adequate local trucking capacity to handle the volume of bagasse
envisaged.  It has therefore, been decided that all bagasse will be delivered
by road, using contracted carriers.
5.16      The wood required by the Project will be supplied from the existing
plantations of the Tamilnadu Forest Plantations Corporation (TAFCORN)
centered about 150 km from Pugalur. TAFCORN is a State Government corporation
with some 32,000 ha currently planted with a eucalyptus hybrid. Eucalyptus
pulpwood is grown on a seven-year cycle, and by 1986, annual production will
have stabilized at a sustained yield of about 120,000 tons annually. The
Project will require about 60,000 tons of pulpwood a year at full capacity,
while SPB is currently consuming about 42,000 tons a year, from the same
plantation. The Tamilnadu Government has directed that these two operations
shall have first call on the resources of TAFCORN plantations. Bank staff
have reviewed the supply capability of TAFCORN's plantations, and concluded
that the margin of safety in the wood supply is adequate, especially since
the State Forest Department has an additional 30,000 ha of land under
productive eucalyptus plantations. The State Forests and Fisheries Department
has issued an order allotting 60,000 tpy of eucalyptus hybrid wood to the
Project, for 15 years beginning in the last quarter of 1983. The Government
of Tamilnadu has undertaken to ensure that adequate pulpwood is supplied to
the Project.
3. Coal and Lignite
5.17      At normal operating rates, the Project will consume some 150,000 tons
of coal annually for its own purposes, and be responsible for delivering an addi-
tional 20,000 tpy to contracted lime suppliers in the vicinity of the plant, and
160,000 tpy to the five sugar mills. In view of the chronic problems with the
supply and transportation of coal in India, this aspect of the Project has been
very carefully scrutinized by both the sponsors and the Bank. The delivery of
coal in India is planned so that supplies to given consumption centers are made
from designated sources. For consumers in southern India, the assigned source
of supply is the Singareni group of collieries, located in Andhra Pradesh, about
1/  At present, although the bagasse is "free", the sugar mills must pay for
the boiler maintenance and operation required to obtain steam.



- 27 -
1,000 km from Pugalur. However, production from this source is insufficient to
meet all demands in the designated supply area, so deliveries have to be augment-
ed with shipments from the coalfields of Coal India Limited in Bengal and Bihar,
which are between 1,750 km and 2,200 km from the proposed mill site.
5.18      In 1979, TNPL approached Singareni Collieries with a view to securing the
entire coal requirement of 330,000 tons annually from that source. In September
1980, after a number of discussions, Singareni confirmed that it would be able to
supply coal to the Project, but only to the extent of 150,000 tpy. A letter of
commitment has been signed for this amount. The Department of Coal in the Ministry
of Steel, Mines and Coal has decided that Coal India Limited should supply the
balance from one or more of the Talcher, Korba, Pench or Chanda coalfields, and the
contract has now been signed with Coal India for the supply of 190,000 tpy from
1983 onwards. Nonetheless, in view of the fact that some industries are not
receiving all of their contracted supplies of coal, TNPL has considered it prudent
to make arrangments for an alternative fuel--lignite--to cover a part of the total
fuel requirements, and the paper mill boilers are being designed to burn briquetted
lignite as well as coal. Lignite is available in substantial quantities from a
mine owned and operated by the Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. (NLC) which is a
Government-owned company. This mine is currently being expanded, and its capacity
is expected to increase from 3.6 to 6.5 million tons of lignite per year by the end
of 1982. This Company has briquetting and carbonization facilities within the
mining complex with a capacity of 327,000 tons per year. The briquetting facilities
were commissioned in 1965 and have sufficient spare capacity to meet a significant
part of the Project's requirement. The plant is approximately 200 km from Pugalur
(located in the State of Tamilnadu), and TNPL has obtained a letter from NLC for
the supply of 60,000 tons of lignite annually, equivalent in terms of heating
value, to almost one third of the total fuel requirements of the Project. The
price of briquetted lignite is presently under review by NLC, but it is expected
that it will be about 40% more expensive than coal (on an equivalent calorific
basis). In view of the fact that its use may be unavoidable in times of coal
shortage, the production cost estimates included in this appraisal report have been
prepared under the assumption that 27% of the total fuel requirements would be
supplied by lignite.
5.19      Coal demand at the TNPL mill itself will be uniform throughout the
year; but as the working season of the sugar mills is only 7-8 months annually,
the 160,000 tons of coal required by them must be made available during September
to February. To facilitate coordination, TNPL has decided to schedule deliveries
regularly over time, and to accumulate enough coal stocks in a dump at the paper
mill site to meet the sugar mills' requirements during the crushing season.
Deliveries from the coal fields to the coal dump will be by rail, and from the dump
to the sugar mills, by truck. These arrangements are satisfactory.   TNPL has
agreed to use its best endeavors to secure and maintain the necessary supplies of
coal and, in the event of any shortages, to procure lignite to cover the shortfall.
The Government of Tamilnadu has agreed to expand wood deliveries to the mill to
allow it to continue operating if for any reason coal supplies are disrupted



- 28 -
leading to a shortfall in bagasse deliveries to the mill.l/ The Government of
India has agreed to take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that
TNPL's annual demand for coal (and, if necessary, lignite) is met on schedule,
and that in the event of any temporary disruption in the operation of the mill
due to lack of fuel or technical problems with the furnish, TNPL is allowed to
procure alternative fuel or to import pulp in order to continue operating eco-
nomically.
4. Electric Power Supply
5.20      The mill turbo-generator will have a capacity of 17.5 MW, and the
Project will normally generate about 75% of its anticipated 19 MW load.   The
balance will be purchased from the Tamilnadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Power
in southern India has been in short supply in recent years, particularly during
the summer, but with new capacity coming on line in the next 2-3 years, TNEB
expects the region to be in balance, with even a slight surplus by 1984. In
any event, the high proportion of self-generation should largely insulate the
plant from upsets in the grid, and by careful control of loads, the plant should
be able to operate for extended periods on its own power supply. The mill site
is located about 1 km from the existing Pugalur substation, and TNEB will pro-
vide a 110 kV line from this station to the mill's proposed 30 MVA transformer.
Conversely with this capacity the plant will, if necessary, be able to operate
entirely from the grid.
5. Environmental Impact and Protection
5.21      The Government of India has issued standards for industrial efflu-
ents for discharge to inland surface waters. Insofar as effluent from a pulp
and paper mill is concerned, the principal Government standards of concern are
suspended solids (maximum 100 mg/1), pH (in the range of 5.5 to 9.0), 5-day
BOD (maximum 30 mg/I), and sulphides (maximum 2 mg/l as sulphur). These are
generally in line with international standards, and are satisfactory. Indian
regulations permit some relaxation of these standards if the effluent is to be
discharged to an irrigation canal. The mill will normally discharge to such
canals, and the irrigation of up to 2,000 ha of dry corn land, which without
irrigation is only marginally suited for agriculture, is a significant side
benefit. However, to avoid any potential problems, the Project provides for
full primary and secondary treatment of effluent to meet the more stringent
standards for surface water discharge as detailed above. TNPL's proposals for
the design of the mill's effluent treatment plant have been reviewed by Bank
staff, and are satisfactory.
5.22      Air emissions in a pulp and paper mill are primarily from the di-
gesting system and the chemical recovery system. In the case of the TNPL mill,
there will also be potential for particulate and sulfurous emissions from the
coal-burning power boiler. Process emissions are generally sulphur compounds
(such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and others) and particulates. To
1/ Although technical considerations limit the extent to which wood can re-
place bagasse, a bagasse shortfall of as much as 10% could be covered in
this way, and wood supplies in Tamilnadu are adequate for this.



- 29 -
reduce particulate emissions, the mill design allows for an electrostatic pre-
cipitator on the recovery boiler, and multiple cyclones on the power boiler.
To reduce odors, digester exhaust gases will be condensed, and the recovery boiler
has been designed with an over-sized furnace. Some of the more recent advances in
odor reduction technology (such as collection and incineration of noncondensible
gases) have not been proposed for the TNPL mill, as the size does not warrant such
treatment and the mill's relative isolation should ensure that any nuisance effects
remain minimal. These arrangements are satisfactory. TNPL has agreed that the de-
sign, execution and operation of the Project will be carried out with due regard
to appropriate safety norms and ecological and environmental standards satisfac-
tory to the Bank, and to establish and maintain adequate monitoring stations to
gather information on meteorological conditions and base pollution levels.
C. Infrastructure
5.23      Power, road and railway connections are required to support the Project,
and provision for these items has been included in the project cost.   The Govern-
ment of Tamilnadu has agreed that by December 31, 1983, it will upgrade the road
connection from Pugalur to the site and undertake such modification to the road as
may be required to provide an efficient transport flow to the site. Further, the
Government of India has agreed that it will take all necessary action to ensure
that the railway spur from Pugalur to the plant site is completed by December 31,
1983. The Project will give direct employment to some 2,000 persons. TNPL in-
tends to arrange housing initially for two-thirds of these workers, which, assum-
ing that each household provides two workers, represents some 670 housing units
of various categories. The Project will directly provide 70 houses for senior
management and technical staff, together with a guest house, a hotel and recrea-
tion facilities. The Project will also provide such services as water, sewage
and electric power. For the remaining 600 houses, 25% of the estimated total cost
of Rs 16 million (US$2 million equivalent) will be provided by the Project, and
the balance arranged by the Government of Tamilnadu. The Government of Tamilnadu
has agreed to make adequate arrangements in a timely manner to assist TNPL in the
provision of housing for its staff which is not provided under the Project. Pro-
vision has also been made in the financial projections for a continuing program
of house building after the mill is in operation, to gradually expand the propor-
tion of staff accomodated by the Company.
D. Project Implementation and Management
5.24      An organization has been developed for project implementation which
includes: (i) a project implementation group within TNPL; (ii) a foreign con-
sulting engineering company with overall responsibility for basic engineering
and project coordination; and (iii) an Indian consulting engineering company
which will undertake detailed design engineering.
5.25      The nucleus of the TNPL project implementation group, consisting of
senior SPB project engineers, is already in place and has been largely respon-
sible for project preparation. A project manager (who will subsequently become
General Manager of TNPL) has been appointed. As the owners' representative,
this group will be responsible for the preparation of tender documents, evalua-



- 30 -
tion of tenders, day to day supervision of construction, training, and start-up
coordination. The group will also make recommendations to senior TNPL management
concerning such matters as financial arrangements, award of contracts, and re-
cruitment of personnel. The contract between SPB and TNPL which defines SPB's
functions and responsibilities in the Project implementation group, has been
reviewed by Bank staff,and is satisfactory. The contract reflects the close own-
ership and working relationship between SPB and TNPL, in that fees, bonuses and
penalties are somewhat lower than might otherwise be anticipated.l/ The contract
contains a detailed description of the services to be performed, and the respon-
sibilities of SPB.
5.26      In order to ensure overall coordination of process design and Project
implementation, the consortium for the supply of the main package of equipment
includes a consulting engineering company with international experience in the
design and construction of bagasse-based paper projects. This company will be
responsible for the overall basic design engineering of all aspects of the Pro-
ject, supervision of detailed engineering design; and monitoring of Project
scheduling and construction. Thus Project design will be entirely the respon-
sibility of this consulting engineering company, and while TNPL (with SPB) will
be in charge of day-to-day supervision of construction activities, overall re-
sponsibility for construction and erection will lie with the engineering con-
sultant. Detailed design will be undertaken by competent Indian design engi-
neering firms under the supervision of the consortium's consulting company. TNPL
has agreed to provide details concerning the arrangements for the contracting of
this work, and to submit the contract to the Bank for review and approval prior
to its signing.
5.27      TNPL and SPB have signed a contract acceptable to the Bank covering
the implementation and start-up phases of the Project.   During the period of
Project Implementation, TNPL, with assistance from SPB will recruit experienced
technical and managerial staff for the operation of the plant.  TNPL has also
entered into a Technical Assistance Agreement with SPB to provide the required
technical and operational assistance during the first five years of production.
The terms and conditions of this Agreement have been reviewed by the Bank and
are satisfactory. TNPL has undertaken that this Agreement will be maintained in
effect through at least the first five years of operation.
5.28      A Project implementation schedule has been prepared and is illustrated
on the following page. A contract for the major package of engineering services
and equipment to be procured through a consortium was executed in June 1981, and
site preparation commenced in August, 1981. Retroactive financing of US$10
million equivalent is proposed (para. 6.08) in order to cover the initial down
payment for the consortium package and so to enable the Project to proceed as
scheduled. Preparation for procurement commenced in January 1981, and assuming
that commercial production from the Project starts in July 1984, this represents
a total implementation time of 42 months, which is realistic.
1/ The daily rates quoted for engineers and staff include a 25% fee element.
If the Project is completed on schedule, TNPL will pay SPB a bonus of
Rs 1 million for every month of early completion, subject to a maximum
bonus payment of Rs 2 million.

E. Employment and Training
5.29    The mill will provide direct employment for some 2,000 workers, in
addition to approximately 1,000 others who will be employed by contractors
engaged in harvesting pulpwood, and in delivering pulpwood and bagasse to
the mill. Although it will be necessary to recruit some skilled workers
with specific pulp and paper experience from other parts of the country,
efforts will be concentrated on employing and training residents of the
Pugalur area.  Overseas training is envisaged for senior technical and
managerial staff. A recruitment and a training program for mill operators,
making extensive use of SPB facilities at Erode for on-the-job instruction,
is being developed. TNPL has agreed to prepare a report on this program and
submit it to the Bank for review, by December 31, 1982.

VI. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Costs
6.01    The total financing required for the Project, including working capital
and interest during construction, is estimated at US$237.5 million equivalent,
of which US$115.0 million (48%) is foreign exchange (both direct and indirect).
The estimate includes provision for all necessary infrastructure, and for the
installation of coal-handling equipment and boilers in the five sugar mills.
The estimate has been prepared in November 1980 prices. The cost estimate is
given in Annexes 6-1 and 6-2 and summarized below:

6.02      The base capital cost estimate was prepared by SPB from actual quota-
tions for the principal packages of imported and local equipment, and engineer-
ing services. Tenders for the main imported package were called using interna-
tional competitive bidding procedures. The tenders have been evaluated, the low-
est tender accepted, and the capital cost estimate used here incorporates the
final price for this package. For other specialized equipment, which would most
likely be purchased outside India, price quotations were obtained from reputable
international suppliers. For imported equipment, customs duty has been computed
at a concessional rate of 35%, which is available for newsprint projects (the
normal rate is 45%). For equipment which will be bid internationally, but which
can be purchased locally, price quotations were obtained from qualified Indian
suppliers,  The civil works estimate was prepared by local civil engineering con-
sultants with extensive experience both in Tamilnadu and with paper mill projects.
The estimate includes the cost of both local and foreign technical assistance. A
total of 7,000 man-months of local assistance is provided for, at an average cost
of US$560 equivalent per man-month. Foreign technical assistance amounts to 470
man-months at an average cost of US$9,600 equivalent per man-month, excluding
travel and subsistence expenses estimated at US$1,500 equivalent per man-month.
These quantities and rates are realistic.  Physical contingencies on all costs
have been calculated as 8% of the base cost estimate (BCE); this rather low fig-
ure was carefully reviewed by engineers from the Indian financial institutions
as well as by the Bank appraisal mission, and in view of the advanced state of
Project preparation, is considered acceptable. Provision for price escalation
has been made. Because the base cost estimate is in November 1980 prices, and
construction commenced in the third quarter of 1981, the total provision for
price escalation represents a relatively low 13% of the BCE (Annex 6-2). Work-
ing capital, of US$17.9 million in current prices, is based on normal invento-
ries of raw materials and products, and on 20 days of accounts receivable and
7 days of accounts payable; to reflect current practice in the Indian paper in-
dustry (Annex 6-3). Interest during construction, amounting to US$29.8 million,
has been computed assuming the disbursement schedules and financing plan de-
scribed in the following paragraphs.
B. Financing Plan
6.03      During and subsequent to the joint appraisal with the Indian financial
institutions, the following financing plan was developed:

a/ The conversion exchange rate used is US$1.00 = Rs 8.00.
b/ The Bank loan would be channelled through the Development Assistance Fund
(DAF) which is administered by IDBI, but differs from normal IDBI operations
in that the risk is borne by the Indian Government (para. 6.06).
6.04      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent
would cover about 87% of the total (direct and indirect) estimated foreign
exchange cost of the Project, or about 47% of total cost excluding taxes and
duties. The financing plan is based on the maximum long-term debt:equity ratio
of 63:37 which the Project can reasonably support. This implies a total equity
requirement of US$83 million equivalent. In order to ensure against the poten-
tial danger of loss of autonomy in TNPL's operations, the Government of Tamil-
nadu's proposed equity contribution will be limited to 47%, or US$39.4 million
equivalent, leaving US$43.7 million equivalent of equity to be raised elsewhere.



- 35 -
6.05      Equity from the Salem and Dharmapuri sugar mills and from SPB is
limited by the capital resources of these companies, to a total of about Rs 40
million (US$5 million equivalent). As is normal practice in India, the remain-
ing equity will therefore be provided by a consortium of Indian financial in-
stitutions and, in view of the nature of the Project and size of investment
required, primarily by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI). As the
Government does not channel funds directly to commercial ventures, the proposed
Bank loan would also have to be channelled through IDBI. However, normal prac-
tice currently restricts IDBI's total exposure in any project to 25% of its own
equity, or about US$63 million.l/ Furthermore, within the above limit, IDBI's
exposure in equity in any project would not normally exceed 20% of its total
exposure in that project (i.e. loan to equity ratio of 4:1).
6.06      To complete the financing plan in both debt and equity, the Govern-
ment and IDBI have agreed that the proposed Bank loan of US$100 million equi-
valent, flow through the Development Assistance Fund (DAF).2/ Further, to
provide for the shortfall in equity that could not be covered by the Indian
financial institutions, the Government has agreed that US$22.5 million equiva-
lent of the US$100 million be channelled through DAF to the Project in the form
of equity. This leaves US$16.2 million of equity to be subscribed by IDBI and
the other institutions. The financial institutions intend to offer their share-
holdings in TNPL to the public as soon as possible, in a prudent manner, as
soon as market conditions permit. IDBI will also sell the shares financed with
the proceeds of the Bank loan on a pari-passu basis.
6.07      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent
would thus be on-lent to DAF, administered by IDBI for a period of 15 years,
including 5 years' grace, at an interest rate of 8.25%. This interest rate
conforms with the Government's policy for the advancing of funds to financial
institutions in the Public sector. In line with its established policy, the
Government of India would bear any foreign exchange risk associated with the
use of Bank funds. DAF/IDBI would pass on US$77.5 million equivalent as a
loan on equal repayment terms (i.e., 15 years including 5 year's grace) and
at its normal on-lending interest rate, currently 14%.3/ The remaining
US$22.5 million equivalent would be passed to TNPL for the Project as equi-
ty.4/ These arrangements have been agreed to by both the Government
1/  For this Project however, IDBI has agreed to a somewhat higher exposure.
2/  By law the DAF is an independent fund which has to be accounted for direct-
ly to the Government. IDBI is merely the fund manager, receiving no benefit
from the fund's operations, other than reimbursement for actual expenses in-
curred for its management and administration, and incurring no risk.
31  After deducting 7% tax on interest, the effective interest rate to IDBI/DAF
would be 13.02%.
4/  At the above lending rates (which result in a spread of 4.77% to DAF) TNPL's
payment to the DAF as debt service of the US$77.5 million equivalent loan
would be sufficient to meet DAF's debt service obligation to the Government
for the entire US$100 million equivalent loan even under conservative assump-
tions regarding dividend payments and share values.

and IDBI, and will be embodied in a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered
into between the Government and IDBI, and a finance agreement to be entered
into between IDBI and TNPL with terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
An additional loan of US$64.4 million equivalent would be made for the Pro-
ject by IDBI in a consortium with the other financial institutions (para.
1.01). The working capital margin (amounting to about 70% of the total work-
ing capital, or US$12.5 million equivalent) would be financed through com-
mercial banks at an interest rate of 19%. The Government of Tamilnadu and
IDBI have confirmed their equity contributions to the Project, to be paid in
a timely manner. In additon, the Government of Tamilnadu has undertaken to
take all necessary steps to see that the sugar companies make their equity
contributions, and IDBI will take all necessary steps to see that SPB makes
its equity contribution. The Government of Tamilnadu and the Indian financial
institutions have also agreed to finance any cost overruns which may be in-
curred up to the time of Project completion, under terms and conditions ac-
ceptable to the Bank. Project completion for this purpose is defined as
satisfactory operation for at least 60 consecutive days at an average rate
of at least 60% (60,000 tpy) of capacity.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
6.08       Tenders for the major package of foreign equipment and engineering
services worth about US$40 million equivalent (para. 5.11) were received from
four potential suppliers and have been evaluated. Procurement for this package
was initiated prior to the Government requesting Bank participation in the Pro-
ject. The actual proceduires used have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory and consistent with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Bank staff
have also reviewed the evaluation of these tenders. The lowest evaluated bidder
is a consortium headed by Beloit Walmsley Ltd. of the UK. TNPL has negotiated a
contract with this consortium which has been reviewed by the Bank and is satis-
factory. This package is suitable for Bank financing. As noted previously
(para. 5.28), the first payment on the contract was made in June, 1981; retro-
active financing of the US$10 million, is therefore proposed.
6.09       Procurement procedures according to the Bank's guidelines will also
be used for all other major equipment packages. Critical or proprietory im-
ported items and items costing less than US$100,000, up to a combined maximum
of US$5 million, will be procured by international shopping, according to a list
of goods and vendors to be agreed with the Bank. For purposes of bid evaluation,
local suppliers will be eligible for a preference margin of 15%, or the appli-
cable customs duty, whichever is lower. Further, US$1 million of the proposed
loan has been allocated for Technical Assi>,ance and training expected to be
required during project implementation. Civil works and erection (financed with
local funds) will be carried out by Indian subcontractors, who will be selected
following competitive bidding procedures normally adopted by Indian public sec-
tor entities; these are acceptable to the Bank. The selection of these subcon-
tractors will also be monitored and approved by the consortium responsible for
basic engineering of the Project. Project management during implementation will
be provided by SPB staff. These arrangements for procuring the supplies and
services required by the Project are satisfactory. The Government has agreed
that permission to import will be promptly granted for all foreign equipment and
services to be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan.

6.10      The proposed Bank loan of US$100 million, would be allocated as
follows:

Total                                     100
6.11      Of the total equipment, services and spares required for the Project,
estimated to cost US$125 million (including contingencies), it is expected that
Indian manufacturers will supply about US$45 million (or 36%) while the balance
(US$80 million or 64%) will be imported. It is also estimated that the Bank loan
will finance local supplies totalling approximately US$20 million, won by Indian
suppliers following ICB and international shopping procedures. The projected
schedule for the disbursement of Bank funds is shown in Annex 6-4.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions
7.01      The assumptions used in the financial analysis of the Project are de-
tailed in Annex 7-1. The analysis asstmes that the paper mill will start com-
mercial production in July 1984. Overall capacity utilization is assumed to be
50% for the six months the mill is expected to operate in 1984, 60% in 1985, 75%
in 1986, 85% in 1987 and 90% I/in subsequent years. At full operation, news-
print and printing and writing paper will be produced in the ratio of 5:4; how-
ever, in view of the fact that the prevailing technology for bagasse-based news-
print production is less well known than that for printing and writing paper, a
slower rate of buildup of newsprint production has prudently been assumed. Fur-
thermore, the effects of a slower buildup to full capacity, and of a still lower
proportion of newsprint in the product mix, are examined as part of the sensiti-
vity analysis of projected rates of return. Pulp and paper mills often operate,
1/ The projected output of 90,000 tpy is 90% of the plant design capacity of
100,000 tpy based on the proposed product mix (para. 5.01).



- 38 -
without major reconstruction, for 30, or even 40 years. For this analysis,
however, an economic plant life of only 17 operating years has been assumed
to ensure that full and efficient operation is maintained.  The financial
projections are in current prices through to the start-up date of July 1984,
and in constant 1984 prices thereafter. Thus cost and revenues are computed
on the basis of prices escalated from 1980 levels to 1984 levels, using
projected rates of international inflation of 12.5% for the balance of 1980,
9% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982 and 7.5% for 1983 and 1984. These rates are
considered appropriate for both local and foreign costs.
B. Revenues
7.02      Printing and writing paper and newsprint prices used in the financial
analysis are current, actual, ex-factory prices net of sales tax (Rs 8,040/ton
and Rs 5,740/ton, equivalent to US$1,005/ton and US$717/ton, respectively) as
discussed in paras. 4.16 and 4.18. Prices to the consumer will thus be the
same as those currently paid, in real terms, and will correspond closely to im-
port parity prices. In the case of newsprint, a 15% customs duty is included.
The Government has agreed that it will take no action, such as controlling paper
prices or production, which would prevent the Project (operating efficiently)
from obtaining a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.
C. Production Costs
7.03      Bagasse prices have been computed as the cost of supplying coal, of
equivalent energy content, to the sugar mills. One ton of coal is the thermal
equivalent of, and will replace, 2.52 tons of bagasse. The current delivered
cost of coal to the sugar mills is Rs 319 (US$40) per ton as detailed in Annex
7-1. Capital charges have not been included, as the cost of installing coal
handling equipment and boilers at the sugar mills has been included in the Pro-
ject capital cost. No sales tax on the supply of steam to the sugar mills has
been allowed for, as such tax is already being paid on coal and the bagasse. The
bagasse price computation is summarized below:

7.04      The prices of wood, chemicals, operating supplies, fuel, power and
maintenance supplies have been based on recent quotations from suppliers, and
on experience at the SPB mill at Erode. Production costs, in November 1980
prices, at normal operation (50,000 tpy of newsprint, and 40,000 tpy of paper)

- 41 -
7.06      The above forecasts show an acceptable financial position in the first
partial year of operation and a satisfactory financial performance thereafter.
Debt service coverage is 1.4 or greater in all years. The long - term debt:equity
ratio, which is based on a financing plan of 63:37, deteriorates slightly during
the first two years of the Project's operating life but subsequently improves
rapidly. The current ratio (which is calculated here assuming that all excess cash
generated by the operation is retained in the Company) also increases rapidly. The
Project should be able to pay an annual dividend, equal to 10% of the share capital,
from the sixth year of operation, without the current ratio declining below 1.5 in
any year.
7.07      The projections show that income taxes will become payable in the seventh
year of operation. From the seventh through the tenth year, the Project will
have the benefit of tax concessions, but will subsequently pay taxes at the
full rate of 55%, plus a 7.5% surchage (or a total of 59.1%).
E. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.08      The base case financial rate of return for the Project, calculated
in constant 1980 prices, is 15.4% before taxes, and 12.4% after taxes (Annex
7-6). Results of a sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following table.

7.09      The first three cases examined (higher capital costs, delay in imple-
mentation, delay in reaching capacity) are all sufficiently typical in projects
of this-type to warrant examination, although the base case represents the best
estimates for all of these items, and no special circumstances exist to suggest
that this Project should be more susceptible to such delays than others. The
other sensitivity cases examined have each been chosen to illustrate the impact
of an event which has a sufficiently high possibility of occuring to be of interest
in the decision making process.
1/ Producing 50,000 tpy of newsprint and 40,000 tpy of printing and writing paper.



- 42 -
(i) Lower bagasse pulping yield: The suppliers of the equipment
for producing pulp for newsprint have guaranteed a pulp yield
of 61% on dry bagasse and this figure (which was achieved in
the test runs) has been used in the base case.  However, in
the Peruvian mill the maximum yield whiclh has actually been
obtained is 54%.  Although there is every reason ,o believe
that the proposed design changes will enable the higher yield
to be obtained, the impact on financial performance of a lower
yield is worth noting.
(ii) No newsprint production: If the Project were to produce only
printing and writing paper, the profitability would increase
as shown. In the event that the equipment to produce newsprint
does not function as envisaged, the fall-back position to print-
ing and writing paper production is clearly viable.
(iii) Increased lignite consumption: In view of possible shortages
in coal supply, the base case anticipates a 27% shortfall in
coal deliveries and replacement with higher priced lignite
which is readily available in Tamilnadu, and could be trucked,
if necessary, to the Project. If coal supplies were even more
difficult, all of the fuel requirements at the paper mill it-
self (or about 50% of the fuel required by the Project) could
be supplied by lignite. The rate of return would then drop as
indicated.
(iv) Bagasse shortfall: If weather conditions or any other eventu-
ality led to a shortfall in bagasse supplies, the Project would
adjust to this situation by cutting back production, varying
the product mix (a ton of newsprint uses about 15% less bagasse
than a ton of printing and writing paper), or by substituting
fiber. The case examined in the sensitivity analysis has as-
sumed that a 20% shortfall in bagasse would be covered by in-
creasing the wood supply to meet one-half of tne deficit, and
importing pulp, at world prices, to cover the other half.
(v) Production of excise duty concession: The base case assumes
that the Government's proposal to eliminate all excise duty on
bagasse-based printing and writing paper would be continued for
the life of the Project (para. 4.1'7). Tf this is not done, the
concession would amount to only a 33.3% reduction in excise
duty, the effective price of printing and writing paper would
be some 11% lower and the rate of return before taxes would
drop as shown.
F. Financial Covenants
7.10      TNPL has agreed that after completion of the Project, except as the Bank
may otherwise agree, it will: (i) maintain a debt equity ratio not greater than
65:35; (ii) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2:1; (iii) not incur any addi-
tional debt in any financial year unless a reasonable forecast of TNPL's net rev-
enues for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shows that debt
service coverage will not fall below 1.5; and (iv) not enter into arrangements for
any new investments costing in excess of US$5 million equivalent per annum.

G. Auditing and Rteporting Requirements
7.11         TNPL has agreed to furnish to the Bank, promptly upon their preparation,
the plans, specifications, reports, contract documents and construction and procure-
ment schedules for the Project, and any material modifications thereof or additions
thereto, in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request. TNPL has also agreed
to (i) maintain records and procedures adequate to record and monitor the progress
of the Project (including its costs and the benefits to be derived from it), to
identify the goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, and to
disclose their use in the Project; (ii)  to enable the Bank's accredited representa-
tives to visit the facilities and construction sites included in the Project and
to examine the goods financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and any relevant
records and documents; (iii) to furnish to the Bank at regular intervals all such
information as the Bank shall reasonably request concerning the Project, its cost
and, where appropriate, the benefits to be derived from it, the expenditures of
such proceeds and the goods and services financed out of such proceeds; and (iv) to
have its accounts audited, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to
submit certified copies of its financial statements (together with the auditor's
report) as soon as available but in any case not later than seven months after the
end of each financial year. Finally, after completion of the Project, the Company
has agreed to prepare and furnish to the Bank a comprehensive report on the Project,
its implementation, initial operation. and the costs and benefits derived and
expected to be derived therefrom.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A. Adjusted Costs and Benefits for Economic Analysis
8.01      To obtain economic costs and benefits, financial data have been adjusted
by correcting for customs duties, excise duties and sales taxes which, for most
materials consumed by the Project, gives a reasonable approximation of world prices.
Electric power costs have been increased from Rs 300 to Rs 450 per MWh which is the
current estimate of the economic cost of power in India. An economic cost of coal
and lignite has been developed, which is about 60% higher than the financial cost,
based on notional imports of coal. Unskilled labor, which represents about 40% of
the total labor cost, has been shadow-priced at two-thirds of its financial cost.
Paper prices currently in effect in India are close to current international prices
and to long-term trend prices (paras. 4.13-4.18). Hence, for printing and writing
paper no change has been made to the financial prices in the economic analysis.
For newsprint, the price used in the economic analysis is equal to the CIF price
of imported newsprint of comparable quality as noted in para. 4.18. All the assump-
tions and adjustments which have been made are detailed in Annex 8-1, and the ad-
justed cost and benefit streams, brought to constant 1980 prices, are shown in An-
nex 8-2.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return on the Project is 18.7%, compared with the
before-tax financial rate of return of 15.4% (para. 7.08). The difference in the
two rates of return is due to downward adjustments in capital costs (duties) which
increase the return by 2.8%, net downward adjustments in production costs which
increase it by a further 1.1%, and a net decrease in the ex-factory price of news-
print which reduces it by 0.6%.

8.03      The sensitivity of this result to the possible changes detailed in
the financial analysis (para. 7.09) are tabulated below. The economic rate of
return remains acceptable evern under rather adverse assumptions.

and imported pulp)                                         16.7
C. Other Benefits
8.04      There are a number of important Project benefits which could not be
quantified ir the above analysis. Most importantly, the Project will produce
newsprint, which is the only paper grade still imported into India in large
quantities. For this reason, and because newsprint is considered to have stra-
tegic importance, the Government has been actively trying to promote the produc-
tion of newsprint in the country. This effort has been hindered by the shortage
of fibrous raw materials other than bagasse, and the lack of a commercially prov-
en bagasse-based newsprint production technology. Industrial countries have suf-
ficient wood based long fiber resources to produce newsprint, and hence lit-
tle incentive to undertake the full development effort and risk associated with
bagasse technology. Accordingly, the developing countries will have to assume
some development risk on their own. Among developing countries, India is well
placed to test this technology. It has the bagasse, it has a large enough market
for both printing and writing paper and newsprint to absorb 100% of total possi-
ble output of either productl/; and it has the engineering and paper production
experience required. Expansions in India's printing and writing paper capacity
are taking place, and if accelerated by the continued relief of market distor-
tions afforded to new mills (para. 4.17), the risk-free fall back position of
printing and writing paper production may not be available to potential bagasse-
based newsprint mills much longer.  If India is to test this newsprint technolo-
gy, it must do so in the near future. If it does so, and is successful in pro-
viding a technically satisfactory way cf economically producing newsprint, the
technology could be used in other projects. If a 100,000 tpy newsprint mill were
then to be constructed specifically for that purpose, and not as a dual print-
1/ The proposed mill is about the minimum economic size for such an enterprise



- 45 -
ing and writing paper/newsprint mill, as in the proposed Project: (i) its capi-
tal costs would be 10% lower; (ii) its bagasse yield would be higher; and (iii)
its start-up curve would be more optimistic. The net effect would be to yield an
economic rate of return of about 20%. While not as attractive as the return
(22%) projected for a 100% printing and writing mill producing for the domestic
market, it is still economically viable, and is preferential to the alternative
of producing bagasse based printing and writing paper for export, which would
yield an economic rate of return of only about 15% under current conditions.
8.05      In Tamilnadu State, the Project will provide development impetus in
Pugalur (a designated backward area' as well as direct employment for 2,000
people, and indirect employment for an additional 4,000. The total investment
per direct job created is US$119,000 equivalent; for the total employment
created (6,000 jobs) the investment per job is US$39,600 equivalent. Further
direct assistance to the region will derive from the availability of treated
effluent for irrigation.  As previously noted (para. 5.21) this effluent will
be sufficient to irrigate some 2,000 ha, allowing it to be converted from
low-productivity dry corn land to high productivity paddy.
8.06      On a national level, in addition to providing newsprint and demon-
strating the practicability of using bagasse for papermaking, over its 17-year
life, the Project will lead to direct net foreign exchange savings (through
import substitution net of foreign exchange debt-service and operating costs)
of about US$980 million in 1981 dollars. The Project may also provide India
with the opportunity to market the technology in other countries, and so lead
to further foreign exchange benefits. As for the Bank, its involvement with
this technology may also benefit other countries where bagasse based newsprint
projects could be viable.
D. Risks
8.07      There are two principal risks associated with the Project.  The first
is, that of introducing the relatively new technology of producing newsprint from
bagasse. The historical development and current status of this technology, has
been discussed in detail in paras. 1.02 and 5.02-5.08. As noted there, the ad-
ditional capital cost that will be incurred to enable the plant to produce news-
print as well as printing and writing paper is only about US$8 million equivalent.
This expenditure also embodies the sole unproven part of the process flow, namely
certain ancillary pulping equipment, which is required for the production of
newsprint but is bypassed during the production of printing and writing paper.
All reasonable precautions have been taken to minimize the risk associated with
the operation of this ancillary equipment, through careful analysis of existing
operations, as well as cooperation and interaction with equipment suppliers, in
the development and testing of alternative process routes and machine configura-
tions. These efforts will continue through the basic engineering and detailed
design phases of the Project.



- 46 -
8.08      As noted (paras. 5.04 and 5.05), two bagasse-based mills have
installed ancillary newsprint pulping equipment to date, and some parts,
largely in the fiber separation stage, have malfunctioned in both. The ma_n
causes of these failures are believed to have been identified   To avoid
them, one equipment manufacturer (Beloit) has developed and successfully
tested a reordering of the process flow.  It is this modified technology
that will be used in the Project. Further, to guard against malfunctioning
due to lack of coordination (claimed to be another cause of the difficulties
experienced by the existing mills para. 5.06), the project sponsors have
decided to procure the entire pulp line/paper machine package from a single
consortium, which is prepared to guarantee production variables throughout
the process, from pulp to the finished paper product.  Following international
competitive bidding, the Beloit Consortium was selected to supply this
package. The consortium includes those responsible for modifying and developing
the pulping process (Beloit), and the engineering arm of an operating paper
company (Reed International Consultants, U.K.).
8.09      Given the ancilliary nature of the commercially unproven equipment
and given the flexibility to produce printing and writing paper that has
been built into the mill design, if the newsprint line should nonetheless
malfunction by the time TNPL starts up, in 3-4 years time, the plant will
switch to the production of printing and writing paper, a procedure which
should not take more than a few hours and would not disrupt production.
Simultaneously, without interfering with the normal production of printing
and writing paper, repairs or modifications to the newsprint pulpiig equipment
will be carried out. Such adjustment and readjustment during the first few
years is reflected in the financial projections, which are based on lower
pulp yields and a slower build-up to full-production in newsprint, thnan in
printing and writing paper.
8.10      Finally, if the effort to produce newsprint were to fail completely,
to repeat, the plant has been designed to produce (80,000 tpy) in the form
of printing and writing paper. Bagasse-based production of printing and
writing paper is a commercially proven technology and the Indian market is
large enough to absorb the plant's entire potential printing and writing
paper output. The company would not have a problem in marketing this addi-
tional production, since it will have already established marketing channels
for printing and writing paper, which could absorb the additional production.
As a result, there is little risk associated with the production and marketing
of printing and writing paper, and, as demonstrated in the sensitivity
analysis (para. 8.03), there is little cost associated with resorting to
this fall-back position. The potential benefits accruing to the successful
production of bagasse-based newsprint on the other hand, are substantial
(para. 8.04), and with a cost of about US$8 million equivalent, the technological
risk is well worth taking.
8.11      The second risk is that of coal suppLy.  This risk has been discussed
in detail in paras. 5.17-5.19 and is one that affects India's entire economy.
Although arrangements to meet the Project's full requirements of 330,000 tpy of
coal are being actively sought, the Project sponsors are also making alternative
arrangements:



- 47-
(i) The boiler at the paper mill will be designed to burn lignite or
fuel oil, as well as coal. As a result, about half the Project's
coal requirements could be substituted for by briquetted lignite.
Despite its higher calorific cost, TNPL has arranged for such a
supply from a nearby source (para. 5.18), and the financial and
economic analysis of the Project has been based on the assumption
that 27% of its total fuel requirements will in fact be supplied
by lignite. Finally, the Government has agreed that in the event
of a coal short-fall the Project will be allowed to procure al-
ternative fuels if this would enable it to continue to operate
economically.
(ii) Half of the Project's coal requirements are needed as a substi-
tute for bagasse in the sugar mills. Bagasse will, in turn,
supply part of the paper-mill's fibrous raw material requirements.
The n1eed for bagasse as a raw material is subject to some flexi-
bility as a function of: (i) the mix of newsprint and printing
and writing paper in the Project's output, and (ii) the proportion
of wood versus bagasse used in the paper pulp. TNPL has arranged
for first rights on a supply of eucalyptus wood that is about 15%
greater than the Project would normally require. Further, the
Government lhas agreed that in the event of a bagasse shortfall tor
to help overcome temporary technical problems), the Project will
be allowed to import pulp if this would enable it to continue to
operate economically.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      Agreement has been reached with the Government of India on the following
points:
(i)   That it shall take all such action as may be necessary to assist the
Project to obtain coal and, if necessary, lignite and to transport
coal and lignite to the mill, and further, that if coal delivery or tech-
nical problems are encountered, it will allow TNPL to procure alter-
native fuels, or to import pulp, if this would assist the plant to
continue to operate economically (paras. 5.19 and 8.11);
(ii)  That the railway spur from Pugalur to the project site will be com-
pleted by December 31, 1983 (para. 5.23);
(iii) That the proposed arrangements for the transfer of Bank funds
through IDBI are acceptable and will be embodied in a subsidiary
loan agreement with terms and cotnditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 6.07);
(iv) That permission to import will be promptly granted for all
foreign equipment and services to be financed out of the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan (para. 6.09); and



- 48 -
(v)  That it will take no action, such as controlling paper prices
or production, which would prevent the Project from obtaining
a reasonable return on investment, under conditions of effi-
cient operation (para. 7.02).
9.02      Agreement has been reached with the Government of Tamilnadu on the
following points:
(i)   That Tamilnadu's equity contribution to the Project, of US$39.4
million equivalent, and such other equity proportionately to
the ratio of its shareholding as may be required to complete
the Project, will be provided in a timely manner, and Tamilnadu
will maintain its shareholding at less than 50 percent (paras.
3.02 and 6.07);
(ii)  That the professional character of the management of TNPL shall
be maintained (para. 3.02);
(iii) That Tamilnadu will assist TNPL in meeting its obligations with
respect to the Project (para. 3.02);
(iv)  That the Project will be permitted to draw water from the Cauvery
River to meet the full requirements of the Project and its colony
(para. 5.10);
(v) That the necessary volume of pulpwood will be made available to
the Project, ard if coal delivery problems are encountered which
disrupt bagasse supplies, that pulpwood deliveries will be ex-
panded to allow the plant to continue at full operation (para. 5.16

Note:  The schedule is based on the assumption that the Project will be con-
sidered by the Bank's Executive Directors in September 1981.  In view
of the advanced stage of Project preparation, it has further been as-
sumed that the first disbursement would be made three months after
that date, in December 1981. This disbursement would be the downpay-
ment for the major package of equipment and services for which retro-
active financing has been requested.

INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.     The financial projections have been carried out in current terms
through 1984, the first year of operation, and in constant 1984 terms
thereafter.  Paper prices and production costs have been escalated
from the November 1980 base, at the following annual rates:
Period                    Annual Escalation Rate
Nov. - Dec.   1980             12.5%    foreign and local
1981             9.0%    foreign and local
1982             8.5%    foreign and local
1983             7.5%    foreign and local
Jan. - June   1984              7.5%    foreign and local
2.     It has been assumed that commercial operation will commence on July 1,
1984.
3.     Design capacity of the plant is 100,000 tpy of newsprint and printing
and writing paper, in the ratio of 5:4. It has been assumed that
operations will eventually reach and sustain production at 90% of
this level. Actual production rates assumed are as follows:
Year                   Production (tons)
Printing/Writing
Newsprint           Paper
1984 (6 months)        10,500             19,300
1985                   24,500             34,800
1986                   35,800             37,700
1987                   46,000             39,500
1988 etc.              50,000            40,000
4.     The Project has been assumed to operate for a total of 17 full years,
up to and including the year 2001.
5.     Mill-net prices at November 1980 levels are Rs 8,040 per ton for
printing and writing paper, and Rs 5,740 per ton for newsprint.
Escalated to July 1984 levels these figures are Rs 10,660 and Rs 7,670
respectively. Revenue projections are shown in the Income Statement
(Annex 7-3).
6.     Production cost estimates at full production, and 1980 prices are
contained in Annex 7-2. Projections at 1984 price levels, and taking
into account the rate of buildup of production, are shown in the Income
Statement in Annex 7-3.
7.     Preoperating costs have been amortized over the first ten years of
operation. Plant capital has been depreciated on a straight line
basis for the 17-year life of the Project. Capital cost allowances
for income tax calculations have been computed, according to Indian



ANNEX 7-1
- S5 --                         Page 2
tax law, at annual rates of 5% orn factory buildings, 2.5% on non-
factory buildings, and 20% on plant and machinery, all on a
declining balance basis.
8.    A concessional electric power tariff, available for the first five
years of operation for new industries in Tamilnadu, has been incor-
porated in the projections. This concession reduces power costs
by 33-1/3% in the first three years, 20% in the fourth year, and
10% in the fifth year.
9.    A corporate tax rate of 55%, plus a 7.5% surcharge (or a total rate
of 59.125%), has been applied. Additional depreciation, and the
Investment Allowance permitted under Section 32 of the Income Tax
Act (1961), has not been taken, as it is not in TNPL's interest so
to do. The eight-year Tax Holiday Benefit, and the ten-year Back-
ward Area Concession have been provided for in the projections, but
as the Project does not generate any taxable income until its seventh
year of operation, the benefit from these concessions is minimal.
10.    Terms of the loans to TNPL have been assumed as follows:
World        Indian         Commercial
Bank      Institutions         Banks
Amount (Rs million)         620           515               100
Interest Rate                14.0%         14.0%             19.0%
Commitment Fee                0.5%          0.5%                -
Grace Period                 5 yrs.       6 yrs.
Repayment Period            10 yrs.       9 yrs.
The portion of the Bank loan to be passed to the Project as a loan
will be channelled to the Project through IDBI. Interest rates and
commitment charges will be at IDBI7s normal rate for projects of
this type.
11.    For the financial rate of return calculations, all cost and benefit
streams have been brought to a constant 1980 basis, using the
projected rates of inflation shown above in paragraph 1.
12.    Coal prices have been developed from current actual data as follows:
(Rs/ton)
Basic cost at pithead                       122.0
Average cost of transport                   125.5
Handling at paper mill                        1.5
Duties, taxes & commission                   15.0
-  Price at paper mill                   264.0
Handling and transport to
sugar mills                               55.0
-  Price at sugar mills                  319.0

INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS
Economic rate of return calculations for the Project have been carried out with
the same basic cost and benefit streams as for financial analysis Annex 7-6, ad-
justed as follows:
1.     Customs duty, excise duty and sales tax have been eliminated from the
capital cost estimates. The overall effect is a reduction of 15.2% in
the total plant cost.
2.     Production costs have been adjusted as follows:
(i) Excise duty, sales tax, and generation tax have been eliminated;
(ii) Power costs have been increased from Rs 300 per MWh to Rs 450 per
MWh, which is the current estimate of the economic cost of power in
India;
(iii) An economic cost of coal and lignite has been developed based
on notional imports of coal at a CIF cost of US$59.0 per ton.
Adjustments for calorific value, freight and handling give a
price delivered at the paper mill of Rs 423 per ton, compared
with the financial price of Rs 264 per ton;
(iv) Unskilled labor, representing some 40% of the total labor cost,
has been shadow-priced at two thirds of its financial cost.
The net effect of all these adjustments is a reduction in production
costs of 5.8%.
3.     Since marginal imports of newsprint would necessarily be of higher quality
than current average imports, as additional low quality grades are not
readily available, a newsprint price of Rs 5,600 per ton has been used in
the economic analysis, compared with a net of duty price of Rs 5,030 used
in the financial projections. Printing and writing paper prices have not
been adjusted, as current duty-free prices in India are close to current
international prices, which in turn are in line with the Bank's estimates
of long-term international prices.
4.     Cost and benefit streams have been brought to a constant 1980 basis, using
the projected rates of inflation shown in Annex 7-1, paragraph 1.
