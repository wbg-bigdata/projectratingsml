INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 2050-IN)
PREFACE
Loan 2050-IN for che Tamilnadu Newsprint Project for
US$100.0 million was signed on September 23, 1981, and was closed on
August 31, 1985. The full amount of the loan has been disbursed.
The main objective of the loan was to finance the establishment
of an integrated pulp and paper mill with a capacity to produce about
100,000 tons per year of newsprint or about 80,000 tons per year of
printing and writing paper, or any combination thereof, using bagasse
(about 80X overall) as fibrous raw materials. The Project uses bagasse
from five existing sugar mills in the vicinity of the Project. Bagasse is
a residue of sugar cane crushed to produce sugar, and is commonly used as a
fuel for generating steam in the sugar mills. In addition to an increase
in productior )f newsprint and other grades of paper to substitute and
reduce dependency on import and hence foreign exchange savings the Project
provides for India:
(a) an option for better use of fiber resource by an economic
repl1cement of bagasse by coal as a source of energy;
(b) an increase in fiber production by releasing bagasse without any
addition to land under cultivation, since bagasse is based on an
annual crop generated on land already dedicated to sugar
production; and
(c) a possibility to participate in development and export of
indigenous technology for production of newsprint from bagasse.
The Project Completion Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department based on a draft prepared by the Borrower, and the findings of
an Industry Department mission in February 1986. No further comments were
received from the Borrower.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 2050-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was conceived specifically to meet the Government's
twin objectives of expanding production of both newsprint and printing and
writing paper and utilizing bagasse as a fibrous raw material. Bagasse is
a residue of sugar cane crushed to produce sugar-(para. 1.01).
Bagasse has been widely used to produce printing and writing
paper both in India and elsewhere, but its use as a raw material for
newspriat is fairly new. In recent years there have been major
developments in this field and many pilot plant tests were successful. The
Project concept is based on these developments, and an Anglo-American
consortium that has been active in these developments assumed a prime
respondibility for supplying process know-how, project engineering and main
equipment packages. However, to minimize technological risks of newsprint
production the Project was designed with the capability also to produce
printing and writing paper for which the process is well proven. This
approach increased the project cost by about 4%(paras. 1.02,1.03,2.09,2.10).
The project is considered to have been well prepared and
efficiently implemented by the Project sponsors. The Project was completed
with a slight cost underrun ir US$ terms (1%), but with a cost overrun in
Indian Rupees (31.5%). The paper mill was commissioned in 44 months, a
time overrun of three months. The pulp mill was commissioned in stages.
Hardwood pulp line and chemical bagasse lines were commissioned in 50 and
52 months, a time overrun of 8 and 10 months, respectively. Finally the
mechanical bagasse line was commissioned in October 1985, a 13-month time
overrun(paras. 3.01-3.04, 3.11, 3.14-3.19).
Although on a short run basis (one or two days) TNPL has
succeeded in producing newsprint of good quality using 100% indigenous raw
material including 50% mechanical bagasse pulp, and 25% chemical bagasse
pulp, continuous production has not yet been achieved for extended periods.
TNPL started production of newsprint using imported pulp in
September 1984, and as of October 1985, with the commissioning of the
mill-produced pulp lines, domestic pulp has gradually replaced the imported
pulp. In January 1986, the mill-produced pulp amounted to 58% of the pulp
used to produce newsprint, of which bagasse pulp was 34%. The company is
making good progress in this technological breakthrough and it is expected
that within six months the blend will reach the appraisal target.(paras. 4.01-4.03).



At the time of appraisal the challenge of producing newsprint
from bagasse and the associated technical risk was fully realized. To
minimize this risk, a fall back position to produce printing and writing
paper was planned. TNPL has fully tested this fall-back position and has
successfully produced on a continuous basis good quality printing and
writing paper using on average about 95% mill-produced pulp, with bagasse
amounting to about 80%, as envisaged at the time of appraisal (para 2.10).
In the first full year of operation, 1985, paper production was
16% higher than anticipated at appraisal and in the latest three months has
reached an average of 90% of design capacity. It was not expected to reach
this level until the third full year of operation (para 4.03).
Manufacturing costs are approximately 13% higher in real terms
then estimated at appraisal due primarily to higher requirements for
chemicals brought about by a change in process technology during
imp'lementation which was necessary to achieve newsprint quality and
runability targets (para. 3.14).
The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) before and after
taxes for the project is 12.3% and 11%, respectively, compared to 15.4% and
12.4% estimated at the time of appraisal. The lower FIRR is mainly due to
higher capital cost. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Project is
13.4% compared to 18.7% estimated at the time of appraisal. 7-te lower ERR
is mainly due to higher capital costs and lower output prices (paras 5.06
and 6.02).
Although one of the Project's objectives, to produce newsprint of
acceptable quality, at high speed, on a continuous basis using at least 75%
bagasse furnish, has not been yet fully realized, significant technological
progress has been made towards the production of newsprint using bagasse as
fibrous raw material (paras 3.01-3.02). The Company and the Bank are
confident of full technological success. This progress has been made
possible primarily because of the Bank's and the Government of India's
willingness to take risks and to participate actively in development and
eventually export of indigenous technology for production of newsprint from
bagasse.
In addition to providing financing, the Bank provided advice
and assistance to TNPL in various aspects of project implementation. Of
particular importance, the Bank insisted that the individual contracts with
each member of the Consortium be supplemented with a single responsibility
contract to ensure continuity in the event of default on the part of any
member of the Consortium (paras 3.09 and 7.02).
As with many other projects in various parts of the world, the
Bank was too optimistic on the international price prospects, resulting in
a higher estimated economic rate of return for the Project than is now
expected (paras 6.02-7.05). The Bank's appraisal should concentrate more
on price issues and develop more realistic price assumptions.



- vi -
Actual disbursement profile was similar to the forecast
except for a lag of about 9 months, mainly due to an 8-month delay in loan
effectiveness compared with the appraisal estimate (para. 3.18).
This Project explored and introduced new technology to India.
The successful start-up and continued good operational results at TNPL
demonstrate that in certain circumstances, and with suitable training and
technical support, introduction of new technology to developing coantries
can be successful.(para. 7.07),



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 2050-IN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Over the last 25 years India's pulp and paper industry has
progressed tc the point where it now supplies virtually all of India's
requirement of printing and writing paper. But India is short of long
fiber coniferous wood resources that are traditionally used to produce
newsprint and it still imports about 50% of its newsprint requirement.
1.02      Bagasse has been widely used to produce printing and writing
paper both in India and elsewhere, but its use as raw material for
newsprint is fairly new. In recent years there have been major
developments in this field and many pilot plant tests were successful.
1.03      The Project concept is based on these developments, and an
Anglo-American consortium that has been active in these developments
assumed a prime responsibility for supplying process know-how, project
engineering and the main equipment packages. However, to minimize
technological risks of newsprint production the Project was designed with
Lhe capability also to produce printing and writing paper for which the
process is well proven (Annex 1-1). This approach increased the project
cost by about 4%.
1.04      India is one of the world's largest sugar cane producers.  If all
the cane produced in India were crushed and the bagasse made available for
paper production, this fiber could support an output of about eight million
tons of paper or about six times India's present domestic consumption.
With such an immense potential, it is natural for India to be a leader in
bagasse-based technological development. Currently, most of the bagasse
which is produced in sugar mills is inefficiently used internally as fuel
for generating process steam.
1.05      The major paper-producing industrial countries have sufficient
wood-based long fiber resources to produce newsprint and hence, have little
incentive to undertake the full development and risk associated with
bagasse-based technology. Accordingly, some development risk has fallen on
several developing countries which have abundant supplies of bagasse.
Among developing countries, India was well placed to test this technology.
It has the bagasse, plenty of relatively cheap coal to replace the bagasse
as a fuel, a large enough market to absorb both printing and writing and
newsprint and the engineering and paper production experience required.
The Project was conceived to meet specifically the Indian Government's twin
objectives of expanding production of newsprint and utilizing bagasse as a
fibrous raw material.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      The Project preparation and promotion started in mid-1970 by
Seshasayee Paper and Boards Limited (SPB), which owns and operates a
successful paper mill in India, at Erode, in Tamilnadu. SPB was one of the
first Indian paper mills to use bagasse, although only for printing and
writing paper and only intermittently in small quantities.
2.02       In April 1979 the Project sponsors, Tamilnadu Newsprint and Paper
Limited (TNPL) was incorporated as a public limited company promoted and
controlled by the Government of Tamilnadu. The Managing Director of SPB
was appointed Chairman of TNPL, five other members of the Board were senior
civil servants, and the Executive Director was the Commissioner Secretary
of the Tamilnadu Department of Industry. SPB was appointcl as the Project
Consultant. The SPB Project team continued preparation and a detailed
feasibility study was completed by SPB in late 1979.
2.03      The Project was appraised on the basis of the feasibility study
in November 1980, and post appraised in March 1981. The appraisal missions
focusse.4 their work mainly on the following aspects: technological risk,
coal surply and alternative sources of fuel, supply contract for the main
machinery, process design and project implementation, financing plan and
level of Government ownership and control in TNPL. These areas are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
2.04      Technological Risk.  It was noted that there is virtually no
unusual technological risk associated with the production of printing and
writing paper from bagasse for the Indian market. The additional cost of
capital required for the production of newsprint was estimated at only
US$4-5 million, so the cost associated with the relatively risky aspect of
the Project is quite low, especially when compared with the potential
technological benefits to be derived. Moreover the pilot tests indicated
that the mechanical pulping process proposed for the Project was
technically feasible and issues like paper quality and factors affecting
pulp yield were expected to be resolved by the time project came on stream.
2.05      Coal Supply.  It was noted that TNPL had received letters from
the coal companies confirming that they would be able to supply coal to the
Project. Nevertheless, it was agreed between TNPL and the Bank that while
the probability of a significant shortfall in supply of coal was small, the
potential shortfall needed to be secured by an array of alternative fuels.
Therefore it was decided that boilers in the paper mill would be designed
to burn coal, oil, pith or lignite, or a combination thereof.
2.06      Supply contract for the main machinery, and process design.  It
was noted that the consortium for the supply of the main equipment package
and provision of process technology included three companies under
independent contracts. However, to ensure accountability for the suppliers
of goods and services and for coordination between process design, basic



- 3 -
and detail engineering, and hardware, it was agreed that a single
responsibility contract should be drawn with the consortium.
2.07      Level of Government Ownership.  Originally the Government of
Tamilnadu controlled 100% of TNPL. It was agreed that the Company should
be professionally managed and become autonomous from the state Government
in its day-to-day operations. Therefore, the composition of the Board of
Director was changed, and the Government of Tamilnadu's shareholding was
reduced to about 47%. The balance of the equity came from the Development
Assistance Fund (DAF) of the Government of India (27%), Indian Financial
Institutions (20%) and small institutional shareholders (6%).
2.08      In July 1981, negotiations between the Indian authorities and the
Bank took place, and on September 15, 1981, the Bank's Executive Directors
approved a loan of US$100.0 million to the Government of India on standard
Bank terms. The Government agreed that the proceeds of the Bank loan of
US$100.0 million equivalent would be on-lent to the Development Assistant
Fund (DAF), administered by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)
for a period of 15 years, including 5 years' grace, at an interest rate of
8.25%. DAF/IDBI would pass on US$77.5 million equivalent as loan on equal
repayment terms (i.e., 15 years including 5 years' grace) with its then
normal onlending interest rate (14.0%). The remaining US$22.5 million
equivalent would be passed on to TNPL for the Project as equity. The loan
became effective on March 22, 1982.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2.09      The Project was conceived specifically to meet the Government's
twin objectives of expanding production of both newsprint and printing and
writing and of utilizing bagasse as a fibrous raw material.
2.10      The Tamilnadu Newsprint Project ComFrises:
(a)  an integrated pulp and paper mill, which, operating at 90% of
design capacity, could produce 100,000 tpy of newsprint or
80,0C0 tpy of printing and writing paper or any combination of
the two, using bagasse (about 80% overall) and eucalyptus (20%)
as fibrous raw materials; and
(b)  coal fired boilers and fuel handling equipment installed and
operated at five sugar mills to release bagasse for use in the
paper mill.
2.11      The Project is located near the town of Pugular, in Central
Tamilnadu State, about 300 km southwest of Madras, ser¶'iced by satisfactory
road and railway connections. To provide for an efficient transport flow
to the site the Government of Tamilnadu upgraded the road connection from
Pugular to the site and the Government of India permitted the constructioP
of a railway spur from Pugular to the plant site.

III. PROJECT iMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      A primary objective of this project tJas to produce newsprint
economically using sugar cane bagasse as the main raw material, with no
imported long-fiber chemical or mechanical woodpulp. This objective has
been substantially achieved, and represents a significant technological
advance of importance to India and other developing countries. TNPL h.as
demonstrated this achievement with the production of several thousand tons
of newsprint of acceptable commercial quality using the new process and a
furnish of more than 75% bagasse pulp and the balance mill-produced
hardwood chemical pulp. The quality of this newsprint is significantly
better than any other newsprint produced in the country. The operating
crews are currently perfecting their operating procedures and techniques to
allow continuous long-term production using the new process. Details of
actual monthly paper production and its furnish are given in Annex 3-1.
The Company is making good progress with this technological breakthrough
and it is expected that within six months the blend will reach the
appraisal target on a continuous basis.
3.02      The objective of producing printing and writing paper of good
quality from a furnish of not less than 80% bagasse pulp has been fully
achieved.
B. Project Scope Changes
3.03      At the time of appraisal it was envisaged that only 66 dwelling
units would be constructed and financed as part of the Project, at a cost
of about Rs 10 million. In addition, construction of 400 dwelling units
was planned as non-project housing for which the Project was to contribute
Rs 4.0 million. TNPL was unable to secure the assistance of the Government
of Tamilnadu in this area and hence the company proceeded with the
construction of 300 dwelling units out of the 400 units using approximately
Rs 30 million of the Project funds to avoid difficulties in attracting and
retaining trained manpower. Apart from this minor change there was no
chaige in Project scope.
C. Project Management
3.04      TNPL appointed SPB as project consultants responsible for project
implementation, supervision of detailed engineering, procurement and
coordilnation with suppliers. SPB with a designated team from TNPL,
assisted intermittently by expatriates and local consultants (at one time
by Reed International of UK), was responsible for undertaking among others,
supervision of basic engineering, supervision of detailed process design,
preparation of tender documenits, and evaluation of bids. Civil works
design and detailed engineering were carried out by Indian consultants.



-5-
D.  Employment and Training
3.05      The mill has provided direct permanent employment for some 1,425
workers in addition to those who are employed by cotltractors engaged in
harvesting pulpwood, and in delivering pulpwood and bagasse to the mill.
About 825 of these workers are skilled and the remaining 600 are unskilled
and semi-skilled workers.
3.06      Recruitment posed problems for TNPL at the initial stages of
project implementation. The mill is located in a backward area and had
considerable difficulties in attracting experienced persons. To address
this issue TNPL adopted a policy of manning only about 25% of the posts of
its operators with experienced hands, local people with little industrial
background were re^-uited for the remaining positions. This policy called
for an elaborate training program including sending workers to SPB and
Mysore paper mills. About 200 of TNPL's operators were trained in these
mills, and later, when the TNPL plant went into production, it was able to
give in-plant training to more than 400 of the recruits. For the highly
skilled technical staff a comprehensive training program was drawn up and
some 20 persons from various engineering disciplines received training
abroad ranging from one to six months.
E. Use and Performance of Consultants
3.07      The Project consultant has been involved in the entire project
cycle, starting from project idea and identification to preparation,
planning, implementation, training, start-up and operational assistance.
The project consultant performance was judged to be very good by both TNPL
and the Bank. According to the company, the project consultant not only
performed a remarkable job, but also contributed considerably to the
creation and stabilization of the TNPL organization and corporate culture.
P. Procurement
3.08      All major machinery and equipment was procured under
international competitive bidding (ICB) using Bank Guidelines. TNPL/SPB
report that they experienced no difficulties following these Guidelines.
The loan was fully disbursed in the original categories with no changes.
3.09      The procurement through ICB was spread among 11 countries.  The
major package consisting of the paper machine, and all the specialized
bagasse pulping equipment and basic engineering services for the entire
Project, was procured from an Anglo-American Consortium. Indian suppliers
selected through ICB supplied 32.1% of the Bank financed goods. For
purpose of bid evaluation local suppliers enjoyed a preference margin of
15%. UK, USA and French firms supplied 28.0%, 11.9%, and 8.7%
respectively.' Full procurement details are shown in Annex 3-2.
3.10      In the Draft Project Completion Report prepared by the Company,
TNPL states that they believe further improvements are possible in the
procurement procedures which will benefit the project in terms of reduction
in cost. Their suggestion is as follows:
I



- 6 -
"With open tendering procedure, the-prices quoted by the
tenderers are. read out and are known to all tenderers. TNPL's
experience with such a procedure is that tenderers are
deliberately vague in defining their scope of supply particularly
in respect of auxiliary items. Such auxiliary items, for
example, are supporting structures, degree of
automation/instrumentation, electrical drives, etc. Depending
upon the price differential available in relation to the nearest
competitor, the tenderer redefines his scope of supplies of these
auxiliaries. In other words, open tendering procedure restricts
the negotiating capacity of the project authorities to a large
extent but provides more leverage to the suppliers. In order to
overcome the above shortcoming, it is suggested that tender
opening can be done in the presence of nominated representative
of the Bank (perhaps local financial institutions) but not in the
presence of tenderers."
This criticism can best be met by ensuring more detailed and carefully
prepared bidding documents to avoid the need for negotiating extra items in
the scope of supply.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.11      A comparison of the implementation schedule for the Project at
the time of appraisal with the actual experience is given in Annex 3-3. At
the time of appraisal it was estimated that the Project take off date was
June 1981, and the commercial production would start in July 1984, and in
one stage. These targets were not achieved. The Project implementation
commenced in September 1981 (3 months behind original schedule), the paper
mill started its operation in September 1984 (about 3 months late) using
imported pu.p, and subsequently the pulp mill started its commercial
operation in three stages: hardwood pulp lizte in February 1985 (8 months
late); chemical bagasse pulp line in April 1985 (10 months late); and
finally mechanical bagasse pulp line in July 1985 (13 months behind the
original schedule). In the Company's view, no delays were caused by Bank
or IDBI's procedures. The main causes of the delays are listed below.
(a)  Natural Causes
(i) Development of process technology took longer than
anticipated. The final configuration could only be fixed in
April 1984. To accommodate these final configurations
several delays in pulp mill construction were necessary.
(ii) The casing of turbine rotors supplied by a reputable foreign
manufacturer was rejected due to poor workmanship. This
resulted in the turbo generator arriving about 6 months
behind original schedule.
(iii) Problem with the design of steam lines feeding to the
generator system. This caused a further 3 months delay.



-7-
.(b) Force MaJeure
(i) The Madras port strike during April 1984 coincided with the
arrival of 30 ships carrying some of TNPL's equipment and
machinery. The strike, which lasted 6 weeks, resulted in
about one month delay in project implementationo
(ii) Collision between a ship carrying some of TNPL's equipment
(power boiler) and a tug boat resulted in equipment being
received by TNPL after about two months delay.
H. Ecology
3.12      The Government of India has specific standards for pulp and paper
effluents. These standards are in line with international standards and
are satisfactory to the Bank. In accordance with these standards, the
Project is equipped to deal with liquid and solid effluent and air
emission through installation of in-plant controls and external treatment
facilitieso
3.13      The mills' liquid effluent, after primary and secondary
treatment, discharges to a canal outside the plant site and is subsequently
fully used for irrigation of sugar cane fields. These systems and
arrangements have been operating according to plan and design expectation.
However, in the last quarter of 1985 the main liquid effluent treatment
plant ran into some technical difficulties when the treatment plant was
upset due to excessive spillage of fiber in the drainage system from the
bagasse storage pile. This resulted in an over-loaded aeration lagoon
operation to the extent of 25-30%. While this condition was considered
temporary and avoidable, TNPL has initiated measures to cope with any
recurrence of such conditions. While the episode involved no significant
danger to the environment and/or public reaction to the mills' pollution
levels, TNPL is committed to continue its efforts in closely monitoring the
environmental impact of the Project.
1. Capital Costs, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.14      The actual total financing required for the Project was
US$234.7 million equivalent, of which US$82.5 million (35.1%) was for
foreign exchange, compared with the appraisal estimate of US$237.5 million,
of which US$115.0 million (48.4%) was foreign exchange, representing cost
underrun of 1% in US$ terms. However, the Project experienced significant
cost overrun in Indian Rupee terms. The total financing required for the
Project amounted to (Rs 2,500 million) 1/ as against (Rs 1,900 million)
estimated at the time of appraisal, representing about 31.5% cost overrun.
The profile of capital expenditures is given in Annex 3-4. A comparison
1/   On the basis of actual expenditure and exchange rate, the average
parity rate between US$ and Indian Rupees has been worked out to 10.6
which has been used for developing dollar equivalent of costs.
Details are in the Project File.

between appraisal estimate and the achieved estimate is given in
Annexes 3-5A and 3-5B and summarized below:
India - TNPL: Total Financing Required
(Rs million)
Appraisal Estimate         Actual

Total Financing Required         1,900.0                 2,500.0
3.15      The major source of cost overrun is attributed mainly to:  the
adverse effect in exchange rate between the US$ and Indian Rupee (about
Rs 190 million); increase in "Auxiliary Duty" imposed by the Government of
India (The auxiliary duty at the time of appraisal was 5% of cif prices.
This was increased to 25% in stages. As a result, payment to the
Government on imported goods increased by about Rs 110 million); increase
in provisions for spare parts (Rs 61 million); increase in cost of civil
works (Rs 140 million - increase in price of cement, steel, increased in
covered area and inclusion of non-project housing - 300 dwelling units
(para 3.04) - end some changes in conceptual design).

3.17       The Bank loan of US$100 million provided Rs 1,065 million as
against Rs 800 million at the time of appraisal. Additional funding was
provided by the Government of Tamilnadu as equity and subordinated loan,
and from Indian Financial Institutions, in such a way and amount that each
Government & Indian Financial Institution remained below the threshold of
50% to ensure corporate autonomy (para 2.07).
3.18       The loan closed at the original closing date of August 31, 1985.
The loan was fully disbursed and the account closed on April 17, 1986.

IV.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      The mill is currently licensed to produce 50,000 tpy of newsprint
plus 40,000 tpy of printing and writing paper. Production of paper began
in September 1984, when 134 tons of newsprint was produced ueing imported
pulp. Since that time, the various pulping lines have been brought on
stream, and by late 1985 all pulping facilities were operational. However,
at the time of preparing this report, significant quantities of imported
pulp were still being used for the production of newsprint. On the other
hand, printing and writing paper is now (since March 1986) produced with
100% mill-produced pulp.
4.02      The monthly pulp furnish used for each paper grade is detailed in
Annex 3-1, which shows that printing and writing paper is being produced
with a pulp furnish reasonably close to that anticipated at the time of
appraisal. In the case of newsprint, however, not more than 58% of own
pulp has been used over a monthly period, and of this, no more than about



- 11 -
35% has been bagasse pulp. For short periods (one or two days) newsprint
has been produced with no imported pulp, and even from 100% bagasse pulp,
wiVh mechanical bagasse pulp making up to 50% of the mixture. However, on
a steady basis, the mill is still using large quantities of imported pulp
whe:n producing newsprint, and this is expected to continue until the end of
1986, while the operating crews build up experience with the new
technology, particularly in the area of balancing the mechanical pulping
section.
4.03      Annex 4-1 shows the total monthly actual production of paper as a
percent of capacity. These data show that the mill has quickly reached a
high level of capacity utilization in terms of paper production, although
it must be remembered that significant quantities of imported pulp have
been used in this production. However, this point aside, capacity build-up
has exceeded expectations of appraisal. In the first full year of
operation, 1985, production was 16% higher than anticipated at appraisal,
and in the latest three months has reached an average of 90% of design
capacity. It was not expected to reach this level until the third full
year of operation.
Bo Market Developments
4.04      Printing and writing paper currently represents about 50% of all
paper consumption in India and most of this is produced domestically. As
shown in the following table, the demand of printing and writing paper as
estimated at the time of appraisal is close to the actual experience.

4.05      At the time of appraisal, the effective installed productive
capacity for printing and writing paper in India was slightly less than
demand, and it was projected that domestic demand would grow faster than
qstalled capacity. Therefore a growing supply gap was predicted for
printing and writing paper which was estimated to reach about 130,000 tons
by 1986. In fact, a large number of mills, mostly very small sized, have
been built in the last five years, and many of these are producing, or have



-12 -
the capacity to produce, printing and writing paper. The result is that
the anticipated supply gap for printing and writing paper has not developed
to the expected degree. Lack of firm data on the new mills makes it
virtually impossible to quantify the gap or surplus, but it is clear that
TNPL does not, for the present, enjoy the secure market in printing and
writing paper that was anticipated at the time of appraisal. However, many
of the new mills are small and inefficient and TNPL will have a competitive
advantage. In any case, the medium-term situation for all paper grades in
India, particularly printing and writing paper, is one of significant
shortage, because of increasing emphasis on literacy coupled with a steady
decline in the capacity utilization of most of the existing mills which are
old, inefficient and suffering from long-term lack of maintenance.
4.06      Newsprint.  Domestic demand for newsprint during 1979-85 grew at
a rate of about 4.5% per annum, compared with an estimated 5% at the time
of appraisal. Details of annual quantity of newsprint indigenously
produced and imported are given below:

Demand," 21/9/83.
Indigenous newsprint production which was equivalent to about 14% of total
demand in 1979-80 was able to meet about 49% of demand in 1984/85. In
summary, the market for TNPL newsprint output is secure.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Basis of Projection
5.01      The assumptions used for the financial analysis of the Project
are discussed in the following paragraphs. The basic projection has been
prepared at first quarter 1986 price levels.
5.02      Volume.  The paper mill started its commercial operation, using
home made pulp blended with some imported pulp in October 1985

(para 4.01). The following table shows the forecasts for annual production
until the Project reaches its steady state.
India - Tamilnadu Newsprint Project
(Projected production in tons)
1986      1987       1988      1989
Newsprint              37,500    45,000    50,000    50,000
Printing & Writing    30,000    36,000    40,000    40,000
Total             67,500    81,000    90,000    90,000
5.03      Prices.  The ex-factory price for newsprint in March 1986 is
Rs 9330 (US$746) per ton which is about 11% higher, in real terms, than the
price at time of appraisal. The weighted average ex-factory price for
printing and writing in March 1986 is Rs 11,588 (US$927), assuming a mix of
52.5% cream wove paper (reel and sheets), 10% duplicating paper, 25%
maplitho sheets and the balance of the 12.5% in color printing paper. This
weighted average price for the same mix is about 2% lower, in real terms,
than the price at time of appraisal.
5.04      Production Cost.  The estimated annual production cost, excluding
depreciation and financial charges, in 1986 terms, is about Rs 485 million
compared to Rs 431 million at the time of appraisal, an increase in direct
manufacturing costs of about 13% (Annex 5-1). While the unit price of some
of the inputs has increased, others have dropped. For example, in real
terms, coal price increased by 42% while caustic soda price dropped 14%
(Annex 5-2). Similarly, physical quantities have varied considerably from
the estimates made at appraisal (Annex 5-3). The major reason for this is
the change in process technology (para 1.03 and Annex 1-1). This change,
which was necessitated to achieve acceptable quality and runability,
results in higher pulping yield, a lower requirement for bagasse, and
consequently less coal for bagasse replacement in the sugar mill.  The
yield improvement is estimated to reduce coal requirement by about 10,000
tpy. On the other hand, this same change in technology results in higher
electrinal energy demand and a higher consumption of bleaching chemicals.
The net result of the technology change is to increase manufacturing cost.
Compared with traditional newsprint manufactured from coniferous wood,
bagasse-based newsprint cests about US$50/ton more (about 10% of current
international selling price) due primarily to higher costs of fiber and
chemicals.
5.05      Projected financial results for four significant cases have been
prepared and are shown in Annexes 5-4A through 5-4D. For the Base case thb
Project is expected to show its first profit in 1991, the sixth year of
operation. This is four years later than the appraisal estimate. The main
reason is the company's policy to exploit the provision of accelerated
depreciation allowed under the new tax code of February 1986. The company
would have reached profitability in the third year of operation if the



- 14 -
original depreciation provision were used. In the unlikely event of the
company's being forced to continue importing long fiber pulp to the extent
of about 15% of its fiber consumption, profit would not be achieved until
1992. For the case of TNPL being required to sell some of its white
printing and writing paper at levy price of of Rs 7,200 per ton,
profitability would be delayed until 1993.2/ Finally, for case of TNPL to
produce only newsprint from its second year of operation and import 15%
long-fiber pulp during the life of the Project, profitability would be
delayed until 1993.
B. Financial Analysis
5.06      The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) before and after
taxes for the Project is 12.3% and 11.1%, respectively - Case I/Base Case
(Annex 5-5A) - compared to 15.4% and 12.4% estimated at the time of
appraisal. The lower rate of return is mainly due to higher capital cost
and higher manufacturing cost (paras 3.15-3.16 and 5.04). The sensitivity
analysis indicates that 10% real increase in ex-factory prices would
enhance the FIRR from 12.3% to 15.2% (Annex 5-5B)   If the company is to
import long fiber pulp for the entire life of tne Project, the FIRR before
taxes will decrease to 11.7% - Case II (Annex 5-5C). If the company is
required to sell part of its printing paper at a concessional price the
FIRR will decrease to 11.1% - Case III (Annex 5-SD). Finally, if the
company was to produce only newsprint using 15% imported long-fiber pulp
during the life of the Project the FIRR before tax would be reduced to
10.8% - Case IV (Annex 5-5E).
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      The detailed assumptions and calculations concerning adjustments
made to financial costs and benefits to obtain economic values are detailed
in Annexes 6-LA through C. In short, to obtain economic costs and
benefits, financial figures have been adjusted by correcting for customs
duties, taxes, subsidies, and transfer payments. Tradeable items are
valued at their CIF border prices. On this basis economic costs of coal
and wood have been developed which are about 14% and 39%, respectively,
higher than the financial costs based on notional imports of coal and
2/   As the result of the amendments to Paper (Regulations of Production)
Order 1978 and Paper (Control) Order 1979 through GOI notifications
dated April 11, 1983, exemptions granted to units manufacturing paper
with 75% bagasse pulp in the furnish, from the applicability of above
two orders have been withdrawn. As a result TNPL will be required to
manufacture white printing paper to the extent of 5% of its paper
production in the first year, 10% in the second year, 15% in the third
year, 20% in the four year and 25% in the fifth and subsequent years
and make the same available at concessional rate of Rs 7,200 per
tonne. Since, compliance with provisions of said orders will result
in substantial reduction in profitability of the project, TNPL has
already sought exemption from the applicability of these orders and is
hopeful of getting favourable considerations from GOI.

wood. Unskilled and semiskilled labor which represents about 40% of the
total labor force has been shadow priced at two thirds of its financial
cost. For newsprint and printing and writing the prices used in economic
analysis are Rs 8,400 (US$672 vs. US$700 used at the time of appraisal) and
Rs 11,500 (US$920 vs. US$1,005 used at the time of appraisal),
respectively, equal to the CIF prices of imported paper of comparable grade
and quality.
6.02      Economic cost and benefit streams and the economic rate of return
(ERR) are shown in Annex 6-2.  The ERR for the project is 13.4% compared to
18.7% estimated at the time of appraisal. The lower ERR is mainly due to
higher capital costs, higher manufacturing cost (paras 3.15 and 5.04) and
lower prices. The difference in ERR due to lower prices accounts for
2.1%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ERR will increase to
16.5% if there is a 10% real price increase for both paper grades
(Annex 6-3).
VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Although one of the Project's objectives, to produce newsprint of
acceptable quality, at high speed, on a continuous basis using at least 75%
bagasse furnish, has not been yet fully realized, significant technological
progress has been made towards the production of newsprint using bagasse as
fibrous raw material (paras 3.01-3.02). Based on progress made so far, the
Company and the Bank are confident of full technological success. This
progress has been made possible primarily because of the Bank's and the
Government of India's willingness to take risk and to participate actively
in development and eventually export of indigenous technology for
production of newsprint from bagasse.
7.02      In addition to providing financing, the Bank provided advice
and assistance to TNPL. Specifically during the project appra'sal the
Bank assisted the project sponsors in the design of the scope of the
responsibility to be included for the major equipment package supplied
by a consortium (paras 2.06 and 3.10). The Bank requested from TNPL that
in addition to the individual responsibility provisions stipulated by each
supplier of goods and services within the consortium, TNPL should ask for a
single responsibility contract from one of the consortium members
acceptable to the Bank. This request, which provided the framework of
contractual agreement with the consortium and TNPL, subsequently proved to
be useful in safeguarding TNPL's interest. A few months after the contract
effectiveness between TNPL and the consortium, one of the members of the
consortium unilaterally decided to restrict its activities and withdraw its
services from the Project. The single responsibility contract was
instrumental to ensure the continuity of responsibility.
7.03      The Project is considered to have been well prepared by the
Project sponsors. The Project was jointly appraised by the Bank and the
Indian Financial Institutions (IFI). There was good cooperation among the
Bank, IFI, the Government of India, the Government of Tamilnadu and many
other agencies in India indirectly dealing with the Project (India Coal



- 16 -
Limited, Neyveli Lignite, Indian Railways, etc.). TNPL has been set up as
a newsprint Project which has to depend on the supply of bagasse from
various sugar mills. This involves transportation of coal from the
newsprint site to the sugar mills, operation of coal-fired boilers in the
sugar mills and transport of bagasse to the newsprint plant from the sugar
mills. If an integrated sugar mill-cum-paper complex can be established,
this would improve the economics in operation by way of reduced
transportation cost of coal and bagasse, besides lower capital cost on
account of common steam and power systems.  These savings are estimated to
be about US$100 per ton of paper output, or about 20% of manufacturing
costs.
7.04      As stated earlier the Project was under preparation by SPB
since mid-1970 and the Project sponsors had invested a significant
amount of time and resources to develop the Project.  The Project
sponsors, and subsequently the project management were a dynamic,
professional and business oriented team, committed and involved in the
Project concept, technical details and commercial aspects. This resulted
in a well conceived, and efficiently implemented project. The lesson
learned is that good project preparation, and commitment from project
sponsors, is a key to project success. The Bank should put more emphasis
on the appraisal of the project sponsors and management.
7.05      As with many other projects in various parts of the world,
the Bank was too optimistic on the international price prospects,
resulting in a higher estimated economic rate of return for the Project
than is now expected (para 6.01). The Bank's appraisal should concentrate
more on price issues and develop more realistic price ass4umptions.
7.06      Actual disbursement profile was similar to the forecast
except for a lag of about 9 months, mainly due to delayed loan
effectiveness caused by among others delays in preparation of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement. Annex 7-1 shows pictorially actual and forecast
disbursement profiles for the Bank loan. The lesson learned is that the
Bank's appraisal should focus more on the loan effectiveness prerequisites,
and be more realistic on the time required for borrowers to fulfill their
requirement.
7.07      This Project explored and introduced new technology to India.
The successful start-up and continued good operational results at TNPL
demonstrate that in certain circumstances, and with suitable training and
technical support, introduction of new technology to developing countries
can be appropriate.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 2050-IN)
Development of TNPL Technology
Introduction
1.        The utilization of sugar cane bagasse for the production of
various types of paper and board has been practiced in a number of
countries for many years. Currently there are approximately 100
bagasse-based pulp and paper mills in the world with installed capacity of
more than 2 million tons. For the most part, these mills produce a
medium-quality printing and writing paper for domestic consumption.
Several other paper grades have been successfully produced, but the
production of newsprint has met with very little success. Most of the
world's newsprint is produced in temperate zone countries which have
natural forests of coniferous species and cheap electric power.
Newsprint Characteristics
2.        Because of its one-time short-term use, newsprint must be
inexpensive to produce, but still it must have specific quality
characteristics. Primarily, it must be sufficiently strong to run at high
speed through printing presses without breaking, have the correct surface
characteristics and whiteness for printing, and be sufficiently opaque so
that it can be printed on both sides without show-through. All of these
requirements are best achieved by using long-fibered coniferous wood as the
main pulping raw material. Most developing countries do not have
coniferous forests, and when they do, prefer to use the wood for higher
valued products such as sawnwood, plywood, or high-quality bleached pulp.
Therefoie, developing countries have had to turn to other fibers, and sugar
cane bagasse has been the most promising.
History of Bagasse Newsprint Production
3.        There have been a number of attempts to produce newsprint from
bagasse in the past 30 years. Most of these attempts have been based
primarily on chemical pulping processes and have been largely unsuccessful
because the yield of pulp and the opacity of the paper have been too low.
In most cases, the only way these mills have been even partly successful is
by using significant quantities of imported pulp - long fiber chemical pulp
for strength, and mechanical pulp to achieve opacity. Otherwise,
production of newsp-int has been abandoned and the mills have reverted to
making printing and writing paper from chemical bagasse pulp, or have shut
down completely.

Development of TNPL's Newsprint Process
4.        In 1980, TNPL entered into a contract with an Anglo-American
consortium to supply equipment, engineering, and technology, for the
production of newsprint from bagasse. The contract guaranteed product
quality, paper machine speed, and the levels of material and utilities
inputs. A key element of this contract was the development of a new
process which required an extensive program of laboratory, pilot plant, and
commercial testing. TNPL deputed two scientists to work with the
consortium in their USA laboratories. After a thorough literature search
and visits to all of the mills which had attempted bagasse newsprint
production, TNPL concluded that the key to success lay in the utilization
of mechanical pulping to the maximum extent possible in order to reach the
twin goals of high yield and high opacity. It was also recognized early in
the program that the inherent heterogeneity of bagasse fibers would pose a
special problem, but could be beneficial if properly exploited.
5.        Early laboratory work was encouraging and it was at this time
that the TNPL project was appraised and approved. During the early stages
of implementation, pilot plant trials were undertaken on the basis of the
laboratory work. These proved unsuccessful. Opacity was too low, and even
more important, the sheet of newsprint could not be carried through the
newsprint machine at reasonable speed without frequent breaks. This
failure, after project implementation had already begun, was obviously
cause for great alarm, and inspired a new round of laboratory
investigations and new approaches at a fundamental level.
6.        The new research effort led to a significant change in process
flow, with the addition of an intermediate chemi-mechanical pulping
stage. The laboratory results were tested at the pilot plant level in
April 1984, and were judged to be successful. Newsprint was produced with
all guarantees of paper machine speed and input levels of materials and
utilities being met.
7.        With the success of the pilot plant trials, the decision was made
to alter the mill process configuration. This involved additional
equipment for the new chemi-mechanical pulping line, and in accordance with
the provisions of the contract, the Consortium provided this equipment at
no extra charge. The change did, however, contribute to a delay in
implementation.
Current Status of Technology
8.        The TNPL mill began operation in September 1984, using imported
chemical and mechanical pulp. In the case of printing and writing paper,
only mill-produced pulp is now used. For short periods, newsprint has also
been produced using only mill-produced pulp, including 50% mechanical
bagasse pulp. However, control of the process at the mill level has proved
to be more difficult than expected, particularly in the technique of
balancing fiber flow within the mechanical pulping section. Therefore,
while the operating crews are gaining experience, imported pulp is still



ANNEX 1-1
-19-                               Page 3
being used for part of the pulp furnish for newsprint. It is expected that
imported pulp will not be used after the end of 1986.
9.        Although successful newsprint production has only been achieved
for relatively short runs, the mill staff are confident that the process as
it now stands Is successful and no further changes are considered
necessary.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - TAMILNADU NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 2050-IN)
Assumptions Used in Economic Analysis
1.        Economic rate of return calculations for the Project have been
carried out with the same basic cost and benefit steams as for financial
analysis (Annex 5-5A), adjusted as follows:
(a) Customs duty, excise duty and sales tax have been eliminated from
the capital cost estimates. The overall effect is a reduction of
about 20Z in the total plant cost (Annex 6-lB).
(b) Production costs have been adjusted as follows:
(i)  excise duty, sales tax and generation tax have been
eliminated;
(ii) concessional power tariffs available to the project during
initial five years of operations are not taken into account;
(iii)  an economic cost for fuel has been developed based on
notional imports of coal having calorific value at
6,000 kcal/kg at Rs 850 per ton (landed cost). Adjustments
for calorific value give equivalent price at Rs 628 for coal
and Rs 425 for lignite as against the financial price of
Rs 550 and Rs 353 for coal and lignite, respectively;
(iv) economic cost of wood is estimated at Rs 500 per tonne as
against Rs 360 per tonne taken for financial cost; and
(v)  based on the economic cost for fuel, bagasse cost works out
to Rs 338 per tonne as against Rs 306 per tonne taken for
financial cost.
2.        Selling prices assumed for economic production are (Rs per
tonne):
