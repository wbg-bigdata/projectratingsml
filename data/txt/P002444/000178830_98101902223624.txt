REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for the equivalent of
$8 million on standard 3A terms to help finance a Second Education Project.
PART I - THE ECONOfY
2.        A report entitled "?Recent Economic Developments in Somalia" (Report
No. AE-28a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 28, 1972.
Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I. A Bank economic mission is
scheduled to visit Somalia in October/November 1974.
3.        Somalia comprises the mountainous .:idge that forms the Horn of
Africa and the coastal plain that lies southi!ast of the Ethiopian highlands.
The Somali Democratic Republic was born as an independent nation in 1960
through a merger of uhe former Italian Trust Territory of Somalia and the
former British Protectorate of Somalia. In October 1969, the Governnent of
Somalia was taken over by the military in a bloodless coup. Since then, the
Supreme Revolutionary Council consisting of army and police officers has been
the highest decision-making body in the country.
Recent Economic Perfor.mance
4.        With an e8timated per capita income in the order of $70, Somalia is
classified by the UNf as one of the 25 least developed countries of the werld.
The economy is simple and largely undeveloped and there are few natural resources
which can be easily axploit.ed at present.  Most of the people depend upon livestock
and subsistence crops for their livelihood. Living conditions for the bnrgely
nomadic population are generally harsh. Much of the country is arid, water
supplies are scattered and often unreliable and periodic droughts bring great
hardship to both people and their livestock. The small monetary sector of the
economy provides only limited opportunities for employment. Apart from the
traditional export of livestock, commercial agriculture is mainly centered
around the production of bananas for export, principally by Italian concession
holders, and the production of sugar for the domestic market. Manufacturing
and other sectors of the economy are restricted in their potential by the
small size of the market, poor infrastructure and the shortage of capital and
entrepreneurial experience. Social services are still very inadequate; only
a small minority of children go to school and most rural communities are
virtually isolated from the rest of the country by poor roads and communications.



- 2 -
5.        The first decade after independence was characterized by chronic
financial difficulties which were manifested in a complete reliance on
external assistance to balance the country's recurrent budget as well as to
finance all development expendii;ures. This assistance was, however, less
effective than it. might have been because of the limited administrative
capacity to evaluate, prepare and implement sound projects.
6.        The 1evolutionary Government which came to power in October 1969
is comiritted to the goal of economic development. It places a premium on
self-rEliance, which is evident in its management of public finance. The
recurrent budgetary position showed considerable improvement starting in
1970 arnd a small surplus was recorded in 1971 and 1972, compared to deficits
in earlier years.  This achievement was due mainly to effective control of
expenditure, improved tax collection and cuts in salaries and wages of govern-
ment employees. Expenditures on defense still account for about one-fourth
of totel recurrent expenditure, but their rate of increase was reduced to
abcut 7 percent between 1970 and 1972 cumpared with the average annual rate
of increase of about 15 percent between 1967 and 1970. Budgetary support
from Italy, which Somalia has been receiving since 1961, continues but is
nowi used mainly to finance development expenditures.
7.        Beca.use of arid climate 87 percent of the coiitrry is unsuitable for
cultivation and about 70 percent of the population are nomads engaged in live-
stock production. of the remaining 13 percent of the area (8 million ha) only
about 600,000 ha is now cultivated, mainly in the higher rainfall areas along
the Juba and Shebelli rivers and In the northwest region. Along these two
rivers, about 100,00C ha are under irrigation; flood irrigation is used to
grow subsistence crops such as maize and sorghum and controlled irrigation,
mainly on the Shebelli, to grow such crops as bananas, sugarcane, fruit and
oilseeds.
8.        Livestock, anima.l products aid bananas axaC'ounted For over 90 percent
of total exports during the last five years.  TJivc- anzmals -are mainly exported
to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Gulf States and processed meat  to the USSR. The
banana industry is riowi recovering from tne effects of the zlosiure of the Suez
Canal in 1967 and the withdrawal of the Dreferentia.1 treatment on the Italian
market in 1969. Although Italy st-ll absorbs about 75 perceni: of the exports,
new markets in the Middle East should enhance the industry's viability.  Sugar-
cane, irrigated with water drawn from -!ha Shebelli river, is the most important
commercial crop for domestic consumption. Maize, millet and sorghum are the
major subsistence crops but their yields are low. Potential 2cists for citrus
fruits. rice, cotton and groundnuts. 3ome efforts to er.ploit this potential
have been started with external assista ce from the EEC, ti-e U3SR and the
People's Republic of Korea. Barring a few exceptisons, f2rming yields little
more than subsistence living at present and Somalia still imports substantial
amounts of foodgrains. However, -improved expicitation of liveetock, conser-
vation of land and water and diversification of agricultu-re, supported by
improved farm inputs and techniques, could go far towards developing the
potential.
9.        Somalia's trade balance has been constant ly in def"icit in recent
years, the average deficit over the period 1970-72 being $i6 millicn annually.



According to the balance of payments statist:cs, exports grew at <a-x average
annual rate of 7.6 percent in the period 1965-71 and rose by 38 percent in
1972, while imports grew 6.2 percent annually and 20 percent, respectively,
during the corresponding periods. From 1968 to 1972 the balanr,e of payments
deficit on current account averaged about US$8 million but the overall balance
was in surplus due to large capital inflows. WUhile information on 1973 is
still incomplete, preliminary figures indica-te a decline in livestock exports
coupled with a higher level of imports, resuLting in a deficit on current
account of U$26 million; there was a. small deficit in the overall balance
for the first time since 1968. The country's official international reserves
(gross) at the end of November 1973 amounted to US$33 million, the equivalent
of about 5 month's imports. Due mainly to the increased cost of oil imports,
it is estimated that the current account deficit will grow to about US$60
million by 1975, thus pointing clearly to the need for a larger inflow of
capital.
10.       Since independence Somalia has received substantial amounts of
foreign aid. From 1965 to 1972 the average annual disbursement of loans
and grants was in the order of $24 million, 70 percent of which was in grants
to finance development projects as well as deficits in the recurrent budget.
The major sources of capital during this period were Italy, the United States,
the European Economic Community, the United Nations, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the USSR. IDA accounted for about 11 percent of the total dis-
bursements of loans in the three-year period from 1970 to 1972. In the last
few years the People's Republic of China and Saudi Arabia made substantial
loan commitments.
11.       At the end of 1972 Somalia's total debt amounted to $232 million
equivalent, of which $107 million was disbursed. The USSR accounted for
44 percent of the disbursed debt while the shares of Saudi Arabia, the Federal
Republic of Germany, United States and IDA were 13 percent, 12 percent,
11 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The major portion of the Chinese
loans are still undisbursed. The debt service ratio in 1972 was 3 percent.
However, interest and amortization payments are to increase substantially from
1973 onwards and the debt service ratio will probably rise to over 10 percent
during the next three to four years. Somalia will, despite recent improvement
in economic performance, continue to need a substantial amount of external aid
for development. As much of this aid as possible should be on concessionary
terms, and because of the dearth of domestic resources, external financing
should be provided for a large part of domestic costs as well as the foreign
costs of investments.
12.       Somalia is at present exclusively dependent on imported oil as a
source of energy except for cooking, for which the majority of the population
uses charcoal and firewood. Of the two main rivers of Somalia, the Shebelli
and the Juba, the Shebelli lacks sufficient flow for hydroelectric purposes
and ends in the dry sand southwest of Mogadiscio. The USSR started construc-
tion of a combined irrigation and hydroelectric scheme on the Juba in 1964,
but completion is reported to be delayed. As the industrial sector in Somalia
is quite small, the demand for power will not increase sharply over the short
run. In the long run, however, power may be needed for the exploitation of
the deposits of thorium, uranium and other minerals in the country. While we



- 4 -
do not -onow the distribution of public and private consumption of gasoline,
it is believed that the pu'blic sector is the largest consumer. Consequently,
the increase in oil prices will reduce the modest savings the Government is
trying to achieve. The increase in the price of gasoline is likely to limit
its consumption in the private sector as incomes are very loa.
13.       In May 1970  the Government nationalized a number of foreign (mainly
Italiar) private enterprises, including an electric poier company, a sugar
refinery and commercial banks. Negotiations on the terms of compensation with
most of the firms have been completed and the Government intends to pay com-
pensation due to other firms or completior of negotiations.
Development Planming
14.       The period of implementation oV' the Government's most recent three-
yea.r Development Program, 1971-73, came to an end in December 1973. The Program
had an investment target of So. Sh. 1000 million ($160 million) and gave high
priority to transport, communications and agriculture which together claimed
about 70 percent of the planned expenditures. The Government, placing a high
premium on self-reliance planned to finance 20 percent of the development
expenditures from internal sources in contrast to the earlier economic plans
(1963-67 and 1971-73) which looked to foreign aid for virtually all of the
financing.
15.       During the first two years of the Program, development expenditures
amounted to only 50 percent of the  lanzned levels for each year. The short-
fall was mainly attributable to uncertainty of external finance as well as
administrative constraints. During the same period, the share of the domestic
financing (38 percent) was higher than the target (20 percent) mainly because
of the shortfall in investment.
16.       The Government has been formulating a new Five-Year Development Plan
to start this year. The draft plan continues to give high priority to agri-
culture and transportation with increased emphasis on education and the fishery
industry. We are discussing with the Government the possibility of a UNDP-
financed planning assistance project to strengthen the planning machinery of
Somalia.
PART !I - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN 3Si)ALIA
17.       Starting in 1965, IDA has made seven credits totalling about $45
million, about 70 percent of which has been for transportation development,
including construction of two trunk roads (Afgoi-Baidoa in the central region
and Hargeisa-Berbera irn the northern region) and a new deep-water port at
.4ogadiscio. The economic future off the country depernds on the development of
agriculture and the livestock export trade.  Provision of basic transportation
infrastructure is an essential  re-recuisite for development and also helps in
the important task of nation-building by tying together Samalia's geographic-
ally isolated regions. IDA credits also assisted Somalia in ed-ucation in 1971
and livestock in 1974. No Bank loans or IFC -nvestments have been made in
Somalia. As mentioned above, ILA credits accounted for. 10 percent of Somalia's



- 5 -
outstanding debt at the end of 1972. Debt service pay.ients on ex:sting IDA
credits in 1980 are projected at 9 percent of Somalia's total debt service
payments on the above debt.
18.       Annex II contains a surmary statement of IhA credits as of June 30,
1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Performance has been
generally satisfactory.
19.       We plan to concentrate our efforts on the country's most important
productive sectors, agriculture and livestock, and also on education and
transport.  Agriculture offers the greatest potential for development but
most rural development activities are only at the beginning stage. Moreover,
agricultural development in Somalia is particularly difficult because most
of the people in rural areas are nomadic. The first effort was the Trans-Juba
Livestock project approved in early 1974. In the second half of the fiscal
year we plan to present another agricultural project to assist development in
the northern region. In education, as noted above, an IDA credit was made in
1971 and the credit proposed herein would complement the earlier project.
9C.       The country's transportation and ccmmunication facilities are
inadequate and the 3overnment plans to continue transport development in
the next few years. The second highway credit under implementation provides
for feasibility studies and detailed ergineering for the improvement of the
Hargeisa-Borama road in the northern region, which would further promote
livestock and agricultural development in the area. Mhe studies are expected
to be completed in the middle af 1975 and to provide the basis for a further
project which IDA could support.
PART III - EDUCATION IN SOMALIA
21.       The education system consists of a h-year elementary course,
a 4-year intermediate course, a h-year general secondary school course or a
2-h-year technical/vocational course following the intermediate level, and
a 4-year university course. Since 1972, promotion between the first two
cycles has been automatic and the two cycles are being merged into an 8-year
primary course.
22.       The weak state ofthe Somali education and training sector is re-
flected in the low literacy rate of 5 percent. The system has suffered from
lack of a Somali script, regional differences in the education systems inhe-
rited from the two colonial administrations, a high rate of nomadism and a
shortage of financial resources. In the 1972 school year, enrolments were
16 percent of the relevant age group at the elementary school level, 9 percent
at the intermediate level and under 4 percent at the secondary level. These
low enrolment ratios indicate the need for expansion of enrolments at all levels.
Eighty-three percent of secondary school students are concentrated around the
two main cities, Mogadiscio and Hargeisa. Educational opportunities in rural
areas are negligible, particularly for nomads who account for about two-thirds
of the country's population and are engaged in the mainstay of the country's
economy, livestock raising. In order to fully apply modern school curricula,
which emphasize practical and science subjects, school buildings, furniture
and e(ouipment require improvement. There is an acute shortage of teachers,
and a large percentage of them are not adequately qualified.



- 6 -
23.       In the last few years, the Govermment has given greater emphasis
to education withi a major effort being directed towards increasing literacy.
As a result, enrolments in primary and general secondary schools have increased
substantially. The adoption by the Government in 1971 of the Somali language
with Latin script as the teaching medium to replace the diverse use of Arabic,
English and Italian has facilitated this expansion. Adult education is also
being given considerable attention by the Gove.rnment. The programs include
an extensive adult education scheme and establishment of farmer training centers
and wamen's education centers. In 1973 about one-third of adults in urban and
settled areas attended literacy classes and short-term courses. But even these
succes3ful programs have only a limited impact on a majority of Somalis, parti-
cularly on nomads.
24.       The draft Five-Year Development Plan, 1974-78, gives equal priority
to the growth of elementary education and to the strengthening of non-formal
education. Most notably, enrolments in grade one are planned to increase by
1C percent p.a. and consequently the enrolment ratio of elementary schools
(grades 1-4) would increase from 16 percent in 1972 to 50 percent in 1983.
Given an increased supply of teachers and the use of the national language
as an instruction medium, the planned increases appear feasible.
25.       Somalia has five technical institutes at the post-intermediate level,
of which two are being improved and expanded under the first IDA Education
Project, and one was built with assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany.
There are also six specialized vocational training institutes. The country
lacks facilities for post-secondary technician training, but the Peoplets
Republic of Korea is considering financing a new Polytechnic.
26.       From 1968 to 1972 the country had no facilities for the pre-service
training of primary teachers. As a result, there is now an acute shortage of
primary school teachers and the situation has been aggravated by construction
of primary schools under self-help schemes. This shortage is expected to be
eased by the expansion of the National Teacher Education Center which is being
assisted by IlD and UNDP/UNESCO and by the establishment of a Teacher Training
College under the proposed Project. (Please see also paragraph 35.)
27.       The Somali National University, for which the Italian Government has
provided financial and technical assistance for many years, has nine faculties
,and 14O0 students and expansion is being planned.
28.       All private schools were nationalized in 197P. Students at all
levels pay no tuition fees but boarders contribute part of the cost.  Si.nce
independence, the recurrent budget for education has been abcut 7 percent of
the Central Government recurrent budget. The ratio is substantially lower
than in neighboring countries mainly because of low enrolments and the
large number of expatriate teachers provided and financed under bilateral
assistance programs. For example in the 1971 school year about 60 percent
of secondary school teachers were expatriates.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       The proposed project will be the second one financed by Iat1 for
education in Somalia. The first Education Credit (1971) of $3.3 million is
financing:
(a) extension of the National Teacher Education Center
providing primary and secondary teacher training;
(b) construction of one new secondary school;
(c) extensions of ten secondary schools;
(d) extensions of one technical school and one
technical/commercial school;
(e) provision of eight mobile training units for
agricultural education; and
(f) technical assistance.
30.       Although implementation is about six months behind schedule due
to changes in Project Unit staff, revision of the project as requested by
the Government and late recruitment of technical specialists, the perform-
ance has improved considerably since late 1972 and most of the lost time
will probably be regained.
31 .      Taking into account a UNESCO Project Identification mission report
of April 1973, a Bank mission held discussions with the Government in
September 1973 which were followed by a Bank Preparation/Appraisal mission in
November/I)ecember 1973. Negotiations took place in Washington in June 1974
with the Somali delegation headed by H. E. Abdirazak Haji Hussein, the
Ambassador to the United Nations Organization.
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project in
Somali Democratic Republic" (No. 438a-SO, dated June 28, 1974) is being
circulated to the Executive Directors separately and a Credit and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III to this Report.
Desc ription
33.       The proposed project is part of the Borrower's education development
program and consists of the following components (map attached):
(a) Academy of Somali Studies - The expansion and rebuilding of
the Academy of Somali Studies, these facilities to include
staff offices, a language laboratory, library and audio-
visual workroom.
(b) Elementary Teacher Training - Construction of an 800-student
capacity elementary teacher training college in Hargeisa,
these facilities to include student hostels, staff housing
and communal services.



(c) Secondar,r Schools - Provision of additional buildings,
furniture and equipment for pre-vocational, agricultural,
handcrafts and domestic science training in selected 10
existing general secondary schools and the rebuilding of
the Fishery and iMarine Institute where student hostels
and a staff house will be ikmluded.
(d) Nomad Training - Construction of 10 Nomad Training
Centers, these facilities to include student hostels,
staff housing and the required comiunal services.
(e) Technical Assistance - (i) Techrical assistance to provide
for the staffing of the management of the Project through
the Project and School Design Units; and (ii) Technical
assistance to provide! for the staffing of the Fishery and
Marine Institute.
34.       The Academy of Somali Studies.   The primary responsibilities of the
Academy, which was established in 1973, are:   (a) development of the Somali
language using Latin script on a scientific basis; (b) production of literature
for mass readership with emphasis on functional literacy; (c) publication of
educational materials for study at academic institutions and general readership;
and (d) applied research in language, culture and science. At present, the
Academy operates from make-shift quarters in an old dwelling on the outskirts
of Mogadiscio.
35.       Elementary Teacher Training College. To alleviate the existing
shortage and oualitative shortcommings of elementary school teachers and to
meet a planned 10 percent per annum increase of enrolments into grade one of
elementary schools, the new college will enrol 800 students in 2-year courses.
Particular emphasis will be given to practical subjects, such as agriculture
and home economics. The National Teacher Education Center which is being
expanded under the first IDA Education Project and is receiving UNDP/UNESCO
technical assistance will supply teachers for this College.
36.       Secondary Schools.  The Project will continue the efforts of the
first education project to shift the emphasis of general secondary schools
from academic to scientific and practical subjects. The student-places in
the 10 schools assisted by the Project will be increased from 2,700 to about
3,800. As the ongoing project is providing similar assistance to 11 other
general secondary schools, the two IDA projects in Somalia will together
improve 21 out of 26 existing general secondary schools. An adequate supply
of suitably trained teachers will be available from the National Teacher
Education Center.
37.       Output from the 26 general secondary schools is not likely to
exceed the demand for graduates in the foreseeable future.   During the 1972-83
school years, about 22,000 students will graduate from the country's secondary
schools compared with an estimated need of about 29,000 for employment in the
modern sector. Further expansion of the schools to meet the estimated shortfall
of 7,000 graduate should prudently be deferred until the late 1970's when the rate
of assimilation of graduates into jobs becomes more certain. An informal under-
standing was reached with the Government that it would exchange views with the
Assocciation on the long-term targets of the country's education development.



- 9 -
38.       The Fishery and Marine Institute.  The country's only fishery train-
ing institute will offer 4-year courses for 300 students in grades 9-12. Somalia
is endowed with a 3000 kmo coastline with good potential for fishery development.
The Government believes that emphasis on fishery development is lovig overdue and
the draft 5-year development plan places a strong emphasis on its development
including the proposed rehabilitation and expansion of the Fishery and Marine
Institute. Somalia is also receiving technical assistance from the UNDP and the
USSR in developing other aspects of the fishing industry. The fishing industry
is expected to expand and to provide ample opportunities for employment of the
Institute's graduates.
39.       Ten Nomad Training Centers. On an experimental basis,, the Project
will start the important task of providing educational and training facilities
for nomads. Of the proposed ten Centers, five will be sited in purely nomadic
areas and five in partially settled areas. Each center will enrol 160 boarding
students. Children (age 7-16) will be given a 4-year course, and in each center
an estimated 200 adults per annum will also attend short courses in practical
subjects, such as hygiene, agricuilture and animal husbandry. The proposed
centers with combined capacity of 1600 children and 2000 adults per annum will
be the country's only facilities for education and training of nomads.
4o.       Technical Assistance. The Project will provide 16 man-years of
technical assistance for the Fishery and Marine Institute and for the Project
and zchools Construction Units to implement the Project.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
41.       The total cost is estimated at the equivalent of $10.1 million
including taxes and $9.3 million excluding taxes. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at $6.1 -million, or 60 percent of the total project
cost and 66 percent of the net o, tax cost. The proposed $8 million credit
will cover abouu 86 percent of the net of tax cost. The recurrent expendi-
tures generated by the Project -w-ill be about So. Sh. 9 million (about $1.5
million) per annum, 10 perment of the estimated total recurrent expenditures
on education for 1978,  Thiis proportion is not excessive, as the Project will
involve a large part of the country's education system.
Implementation
42.       The Project will be executed over a period of six years.  The
Project Unit for the ongoing IlI project under the Mi'Lnistry of Education
will have overall responsibility for Project execution and the Schools
Construction Unit, also established under the ongoing Project, will contine
to be responsible for design and supervision of construction.  The Project
and Schools Construction Units are functioning efficiently and will carry
out the proposed Project with some additional specialist staff such as  a
quantity surveyor, a procurement adviser and an accountant.



Proc-urement
43.       Contracts for civil works, furnitulre and instructional equipment
will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Because
of their small size (an estimated average of' under $100,000) and scattered
locations, contracts for civil works for the ten general secondary schools
amounting to about $1 million will be awarded following competitive bidding
after advertising only in Somalia. Procurement of furniture costing less
than $30,000 up to an aggregate total of $100,000 will be on the basis of
local -ompetitive bidding in accordance with contracting procedures accept-
able to the Association. Domestic civil works contractors will be allowed
a preferential margin of 7-1/2 percent over the bid prices of' competing
foreign firms. Domestic manufacturers of furniture will be allowed a
15 percent preference margin or the existing rate of import duties, which-
ever is lower, over the c.i.f. bid prices of competing foreign firms.
Disbursement
t,4.      Disbursement will be against (a) 100 percent of foreign expendi-
tures for imported equipment and furniture; (b) 95 percent of ex-factory
cost for locally manufactured furniture; (c) 80 percent of local transportation
costs for furniture and equipment; (d) 74 percent of expenditures for civil
works; and (e) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of local
expenditures for technical assistance and project administration. Disburse-
ment is expected to be completed by June 30, 1980.
Benefits and Risks
h5.       The proposed project is designed to assist in the achievement of
educational objectives consistent with the country's socio-economic needs,
namely: (?) to help develop the written national language as a means of
reducing illiteracy and increasing the efficiency of the education system;
(b) to expand the enrolment of the formal school system to meet future man-
power requirements; (c) to further reorient instruction towards practical
purposes; and (d) to provide education and training programs to assist rural
development, particularly to educate nomads in practical subjects such as
animal husbandry. Among other things, the first and proposed second projects
together will cover all planned expansion of elementary teacher training and
the improvement of general secondary schools with 85 percent of the country's
total enrolment and of technical schools with 60 percent of the total enrol-
ment, as well as mobile agricultural training and nomad education. The
benefits of the Academy of Somali Studies and Nomad Training Centers are
far-reaching. Development of the national script will facilitate written
cormmunication in all social and economic activities of the Somali people
as well as of private and public agencies, help reduce illiteracy by short-
ening the period needed to achieve satisfactory educational standards and
help unify the Somali people.   The Nomad Training Centers will contribute
to the development of the country's most imp,ortant productive sectors --
livestock and agriculture -- and help mobilize scattered nomads for nation
building.

46.       This is the Bank Group's first education project designed to
support develDpment of a national language and a training scheme for nomads
and, as with all new ventures, there is some risk that all the objec cives may
not be achieved. We intend to keep a close watch on these activities with a
view to reducing the risks to a mirimum. Considering the benefits which will
result if these efforts are successful, we believe the risks are well worth
taking. Regarding the Academy of Somali Stulies, the work program for the
first five years has been discussed in detail with the Government and agree-
ments made on a continuing dialogue on this rqatter and the submission of the
Academy's annual reports to the Association (Section 3.04 of the draft Credit
Agreement). With respect to the Nomad Training Center, an interministerial
Nomad Education Board will be established. It was agreed that this Board
would regularly monitor and evaluate the Centers' activities and effectivenss,
and maintain close liaison with the Association (Section 3.05 of the draft
Credit Agreement). The success of the Noma6 Training Centers will depend
on their location and on careful selection o' students, teachers and courses.
Special care will be needed in selecting the Centers' locations in harmony
with other rural development activities. For example, it was informally
agreed with the Government that four centers would be located in the project
area of the ID[-financed Trans-J.uba Livestock Development Project. Employment
aspirations of the students would be carefully monitored before their enrolment
so that a majority of graduates of the four-year courses would continue their
rural activities without nigrating to urban areas. Teachers would be selected
with a view to their familiarity with a nomadic environment and credibility
with nomads, and receive one year training at a Farmer Trainin;g Center. The
centers would adopt the courses best suited to nomads' needs, such as in
animal husbandry and agrcnomy. It was agreed that details of the teacher
training courses as well as centers' courses would be sent to the Association
for its comnents (Section 3.03 of the draft Credit Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNENT AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali Democratic
Republic and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
under Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit
are being distributed to the Ececutive Directors separately. These draft
agreements conform substantially to the Association's pattern for education
projects.
48 .       I am satistied that the proposed credit will conply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

B.  Projects in Execution-
123-SO: Highway (Afgoi-Daidoa) - The construction of the Afgoi-Baidoa road was
substantially completed in March 1971. The contractor has submitted
four major claims amounting to US$2.40 million for arbitration. The
UNDP financed Highway Management Consultants services have been
extended for an additional year to August 15, 1974.
247-SO: Education - Implementation was slow to get started and fell behind
schedule. However, it has improved since December 1972 and i-f present
momentum continues most of the lost time is likely to be regained.
295-SO:  Highway (Hargeisa-Berbera) - The Hargeisa-Derbera road construction is
progressing satisfactorily.   Feasibility and detailed engineering studies
for tie Hargeisa-Boramna road have started.
359-SO:  Port (Mogadiscio) - The civil works which started in the ariiddle of last
year is behind schedule by about six months. The delay could be reco-
vered because the workt is still in an early stage.  Steps are being tai-en
to select management, accounting and port operations consultants.
462-30: Livestock (Trans-Juba) - The Credit was signed in Februiary and is not
yet effective.
