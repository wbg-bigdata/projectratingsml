FOREWORD
This Report is a restricted document prepared for the
Government of Somalia, under the Cooperative Agreement between
Unesco and the World Bank.
At the invitation of the Government, a Mission composed of
Messrs. L. Insuasty (General Educator and Mission Coordinator),
G. Ziogas (Architect), both Unesco staff members, and R. Sack,
(Consultant/General Educator), visited the country between 3-18
February 1982.
The assignment of the Mission was to review in detail the
history of the formulation and implementation of the project in
order to identify positive achievements and shortcomings of
pre-appraisal activities; to describe and explain differences
between Appraisal forecasts and credit conditions with actual
results concerning the implications of hard and software
components and to assess the appropriateness of appraisal and
credit conditions as well as assumptions about the Borrower's
implementation capacity.
Before working in the country, the Mission made a compre-
hensive study of the relevant project files held by the World
Bank Regional Mission in East Africa. These provided an
essential background for the Mission's field work.
To carry out its mandate, mission members held meetings
with representatives of several Government agencies, namely from
the Ministries of Education, Higher Education, Labour, Fisheries,
Marine Transport, Local Government, and others (see Annex 1).
In addition, mission members visited a representative sample of
project schools. Annex 10 of this Report presents a summary of
the observations made during these visits.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOMALIA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 511-SO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second
Education Project in Somalia. The related Credit 511-SO was approved
in August 1974 in the amount of US$8.0 million. The last disbursement
under this Credit was made on January 29, 1982 resulting in a total
disbursement of US$7,915,729.18. The remaining balance of US$84,270.82
was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by Unesco at the request of and with the
assistance from the Government of Somalia. On the basis of its review,
EAPED agrees with the principal conclusions of the PCR.
The PCR was prepared after a visit to Somalia by the Unesco
team in February 1982. The report was sent to the Borrower which had
no comments.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Somalia,
particularly the Project Implementation Unit, is gratefully acknowledged.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOMALIA SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 511-SO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Credit Agreement for the Second Somalia Education Project (Cr. 511-SO)
signed on September 19, 1974 provided for a Credit of US$8.0 million.
The Project is part of the Government's education program contained in its
Five-Year Development Plan (1974-78) and would assist Somalia's strategy
by :
(a) establishing an elementary teacher training college;
(b) developing an Academy of Somali Studies in support of the Government's
policy to promote basic education and reduce illiteracy;
(c) improving secondary education by the addition of facilities to schools
to enable agriculture, fisheries, science and commerce to be taught;
and
(d) providing rural training facilities for nomads including student hos-
tels, staff housing and communal services.
The Project was closed March 31, 1981 - nine months beyond the original
June 30, 1980 Closing Date.
Actual outcomes derived from assessments of educational objectives attained
and of results arrived at in physical implementation as compared to project
targets set out in the appraisal report, cannot be termed a reasonable
success. The following table gives summarized attainments with
cross-references to pertinent paragraphs in the Completion Report:

CHAPTER I
THE PROJECT AND ITS EVOLUTION
BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01    Somalia has an area of 637O000 Km . About 13 per cent of the land is
potentially cultivable and 45 per cent suitable for grazing. However, only a small
proportion of the cultivable land is used and grazing resources are degrading.
Rainfall is low and irregular so the risk of drought is ever present.  While land
and livestock are Somalia's main assets, fishing along the longest coastline of any
mainland African country holds real promise.  Th  1978 estimated GNP per capita is
US$ 185 based on a GNP of So.Sh. 7,500 millions.edr
1.02    The population is estimated at about 4.2 million in 1982 (estimated growth
rate 2.3 per cent - 2.7 per cent). Of this total, nomads account for about 60 per
cent and the remainder is equally divided between sedentary agriculture and non-
agriculture activities. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 43 years. No data
are available on skilled manpower drain to oil-exporting countries. The refugee
population is estimated at over one million.
1.03    At the time of the Appraisal of Credit 511-90, Somalia had prepared the
1974-78 Five-Year Development Plan. "The strategy emphasizes maximum priority to
the sectors of agriculture, livestock, forestry and fi shgries since these primary
producing sectors are the key to economic development*.5  Regarding industry,
"the building materials i2 ustry will receive immediate attention because of its
strategic importance...7 .-   As far as social services are concerned, the plan
strategy is to "bring education and health services on a widening scale to the
majority of the population, especially people in the pastoral-nomadic domain".
1.04    The Appraisal mission updated and projected to 1983 the manpower require-
ments for the modern sector obtained in the 1971 manpower survey. The projections
are summarized below:

1.05    In order to meet these needs, the outputs from the educational system were
estimated aJ foUows:

1.06    The particular conditions of Somalia necessitate humai  resources and rural
development efforts different from those in other developing countries. Nomadim
is a national rather than a regional characteristic, and while the nomads are
responsible for the major part of production and export - the livestock sector -
provision of social and economic services to improve their productivity and living
standards is made difficult by their migratory patterns. It wax suggested that the
provision of grazing reserves, water supply, marketing, etc. needed to be comple-
mented by the development of schemes to improve the skills and appropriately
orientate the attitudes of the nomadic population.
1.07    During the 1970a Somalia experienced a number of external events which had
a major impact on the performance of the administration and the economy of the
country. The first was the drought of 1973/75 which caused great human suffering
and loss of livestock with the consequent migration of people to towns. With the
financial externAl assistance the Government was able to carry out a rehabilitation
progrsame including the establishment of nomadic settlements for agriculture and
fisheries.
1.08    The conflict with Ethiopia in 1977 and 1978 also strained both the admini-
stration and the economy of the country. First it led to a large influx of refugees
estimated at over one million, mainly women and children. Secondly, it increased
the defense expenditure at the expense of other sectors of the economy.
1.09    The changes of Somalia's foreign policy in 1977 contributed to the disruption
of planning management and administration as well as a negative impact on the economy
of the country due to the paralysis of some productive units and the disruption of
investment programmes.
1/ Participation rates of 100 per cent for post-secondary level, 90 per cent for
secondary level and 80 per cent for intermediate level have been used. (Partici-
pa ion rate: School-leavers joining the labour force as a proportion of the
total school system output). Annual outputs from the education system tell
considerably short of these estimated needs. At the post-secondary level the
annual supply was about 200, including graduates returning from studies abroad;
at the secondary and intermediate levels, the education system produced some
1,500 and 5,000 graduates p.a., respectively. These figures pointed to the need
for expansion at all levels.



Education and Training Setting
1.10    In 1974, when the Credit 511-SO was appraised, the education and training
system consisted of:
(i) eight-years of primary education:
four-years of elementary education and
four-years of intermediate education;
(ii) four-years of secondary education;
(iii)  a two-year post-primary teacher training course;
(iv) post-secondary education of variable duration; and
(v) a scheme of out-of-school education and training,
including literacy classes, farmer training centres,
women's education centres, community development centres
and summer youth camps.
1.11    The Appraisal mission stated that in spite of the Government's efforts,
only 16.4 per cent of the eligible age-group found places in Grades I-IV, 9.3 per
cent in Grades V-VIII and less than 4 per cent in Grades IX-XII. There existed wide
inequalities of educational opportunities, i.e. 65 per cent of secondary school
enrolments were concentrated around Mogadiscio and 18 per cent around Hargeysa.
Also, female participation was only 16 per cent in secondary schools.
1.12    Qualitative shortcomings were as acute as these quantitative weaknesses:
(a)  textbooks, teachers' guides and vocabularies in the official
language were lacking;
(b)  over 60 per cent of primary school teachers and a large proportion
of the secondary school teachers were unqualified by Government's
own standards;
(c)  the introduction of new curricula with vocational subjects was
impeded by the inadequacies of the available physical facilities;
(d)  moreover, most school buildings were below desirable standards.
Maintenance was lacking, furniture and especially equipment were
inappropriate.
Development Strategy
1.13    The objectives of the Education and Training Five-Year Development Plan
(1974-78) that aimed at solving the above-mentioned problems and needs are
summarized below:
(i) continued emphasis in the use of Somali language in all
forms and special effort to bring literacy to 90 per cent
of the adults;
(ii) expansion and quality improvement of primary education;
(iii)  expansion of technical secondary education and of vocational
and occupational training;
(iv) development of the National University and, in the interim,
continuation of a programme for foreign fellowships and
scholarships; and



- 4 -
(v) development of education and training schemes for the
nomadic population, mainly by improving the Koranic
school and by establishing special training centres
for nomads and their children.
1.14   Within recent years, frequent structura:l changes have ten made in the system.
For example, a decision to reduce the primary cycle from eight- to six years led to
the phasing-out of Grades VII and VIII with the last class of the latter graduating
at the end of the 1976/77 school year. However, at the end of May 1977, a decision
to reinstate the eight-year cycle was made. Further, the primary teacher training
jprogramme was reduced in 1974/75 from a two- to one-year post-primary in order to
rapidly meet the demand for primary school teachers due to the introduction of
compulsory primary education in 1975/76. However, it too has reverted back to the
original two-year programme since 1978/79. Similarly, due to the demand for
secondary school teachers, the teacher training programme at the Faculty of Education
of the Somali National University was reduced progressively from four to three
years and from three to two years and is now planning to return to a three-year
programme. Basically, the structure at present consists of eight years of primary,
four years of secondary and four years of university, with various exceptions.
L.15    Recurrent expenditure for education (see Annex 2) under the Ministry of
Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education (W)CIE) (as a
proportion of the Central Government expenditure) has declined in recent years,
as summarized below:

Project Generation
1.16   'lhis project is derived from the Five-Year Development Plan (1974-78) for
education prepared on the basis of the Short-Term Developnmt Programme (1971-73)
and incorporates elements of the Unesco Report: "Pre-requisites for Mass Education".
In part, it is an extension of the first project (assisted under Credit 247-S
and signed in 1971) in regard to teacher training, pre-vocational secondary education
and specialized secondary education. This project has been followed by two additional
ones. The third project deals with curriculum development, teaching materials produe-
tion, basic education and skill training for youth and adults and preparation
of specialized manpower for animal husbandry, forestry and paramedical services.
The fourth project includes primary and secondary teacher training, vocational
training and general secondary schools.
1.17    Following-up on a Unesco Project Identification mission which visited Somalia
in January 1973, the Bank sent in September 1973 a Reconnaissance mission to outline
the content of a possible Second Education Project. On this occasion the mission
discussed with the Somali Government the projects described in the development plan
and analyzed the complementary aspects of assistance ty other agencies as well as
self-help projects. It was agreed that the following components would be considered
for project preparation and appraisal:
/ The former eight-year system was divided into the elementary (Grades I-IV)
and intermediate (Grades V-VIII) cycles.



(i)  construction and equipment of the Academy of Somali Studies (ASS)
in the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education;
(ii)  construction and  quipment of a combined Education Development
Centre and Primary Teacher College;
(iii)  construction and equipment of ten nomadic training centres
to provide basic education and special adult training
programmes on a pilot basis to nomadic population;
(iv)  replacement, expansion and improvement of a fisheries
institute;
(v) developing diversified occupational training programue at
skilled manpower level and such facilities and equipment as
may be required; and
(vi)  extension of selected existing secondary schools by the
addition of libraries, laboratories and workshops.
However, there were differences between this project and the proposals of the
Unesco Project Identification mission which included:
(a) buildings, furniture, materials and equipment for:
(i)  a Language and Cultural Institute;
(ii)  two primary teacher training institutes of 800 places
including 400 for boarders;
(iii) a higher-level technician training institute for 80 students;
(iv)  the addition of 80 places to the training school for animal
health assistants;
(v)  the addition of 20 places to the (Aburein) Farmer Training Centre;
(vi)  the addition of a forestry and wildlife section for 40 trainees
to the agricultural secondary school; and
(vii) an educational materials printing agency.
(b) incentive financing for self-help building of primary classrooms;
(c) pre-investment studies on:
(i) an experimental education project for the nomadic population; and
(ii) a proJect to improve and reform the Maritime and Fishery Institute.
(e) technical assistance.
Some of the above-proposed components were not included in the Second Project,
as can be seen below, but included in the Third and Fourth Projects.
1.18    The Project was simultaneously prepared and appraised by a Bank mission in
November-December 1973. The retained components were negotiated without further
changes. The Project was signed on 19 September 1974 and became effective on
19 December 1974. No condition of effectiveness was established.



1.19    It is the opinion of the Completion mission that the unusual practice of
project formulation through joint Preparation and Appraisal activities did not
allow sufficient time for the national team to conceptualize the unfamiliar project
components and elaborate a detailed document including the physical plant and
educational aspects. It is most likely that some of the development, implementation
and operation problems of the project (see Chapter II) could have been minimized
if a more thorough preparation had been done.
ProJect Description
1.20    As expressed in the Appraisal report, the proposed project would assist
Somalia's strategy by:
(a) establishing an elementary teacher training college and developing
an Academy of Somali Studies in support of the Government's policy
to promote basic education and reduce illiteracy;
(b) improving secondary education by the addition of facilities to schools
to enable agriculture, fisheries, science and commerce to be taught; and
(c) providing rural training and other facilities for nomads.
1.21    The Project consisted of two parts:
Part A : Educational and Training Facilities, Furniture and Equipment
Construction of new facilities for extensions to, and/or provision of
equipment for, training institutions, and the carrying out of education and
training programmes, as follows:
1. Academy of Somali Studies (ASS)
The expansion and rebuilding of the Academy of Somali Studies.
These facilities were to include staff offices, a language
laboratory, a library and an audio-visual workroom.
2. Elementary Teacher Training College (ETTC)
Construction of, equipment and furniture for, an 800-student
capacity elementary teacher college. These facilities were
to include student hostels, staff housing and communal services.
3. Secondary Education
Provision of additional buildings, furniture and equipment
for about 1,200 student places in pre-vocational, agricultural,
handicraft and domestic science training in ten selected general
secondary schools and the rebuilding of the Fishery and Marine
Institute (288 student places, 80 for boarders) where student hostels
and staff houses would be included.
4. Nomadic Training Centres (NTC)
Construction of, equipment and furniture for, ten Nomadic Training
Centres of 160 places each (all boarders). These facilities were
to include student hostels, staff housing and the required communal
services.



- 7-
Part B : Technical Assistance
(a) Nine man/years for the Fisheries and Marine Institute, equivalent to
three specialists for about three years each in the following fields:
educational planning, organization and management, navigation, seamanship
and applied technology to sea-going fisheriestand marine vessels, as well
as marine engineering, marine mechanics and related matters; and
(b) seven man/years of specialists' services for the project implementation
and construction units as follows: an architect or a building designer/
constructor for 2i years, a quantity surveyor for two years; and a
procurement advisor for 2i years.
1.22    The project schools would have a total of about 6,700 student places, of
which 3,800 would be additional ones. These figures did not include attendance at
short courses by adults in the Nomadic Training Centres which was estimated at
some 2,000 per annum.
1.23    Financial assistance for the development and implementation of the pedago-
gical and didactic aspects and for institutional building was never considered in
the formulation of the project except for some special covenants and conditions
established (see Annex 3) in the Agreement.
1.24    The span of the Project was six years and as can be seen from the implemen-
tation and disbursement chart (Annex 4), all construction and procurement work was
concentrated in the middle three years. The first year was devoted to site
acquisition and the fifth and sixth years to deal with the guarantee period and
some technical assistance.






CHAP?ER II
PROJECT DEVELOM4ENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION
A.   OVERVIEW
Project closing date and cost overrun:
2.01    The Project completion date (and credit closing) foreseen in the Agreement was
30 June 1980. At the request of the Government of Somalia this date was extended to
31 March 1981. The cost overrun of the Project was US$ 1,797,000, i.e. 17.8 per cent
over the Appraisal estimate (see paras. 3.27-3.35 and Annexes 18 and 19 for estimate
of actual cost).
Implementation schedule
2.02    The physical implementation of the project was 49 months behind schedule
(certain items were completed after the closing date). (For details see Annex 4).
Causes for deviations
2.03    The main cause for the cost overrun was the local and international increase
in the cost of commodities after 1973 which was the year on which Appraisal cost
estimates were based. This was compounded by delays in the implementation of the
project. Implementation was initially delayed by administrative difficulties,
e.g. delays on decisions concerning locations and programmes of certain items plus
an understaffed Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with a heavy workload for a
previous Credit. Implementation was further delayed at the construction phase
because of shortages of building materials and the required compliance with
established precedures for the acquisition of these materials by the contractors.
Shortage of petrol, transportation problems plus other difficulties the country was
experiencing during the years of implementation were important factors in the
delays.
Fulfilment of conditions and covenants
2.04    The Credit Agreement included eleven conditions and covenants (see Annex 3).
In this context, the mission found the following:
(a) no evidence of good maintenance of the buildings, furniture
and equipment;
(b) although the Project Unit did keep records of expenditures and
disbursements, they need to be improved in order to easily
differentiate accounting records from cost control records;
(c) it is the view of the mission that the condition that makes
reference to the administration, operation and evaluation of
the Nomadic Training Centres was not totally fulfilled; and
(d) no annual reports of the Academy of Somali Studies have been
submitted yet.
Attainment of Project Objectives

B.   PROJECT CCMPO0NTS
ELEMETARY TEACBER TRAINING COL1=GE (ETTC)
General
2.06    The original project called for the construction and equipment of a teacher
training college in Hargeysa that would have 800 places (400 boarders) in support
of a planned increase of enrolments into Grade 1 of elementary schools of 10 per cent
per year. Students would be in a two-year course and the resulting output would meet
teacher needs at this level until about 1985. In addition, teachers were to be
trained in practical work such as simple agriculture, handicrafts and home economics,
as well as the broader aspects concerned with civic leadership and the wider role
teachers are being called upon to fill as community leaders in support of Government
policies to foster community development by using all schools as centres for these
activities.
Development and Implementation of the Educational Aspects
2.07    This component of the project has been substantially transformed and has
become a 3,000-place college in Mogadiscio (Halane) that provides full boarding
facilities and is run jointly by the Ministry of Education (pedagogical aspects)
and the Army (organization and administration).
2.o8    With the advent of the policy of universal primary education in 1975 the
need for primary school teachers became overwhelming and necessitated the rapid
training of large numbers of teachers (see Annex 5). For this reason the project
was altered to permit the creation of a much larger institution in or near the
capital where teaching and other facilities would be more available.
2.09    The college began operating in 1975 with 1,000 students enrolled in a one-
year crash programme. This programme lasted until 1978 when the project's construction
was completed by the Army and the programme of studies was lengthened to two years.
At present, there are about 3,000 students enrolled in the college with about 950
in the second year (see Annex 6).
Development and Implementation of Physical Facilities
2.10    As far as the physical facilities are. concerned, this component has had two
major modifications which were the result of the changes described above. For one,
the location was changed from Hargeysa to Halane, near Mogadiscio. Secondly, its
capacity was increased from 800 student places with 400 boarders to 3,000 student
places with 896 boarders. A new schedule of accommodation and costing was prepared
in February 1976, taking into account the additional requirements.
2.11    Location and Sites:  the site of the E=TC is in Halane at a distance of 6 kms
from the centre of Mogadiscio and covers an area of 6.10 ha. It is adjacent to a
military camp, whose facilities (kitchen, additional dormitories) are used by the
students of the ETIC. The area per student is adequate (20 sq.m.).



- 12 -
2.12    Design:
(a)  the plans of the ETIC campus differ from the approved schedule of accommo-
dation (see paragraph 2.10). They provlde for: 60 classrooms instead of 40;
no seminar rooms (four regular classrooms are named 'seminar rooms' on the
plans); one social studies room instead of seven; three science rooms
instead of four; no lecture demonstration rooms; one music room instead
of three; three teaching workshop rooms instead of seven; and one crafts'
room instead of two. The multi-purpose hall, although appearing on the
plAns was not constructed. The academic and communal areas are grouped in 21
one-storey blocks, laid out avmmetrically around two axes intersecting at
a right angle. Physics and biology labs are grouped together in one block
with chemistry and social studies rooms forming another block at the
opposite side of the campus. Each block consists of a row of rooms (four
to five for the classrooms) opening on to a covered walkway orientated
north or south according to the say   etrical position of the block in
relationship to the central axis. The plans provide for one sanitary
block of 10 W.Cs (no washbasins) for the whole academic area;
(b) the boarding area isseparated from the academic one by a wall and consists
of two identical blocks laid out symmetrically around a central axis.
Each block has two rows of 2B dormitory rooms on either aide of a central
corridor which is 2 metres wide and 126 metres long, with one window at
each far end. The row of rooms is broken in the middle by a central hall
and at two intervals by a corridor leading to the ablutions. The dormitory
rooms of 26.6 sq.m. each have one window and no cross-ventilation. The
central corridor has very little natural light and ventilation;
(c) the actual total gross academic area corresponds to 2.60 sq.m. per student
(design capacity) compared to 4.5 sq.m. of the Appraisal estimates and to
4.8 per boarding place compared to the 7.5 sq.m. per student of the
Appraisal estimates. The actual figures based on the present enrolment
(3,325) are 2.3 sq.m. per student of gross academic area and 3.23 per
student in the boarding facilities (each dormitory room designed for eight
actually has twelve beds, i.e. six double-decked);
(d) at present, the teacherst common room building is used for administration
and storage. The teaching practice rooms are used as teachers' common
rooms, one classroom is used as a storeroom and another as an office.
The science preparation rooms are used as section principals' offices.
The music and arts rooms are used as storerooms. The lecture and social
studies room is used for other purposes.
(e) food is prepared through facilities on the adjacent campus and there are
no dining arrangements available.
2.13    Construction:
(a) the structure of the roofs suffers both from inadequate design (wooden trusses
designed for long timber, spaced every two metres with no wind-bracing,
covered with corrugated asbestos sheets, with a very small slope), low
quality materials (short timber, nailed members) and poor workmanship.
This combined with parapet walls, gutters and spouts, obstructing the free-
flow of the rainwaters resulted in leaks in practically all ceilings. In at
least three to four classrooms the roof trusses have collapsed and are
supported by wooden poles or steel pipes. In 50 per cent of the rooms,
including the biology and chemistry labs, the ceilings have been destroyed
by rainwater and have a dangerous sag of more than 20 cm. in the centre of the
span. The dormitory roofs present similar problems where the evacuation of
rainwaters is done through inadequate and concealed gutters and down-spouts;



- 13 -
(b) floor-finishing (cement screed) has not resisted well and is partially
destroyed in many rooms;
(c) artificial lighting is not adequately planned and electrical installations
suffer from bad quality material and poor workmanship. Many lighting
fixtures, switches and outlets are missing or disconnected;
(d) sanitary and plumbing installations suffer from poor workmanship
and maintenance;
(e) metallic parts of the buildings such as doors/windows, hardware,
electrical fittings, etc. are exposed to the sea air and are rusted;
(f) the campus is connected to the city's electricity networks and water
suplly. Water is provided only at night.
2.14    Furniture (see Annex 17):  this has been provided as part of the project
but is sufficient neither for the academic areas nor for the dormitories (e.g. students
are sleeping on the floor);
2.15    Equipment:  was supplied for the science laboratories.  Equipment in the
chemistry and biology labs is not properly set-up and maintained, and some is not yet
unpacked. Equipment such as twelve biology driers and two large ovens in the biology
and chemistry labs are not connected to electricity and have never been used. All
equipment and materials are in the laboratories, as the preparation rooms are used as
offices.
2.16    Capital Costs:
(a) at the time of the preparation of the new schedule of accommodation
(February 1976), the cost of the civil works was estimated at
So.Sh. 11,250,000;
(b) the works were contracted to the Somali Army Corps of Engineers.
The project financed part of the total cost equal to So.Sh. 6 million
(approximately the Appraisal cost estimate) including contingencies of
the Hargeysa TTC). The remaining cost was financed by the Government;
(c) the cost of furniture and equipment remained the same as estimated
in Appraisal and, therefore, the cost per student place was reduced
considerably from US$ 195 to US$ 51 for furniture and from US$ 195
to US$ 51 for equipment.
2.17    Professional Services:  the design study of the ETT' was prepared by the PIU
which had no further involvement with the construction (supervision).
2.18    Implementation Schedule:  the construction of the ETTC was considered as
urgent. With the AssociationTs approval, the Ministry of Education contracted the
civil works to the Army without tendering. Works started early February 1976 and
were completed in four months, some six months ahead of Appraisal schedule.
Operation of the Project Component
2.19
(a) At present the College has 3,325 students all of whom are boarders. There are
60 classes, 4C of which are first-year and 20 second-year. Also, there are
125 teachers. This makes for a student/teacher ratio of 27:1 and an average
of 55.4 students per class;



- 14 -
(b)  the course of study is for two-years (post-primary) of eight months
a year including one month of practice teaching in the second-year.
They have 35 hours of classes per week, of which only three periods
are devoted to pedagogy and education aspects;
(c)  the classes are largely overcrowded and for this reason the science
laboratories are not used. This overcrowding plus the difficult
conditions in which the students live and study may account for a
high wastage rate (see Annex 6) that indicates that only half of
the first-year students go on to the second-year. In this context
we were informed that there were only about 50 official repeaters
at the end of a year;
(d)  upon graduation, the students go to the Primary Department of the
Ministry of Education where they are assigned to teaching positions
usually in their home regions;
(e)  from a pedagogical perspective, the College has the following problems:
-  lack of teachers:  13 teachers are needed this
year, mostly for scientific subjets;
- no visual aid equipment and no books available in library;
- overcrowdingr.
Conclusions
2.20    There are lessons that can be learned from the mission's observations of
the teacher training component:
(i) although there was an unexpected enrolment growth in primary
education, it seems that teacher demand was under-estimated.
Perhaps a more detailed study by the Preparation/Appraisal
mission would have arrived at the same conclusions of the
Unesco Project Identification Mission, i.e. suggest two,
instead of one, teacher training colleges for 800 students
each; and
(ii) it seems advisable that smaller but regionalized teacher
training colleges serve better the interests and demands
of the several regions of the country.
SECONDARY EDUCATION
General
2.21    Secondary Education comprises grades 9-12 in an educational system
(see Annex 7) whose primary schooling is eight years in 1980/81. There are two
types of secondary school: general academic and vocational-technical. The curri-
culum of the general academic school does not include any practical subjects.
2.22    Annex 8 gives an idea of the enrolment patterns of secondary schools and it
can be noticed that the intake more than doubled in the 1980/81 school year. It is
expected that the intake will be reduced and remain around 20,000 until, at least,
1984/85. The reason for this sharp and sudden increase can be attributed to the
policy of universal primary education first implemented in 1975, plus a very high



- 15 -
acceptance rate into secondary school. The Government policy, made in 1980, is to
accept about 80 per cent of the primary school leavers into secondary schools with
56 per cent going to vocational-technical schools and 24 per cent to general
secondary schools. Because of this increase a number of primary schools are presently
being used for secondary classes.
2.23    One consequence of this increase in secondary enrolments is a shortage of
qualified teachers, particularly in science. However, from 1978 to 1981 the teacher
training college has graduated 1,500 new science teachers (see Annex 9).
2.24    On another level, it should be noted that the entire general secondary school
curriculum is now in the Somali language with textbooks in Somali. Technical subjects,
however, are still in English due to lack of development in Somali terminology for
technical subjects.
Development and Implementation of the Educational Aspects
2.25    The secondary education component of this project was conceived as an
extension and a continuation of the first IDA education project which supported the
replacement of a literary curriculum by a broader programme placing substantial
emphasis on scientific and practical subjects. The project consisted of additions
to general secondary schools taking the form mainly of adequately equipped workshops
(woodwork, handicrafts, agriculture), science laboratories (one physics and one
biology/chemistry) and domestic science rooms. The schools of the second project
were to be mostly located in small towns and rural areas and thus improve equality
of educational opportunity and add thrust to integrated rural programmes. An adequate
supply of suitably trained teachers was to be available from the Technical Teacher
Training Institute which has been, and still is, receiving technical assistance
under a UNDP/Unesco project, and from the College of Education where general
secondary school teanhers are trained (and which is to receive assistance under the
Fturth IDA Education Project).
2.26    The mission found, however, that the educational policy of Somalia had changed
in 1977/78 to exclude practical subjects from the General Secondary School curriculum.
Therefore, the workshop component of the project had become non-operative with much
of the machinery and equipment transferred to vocational-technical secondary schools.
The reasons for the change in policy were as follows:
(i) pre-vocational training in general secondary education was
thought to give unsatisfactory training to the students and
was considered too expensive in terms of both capital invest-
ment and recurrent costs;
(ii) there was, and still is, an insufficient number of technical
secondary school teachers to staff effectively the 30 workshops
foreseen in the original project (three workshops per school);
in addition, the recent creation of numerous technical schools
required teaching staff who otherwise could have taught in the
secondary schools;
(iii) there is a very substantial 'brain drain' of technically
trained people toward Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States,
thereby depriving technical education of a large number
of teachers; this problem was brought up in a great variety
of contexts and weighs heavily on the Somalian economic,
social and educational situation.



- 16 -
(iv) the technical teachers in the general secondary schools would have
been under-utilized since there would have been two or three per
school teaching their subJect only one or two hours per week to each
class.
2.27    The syllabus for scientific subjects is in the Somali language and is the
one already developed in the context of the First IDA Education Project.
2.28    The College of Education at Lafole and the Technical Teacher Training
Institute have been training teachers for scientific and technical subjects. In
order to reinforce this component of the project, the funds allocated to the
construction of one NTC were transferred with approval of the Bank to support
t,echnical assistance to the Technical Teacher Training Institute,
Development and Implementation of Physical Facilities
2.29    This component originally included extension to ten general secondary schools
and one specialized secondary school (Fishery and Marine Institute, which will be
dealt with separately). Eight out of the ten extensionJs were made to the designated
schools and locations. Sheikh Secondary School was replaced by the Dusamarab
Secondary School because it was decided by the Ministry of Education that the former
would be converted into a technical institute (outside of Credit 511-So). Also,
Erigabo Secondary School replaced D%yaho Secondary School. The latter was
constructed by the Ministry of Works in collaboration with the Ministry of Education
rith funds for civil works outtide of Credit 511-90.
2.30    Locations and Sites: All items of this component-are extensions to existing
schools, which were operating in two major towns and eight smaler ones. Sites are
all centrally located in relation to their catchment areas. The areas of the sites
are adequate, ranging from a high of 2.8 ha. to a low of 0.53 ha. with a site area
per student ranging between 14 to 24 sq... per student (with the exception of one
siite which has 60 sq.m. per student) for planned capacity and from 10 to 20 sq..
per student for the present enrolment.
2 .31 DesiBn:
(a)  In general, the new accommodation added to the existing facilities coniist
of ciassrooms, science laboratories, workshops, lecture-demonstration rooms,
libraries and ablutions, mostly In one-storey buildings and in blocks
arranged according to the layout of the existing schools and the site avail-
able. Some modifications were also made to existing facilities. Standard
drawings based on previous designs were used for the science labs and the
workshops. The space standards are adequate, and the external layout and
functional relationship satisfactory. The interior layouts of the work-
shops and labs (furniture) are less functional with bulky fixed benches
not allowing for flexibility. All rooms have cross-ventilation, but some
have open-ventilation holes which let duLst and sand into labs, workshops
and preparation rooms with equipment requiring protection. There is suffi-
cient natural light, but artificial light is not of adequate quantity, not
arranged in relationship to internal layout (working benches) and, in the
case of workshops, not appropriate for work requirements (fluorescent lights
with rotating machines);
(b)  the structural design of the roofs has certain weaknesses such as the non-
existence of wind-bracing. The rather mild slope of the roof combined, in
many cases, with parapet walls, gutters and spouts which do not allow the
free-flow of the rainwater, has caused serious leaks destroying the hard-
board ceilings;



- 17 -
(c) the Naco-type windows proved to be very fragile for school use.
Their glass louvers break very easily and are practically impossible
to replace;
(d) for almost all items total gross areas are higher than those estimated
at Appraisal. The increase ranges from 3 to 24 per cent with exemptions
of around 50 per cent for the two items whose location was changed.
One of the causes for the increase of gross area is the increase in
the percentage of circulation areas (mainly external covered walkways).
This increase ranges from 20 to 165 per cent over the Appraisal
estimate.
2.32    Construction:  In general, the construction suffers from the quality of
building materials, the lack of skilled workmanship and the difficulties of super-
vision. This is particularly evident in the case of roofs and ceilings (see also
above), finishing of floors, electrical, sanitary and plumbing installations.
In many cases, the termite control was not effective, and timber parts of the
buildings have already been attacked, especially doors and fixed furniture. All
civil works were executed by local contracting firms, which pre-qualified following
international advertising.
2.33    Furniture (see Annex 17):  all schools have been supplied with movable
furniture, generally delivered on time.
2.34    Equipment:  equipment lists for this component were prepared on time, based
on the lists prepared for the First Education Loan and approved by the IDA.
The first batch of equipment for the project (which included the equipment for this
component) was announced in November 1975, contracts were signed in 1976, and the
material arrived at Mogadiscio around December 1977, where it was stored until the
completion of buildings.
2.35    Professional Services:  the secondary school extensions were designed and
supervised by the PIU. Supervision was carried out by the same architect (four items)
and later by the PIU engineer (five items). The item constructed by the Ministry of
Works was supervised by the same Ministry.
2.36    Implementation Schedule:  working drawings and tender documents were all
prepared by January 1977, some 18 months behind Appraisal schedule. The awarding
of the contracts was completed between June and August 1977. The installation of the
contractors was completed between July 1977 and January 1978 (21 to 27 months behind
Appraisal schedule). The civil works of this component are in total 55 months behind
Appraisal schedule as the last item was plnnned to be completed by mid-1977 and was
actually completed in February 1982. One construction was completed 12 months behind
Appraisal schedule; three were 18-20 months late; two were 27-32 months late;
one was 42 months late; and two 54-55 months late. The main causes for the delays
in implementation were:
(a) initial delays in the preparation of the working drawings,
specifications, tendering and award of contracts;
(b)  shortage of building materials combined with the remoteness
of many sites and the shortage of petrol; and
(c) overall difficulties that the country was facing during this period.

Capital Costs
2.37    The actual total cost of the civil works exceeded the Appraisal estimates
by 16 per cent (the actual total cost does not include the cost of one item which
was financed outside of Credit 511-SO). The actual total cost of furniture is
37 per cent over the Appraisal estimates and that of equipment is 6 per cent less.
2.38    The average actual cost per student place was US$ 2,062 compared with US$ 1,829
in the Appraisal estimate. The increase is to the order of 13 per cent which is justi-
fied considering the evolution of prices from 1973 to 1980.
Achievements, Shortcomings and Problems
2.,19    The conceptualization of the physical facilities of this component meets the
educational requirements of the time of Appraisal as far as the location, type of
accommodation and areas are concerned. However, the conceptualization of the project
did not fully take into account the local conditions concerning materials, shortage
of manpower and skills, transportation, difficulties of maintenance, etc. Therefore,
there were no specific measures ensuring physical facilities appropriate to particular
local conditions.
2.40    Inputs concerning the preparation of the working drawings and tender documents
were not adequate, both in terms of human resources (one architect) and of information
and documentation (lack of detailed architect's brief and no use of documentation about
similar experiences in other countries, particularly Africa.   Human resources were
minimal in the supervision of the construction. Counterpart funds started to flow in
FY 1976-77 and remained limited until 1977-78, the main bulk of expenditure being
aff'ected from FY 1978-79 to FY 1980-81.
2.41    Although conforming to the requirements of the Appraisal, the final output of
the physical faci:ities of this component now corresponds only partially to the present
needs. This is because of the provision of workshops which are no longer required due
to changes in the curriculum. The capacity of the schools included in this component
has been increased as planned, but the actual enrolment in most cases has been increased
even more than the planned capacity.
2.42    In terms of quality of construction, the new buildings suffer in many respects.
This is expected to create shortly problems of repairs and maintenance and thus put a
financial burden on the Government.
Operation of Project Facilities
2.43    After having visited six project schools (see Annex 10), the mission concluded
that the present facilities are vastly underused and generally in a poor state of repair.
Workshops (three per school) are generally not used for any instruction purpose. Science
laboratories are functioning although poorly and, in all cases observed, are without
water and/or electricity, and with some material as yet unpacked.
2.44    The schools have, at least, one teacher for each of the science subjects and
the students have Somali language textbooks. However, the teachers seemed unprepared
to use the laboratory equ_pment effec-tively, and this is understandable given the
conditions of the College of Education (Lafole) where they are trained.
2.45    The machinery and handtools have mostly been transferred to technical secondary
schools.  One of these schools was visited by the mission and it was observed that the
machinery was unused owing to lack of electricity and qualified teachers.



- 19 -
2.46    The problem of qualified teachers for technical subjects is a major one and
is being tackled by the Technical Teacher Training Institute in Mogadiscio which is
the object of a UNDP/Unesco assistance programme. The Institute is making considerable
efforts to train future teachers and, especially, to provide them with practical
experience. In the past three years this Institute has graduated 292 teachers.
2.47    After secondary school the students enter the national service for two
years where they often work as teachers at the primary or lower secondary level.
Many go to the university or directly into the labour market.
2.48    In spite of these problems, it must be mentioned that in many cases the only
schools with any equipped science laboratories are those benefitting from IDA assist-
ance.
2.49    If we attempt to compare the ten schools of the Second Education Project with
other schools on the Fourth Form Examination results we find the following:

This suggests that whereas in 1978/79, which was the first year of operation of the
science laboratories, the project schools had a much higher failure rate than the
others,  this relationship changed the following year. It is not possible at this
stage and with the information available to make any inference regarding these facts.
Conclusions
2.50    There are several lessons that can be learned from the mission's observation
of the secondary education component of this project;
(i)  the proper use and maintenance of laboratory equipment depends
upon the training and qualification of the science teachers.
In the case of Somalia, these teachers have been trained in a
mostly theoretical context and were unprepared to effectively
use and maintain the equipment furnished;
(ii)  a similar comment could be made for the technical teachers.
However, in the case of technical education, other factors
must be considered such as the external demand for technically
trained personnel, even if their training includes a pedagogical
element;



- 20 -
(iii)  when conceiving workshops and science laboratories that require
water and electricity (also gas), it would be advisable to
consider the probability of the continuous availability of
these elements.
NOMADIC TRAINING CENTRES
General
2.51    The Nomadic Training Centres (NT:) were defined as experimental institutions
of two types: the first, a group of five directed at nomads in the remote areas,
and the second concerned with partially settled areas. The purpose of an NTC
is to provide education and training to children, youths and adults. Youths were to
be given a four-year course oriented towards developing their capabilities in animal
husbandry, agriculture, literacy and numeracy. For adults, literacy and non-formal
programmes such as personal and public hygiene, agriculture and animal husbandry,
citizenship and community development were to be organized. Community services
in the nature of health clinics, veterinary, marketing and cooperative services were
also to be included.
2.52    The project was to assist in the construction of ten nomadic training centres.
Each centre consisted of four classrooms, one health clinic, one veterinary clinic,
one agriculture extension room, boarding facilities for 160 participants, offices,
storage rooms, staff housing and toilets. Each centre was to be provided with the
necessary furniture and audio-visual teaching equipment.
2.53    As a result of the drought which affected Somalia during 1973 and 1974, the
Government decided to establish settlement areas for nomads to work in agricultural
and fishery activities. For the agricultural settlements, three sites along the
Shabelle and Juba rivers were selic4ed: Sablale, Kurtunwarrey and DuJuma. The
estimated settled population was:-
Centre          Adults         Children        % Children        Total
Dujuma             22,720            24,713           52.1           47,433
Sablale            12,905            16,632           56.3           29,537
Kurtunwarrey       11,834            14,759           55.5           26,593
Total           47,459            56,104           54.2         103,563
2.54    It was also decided, with IDA approval, that three of the Nomadic Training
Centres would support the drought rehabilitation project. Accordingly, the Centres
would admit candidates at about age 14 for four-year programmes preparatory to further
training as extension workers and community leaders of various categories. These new
institutions would be called Community and Education Training Centres (CETCs) whose
description and implementation is presented in the following section, paragraph 2.92.
2.55    By the end of 1977 one of the Nomadic Training Centres was deleted from the
project on the basis that changes in population patterns made it no longer necessary.
Another reason was a pressing need to provide funds to cover a nine-month gap in a
uNDP/Unesco technical assistance programme (paragraph 2.158).

Development and Implenentation of the Education Aspects
2.56    For more than a decade! now, Somali officials have been working towards
the conceptualization of an educational programme to cater for nomads who represent
the majority of the Somali population. As far back as 1969, Government officials
discussed with the first Unesco Project Identifycation Mission the basic elements
for an integrated nomadic education programme.-   The second project, Credit 511-SO
in 1974 was, in fact, the opportunity to crystallize the idea.  Although theoretically
a school for nomads must be as mobile as the nomads themselves, in practice the
Government decided to provide, on an experimental basis, nomadic centres where members
of the nomadic family could attend long-term residential courses and then return home
to carry out their normal nomadic life. The outcome of this project component cannot
be assessed until a good number of centres have been in full operation for several
years and the evaluation is properly designed and controlled. Until then it cannot
be stated whether the Nomadic Training Centres are the best approach to teaching
nomads.
2.57    The original project dcid not include support for the research and development
process of this component which was totally new in Somalia, as well as elsewhere.
However, the Bank sent two one-man missions to Mogadiscio in May 1975 and June 1976
to help in course design, teacher training, site selection and other aspects of the
project. Additional help to this endeavour was also provided by UN missions in the
ecluntry, i.e. Unesco, FAO and IID.
2.58    The National Adult Education Centre (NABC), which is part of the Department
of Non-formal Education of the. Ministry of Education, was given major responsibility
for the implementation of the educational aspects of the Nonadic Centres. The Centre
worked under the Interministerial Committee for Nomadic Education organized with
representatives of the Ministries of Education, Livestock, Local Government and Rural
Development, Agriculture, Health, Range Management and others.
2.59    In early 1978, the decision was made to change the four-year programme origi-
nally envisaged as follows:
(a) duration of programmes for all training groups would not exceed
foaur months;
(b)  training would be recurrent, therefore, some participants would
return to the Centres for further training; and
(c) selection would be macde of the best students from each group who
would receive advancecd courses of about nine months' duration to
enable them to perfonr social services and improved practices in
livestock rearing and agriculture.
In actual practice, the courses are of 42 days' duration:  seven weeks of six days per
week. No provision has been made to establish the recurrent system, or to plan
advanced trainirg.
2.60    The National Adult Education Centre (NAEC), with the cooperation of the
German Adult Education Association (GAEA) prepared syllabi in six major fields:
animal husbandry, poultry farming, agriculture, health and hygiene, range and
environmental protection, literacy and knowledge and orientation. Participation
of the nomads was rather limited.
1/ Unesco: The Somali Republ'.c : Priority Projects for Educational Development,
Paris, October 1969, pages 42-47.



- 22 -
2.61    Several textbooks were also prepared by local specialists under the leadership
of NAEC. Some of the titles available in Somali language are: 'Contagious Diseases';
'Animal Husbandry'; 'Animal By-products'; 'Vegetables'; 'Agriculture' (primer);
'Soil and Soil Erosion'; and 'Family Nutrition'. For the first time this type of
work is being carried out in Somalia. The German assistance in this endeavour was
extremely valuable.
2.62    The equipment requested dealt with audio-visual teaching hardware such as
overhead, film and slide projectors and recording facilities. The equipment has
been supplemented with some audio-visual materials provided under the German assistance
consisting of films, slides and filmstrips which have been translated and recorded.
However, it must be noticed that medical supplies and instruments, veterinary supplies
and instruments, agricultural tools and supplies and other arts and crafts tools were
not providl by the project, although requested by the Department of Non-Formal
Education.-
2.63    Participants for the Nomadic Training Centres were to be selected by their
local communities from the population of 18-year olds or over. It was thought that
the availability of boarding facilities would expand the catchment areas of the Centres
and also encourage greater participation. For the courses already organized, parti-
cipants had been selected by local authorities without pre-established criteria.
2.64    The permanent training staff requested for the Nomadic Training Centres was
as follows:
Number                         Title
1                        Director
1             :          Assistant Director
2                        Literacy Specialists
2                        Agriculture Specialists
2             :Range Management Specialists
2                        Animal Husbandry Specialists
2                        Health and Hygiene Specialists
4                        Blacksmithery and Shoemaking Specialists
Directors were trained at the Somali Institute of Development Administration and
Management (SIDAM) for two months, a period considered to be too short to meet the
training objectives. The staff was trained at the National Adult Education Centre
for two months well before the buildings and other physical facilities were ready.
In actual practice, the Centres were not staffed with the previously trained personnel.
In fact, at the time of appointment some had left the country, others had. better
positions or did not accept to work in the nomadic areas.
2.65    In May 1978, an Inter-Ministerial Meeting on Nomadic Education, under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Education agreed on the following administrative
and management matters:
1/ Basic Education for Nomads, Report of a Seminar, Mogadiscio, 1-9 April 1978,
pages 54-55.



- 23 -
(a) the establishment cf a National Steering Committee to be responsible
for the overall guidance of the Nomadic Training Centres, the valida-
tion of their curricula and curriculum-related materials, the general
inspection of the Centres' operations and the estimation of the yearly
recurrent costs. Such a committee was to be composed of representatives
of concerned ministries and agencies. The Director-General of the
Ministry of Education would be the chairman for the first two years;
(b) the management of the Centres would be the responsibility of local
authorities, however, the Ministry of Education wuld be resprn.sible
for the first two years of operation;
(c) the budget allocated by agencies other than the Ministry of Education
for the operation of the first two years of the Centres would be
transferred to the Ministry of Education;
(d) interested Government ministries and specialized agencies would have
to contribute to the costs and activities of the Centres.
In practice, the steering body has not fulfilled its responsibilities and has not
been able to enforce the decisions made by the Inter-Ministerial Meeting. Even the
specialists appointed by other bodies than the Ministry of Education are not working
full-time in the Centres.
2.66    As far as participation is concerned, the nomads have been mostly neglected.
Their participation during the project development and implementation was very
limited and they have no say in the actual administration and operation of the Centres.
Development and Implementation of Physical Facilities
2.67    This component, which originally included the building facilities, furniture
and equipment for ten Nomadic Training Centres (NTCs) has actually included six NTCs
and three Community Education and Training Centres (CETCs). Soon after construction,
one NTC (Ber) which was located in a sensitive zone, was taken up by the Army. This
was no longer considered as part of the project and its civil works cost (credit
funds) was cancelled.
2.68    Locations and Sites:  three NTCs (Ber, Boame and Buran) are located in the
northern part of the country at distances of 1,000 to 1,500 kms from Mogadiscio and
another three (Aboorey, Guriel and Gadogob) in the central part of the country at
distances of 250 to 800 kms from Mogadiscio. All sites have an area of 1.44 ha
each and are located near water-points and places of nomadic settlements. The site
area corresponds to 90 sq.m. per trainee's place which is adequate for the activities
foreseen.
2.69    Design:  standard plans (layout and buildings) were developed for all NTCs on
the basis of the working-sheets established at the time of the Appraisal. Each NTC
consists of:
-  1   Administration block
-  1   Classroom block
-  1   Communal facilities block
-  4   Dormitory blocks
-  1   Kitchen and Dining block
-  2   Detached houses
-  1   31ock of teachers' flats
-  1   Block of ablutions and toilets



- 24 -
(a)  all buildings are one-storey with load-bearing walls, timber truss
roofs covered with corrugated G.I. sheets;
(b)  the actual total gross area exceeds the Appraisal estimates by
35 per cent, the main reason being the increase of the circulation
areas (251 per cent over the Appraisal estimates or 20 per cent of
the Teaching and Communal areas and 30 per cent of the Boarding,
compared with the Appraisal figures of 10 and 20 per cent, respectively.
Other areas increase considerably: Kitchen (57 per cent); Dining'
Lecture Room (80 per cent); and Housing (20 per cent). On the contrary,
the Dormitory area was decreased by 18 per cent with an increase of the
corresponding circulation area;
(c)  the various blocks are oriented parallel or perpendicular to the longi-
tudinal axis of the site. There is no evidence in the layout of any
provision for future additions of facilities necessary for nomadic
training such as tanning sheds; sheds for animal husbandry; sheds for
drying hides and skins; blacksmith sheds; tool storage sheds;
general storage; maintenance, etc. The present accommodation covers
only the formal aspect of the nomadic education (formal classrooms),
the boarding and administrative requirements. The spaces provided
for community use (health and veterinary clinics) are minimal
(18 sq.m gross area each);
(d)  the various blocks of buildings are arranged in the layout in such
a way as to allow with difficulty the addition of any future facili-
ties, for which no provision was made in the plans;
(e)  the design of the building is simple, but internal arrangements (such
as the kitchen with six wood-stoves and no chimney, no correspondence
between w-ndows and bed positions in the dormitories) could have been
better planned. All buildings have the possibility of cross-ventilation
although they are not always properly oriented because of the layout
(see (c) above).
2.70    Construction:  the construction suffers mainly from inappropriate structural
design, low quality materials and inadequate workmanship.  The roofs are designed
and built without wind-bracing members, and for long timbered pieces, whereas timber
is not available more than 4 m. long.  Termite treatment was not effective with the
result of many wooden parts (doors, cupboards) showing evidence of termite attack.
2.71    Furniture (see Annex 17):  all NICs have been supplied with the furniture
according to plans made up for each NTC.
2.72    Equipment:  the vehicles foreseen for the NTCs (1 Land-Rover and 1 5-ton truck
each) were not delivered except for one 5-ton truck for each Aboorey and Buran Centre.
2.73    Professional Services:  the design studies of the NTCs were prepared by the
PIU architect. Supervision of the construction was carried out by this architect
for three Centres, by the PIU engineers for two Centres and jointly for one Centre.
2.74    Implementation Schedule:
(a)  the design study was started late 1975, but exact locations and sites had
not been defined until end of 1977. Working drawings and tender documents
were completed and tenders invited by late 977 (30 months behind Appraisal
schedule);



- 25 -
(b) three contracts were awarded and works started in Aboorey and Guriel
on 15 May 1978 (26-29 months behind the Appraisal schedule). Constru-
ction in Ber began a few months later.  Another two contracts (Boame
and Gadogob) were awarded and works commenced in September 1978.
No bids were received for the sixth NTC located in Hiinalol because
of its remote location. This was relocated to Buran and construction
began in March 1979;
(c) the construction of one of the NTCs (Ber) was completed 17 months
behind the Appraisal schedule and three months ahead of the contract's
schedule. Four NTCs were completed from 33 to 38 months behind the
Appraisal schedule andi from 11 to 14 months behind the contract's
schedule;
(d) finally, one NTC (Gur:Lel) was completed in February 1982, i.e. 52
months behind the Appraisal schedule and 33 months behind the
contract's schedule. The reasons for the delays were initially due
to delays in the selection of the exact locations and sites. This,
however, had very little influence on the design because all NTCs
have the same layout and building plans, irrespective of location
and site;
(e)  the discussions and decisions concerning the content of the training
programmes of the NTCs cannot also be considered as a delaying factor
because the plans of -the NTC have followed the working sheets estab-
lished during the Appraisal and were not influenced by any changes in
the concept of training programmes and scopes. Delays in the constru-
ction stage are mainly due to the shortage of building materials and
petrol as well as the remoteness of the locations, although one of
the NTCs (Ber), situated in a remote area, exposed to difficulties,
was constructed in thie record time of ten months.
2.75    Capital Costs:
(a) the increase of the cost of civil works of the NTC is on average 19 per cent
with one NTIC presenting an increase of nine per cent and another (Ber)
costing 69 per cent less than the Appraisal estimate;
(b)  furniture cost was in3reased by 166 per cent over the Appraisal estimate
and equipment cost by 50 per cent;
(c)  the reasons for the cost increase of the civil works can be attributed
to two factors: under-estimation of the cost during Appraisal because
the estimates were based on Mogadiscio prices and did not include a
cost adjustment for the actual locations;  and the increase of the
total gross area. The increase of the furniture cost is general for
all components and it is being dealt with separately (see Annex 17).
2.76    Achievements, Shortcomings and Problems:  considering the innovative character
of this component, the positive aspect of the physical facilities as they have finally
been constructed is that they exist and can be a basis for further evaluation of the
idea by experimentation, identification of mistakes and search for the right solution
to the problem.



- 26 -
2.77    The conception, planning and construction of the NlCs do not correspond to
the following needs:
(a)  to the requirements (as expressed in the Appraisal) for courses:
"?oriented towards developing capabilities (of youths) in animal
husbandry, agriculture, literacy and numeracy", of "literacy
and non-formal programmes", for adults "hygiene, agriculture
and animal husbandry, citizenship and community development"
and for community services "health clinics, veterinary,
marketing and cooperative services";
(b)  to the cultural, social and environmental background character-
istics and requirements of the users. The buildings of the NTCs
provide facilities suitable for formal schooling and nothing for
non-formal programmes on courses such as animal husbandry,
agriculture and skills. The spaces provided for community use
are minimal and inadequately equipped. For example, there is
no provision in the plan for additional facilities that could
be used for non-formal training and community development,
as well as for any space for cultural or spiritual activities,
such as a mosque or a praying-shelter which would enhance the
integration of the Centre with the social and cultural environ-
ment of the users;
(c) finally, varying environmental conditions have not been taken
into account (e.g. buildings have the same design, materials,
fittings, etc. as those built in a town including dependence
upon electricity (fuel) and difficulties in maintenance).
2.78    During the design study the inputs concerning the special educational
character of the NTCs never reached the designers and this can be confirmed by the
strict adhesion to the working-sheets prepared during the Appraisal. The major
problems which the NTCs physical facilities now present are:
(a) maintenance (low quality materials, remoteness, lack of maintenance
budget and qualified technicians); and
(b) adaptation to the requirements of non-formal nomadic training.
ODeration of the Centres
2.79    The current situation of the Centres is as follows:
Centre         Completed         Operational             Remarks
Aboorey          June 1979          December 1980      Two courses of 42-days
each have taken place.

Cancelled as project
element.



- 27 -
2.80    In spite of all the preparatory work described in the above section, actual
operation of the Centres has been characterized by improvisation. When the beginning
of the first course in Aboorey was decided by the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development, none of the required resources were available on the site -
meaning teachers, teaching materials and food. Even the participants did not arrive
on time. Some improvement has occurred for the second course in Aboorey and the
first course in Buran.
2s81    The current administration has been designed as follows:  the Ministry of
Education will appoint the Centre's Director and four full-time primary school
teachers; the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development will appoint the
Assistant Director and the non-teaching staff and will pay for the subsistence of
the participants; and the other ministries will supply instructors for the specific
duration of the courses. This arrangement excludes the full-time specialists who
were supposed to provide health, veterinary and agriculture extension services to the
community and which was one of the aims of the Centres. The creation of the Research
and Planning Division in the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
responsible for the Centres will, undoubtedly, improve their performance.
2.82    It is difficult to estimate the costs of the courses, one factor being the
salaries of the part-time staff from different ministries and agencies. As far as
food allowance is concerned, it is estimated that, at present costs, So.Sh.2.0 million
are required, per Centre, in order to provide food for 200 people (160 participants
and about 40 staff members) for 200 days per year (four courses of seven weeks each)
at So.Sh.50 per person per day. To run five Centres, So.Sh.10.0 million will be
needed, a sum which is very high by Somalian standards. At the time of this mission,
no budget had been allocated to the Ministry of Local Government to operate any of
the Centres in 1982.
2.83    Since the syllabi prepared by the National Adult Education Centre in 1978 had
a different course length and training approach, they are used as guidelines only.
The Centres themselves prepare the course content in coordination with development
-gencies and ministries. Because of this, supporting materials are not available on
time and a total re-thinking of the curriculum has to be carried out in accordance
-wth available experience. One aspect which has been given too much weekly time is
Literacy, to the probable detriment of the development of pastoral skills which was
emphasized throughout the development process.
2.84    Criteria and mechanisms to select the participants have not been well developed
and established. However, in order to succeed, community leaders and elders should
participate.
2.85    The mission had a meeting with community members in Aboorey who expressed
sacisfaction with the Centre. However, they pointed out that primary school was their
f'rst priority in view of the fact that there is no such service.  Therefore, the
risk exists that the community may move to open a primary school in the Centre.
A second priority expressed was that of the mosque followed by the provision of health
ar i veterinary services.   As indicated above, facilities for the latter services
,4ere built but personnel and supplies have not been provided.
1.B6    Attendance at the two courses in Aboorey was high:
Beginning of course       End of course
First course                          160                    141
Second course                         120                     93
Participants are supplied with textbooks, copy-books and pencils and with hygienic
materials.  Transportation to and from their community is also provided.



- 28-
2.87    The educational facilities of the Centres, i.e. four regular classrooms,
are not adequate to meet the needs of the programme envisaged. The present setting
Dermits classroom teaching only. The Government is looking into foreign assistance
for the building of additional facilities to carry out the teaching of livestock,
agriculture, leather work and blacksmithery. Depending on the performance of the
Centres, a new IDA project may wish to supplement the Centres with the necessary
additional facilities.
2.88    As the original conditions have changed, curriculum and curriculum-related
materials are no longer relevant. If courses are tailored in duration and content
to the specific target groups, then flexibility rather than permanency would be
the salient characteristic of the curriculum. Training in curriculum development
appears as a need for all those involved in course design.
2.89    The present administrative approach based upon voluntary participation or
rural development ministries and agencies, cannot guarantee a smooth and permanent
operation of the Centres.
2.90    The Centres are far from achieving the expected results, mainly because
they do not have the necessary minimum physical, financial, technical and human
resources to carry out the planned activities. The question as to whether the
Centres are an adequate answer to the educational needs of the nomads is still open.
Conclusions
2.91    These observations lead us to the following conclusions in the form
of lessons that could be learned from this component of the project:
(a) a project component that is totally new to a country should include
some research and development work. This should be costed and
included in the preparation document. The Bank should share some
of those costs. In any case, a concerted effort is needed to design
and implement new and challenging educational programmes;
(b) the inter-ministerial committee approach to administer and
operate the NTCs has been inefficient.  Experience in the country
indicates that only one agency should be made responsible to run
a component and it should have the necessary means to operate it
effectively;
(c) a basic criterion for the location of any element of a component
(i.e. one NTC) should be the recognized demand or priority given
by the local community. When the local population prefers a
primary school instead of an NTC (e.g. Aboorey) the chances of
the latter being subverted are real;
(d) if NTCs are going to provide veterinary health, agriculture
extension and community development services to the nomadic
population then transportation facili-ties are badly needed.
None of these serrices will be efficiently provided unless
improved support and better supervision is established.  The
use of mobile units seems appropriate.
(e) it is not clear to the mission how the NTCs are going to achieve
their objective: to improve the life of the nomads. Is it
through the introduction of new varieties of livestock and
agriculture products, improvement of the existing varieties and
products, change of present economic activities, improvement of
marketing systems, or a combination of' all these and others,  In
any case, wlat is the role of NTCs?  A clearer and more developed
statement of this leading to a better conceptual and practical
understandirg of their role might well have made a difference.



29 -
(f)  A mechanism for corrnunity participation in the actual management
and operation of the Centres is required in order for them to be
responsive to the cultural patterns of the target populations.
COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND TRPIDING CMFT=S (CETC)
General
2.92    As explained in paragraph 2.56, these three Centres were aimed at supporting
three agricultural settlements in Sablale, Kurtunwarrey and Dujumxa.  In contrast to
the Nomadic Training Centres, the  Community Education and Training Centres were to
be non-residential and consist of six classrooms, six workshops (carpentry, masonry,
shoemaking, tailoring, electricity and home economics), a shed for poultry farming,
land for crop farming, a maLternal and child health care unit, a youth centre,
administration facilities, staff housing and ablutions areas. Each Centre would
be able to accommodate 160 participants. Furniture and workshop equipment would
be provided.
Development and Implementation of the Educational Aspects
2.93    Although the NatiorLal Adult Education Centre (NAEC) was given the responsi-
bility for implementation of the educational aspects of the Centres, it was unable
to carry-out these functiorLs and to cope with the NTCs as well, for reasons of
under-staffing.  Therefore, the Bank suggested the strengthening of NAEC along with
the village techniology specialist included in the Third Project.
2.94    In early 1978, the Settlement Developmert Agency (SDA) which is responsible
for the administration of the settlement areas (including the comnunity and education
training centres), carried out a survey of the skill training needed. The results
were to be used as a basis for the planning of the courses. It was intended that
each Centre would provide a two-year course for 80 adolescents and at the same time,
short courses for adults. The NAEC would get assistance from the German Adult
Education Association and the Unesco/Unicef/ILO Intermediate Technology and Basic
Education Project to desigi courses and prepare materials.
2.95    The students had to be selected from the surrounding settlements since the
Centres had no boarding facilities. Participants should have finished six years
of primary education.
2.96    As far as the staff is concerned the following personnel had been proposed:
1         Coordinator
4    :   Agriculture specialists
2         Animal husbandry specialists
2         Maternal and child health specialists
2    :    Literacy specialists
6         Craft instructors (woodwork, blacksmithery,
leatherwork, tailoring,
electricity and general
mechanics)
2    :   Home economics specialists
Coordinators were to be trained at the Somali Institute of Development, Administration
and Management and teachers at the National Adult Education Centre.



Development and implementation of Physical. Facilities
2.97    Locations and Sites:  the three CETCs are located in three districts which
were created for the settlement of drought-affected nomadic population in Dujuma,
Sablale and Kurtunwarrey. These are settlements in the southern part of the country
at distances of 250 to 350 kms from Mogadiscio.  The sizes of the settlements are
estimated at present to be between 10,000 and 14,0C0 inhabitants, respecAively. (See
paragraph 2.53).  The sites are centrally located (Dujuma, Sablale) or within walking
distance from the centre of the settlement (Kurtunwarrey). All sites have an area of
0.636 ha. each and are accessible by car.  The Kurtunwarrey site was inrtially
selected to be at the centre of the resettlement but was later moved to another loca-
tion at a certain distance from the Centre, The soil in this area is alluvial-
swelling type.
2.98    Design:  the layout and building plans of the three CETCs are identical.
There are five main blocks of buildings: Administration, Classrooms, Workshops, Home
Economics, Library and Youth Centre, and Maternity and Chdld Welfare Centre. There
are also three housing units: two houses and one group of flats for staff. All
building blocks are one-storey and are laidc out parallel to the longitudinal axis of
the site except for the administration and library blocks which are perpendicular.
2.99    The design followed the requirements laid out in the schedule of accomnoda-
tion, prepared in February 1976 with the exception of the poultry and crop husbandry
sheds which were not included in the plans. The plans of the various buildings are
a simple juxtaposition of rooms in a row (classrooms and home economics blocks) or in
groups of rooms on either side of large entrance halls (workshops and maternity).
The questions of physical lighting and ventilation as well as protection from sun
were not given full attention. The workshops have no cross-ventilation and inadequate
natural light. Classrooms also have inadequate natural light, and low windows which
do not allow for ventilation of the upper part of the rooms. Covered walkways have
different orientations in different building blocks. Artificial lighting is inade-
quate and not planned according to each room requirement. The structural design and
detailing of roofs has several shortcomings such as the form of trusses (designed for
long timber members), lack of wind bracing members, hardboard ceilings in external
covered walkways, etc. There is no evidence that hazards such as bats entering the
roofs, or swelling soils were taken into account in the design.
2.100   The gross area (academic and communal) estimated in the schedule of accom-
modation, excludirg the poultry and crop husbandry sheds, was 1,640 sq.m. The
actual gross area is 2,006 sq.m., i.e. exceeding the planned areas by 22 per cent.
The actual gross area for staff housing conforms to the estimates. The main reason
for the increase is due to the doubling of the foreseen circulation areas (external
covered walkways) from an estimated 10 per cent to 20 per cent.
2.101   Construction: the construction is of load--bearing walls, timber truss roofs
covered with corrugated iron sheets, wooden windows and doors, cement plastered walls
and cement screed floors, The construction suffers from inappropriate and,/or poor
quality materials "hardware on doors and windows rusted or broken, flush doors made
of hardboard, electrical and plumbing fixtures rusted or broken, etc.), poor workman-
sn-ip and lack of supervision (cement screed floors disintegrating from lack of cement;
doors, cupboards and other timber attacked by termites, floors of rooms and external
covered walkways wi-thout jcints, long fence walls without joints, no provision for
chimneys in the kitchens) and inadequate design detailing (ceilings destroyed because
of leaking roofs ard bats, maor damages to buildings because of inappropriate
foundations e.g. Ki:rtunwarrey, etc.). All sites are supplied with generators. In
one of the centres the generator is not yet installed.  Two sites are water connected;
one is still without water.



- 31 -
2.102   Furniture:  all pro'lect furniture has been delivered and most of it has been
installed (some items were delivered unassembled and have not yet been set up. The
furniture is not sufficient for the present use of the CETCs (for furniture in general,
see Annex 17).
2.103   Equipment:  all project equipment has been delivered but has proved to be
inadequate and inappropriate for the present use of the CETCs. The five-ton trucks
were delivered but not the ILad-Rovers.
2.104   Professional services:  the C=I'C buildings were designed and sW.pervised by the
PIU architect except for the Kurtunwarrey CETC which was supervised by the architect
and later by the engineer oV the PIU.
2.105   Implementation Schediule:
(a) sites for the three CETCs were selected during the last quarter of 1975 and
the schedule of accommodation was prepared in February 1976. Drawings and
tender docunents were ready by mid-1976 and tenders invited by October 1976.
Contracts were awarded after four months and works started in March (2 CETCs)
and April (1 CETC) 1977, 11-14 months behind Appraisal (NTCs) schedule;
(b) construction of one CETC was completed seven months behind the Appraisal
schedule and two months ahead of the contracts schedule. The second CETC
was completed 17 months behind Appraisal and eleven months behind the
contracts shedule. The last one was completed 38 months behind Appraisal
and 29 months behind the contract schedule. The reasons for the delays
can be attributed to the initial delay of the preparation of the design
study because of changes in the purpose of the programme and in the
location of the institution and shortage of building materials and petrol.
2.106   Capital Cost:  increase of the cost of the civil works is from 12 to 33 per
cent if compared with cost estimates of the Appraisal (made for different types of
buildings). As compared with the cost estimates of the new schedule of accommodation,
the cost increases are 72 per cent, 58 per cent and 44 per cent for each of the three
Centres. The actual unit cost of the three CETCs is lower than the Appraisal unit
cost of the NTCs. Furniture costs were increased by 220 per cent over the Appraisal
estimates and equipment costs by 121 per cent.  The reason for the cost increases over
the Appraisal estimates are, of course, the change in accommodation requirements and
the increase of the total gross area. The spectacular increase of the cost compared
to that of the cost estimates of the new schedule of accommodation is due to the
under-estimation of the cost (unit cost was estimated at 36 per cent less than that
of the Appraisal unit cost of the NTCs), and particularly the cost of site works
(only five per cent) and of the contingencies (20 per cent).  No cost adjustment
was added. The increase of" the furniture costs is general and will be dealt with
separately (see Annex 17).
2.107   Achievement, shortcomings and problems:  the facilities required for a Centre
serving community education and training needs were well conceived at the preparation
of the schedule of accommodation.  The buildings as they were built can serve the
purposes of s  .h a Centre with minor improvements (natural ventilation and lighting
of workshops) and additions (sheds for practical training). The main problem of
CETCs' physical facilities is maintenance (low quality materials, remoteness, lack
of maintenance budget and qualified technicians). Repairs are urgently required,
particularly at the Kurtunwarrey CETO.



- 32 -
Operation of the Centres
2.108   Currently, all three .Centres operate as technical secondary schools.  Given
the large primary school population and the high demand for secondary education, the
Government decided to use the facilities for this type of education. The Bank was
informed of the decision. The facilities built for home economics and maternal child
welfare are either not utilized at all or used as staff housing (KurtunwarrEY).
2.109   The Women's Education Centre, which is part of *the Non-formal Adult Education
Department, has organized two types of 'Family Life' courses operating under the
authority of the Principals of the Centres. The first type of programme consists of
initial training of young women in the settlement areas; the second is a continuation
o; the first and operates as a production-training centre. In the case of Kurtunwarrey,
the initial training takes place inside the Centre but the production training activities
operate outside the compound in a room provided by the local authorities where twelve
sewing-machines provided by the project has been transferred.  Three instructors and
twelve participants work on tailoring, weaving, carpet-making, etc., and their output is
for sale. The objective is to help women establish their own businesses. Instructors
and some materials are provided by the Ministry of Education, but the programme faces
several constraints, including lack of financial assistance to acquire equipment and
materials, inexperienced instructors, and lack of marketing studies. The estimated
cost of a production-training centre for 20 people per year is So.Sh. 36O,120 (see
Annex 11).
Conclusions
2.110   This leads us to draw the following conclusions and lessons from our observations
(a)  the policy concerning the utilization of the CETCs responds to the
educational needs and demands of the settlement areas where formal
education for youth has a higher priority than adult education.
This suggests that flexibility should be applied and that facilities
designed and built for the exclusive use of adult educational
programmes could be used for other purposes and remain within the
scope of the Agreement;
(b) it is unfortunate that the Women's Education Centre was not actively
involved in the development aspects of this component of the project.
Such involvement could have enhanced the functionality of the facilities
as well as the 'Family Ilfe' programme (which is the only adult education
activity taking place in the Centre);
(c) a study should be carried out to find out:
(i) the training needs of rural population groups;
(ii) additions or modifications required in the existing
adult education facilities (Nomadic Training Centres,
Community Education Training Centres, Farmer Training
Centres, Adult Education and Training Cen-tres, etc.)
to make them of multi-purpose use and to increase
the use of under-utilized facilities;
(iii)  the required financial, technical and other resources;  and
(iv) proper mechanisms for the administration and operation of
such multi-purpose Centres.

General
2.111   At the time of the <oppraisal the Fishery and Marine Institute ,as conceived
for 268 students of .wnom 60D would be boarding.  It was to replace existing old and
derelict accoo=r.odations -w;here 180 students were enrolled.  The Institute, to be sited
near the new port area of  Tosgad_cio, would offer four-year courses (Grades IX-XII)
Driented towards pro;_di; :bs_c- ,re1ffiinary train.ing to enable graduates to be employed
in the coastal fizhing, the merchant navy or the fish processing industry, It was to
be the country's only training institute of its kind and be under the,direction of the
newly-formed .Iiristry of Fisheries and :Marine Transport.  Probable develo,pments in
fisheries and related activities were to ensure relevant employment for the Institute's
graduates.
2.112   The project provided for the construction of five classrooms, one general and
^ne engine workshop, two sclence and one navigation laboratory, one library, one multi-
purpose hall, administration and boarding facilities, and one wardents house. The
Institute was to be supplied with necessary fUrniture, four boats and other teaching
and non-teaching equipment.
Developrnent and Implementation of Educational Aspects
2.113   In 1976, the Ministry of Education directly contracted five specialists of
Indian origin to serve as teachers at the Institute. The contract was made possible
throlugh the technical assistance component of the Second Project. These specialists
started work in early 1977. The specializations selected were: fishing gear, fish
processing, marine mechanics, marine engineering and navigation. The purpose of the
technical assistance group rwas not only to teach their own specialities but also to
train counterpart teachers to take over the classes from them.
2.1l1   The Institute in Mogadiscio is one of four that the Government decided to
establish. The other three, not supported by the project, are located in Kismayo,
Brawa and Bossaso, In 1977, the InstItute was up-graded from a diversified secondary
school to a full vocational training institute by increasing the teaching load of
technlcal subjects. The Institute has been in operation since 1953, was closed in
1969 and re-opened in 1971.  It operates 36 weeks a year, from November to July
waith a teaching load of 36 hours per week.
2.115   The syllabus was prepared at the Institute by the Indian specialists with the
cooperation of FAQ experts working in the fisheries project, and others from the Mlnistry
of Fisheries, the "'iinistry of Education, etc. Three sections were established: marine
engineering, fisheries and navigation.  2ne first-year programme is cormron to all studentz
a-d diversification starts from. the second-Year.  The language of teaching is English,
ho-wever, Somali teachers prefer to teach in the Somali language.
2.116   Thae ecuinment llsts corresponding with curricullm requirements were also prepared
at the Institute.  Five lists were prepared:  fish processing laboratory;  fish-gear
laboratory; general workshop;, engine practice workshop and navigation. At the same
time, the list of required books was also precared.  Only the ganeral workshop list wras
procured tlrcu&i the project assistance.
2.117   Students are selected bo, the Deoartment cf Seconday Education of the Ministry o0
Educatcr. fro. a mertt list based on science and mathematics examination results.
Students from all sver the country apply for acLmission.



- 34 -
2.118   Teachers are recruited from the graduates of the Tnstitute who have under-
gone two years of training at the Tecrinica 7eacher Training College.  Also, twelve
former students of the Institute are undergoing training at the Academy of Marine
Transport in Alexan.dria, EBypt, and they are expected to return late t.is year (11982)
to carry out part-time teaching at the Instit.ute.
Development_andIm-plementation of Physical Facilities
2,119   This component consists of building facilities, furniture and equipment for
a Fishery and M arine Institute.  There were no amendments or modifications to the
initial formulations of the component.
2.120   Location and Site:  the Institute is located in Mogadiscio.  The location
meets the criteria for the installation of such an educational facility.  It is in
the central area of Mogadiscio, on the coast and near the new port.  The site has
ar. area of 0.62 ha. which corresponds to 21.5 sq.m. per student place (design
capacity). This is approximate, considering that the total actual gross area per
student is 12.24 sq.m. (some buildings are two-storied). No possibility for future
extensions exist within the present site.  Situated along the coast, although an
advantage for such an institution, it creates certain problems for the buildings
and equipment (corrosion of metal parts and equipment, erosion of the foundations
of fence walls facing the ocean side).
2.121   Design:  the plans prepared for the FYI follow the requirements established
in the working-sheets at the time of the Appraisal. The required accommodation is
grouped in the following blocks: administration and multi-purpose hall (single-
storey); classrooms and laboratories (two-storey); library, social studies room
(one-storey); workshops (one-storey); dormitories (two-storey); kitchen and dining
area (one-storey). The actual total gross area exceeds the Appraisal estimates by
30 per cent. The main reason for the increase is the addition of a dining hall,
separate sanitary facilities and a laundry in the boarding area. The circulation
area, although increased in absolute terms, is decreased to approximately 17 per cent
of the total area instead of 20 per cent (Appraisal). All building blocks, with the
exception of the library-social studies and the workshop blocks, as well as the
multi-purpose hall, are oriented towards the ocean. Nearly all spaces have openings
on the two opposite sites and have sufficient cross-ventilation and natural light.
One exception is the workshops which have neither good ventilation nor sufficient
natural light.  All workshops have a row of reinforced concrete columns running
through the middle of the room, although the span of the roof is not very important
(approximately eight metres). The multi-purpose hall has a sloping floor.  The
kitchen has no sinks or running water inside the cookirg area and no working tables
or benches.  Two small sinks are installed outside the kitchen.  Ventilation and
natural light is inadequate as there are practically no windows in the cooking area.
The boarding facilities consist of rooms for four boarders, with one window and one
door on opposite sides.  The rooms of the upper flocr ocen on to an unprotected
terrace.  The science laboratories nnd classrooms block face directly on to the
ocean.  No particular provision was made in the specifications for the metal elements
(window bars, hardware, electrical fi;tures) which are exposed to the sea air heavily
loaded with salt. The roofs which are covered *.with corrugated asbestos sheets have
an inadequate slope and they are surrounded by high parapet walls.  Rainwater is
disposed throug-h gutters placed between the edge of the roof and the parapet walls.
he interior arranrgements of the science labcratories follow th-e standard plans of
the secondary schools.  Central laboratory benches are fixed and bulky.



- ,5 -
2.122   Constructi:n:  the construction is, in general, acceptable with -.he exception
of the rocos -.rch are practically all leakirg.  In some rocms, such as the library
an:i classrooms, ceilings are riouaiy dama.ed b-y ra-jnwater.  Floors exposed to the
sun, such as the dozr-Litories' terrace are cracking for lack of joints and adequate
cement.  :.etal elements (..indcw bars, hardware, electrical fixtures) are exposed to
sea air, particularly in the classrooms and laboratories' block and are rapidly
rusting.  The sea air is also affecting the science equipment.  Tenraite treatment
of the foundaticns was inadequate, and wooden elements such as laboratory benches
have already been attacked by tertites. Laboratory bench tops have a treatment
which is not resistant to acids and ordinary laboratory use.  A lrge part of the
fence on the coast side has collapsed because of sea erosion of the foundatiors.
2.123   Furniture:  all the furniture included in the prolect with the exception of
that in the boarding facilities, has been delivered to the Institute (see Annex 17).
2.124   EcuSi cment:  science laboratories are adequately equipped, but workshops
(except for general mechanics) have no equipment at all.
2.125   Implenentation Schedule:  final decisions concerning location and site were
taken in     the beginning of 1977.  Working drawings and tender documents were
prepared by M',arch 1977. Tendering took place in June 1977 and the contract awarded
two months later. The contractor was installed in January 1978, 21 months behind
Appraisal schedule. The construction was completed in 31 months, i.e. 31 m.onths
behind Appraisal schedule and 15 months behind contract schedule. The reasons for
the delays can be attributed to:
(a)  initial delays in the decisions concerning the location and site
of the Institute as well as the scope of the teaching and training
programmes, although the latter had no influence on the design
since the final building plans followed the schedule of accommo-
dation prepared at the time of the Appraisal;
(b)  difficulties in taking possession of the site (the Institute was
in operation in old buildings on the same site);  and
(c)  shortage of building materials.
2.126   Canital Cost:  the increase of the total cost of civil works was 86 per cent
over the Appraisal estimates, while the cost per sq.m. was increased by 43 per cent.
Furniture cost was increased by 8.5 per cent and the cost of equipment was decreased
by 40 per cent. The increase of the cost of civil works is due to the increase of
the -ross area by 30 per cent and the general increase in construction costs.  The
increase in the cost of furniture is general to all proJect components and it will
be dealt wlth separately (see Annex 17). The decrease of the equipment cost is due
to the cuts made to the equipment lists (see paragraph 2.124 above) as a result of
general cost overrun in the procurement of equim.ent.
2.127   Achieve.ments, shortcomings and problems:  the actual accormodation is suffi-
cient for the num,ber of students planned.  any increase in the nur.ber of students
;     recuire additional accommodation for which there is not sufficient site area.
The construction of th:e buildinFs is acceptable but modifications to the roofs and
to their details of evacuation of the rainwater should be carried out most urgently.
Tne same measures aisc apoly for
,a)  ensuring th.e -rotection cf metallic elements exposed to sea air;
()  Fprotecting  oidcden elements fror, ter-ites;
3) 2 ororiding anpropriate finishes to labcratory bench--tops;  and
'da  ensuring adequate irater supply.

Oneration of the Institute
2.:L28   The new building was completed in July 1980.  Enrolment intake has not been
rationalized in terms of the estimated output for each specialization nor in terms
of the facilities available.  For example, the enrolment in the first grade was
162 in 1979/80, 199 in 198o/81 and 80 in 1981/82. Total enrolment was 472 in 1979/80,
595 in 1980/81 and 380 in 1981/82. In all cases a double shift is used (see Annex 12).
The pass-rate in examinations is rather high.  However, Annex 12 indicates that some
students who passed the examinations failed to return.  It is not possible, at this
stage, to estimate the proportion of drop-outs or repeaters.
2.129   As far as teachers are concerned, we see that although thne enrolment decreased
by about 200 from 1980 to 1982, the number of teachers remained constant (see Annex 12)
at an equivalent of 32 full-time teachers. Therefore, the pupil/teacher ratio decreasE
from about 15 students per teacher in 1980/81 to about ten for the following year.
2.130   The project facilities are utilized as follows:  classrooms are fully utilized;
the general mechanics workshop (the only one equipped) is fully utilized; owing to
lack of water, the science laboratories have a very low use factor; due to lack of
books the library is used as a lecture room; the multi-purpose room is used for
storage;  the other workshops and the boarding facilities are not utilized at a1.
In the near future, the Government will define its policy regarding student boarding
which is now considered very expensive and is financed totally with uovernment
resources.  As part of the new policy, parents may be requested to share food costs.
2.131   There are no records of actual recurrent costs.  The following figures are
estimates made by the Principal of the Institute as an indication of costs during the
1980/81 school year:
So.Sh D
Personnel emoluments                      819,000
Teaching materials                           -
Stationery and related supplies            10,00
Public utilities and services              80,000
Student practice                          300,0C0
Maintenance                                 6,oco
Total:                            1,215,00C
With enrolment of 593 students, the unit cost is about So.Sh. 2,CC0.  Personnel
expenditures represent about 67 per cent of total cost which is uanusually low if
compared with other institutions. Some of the studentst costs (e.g. practice) may
also include other teaching costs.

2.132   The Ministry of Fisheries-/ has estimated the training requirements between
1982 and 1987 for the Ministry itself, the fisheries fLeet and the cooperatives, as
follows (see Annex 13 for details):

If the average number of graduates of the Institute in Mcgadiscio is about 80 per
year, there will be enoush demand for the graduates until late l980s.  The same
development plan suggests that further diversification of specialities will be
required, as well as smaller class sizes and upgrading of the Institute to a two-
year post-secondary course, instead of the present four-year secondary education
level programme.  Regarding boat operators, the plan foresees in-service training
in short (three-month) training courses.
2.133   Graduates of the Institute are working in several Government agencies such
as the Ministry of Fisheries, the Ministry of Marine Transport, Fisheries' Coopera-
tives, the Harbour Agency, and others.  During discussions with mission members.
the employers indicated that graduates lacked practical experience in the field of
trairing. This is understandable given the lack of equipment in the workshops and
technical laboratories. Some employers even suggested that a further two-years of
apprenticeship would be required to become well-qualified specialists. Some of the
graduates interviewed by the mission had the same opinion.  Unless follow-up studies
are carried out, it will be difficult to evaluate the training received and the
improvements required,
2.134   The experience gained at this Institute has helped to establish other similar
Centres in the country.  Currently, one such institute is operating in Brawa. wich
is a fishery development region.  This institute follows the same curricula as the
Institute of Mogadiscio and, on several occasions, the specialists under technical
assistance contracts have come to the Centre to orientate and guide teachers wTho
are foirmer graduates of the .'cgadiscic Insti-tute.  Brawa has actually been in opera-
tion for t'wo years wvith 250 students distri_uted In:  Fishery (60);  Navigation (70);
iechanics (70);  and Carpentry (50).  It can be said that the materials and equipment
procured (which are far fewer than in the original equipment list) do not correspond
to the required training;  in any case, there is lack co text materials and resources;
teachers are trained at the Tochnic_l Teacher Training Colle_e which lacks the required
worksihos ard laboratories, and spe'ialists provrid  ta,_cu'h 'he technical assistance
c_monent have had no ccunter_arts to ta-e eover their teaching responsibilities when
their contracts ended in june 19S2.
2. 5   In cornclusicn, the Institute ;rill continue to ocerate at sub-sta^.dard level,
unless it is provided writh adequate equipment and highly-cualtfled teachers.  A forth-
ccming DanR proiect may provide the resources to solre these two major probwers,.

General
2.137   The Academy was created under the direction of the Ministry of Culture and
Higher Education in 1973 at which time it -;as  ailed t-he 'Academy of Somali Studies'.
In 1978, the Academy was reorganized and its responsibilities widened. Tne Academy
is now nared the 'Somali Academy of Science and Arts', ar.d its administrative head
has the title of President. The Academy is an autonomous bcdy on the same admini-
strative level as the National University ard continues to be under t-he Ministry of
Culture and Higher Education.
2.138   Tne Academy is divided into two Institutes:  one for sciences and one for
arts, with two directorates each^ (see Annex 14).  The 3card of Directors, .which
meets once or twice per year, is chaired by the Minister  rf Culture and Higher

In addition, it would have overall responsibility for broad cultural matters,
including the development of the existing NTational M4useum and the founding of
a National Tibrary.
2.140   To these ends, the Second Education Project included a component for the
expansion and rebuilding of the Acadermy which would comprise facilities to include
staff offices, language laboratory, library, and an audio-visual workroom.
Develorc,ent and Implementation of Ph'ysical Facilities
2.141   This component includes the construction of building facilities and supply
of furniture and equi.ent for tne Somali Acadeny of Science and Arts (forner-
'Academy of Somali Studies'). There were no amendments or modifications to the
component.
2.142   Location and Site:  the site is located in the centre of Mogadiscio and
has an area of approximately 1 ha.
De sign
2.143   The building facilities of the Institute consist of a two-storey office
building and two adjacent one-storey buildings, one for the Library and one for
the Multi-purpose Hall. TInh office building has on each floor a central corridor
with office rooms on either side.  The Library building is connected to the ground
floor corridor of the office building and has a reading and bookstall room with
storage room. The Multi-purpose Hall is connected to the Main Building with a
covered walkway which is, at present, used for storage. The Hall is designed
to resemrble a mini-theatre with a sloped sitting area, a very small stage, dressing
ooms and two toilet groups., projection booth, all on a very small scale. The
sitting area occupies approximately 1/5 of the total area and it has eight rows
of five seats (total 40).  The main part of the building (assembly and stage) has
a high ceiling with ventilation openings on the lower level only. There is no
evidence of any consideration for acoustics.
2.144   The total gross area of the building exceeds the Appraisal estimates by
only 1.9 per cent but spaces of a total of 116 m. (storeroom, guardian's area, etc.)
which originally w,ere inclucLed in the schedule of acconmodation are housed in an
existing building and they are not included in the new one.  If this change is taken
into account, the total gross area exceeds the Appraisal estim.ates by 9.7 per cent.
The Multi-purpose Hall building was not included in the Appraisal schedule of accommo-
dation, t.hich included a conference rocm instead.
2.145   Construction:  the construct-in (reinforced concrete fram-e and non-bearing
walls) -s of an acceptable quality, as are t'e finishes.  The .Multi-purpose Hall's
rocf reauires better Twaterproofin. 6.     eral -,s  have not 'been completed although
the 'uilding wias ter,dnated and h-anded over in Octo.ber "lC '. Water and electricity
are connected to the toTe  supply netw-,orks.
2.146 5   Furniture:  all rooms are suptlied ;rit-h adecuate and acceotable quality
fur-iture.
2.147 1uin.ent:  th'is includes one lanz:a<ae la'craooTr which was ordered on th-e

2.148   Capital Costs:  the total cost of the civil works was 83 per cent higher
than that of the Appraisal estimate and the cost per square metre was US$ 238 instead
of US$ 132 of the Appraisal (80 per cent increase).  The cost of furniture was 346
per cent higher than the Appraisal estimates and the cost of equipment 53 per cent
less. The main reason for the increase of the cost of civil works was the low unit
costs of the Appraisal (1973) estimates and the increase of the construction costs
by the end of 1977. The cost of furniture represented ten per cent of the building
cost in the Appraisal estimates but it actually exceeded 29 per cent of the building
cost. This is because of the nature of the building (offices) and its need for
higher standards and prestige than an ordinary educational bu'iding.  The cost of
equipment was lower because the only equipment ordered was the language laboratory
whereas the Appraisal mentioned audio-visual equipmeent in addition to this.
2.149   Professional Services:  the building was designed by the architect of the
PIU and construction was supervised by the engineer of the same unit. Except for
the Multi-purpose Hall (see above), design was satisfactory and the supervision
adequate.
2.150   Implementation Schedule:  Sketch designs were prepared by November 1975.
Design work was interrupted around February 1976 due to heavy workload of the PIU.
Working drawings and tender documents were completed by February 1977; tendering
took place in June 1977 and work began in November 1977 (19 months behind Appraisal
schedule). Construction was complete in October 1980, i.e. 34 months behind
Appraisal schedule, and 20 months behind the contract's date of completion.
2.151   Achievements, Shortcomings and Problems:  the new building accommodates the
requirements for the research and office space of the Academy. Rather, we might say,
that these requirements are accommodated in the new building although several changes
concerning the scope and the organization of the Institution took place after the
initial conception of the building at the time of Appraisal. The initial conceptu-
alization of the building as a series of rooms with identified use and floor area
was a difficulty which the architect faced in trying to meet the requirements of
the working sheets and the changing functional needs of the Academy and its staff.
The result was a building with a rigid plan whLch has no possibility for flexibility
and growth. A better conceptual approach would have been the definition of the
requirements in terms of overall office and specialized areas and the design of a
modular building which could be sub-divised by light partitions into offices and
other spaces according to the changing needs.
Operation of the Project Facilities
2.152   The Academy and the Educational System:  the Academy is a well established
institution that has made a substantial and important contribution to the development
of the Somali language and culture.  The most important testimony of this work is the
fact that the first cohort of students to have received all their primary and secondary
schooling in the Somali language graduated in 1L981. By 1976, all of the primary
curriculum had been Somalized and by 1978 such was the case for all the secondary
school curriculum. Only technical education is not yet in Somali. The development
of the Somali language is that aspect of the Academy's work that contributes most to
the educational system. The language department has produced dictionaries, a grammar
and standard terminologies for various terms where there is regional variation.
At present, there are several working committees under the aegis of the Academy,
such as:  grammar;  technical administrative and scientific terminologies, and the
develoanent of scientific and comprehensive dictionaries as well as dictionaries
between Somali and other languages.



- 41 -
Facilities and Resources
2.153   The Academy received in August 1981 a language laboratory that is still in
its original crate and awaiting a specialist for its installation. It appears to be
a teaching laboratory. Accorcing to the President of the Academy there are no
language teaching activities at the Academy but, rather, research activities. The
needs of the Academy's linguistics section favour a research laboratory with graphic
devices permitting research on the phonetics and phonology of the Somali language.
The library is used but not well stocked with books. Also, there are no special
audio-visual facilities. The theatre/multi-purpose room is constantly in use, although
poorly adapted to the needs. The staff offices are well used and even overcrowded.
2.154   There is a staff of about 13  people:  about 70 are working in the Directorate
of Fine Arts (theatre, music, dance, folklore); 29 in the Directorate of Somali
Language Development, including 14 full-time researchers with university degrees
plus several part-timers, six 'elderly advisors', typists, etc; about 15 full-time
and four part-time researchers in the Directorate of Social Studies; and about twelve
full- and part-time staff in the Directorate of Natural Sciences who do much of their
research at the National University.
2.155   The Academy has not yet published any material although it plans to come out
with a journal of scientific studies in the near future.
2.156   The Academy's annual budget for this year is around So.Sh. 13 million, of which
3 million are for salaries and seven million on research (including training) with the
rest spent on production maintenance and administration. They receive about
So.Sh. 6 million from foreign sources, especially Swedish.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
General
2.157   As stated in the Appraisal Report, technical assistance aimed at ensuring the
availability of key personnel to support the development of the Fisheries and Marine
Institute and to strengthening the Project Implementation Unit of the Ministry of
Education and the School Construction Unit of the Ministry of Public Works. The
technical assistance component consisted of nine man/years for the Fisheries and
Marine Institute and seven man/years for the Project Implementation Unit.
2.158   Because of an expected finance gap between an ongoing UNDP technical assistance
project and a forthcoming one, the Somali Government requested, and the Bank agreed,
(August 1977) to reallocate part of the credit to support about nine man/years of
specialists' services to train secondary technical education teachers and vocational
training instructors.  Taking into consideration cost increases in the civil works,
the Association agreed in November 1979 to a Government proposal to adjust the
technical assistance component to US$ 730,000. It was established that the proceedings
from the Credit Agreement wculd finance 100 per cent of the foreign expenditures and
about 90 per cent of the OCal1 expenditures.

Development and Implementation of the Component
2.159   Given the high costs on international experts for technical assistance, the
Government was reluctant to engage specialists to be paid under the Credit. There-
fore,no progress in recruitment was observed until late 1976, in spite of the
insistence of the Bank Supervision missions.
2.160   In November 1976, the Tinistry of Education sent a mission to India to recruit
specialists for the Project Unit and the Fisheries and Marine Institute. With the
assistance of the Foreign Assignment Secticn of the Government of India, the above
mission recruited the following personnel:
Contract
Specialist                 Institution                From                To
1  Civil engineer           Project                  01 March 1977      28 Feb.1980
1  Fishing gear expert      Fishery Institute        15 Feb. 1977       31 July 1980
1  Fish processing expert                            15 Feb.  1977      31 July 1980
1  Marine engineer                                   15 Feb. 1977       31 July 1980
1  Marine mechanic                       h           01 March 1977      31 July 1980
1 Navigation and
Seamanship                                        15 Feb.  1977     31 July 1980
From the above Table it can be concluded that the quantity surveyor was not recruited
and five instead of three specialists for the Fishery and Marine Institute were
contracted, thereby utilizing the savings caused by the direct recruitment process.
Their services were extended with the proceedings of the Third Education Project
until 1982.
The major assignments for this team of specialists were to assist the Fishery
and Marine Institute in:
(a) organization and operation of the institution;
(b) actual teaching of their fields of specialization;
(c) training of trainers; and
(d) development of curriculum and curriculum requirements.
2.161   Assessment of the technical assistance services indicates that the Indian
team of specialists played an important role in the up-grading and organization of
the Institute. They have been teaching their respective subjects both at the
Fisheries and Marine Institute and at the Secondary Education Technical Teacher
Training Institute. Because of lack of actual, full-time counterparts they have
only partially fulfilled the assigrment regarding -the training of trainers. Finally,
they prepared syllabi for the Institute as well as the materials, textbooks and
equipment lists required.
2.162   In order to continue to provide technical assistance to the Secondary Educa-
tion Technical Teacher Training College, the Government decided to establish an
agreement with Unesco which had been the Executing Agency for this same UNDP project.
The Agreement was signed in July 1977 for about 100 man,/months at an estimated
cost of LTSQ 468,540. It was due to start on the 1st of January, 19b0, to recruit
the specialists described below:

As in the original UNDP project, ILO provided part of the services to train voca-
tional instructors. To accomplish this, Unesco established a contract with ILO.
2.163   Difficulties in retaining, recruitment and appointment of specialists at
the proper time diminished the efficiency of the component and jeopardized its
impact. Ministry of Education Officials told the mission that: firstly, the
recruitment delays in a context of lack of available national-trained staff put
heavy burdens on the country and created troubles for the Government;  secondly,
that Unesco applies the same rules to Government funds as to the grant-funds;
thirdly, that the long procedures and complicated bureaucratic mechanisms for
dealing with problems de-personalized the Organization and made it difficult to
find someone actually empowered to take prompt decisions; and fourthly, that direct
recruitment sped-up the process and reduced the costs even though the specialists
may not have been better than those provided through international organizations.
2.164   Cost and Finance:  the Table below summarizes projected and actual technical

It can be observed that during the implementation period a third component,
i.e. technical teachers and occupational training instructors, was introduced
along with additional resources to cover the expenses. This Table also shows
that the Governmentt s contribution to techn:Lcal assistance represents 3.6 per

From thLs Table it can be observed that:
(a)  Unesco, as Executing Agency, received US$ 39,462 above the original
Agreement of US$ 468,540 to pay, with the Association Agreement, one
pending account in the same project component.
(b)  posts directly recruited by the Government had lower unit costs
than that of international recruitment agencies. One can only
speculate whether this has an effect; on the quality of work.
Conclusion
2.166   This experience raises the issue of whether Unesco and the Government could
have established an agreement whereby a specific system of management and operation
of Government funds coming from the proceedings of lending agreements could be
worked out in order to short-cut recruitment; delays and establish flexible working
procedures and mechanisms.

CHAPTER III
MANAGEMENT AND COSTS
A.   GOVERNMENT RESPONS';ILITIES AND PERFORMANCE
Overview
3.01    The Ministry of Education was the Executing Agency and, therefore, the
coordinator of all development and implementation activities. Several other
Government agencies participated in these activities, including the Ministries
of Fisheries, Marine, Agriculture, Range Management and Environment, Local
Government and Rural Development, the Resettlement Agency, etc. Actual
responsibility for execution was given to the Project Unit of the Ministry
of Education.
3.02    The Prolect Implementation Unit (PIU) was established for the execution
of the First Education Project. By the end of 1979, the Unit was fully staffed
as shown below:
-  1 Director                     -  1 Procurement Officer
-  1 Deputy Director              -  2 Assistant Procurement Officers
-  i Project Educator             -  2 Accountants
-  2 Engineers                    -  1 Assistant Accountant
-  1 Architect                    -  1 Clerk/Typist
-  2 Draughtsmen                  -  3 Drivers
-  3 Site Supervisors             -  3 Messengers
However, the turnover of the staff was high due to transfers of the seconded
personnel from the Ministry of Public Works back to their original administration
as well as to emigration from the country and to changes into other positions.
(See Annex 23)
3.03    The Project Implementation Unit was responsible for the co-ordination of
activities with all Government agencies concerned; the architectural design and
supervision of the construction; the supplying of materials, equipment and
furniture; the liaison ancl operation with IDA and the progress evaluation and
reporting.
3.o4    Regarding the implementation of educational and software components, the
Project Unit's role was to collect information from the Units of the Ministry of
Education concerned with specific conditions and covenants and then report to
the Association. The fact that the Project Unit had, for most of the time, no
educator on its staff may account for confusion in the implementation of
educational aspects of the Project. (See Chapter II)



- 46 -
Working and Administrative Procedures for Implementation
of the Educational Aspects
3.05    There are no clear-cut working procedures and mechanisms to implement
the educational aspects as there are for the physical plant aspects. Almost
all tasks in this regard are carried out on an ad hoc basis. The secondment of
specialists from one Government agency to join a work team in another one, for
example, is made on personal request. No criteria or established procedure exists
on duration, work conditions, etc.
3.o6    Although there is a curriculum unit in the Ministry of Education, it was
not possible to find the recommended norms and standards for the preparation of
syllabi for non-form.al education. Ad hoc groups were organized for the prepara-
tion of the syllabi and the determination of their requirements in terms of
materials, equipment, textbooks, etc. However, review, approval, supervision and
evaluation functions and responsibilities were not clearly defined and allocated.
3.07    Not much was prepared beyond that which traditionally exists in the
following areas of the student's life: admission, attendance, promotion, drop-
out, repetition, graduation, incentives for entrance and retention, mechanisms
to integrate the student into the working world, and the establishment of
student services (boarding, scholarships, health, guidance, etc.).
3.08    Participation of parents and the community is one of the aims of the
education and training system. However, no mechanisms for mutual co-operation
and development have been established: not even in the Community and
Education Training Centres.
3.09    Finally, no administrative manuals were prepared for the project
institutions, or for the requirements of staff in quantitative and training
terms. Since all these aspects are new developments for the country, it
is advisable that in future projects teclhnical and financial assistance be
provided to properly implement the education and software elements of project
institutions.
Working and Administrative Procedures for Implementation of the
Physical Facilities Aspects
3.10    The professional services (architectural and engineering) for the civil
works of this project were provided by the PIU staff. Checking of drawings,
contract documents and structural calculations was carried out by the "Somali
Engineering Consultancy Agency" which is under the control of the Ministry of
Public Works.
3.11    For the first two years of the project implementation, 1975 and 1976,
the professional staff of the PIU consisted of one architect only, who was also
responsible for the First Education Project. These years correspond to the period
of the preparation of the working drawings ard tender documents of nearly all
project buildings. Two engineers were recruited in January and March 1977.
A quantity surveyor had never been recruited. His work was carried out by the
architect and later by the engineers. (See Annex 23)
3.12    Supervision of the proJect building construction was the responsibility
of the PrJ and it was carried out by the architect and two engineers.  Two site
supervisors were recruited in early 1977, one at the end of 1978 and a third



- 47 
at the beginning of 19.80, The site sunervisors were young, unqualified and
inexperienced, serving mainly as resident site supervisors under the responsi-
bility of the professionals.
p.13    The design of all project buildings was based on the schedules of
accommodation prepared in June 1974 (worksheets) as part of the Appraisal. New
schedules of accommodation were prepared later for two of the components whose
capacity and/or scope changed (Elementary Teacher Training College and Community
Education and Training Centres). There is no evidence of detailed architectural
briefs for the project buildings.
3.14    Drawings prepared for the First Education Project (between March 1973
and August 1975) were used in the preparation of the designs of this project
building.  These drawings were mainly laboratory and workshop layouts and their
details of fixed furniture (workbenches, cupboards, cabinet, etc.).  Norms
concerning space standards, performance requirements of educational spaces
(natural and artificial illumination, ventilation, acoustics, safety, etc.), and
service requirements (electricity, water, etc.) did not exist in the country
and unfortunately they were not established beforehand as part of the project.
Working drawings and tender documents for all civil works were prepared by the
architect, checked by the Somali Engineering Consulting Agency and approved by
the Association.
-.15    Bids for civil works were called for locally and internationally
(through embassies in Mogadiscio). No interest was shown from firms outside
the country. All contracts were awarded to local construction firms. Bids were
submitted to the Ministry of Education "Tenders Board" who selected the winning
contractor.  After clearance from the Association and various government offices,
contracts were registered by the "Magistrate of Accounts" and finally signed.
This procedure (from bidding to signature) took approximately 3 to 4 months to
be completed.
3.16    For the procurement of equipment, the PIU called for pre-qualification of
firms by international advertising through foreign embassies and the World Bank
Resident Representative. A list of registered bidders was established and
included all firms that had replied. After preparation of lists and approvals
by a committee nominated by the Minister of Education and the Association, tenders
were invited from the pre-qualified firms. The bids were opened by the Tenders
Board of the Ministry of Education who selected the winning firms. After clearance
from the Association and various Government agencies, contracts were registered
by the "Magistrate of Accounts" and signed. Part of the equipment supply (audio-
visual, vocational training, vehicles) was contracted to Unicef directly.
Equipment was delivered to the Port of Mogadiscio and received by the Procurement
Officer. The equipment was not unpacked and therefore compliance with specifi-
cations, missing parts, damages, etc. were not checked on arrival. The equipment,
boxed or crated, was stored in Mogadiscio and sent to the corresponding institution
with a notice not to be unpacked until the buildings were completed. The equip-
ment as such was received by the principal of the school or the regional authori-
ties, who signed a protocol.
3.17    Ccmmittees were nominated by the Ministry of Education to receive the
equipment. The committees consisted of one representative of the PIT, one
engineer from the Ministiry of Education and three science teachers. Committees
went to each project school or institution, unpacked the equipment, and handed
it over to the principal or to local authorities. As far as it is known, no items



- 48 -
of equipment have been rejected for not conforming to the specifl-cations, which
were not available on the spot. The transportation from port tc project school
was paid for by Government funds and the equipment was not ins-ared. The above
procedure (from arrival at port to handing-over to the project ir-stitution) meant
that the equipment was not checked (for compl`.ance with orders and specifications,
damages and missing parts) at the port of entry. These checks -were done months
or years after delivery because most of the project buildings were completed
much later than the arrival of equipment.  At that time no claims for damages
could be made because equipment was no longer at the port of arrival and the
insurance had expired. Control of quality (conformity with spec'fications)
depended on the committee member's involvement (if any) with the preparation of
the equipment list and their experience and knowledge with regard to different
types of equipment.
3.18    Furniture lists were prepared by the PIU procurement officer on the basis
of the working sheets and actual drawings. The drawings and specifications pre-
pared for the First Education Project were used in this project, No estimates
of cost were made. The first package of furniture went to inte-'rational competi-
tive bidding and was won by a Somali firm. Procedures for tendering and approval
were the same as those described for equipment. Eight contracts for furniture
were signed in total: one was awarded to a Somali firm after international
bidding; four were awarded to the Custodial Corps (a Government agency) directly,
without tendering, because the agency had the required timber available, which
was not the case with local contractors whose capacities proved insufficient in
the preceding cases; two were awarded to local firms without tendering, and one to
a local firm after local tendering. The contract documents included:
-  contract agreement;
-  conditions of contract;
-  general furniture specifications;
-  sketch drawing of furniture with a
description of materials.
3.19    The furniture produced under the first contract was received by the
PIU architect. All the rest was received by the procurement officer or his
assistant. During this procedure, no specialists (school furniture designer,
educator, technician) were involved in the preparation of the lists, the definition
of requirements (specifications), the control cf the manufacturing or the final
reception and quality control. The general furniture specifications are very
brief and incomplete and the contracts do not include the obligation of the
contractor to produce prototypes for approval, which is necessary when no
detailed drawings and specifications exist, as was the case for t-is protect.
Finally, quality control at the reception of the finished product was not
possible because of the non-existence of specialized, experienced personnel
(technicians).
3.20    Maintenance of the school buildings is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Education.  In the Mogadiscio region, small and major renairs are carried out
by the School Building and Maintenance Section of the Ministry of Education.
In other regions, the Regional Education Officer is responsible for urgent small-
scale maintenance. Maintenance plans and/or maintenance instructions and guide-
lines for the project buildings have not been prepared.

B.   BANK PERFORMANCE
3.21 The Project benefitted from 13 Supervision missions and 4 Development
missions covering the period December 1974 to March 1981. These missions
consumed a total of 207 man-days, 41 of which were for the Development missions.
(See Annex 15)
3.22    The Development missions were concerned with analyses and recommendations
for two aspects of the Projeet: the conception and implementation of the Nomadic
Training Centres, especially in the context of the rehabilitation of drought
areas; and the situation in technical and vocational education with special
emphasis placed on training for the fishery and marine industries. Several of
these missions were staffed by outside specialists. Their reports are informa-
tive and useful. One of them on the establishment of the NTCs was particularly
perspicacious.  With hindsight, it is clear that the performance of this project
item would have been greatly enhanced had the findings and recommendations in
the report been taken seriously into account. We can only speculate as to why
this did not occur.
3.23    The Supervision missions occurred at regular intervals of two per year
and benefitted from good staff continuity.  Tne missions reviewed implementation,
procurement and disbursement schedules and compared the progress made to the
terms stated in the Appraisal mission report. At times, they visited some of
the project sites and looked into educational aspects of the Project as well as
technical assistance. For example, in 1979 a Supervision mission visited the
three secondary schools in the north that were visited by the Completion mission.
Most of the construction for the schools had been completed in 1978, and the
Supervision mission noted the problems: poor construction, lack of water and
electricity, and poor and improper use of the science and workshop equipment due to
the quality (i.e. poor training) of the teaching staff. Analogous problems and
serious substantive remarks were made for other items. However, these problems
remained, became compounded and then incorporated into the completed project
as observed by this mission.
3.24    This brings us to review some of the functions of the implementation
system concerning development of the physical and hardware aspects of the
project. Taking examples from the project, we shall compare what we could
legitimately expect from such missions with the actual outcomes. Below are
some of these expectations followed with the actual results:
(a) Adjustment of the initial (Appraisal) requirements to changes and
modifications in the substantive needs of the project. For example,
new schedules of accommodation were prepared for the Elementary Teacher
Training College and -the CETCs, but no action was taken concerning the
NTCs or the Fishery and Marine Institute.
(b)  Adjustment or modification of the initial plans to ensure designs and
construction appropriate to the field conditions as they become apparent
during implementation. For example, consider the low quality and
scarcity of building materials, the lack of qualified manpower, insufficient
staff for supervision and design modification and transportation diffi-
culties.  Ir this case, no major conceptual changes were made.
(c) Monitoring, guidance and provision of information and documentation during
the design process, as well as during the construction of civil works
and the production Df furniture. For example, control of detailing,



- 50 -
specifications and structural design, staff training at the PTU, provision
of guidelines, development of guidelines for manufacturing of furniture
and procedures for its delivery.
(d)  Establishment of procedures for cost control (not only accounting) and
the collection of data for the purpose of implementation and evaluation.
For example, there are no contractor's diaries, unit costs of implementa-
tion are not known, and there are differences in the cost figures provided
by the procurement officer and engineer and those of the accountant.
3.25    Tnis mission can only conclude that the problems ascertained by the
Supervision missions never became objects for remedial action on the part of the
Government.
3.26    The main lesson to be learned from this experience is that, in addition
to supervision missions and related correspondence, the implementation system
should establish means to ensure that remedial actions identified will promptly
and definitively be carried out.  In this case, some elements of technical
assistance incorporated into the project could have served this purpose. Future
projects certainly should include provisionis to this effect.
C.   COSTS AND FINANCING
Apraisal  site
3.27    At Appraisal, the estimated total project cost was US$ 10.1 million and
the foreign exchange component US$ 6.1 or 60 per cent of the total cost.
According to the Credit Agreement, USt$ 8.0 million were to be financed by the
Credit and US$ 2.10 million by the Somali Government (counterpart funds).
Actual Costs
3728    The mission had difficulties in establishing the actual cost because of
different figures provided by different sources. In fact, the total project
cost by category of expenditure differs between the PIU accounts and those of
the Association. The latter, based on received applications for reimbursement,
ls lower than the cost accounted for by the PIU. It is assumed that the
difference is due to non-submission of all claims for reimbursement.
7.29    Differences also exist between the total costs of civil works, furniture
and equipment as appearing in the PIU accounts and those provided by the project
engineer (civil works) and the procurement officer (furniture and equipment) for
each item.
7.70    In the case of civil works, the accountant's figure is higher than that
provided by the project engineer which is based on the contract cost of each
item. It is assumed that additional cost not included in the contracts but
related to construction were accounted for by the PIU.
7.31   TIhe difference between the accountant's figures and those of the procure-
ment officer can oe attributed to the fact that the latter calculated:



51 -
(a)  the cost of furniture on the basis of unit costs and standard lists
for each item of the project; and
(b)  the cost of equipment on the basis of the letters of credit of the
various orders, The accountant's figures are based on actual payments
which include differences and changes in the exchange rates (equipment)
and refer to contracts which include various types of furniture for a
number of project items.
3.32    In the case of furniture costs, the difference between the accountant's
figures and those of the IDA can be attributed to the non-submission of all claims
for reimbursement, e.g. the last application was only partly reimbursed because
the limit of the credit; was already reached (application for US$ 127,000, of which
US$ 37,000 were reimbursed).
3.33    The mission considered that the actual cost of the project is what the
Government spient on it, including the credit funds, independent of whether or not
this expenditure corresponds to the applications for reimbursement submitted to
the Association. (Tab-.es la and 3a are included for comparative purposes only.)
Therefore, the PIU accounts figures were used for the calculation of the actual
costs in this report. In fact, the Government spent even more than what was
accounted for by the P:13 if we only consider the case of ETT1C civil works, whose
cost was only partly f:Lnanced by the Project, Item A.23, whose building was con-
structed but not included in the project and the NTC Guriel, Item A.29, whose
civil works were only partly financed by the project because its construction was
not completed on time.
3.34    Annex 19:  'Cornparative Table of Costs' shows:
(a)  the differences 'between the PIU and Association figures, as well as those
between the PIJ and the project engineer's and procurement officer's;
(b)  the 'corrected cost' of furniture and equipment of each item.  This cost,
based on procurement officer's figures (the only figures available by item)
has been adjusted proportionally (see column 4 for furniture and equipment:
'Actual Cost, Corrected') in order to compensate for the difference in
total cost as it was actually accounted for.

3.36    As shown in Table 1 above and in Annex 17, the actual project cost was
USS 11.89 million as against US$ 10.10 million forecast with contingencies, or
about 18 per cent over the Appraisal estimate. The reasons for the overrun
cannot be attributed as much to the changes made to some project components as
to an increase in the cost of certain components which could not be foreseen at
the time of Appraisal. The up-dated Appraisal Cost Estimate (see Table 2) shows
that even without any changes, the overrun would be 20 per cent (compared with
18 per cent of the actual overran).  This is further confirmed by the fact that
components which had no major changes had a higher overrun:
-  Academy of Somali Studies              -76%
- Secondary Schools and
Marine and Fishery Institute            18%
compared to components whose contents were changed during Implementation:
- Elementary Teacher Training
College                          :       3%
-  Nomadic Training Centres         :       4%
The main elements of the cost overrun were the increases in the cost of:
(a)  Academy of Somali Studies                :       (US$ 236,000)
(b)  Nomadic Training Centres and
Community Education and Training                 (US$ 214,000)
Centres
(c)  Secondary Schools                        :       (US$ 538,000)
(d)  Project Administration                   :       (US$ 246,000)
Civil Works Costs
3.37    The actual construction costs amounted to 66 per cent of the total cost
of the project compared to 69.5 per cent of the Appraisal (including contingencies)
and exceeded Appraisal estimates by 12 per cent, which is comparatively low com-
pared to the overall increase of the cost; of the project and to the unexpected
general increases of cost which took place between 1973 and 1981.
Furniture and Equipment
3.38    Furniture accounted for 9.4 per cent of the overall cost compared with
6 per cent estimated at Appraisal, including contingencies. Total expenditure
for furniture was US$ 1,115,000, or 85 per cent over Appraisal estimates.
Equipment accounted for 15 per cent of the overall cost compared with 16 per cent
estimated at Appraisal, including contingencies. Total expenditure for equip-
ment was US$ 1,782,000, or 8 per cent over Appraisal estimates.  The increase
in the cost of furniture is not due to an increase of quantity but, mainly, to
the high cost of the local industry combined with the absence of any competitive
market. Cost increase of equipment was relatively low because equipment lists
were cut down to keep costs within the allocated amounts.

Built Areas
3.39    A comparative analysis of planned and built areas is given in Annex 17.
Trne total built area has exceeded the total planned area by 19 per cent. The
component which had the highest increase was the Elementary Teacher Training
College, with 77 per cent; over the Appraisal estimates and the component with the
lowest increase was the Academy of Somali Studies-with a 2 per cent increase.
Student Places
3.40    The number of student places was increased by 64 per cent over Appraisal
estimates mainly because of the increase in the student places of the Elementary
Teacher Training College and the change of three Nomadic Training Centres to
Community Education and Training Centres with an increased student place
capacity.
Unit Costs
3.41    The cost per sq.nm of construction ranges from a considerable low of
us$ 55 (Ber WTC) to a hi;h of US$ 238 (Academy).!/. The average cost per
sq.m of the General Secondary Schools and of the Nomadic Training Centres
(including CETCs) is lower than that of the Appraisal estimates, while the cost
per sq.m for the Fishery and Marine Institute and the Academy of Somali Studies
have exceeded that of the Appraisal by 43 and 80 per cent respectively.
3.42    The average actual cost per student place of the secondary schools is
US$ 2,060 (Appraisal: U13$ 1,821), for the Nomadic Training Centres and CETCs
it is US$ 3,032 (Appraisal: US3$ 2,962), and for the Fishery and Marine
Institute it is US3$ 2,827 (Appraisal: us$ 1,905). These unit costs are not
comparable to costs of other institutions in the region because they represent
either additions (workshops and laboratories in the case of secondary schools)
or innovative projects (ITCs and CETCs) or specialized facilities (Fishery
and Marine Institute). However, it is interesting to note that costs per student
place for projects in the Eastern Africa region (FY.74-FY.77) were:
- US$ 1,654   (Diversified Education and Teacher Training).
- US$ 3,100   (Non-University Technical/Vocational and
Agricultural).
Implementation Schedule and Disbursements
3.43    Annex 4 presents a comparative analysis of the Implementation schedule,
and the final disbursement schedule is given in Table 7 above. At the time of the
original closing date (July 1980), 90 per cent of the Loan Allocation had been
disbursed. The loan amoant is now fully disbursed except for US$ 84,ooo, which
was cancelled.  The yearly allocation of capital counterpart funds and the actual
expenditure is given in Table 6.

CONCLUS'IONS: ISSUES AND RZCOPr11=4TICNS
Introduction
4.01    This Chaoter will be devoted to conclusions the mission has drawr., based on
observations and analysis of the situation of the Second Education Project in
its context. The following paragraphs are written in a spirit of constructive
evaluation with the intention that the lessons learned from this project can be
put to fruitful use for others. It should be noted that the points mentioned
below are additional to those brought up at the end of the discussion of each
project component in Chapter II where we mentioned specific conclusions relative
to the respective component. Therefore, the statements in this chapter can be
thought of as a synthesis of -the mission's evaluative work and judgement.
A. CONCERNING TME PROJEcr CYCLE
4.02    In addition to the full presentation in the preceeding chapters, the
reader should refer to two summary tables: the table on the attainment of
project objectives in paragraph 2 of the Summary, and the table that presents
an overview of the project at completion in paragraph 2.05.
Formulation
4.03    The salient aspects of the formulation of this project are the following:
(a)  There was only one mission to cover both the Preparation and the Appraisal
of the project. Th:Ls short-cut approach meant that less time and thought
were given to various aspects of the formulation of the project.
(b) This project contained two innovative components - the development of the
national language for instructional purposes and the non-formal education
of nomads - with wh:Lch the Bank had no prior experience.
(c) Some parts of the project (especially the secondary schools) were
continuations of the First Education Project.
4.04    Given these considerations as well as the main body of our observations,
the mission suggests that the following lessons could be learned from the
experience of this project as concerns the formulation phase of the project
cycle-
(i)  Any project component requires a quick feasibility study taking into
consideration the risks and benefits involved so as to avoid placing
ar. unnecessary burdein upon Member States; particularly with regard to
costs involved in a large scale implementation; readiness to conceptualize
and develop the proposal and operative capacity of the institutions
responsible for the execution;
(ii) Components which are new or for which no experience exists in the
country need to be prepared in detail by the local institutions concerned.
The project precaration document should include a part on the development



- 66 -
ar.d conceptualization activities of such components. The short-cut
Preparation/Appraisal approach should be discouraged in such cases.
(iii)  Components that are intended to be a continuation of on-going Bank
projects should be evaluated before extension is granted. The evaluation
should look at the large-scale implementation costs and resources
availa'le.
(iv)  Components of different projects which are intended to be for the same
or similar tarGet groups (adults, nomadic, settled, etc.) should be
evaliated before preparation to see if -they can be integrated for multi-
purpose use. rTis might entail minor modifications of the existing
comronents and the proposed new ones.
(v)  In countries like Somalia, more emphasis on the preparation of Design
Guidelines (standards and norms) should be included in the request
document (Preparation Document).
(vi)  Quality co-ordination should be includedl in the preparation of the
project.  in the case of this prDject, there were serious incongruities
between the cual it of the science and pre-vocational teacher, and
that of the labor2atory and workshop the project was equipping. This
would also hold for the level of curriculum development in these areas.
(vii)  Project formulation should attempt a realistic assessment of the
Borrower s ability to regularly allocate resources for maintenance.
Furthenitore, an assessment should be made (based on existing examples
and other available experience) of the likelihood of maintenance ef'  .
Development and Implementation
4.05    The most salient issues concerning this phase of the project cycle were
the following:
(a)  Again, the innovative aspect of two of the items.  Of special concern
are the NTCs conceived for the nonformal training and education of the
nomadic population. There was no precedent for this type of project and,
therefore, no real experience or expertise. This was the case both in
Somalia and in the Bank.
(b)  Super-ision missions, although frequent, did not seem to be effective
in controlling and improving the quality of the implementation of the
project.
(c)  Within the Project Implementation Unit there appeared to be a lack of
coordination with concerned departments of the Ministry of Education,
as well as other ministries. This was especially felt in the implementa-
tlon of the educational aspects of the project.
4.06    Given these considerations, the mission suggests the following lessons
could be learned:
(i)  If components are to try new approaches, provision must be made to
ensure that rew ideas and analyses are brought in at early stages of
deveLopment. All potentially relevant experience needs to be brought to
the attention of those involved in project implementation.
(ii)  New and experimental components need to be varied in approach and
design. If the NTCs ever become operational they cannot be compared
with anything else, as all five Centres are the same.  Built-in



- 67 -
evaluative mechanismis are of particular importance here if there is any
hope of implementation on a larger scale.
(iii)  In order for Supervision missions to influence the quality of project
development and implementation, they need to look into the following
areas:
(a) the enforcement and compliance of lending agreements and covenants;
(b)  disbursement and accounting;
(c) the quality and appropriateness of the physical aspects being
developed and implemented (design and construction);
(d)  the quality and appropriateness of the educational aspects being
developed and implemented.
At the begirnning of the project (c) and (d) should be emphasized,
and at the end (a) and (b) should be emphasized.
(iv) It is conceded/realized that the duration of, and intervals between,
Supervision missions offer too short a time to have sufficient impact
on project implementation and, particularly, the required follow-up.
Therefore, an adequately-sized component of technical assistance,
including counteroart training, would appear most appropriate in order
to avoid, to the extent possible, failures and deficiencies.
(v) Supervision missions should identify the issues, propose development
assistance missions as well as government remedial actions and modifi-
cations, and follow up on the issues until solved or resolved.
(vi)  Since there was a -unit responsible to the Bank in regard to the implemen-
tation of physical facilities, Govermment units should also have been
established and made responsible for the development and implementation
of the educational aspects (curricula development, textbooks, teaching
materials, equipment lists, etc.) and technical assistance.
Project Management, Operations and Performance
4.07    The most important findings of the mission concerning project management
are the following:
(a)  There were no liaison officers (project educators) in the PIU concerned
with the pedagogical aspects of the project.
(b)  There was a certain rigidity in the project that has led to waste.  For
example, the fact that many of the science laboratories and workshops are
not being used. and the vast under-utilization of the NTCs. With some
imagination, plus a spirit of flexibility with respect to the terms of
the Appraisal, modifications could have been made during the course of
the proJect.
(c)  The PIU appeared to have a workload beyond its capacities for effective
and efficient management of the project.  This might be related to some of
the problems observed in the monitoring of the construction.
(d)  There was little coordination between the educational objectives of the
project and the educational realities of the country. For example,
the quality of science teaching was severely hampered by the lack of
we'l-trained science teachers, and the workshops were never used due to
a severe shortage of teachers.



- 68 -
(e)  There were serious problems in the quality of buildings and furniture,
as well as in that of the equipment when it arrived    the intended
schools.
(f)  The PIU policy was to keep itself away from the operation of the project
components, as well as from their physical maintenance.
(g)  It was observed that the personnel in the schools were frecuently rotated.
Rarely did the mission find a school principal who hat been in his
present position for more than two years.
4.o8    The mission concludes that the following points summarize the lessons
that could be learned from this phase of the project cycle:
(i) The Project Unit should be required to have a liaison officer to look
into the educational aspects of the project components and ensure that
new demands and requirements are feasible within the limits of the
project and that they can be integrated into the component.
(ii) The Project Unit should formulate changes within the limits of the project
and liaise with the Association so that the original working sheets respond
to new educational demands and requirements.
(iii) Just as there is a chapter on management procedures and standards to
implement the physical aspects of a project, an effort should be made to
outline working procedures and standards to implement the physical aspects
of a project, an effort should be made to outline working procedures and
standards to implement educational aspects and technical assistance.
(iv) It would be desirable to make realistic estimates of the PIU's workload
and its capacities when several projects are being implemented at the
same time.
(v) Procedures should be developed in the areas of quality control, storage,
delivery and installation of procured furniture and equipment. For example,
equipment was found that had been ordered, cdelivered, stored and, finally,
unpacked after the insurance policies had expired. Because of this, the
insurance on damaged materials was of no use.
(vi) Also, site supervision of the construiction quality of the physical
facilities and the civil work need to be ensured. A little effort in
this direction could go a very long way and, based on our observations,
make the difference between a building that will last and one that
becomes quickly unusable.
(vii) For any evaluation of the project to be successful, it should be built in
to the project development, implementation and operation.  Therefore, an
information system should be developed capable of generating data indica-
ting the changing needs of the project and help in monitoring the imple-
mentation. This could be linked-in with the periodic Supervision mission
and on-site inspections.
(viii) Frequent changes and rotations in the teaching staff (including school
principals) is a major problem that severely undermines the efficiency of
the system. The Government should attempt to retain staff in post for a
minimum of two years.
(ix) Before the components are completed, a detailed plan of operations of
the new facilities needs to be prepared by the Governent' in accordance
with modifications introduced during implementation.



- 69 -
Pro4ect Costs and Financing
4.09    The major findings of the mission concerning costs and financing are
the following:
(a) There was not sufficient flexibility in requesting reallocation of funds
during implementiation, especially for the more innovative items of the
project.
(b)  The estimated costs of construction were those of the bids submitted
(generally, based on bids for the first project).  Experience shows that
bid prices are usually low and that the real implemented costs are much
higher than the bids. Furthermore, in a limited market situatlor., bid
prices tend to be stretched upward once the contract is awarded.
(c) Recurrent costs were never realistically estimated.
(d)  There were no procedures for cost control.  Furthermore, there was a
discrepancy between the costs as shown by the accountant and those of
the project engineer, and procurement officer.
4.10    Given these findings, the mission submnits the following points that
could be considered in future work:
(i) Greater flexibility between Appraisal and Implementation would be bDene-
ficial.  For example, when new or unusual components are part of a projec'JI
the cost estimates should be global rather than specific, as is done in the
working sheets. This way, governments have some leeway for creativity
and development. Also, the unallocated funds for these particular ccm-
ponents should be significant enough to be able to cope with unexpected
increases once a component has been conceptualized and costed.
(ii) The estimated unit cost should be based on actual construction costs at
the time of Appraisal.  These costs should be based on the experierce of
the PIU, other government agencies and private enterprises. This would
avoid the under-estimation that may occur in the bidding process,
(iii) The recurrent costs should be based on the compounded cost of various
components and adjusted to local prices. For example, in this prcoect
the boarding costs of the NTCs are prohibitive and totally out of line
when compared to those of secondary schools.
(iv) There should be procedures for cost control which are distinct from.
the accounting process.
B.   PHYSICAL FACILITIES
Locations and Sites
4.11    Locations of all project items respond in general to the criteria
established for their selec-tion. In the case of the Dujuma CETC, the population
moved to other settlement areas and, for this reason, it was found necessary to
add boarding facilities (no-t irncluded in credit).  The sites are, ir general,
adequate in size and accessible by car.



- 70 -
Design and Construc-.ion
4.12    In general, the plans of the various project items have interpreted the
requirements described ir the working sheets more or less faithfully, but in a
very elementary manner.  The various buildings were designed as juxtapositions of
rooms equipped with the essential elements such as doors, windows and roofs. The
spacial organizaticnt, both of the layouts and of the buildings themselves,
responds to essential recu-.n.Ienots but shows no effort to improve functionality,
flexibility and exrandabillty., or to create better physical environments, con-
sidering the climate of the country. Users' requirements such as suitable
learniing a.nd physical en;inronmen%ts responding tc the pedagogical and biological
needs (suitable interior arrangements, acoustics, illumination and ventilation,
sun protection, etc.) have not played an important role in the design.
4.13    The use of building materials and the detailing of the buildings show
no attempt at innovation, nor do they show concern for appropriateness of existing
materials, possibilities for alternate construction methods or maximum value for
money. Buildings are designed as if they were to be built with the best quality
materials and by the best craftsmen. Detailing is inadequate and much is left
to the contractor's interpretation.  Efficiency and practicality, in many cases,
are sacrificed for doubtful "aesthetic" effects.
4.14    Construction is characterized by low-quality materials, poor workmanship
and inadequate supervision. A numzber of materials are inappropriate for the
physical conditions of the building's environment, the level of the workmanship
and the use oL the building.  IEhe result is deficient buildings with non-functioning
electrical and water installations, which now require repairs, and in the future
will require continuous and expensive maintenance.
4.15    If design can be blamed for buildings which do not ensure the appropriate
educational and physical environment, it can equally be blamed for buildings with
deficient construction and operation and maintenance problems. Low-quality
materials, lack of qualified technicians, poor contractors' organization, shortage
of qualified supervising staff and other difficulties should be taken into account
in the design:  buildings should be designed for real conditions, and not for
ideal ones.
4.16    However, efficient and appropriate design is not possible unless all
requirements are carefully studied and clearly defined.  These requirements include
the educational. architectural, functional and technical requirements, the cost
elements and, finally, the professional staff (qualifications, number and
specialities). An initial study, before the preparation of the design study of the
protect buildings, should include:
(a) An assessment of the present situation in terms of existing materials
(local and imported), building mei:hods, technicians and skills available,
contractors' organization, availability of materials and maintenance
problems, comparative costs, etc.  Climatic and environmental conditions
should also be examined as well as hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
termites, etc.
(b) An assessament of the edicational, pedagogical and functional require-
ments of the dIfferent types of institutions and spaces of these insti-
tutions includi4- space norms, climatic and environmental requirements



- 71 -
(sun protection, ventilation, acoustics, artificial and natural illumina-
tion), furniture ard equipment requirements, and services (water and
electricity).
4.17    Tne final product of this study should be a document which will define:
(a)  the general requirements (Design Guidelines) concerning the type of
construction, materials, building methods, cost, etc., the space norms,
the different types of accommodation and their requirements (planning,
functional relationships, environmental requirements, furniture,
equipment, services, etc.);
(b)  the specific requirements of each project institution (Architect's Brief),
i.e. a detailed description of the required accommodation and related
facilities (furniture, equipment, services, etc.).
4.18    The next important item in the implementation of the physical facilities
component of the project is the assessment of the needs in terms of professional
staff, the selection and appointment of the required number and specialities and,
finally, and most important, the backstopping of that staff with documentation
and information and, if' necessary, with training courses and visits.
4.19   Tne conclusion is that more human and financial resources should be
invested in the design stage and particularly in the preparatory stage of the
definitior. of the recquirements and initial studies.  This investment is highly
productive (a) because it results in savings to construction, operation and
maintenance costs, and (b) it serves all subsequent school building projects
financed either by external or internal sources.
Furniture
4.20    The furniture supplied to the project buildings is of sub-standard
quality and expensive as well. It cannot have a life span of more than three
to four years, thus becoming even more expensive.  If school furniture has to
be manufactured locally, the question is whether the possibilities for design,
manufacturing and quality control exist. If not, they have to be developed and
be given equal attention as with the design and construction of buildings.
Quality control is an important part of the procedure and requires clearly-defined
criteria and qualifiesd staff.
Equipment
4.21    Equipment in general was ordered on time and arrived in the country
before the completion of the buildings. This had the advantage of savings on
cost increases due to inflation. This procedure is beneficial to the project
provided that the infrastructure exists for handling the equipment from the
arrival at the port until the delivery to the project buildings. This infrastruc-
ture includes not only the appropriate storage facilities, but particularly
experienced and qualified staff and management. If this infrastructure does not
exist, it has to be created with assistance provided by the project.



- 72 -
Maintenance
4.22    There is no evidence of maintenance or provision for maintenance in
any of the project buildings except for the Academy of Science and Arts. A
certain degree of maintenance could be ensured if:
(a) maintenance considerations were included as an important design
requirement (allowance, if possible, of higher cost in some cases);
(b) maintenance programmes and guidelines were prepared for the use of the
school directors, local authorities, ministry services, etc.;
(c)  a mechanism for the establishment of maintenance budgets in every
institution was studied and created.

OBSRVATONS ON PROJECT SCHDOOLS VISITED
SECONDARY SCHOOLS
The mission visited six of the ten general secondary schools included
in the project. The visits included discussions with the school Principal and
the science teachers1 and an extensive tour of the physical facilities whose
construction, furniture and equipment were firanced by the project.  In each
of the schools visited the Second IDA Project financed the construction and
equipment of two science laboratories (physics and chemistry/biology) and three
pre-vocational workshops (domestic science, woodworking, and either handicrafts
or agriculture).
Sheikh Ali Jowhow Secondara School, Borais
Thia school has suffered from the double disadvantage of being in a
war and an earthquake zone.  The school has 624 students and there are two
other secondary schools in the immediate vicinity, one general secondary school
with 350 students and one newly-opened agricultural secondary school with
91 students. There are 14 permanent teachers, three of whom are science teachers,
plus four national service teachers. This makes for a student/teacher ratio of
34:1 in a school whfere the average class size is 44.6.
Curriculum
The school follows the standard curriculum that includes no vocational
training. Each one of the 14 classes has three hours of cheristry, physics
and biology a week, including one hour of laboratory work for each subject.
Students have Somali language textbooks for all subjects.
Facilities
(a) The agricultural laboratory has been transformehd into a biology
laboratory and the domestic science room is used for storage.
The school has enough classrooms but lacks chairs and tables;
(b) the physics laboratory is furnished and equipped but shows sigas
of little maintenance with some equipment not used and some in
a state of disarray. It is used 14 hours a week for labwork.
(c)  the chemistry laboratory is in a poor state of repair with bird-
droppings on all the equicment. Scales are not unpacked and the
storeroom equipment materials are scattered around. It is used
14 hours a week for labwork.
(d) the biology laboratory is, at present, not in use due to damage
to the roof caused by a hailstorm about a year ago. The equipment
is poorly stored in another classroom.
(e) furniture is made of wood and does not appear to be sturdy. It is
doubtful whether the chemistry benches can resist water and acids
much longer;
(f) there is evidence that the laboratcry equipment is under-utilized.
Many items appeared to be not unpacked, the storerooms are poorly
arranged and ordered, Lack of water and electricity renders some
equipment unusable.

Student Flow
Promotion from Form I to Form II is automatic. Last year there were
only six repeaters in Forms II, III and IV and only two failures in the
Form IV examination. In the past three years there have been very few drop-
outs, although exact figures were not available.
Construction
(a) Water and electricity: there is no water supply. The electricity
is generated on site but there is no-one to operate the generator;
therefore, there is no electricity;
(b) buildings: appear sound but there are visible cracks, due to an
earthquake. There is no evidence of maintanance. One roof is in
poor condition due to a hailstorm;
(c)  furniture and equiprent:  all furniture is of wood and does not
appear solid. The lab benches are not likely to last for very long,
especially if they are in contact with acids and water. Some of the
equipment is still not unpacked, especially the scales and the more
advanced equipment.
Gebileh Secondary School, Gebileh
This is the only secondary school in the district although there are
plans to build more. The school has 495 students, 310 of whom are boarders.
The school is about three kilometres from the village and has suffered from
earthquakes and bombardment. There are 14 teachers and 10 classes making
for 49.5 students per class and a student/teacher ratio of 35.4:1.
Curriculum
This is a general secondary school with no vocational or technical
courses. Every class has three hours per week of each of the three scientific
subjects, including one hour of laboratory work. Students have Somali language
textbooks for all subjects.
Facilities
(a) The rooms built to be used as pre-vocational workshops are not
in use. In the agricultural workshops there are some tools and
implements stored in a corner which have never been utilized;
(b) in the Physics laboratory, lighting fixtures and parts of the
ceiling are falling down - this being the result of an air-raid
that took place in June 1981. The equipment is poorly stored and
some is still in its original packing. Theoretically, there
are ten hours of lab use per week, plus classwork.
(c) the chemistry/biology laboratory also shows evidence of the air-
raid. There are plenty of chemicals that are indifferently
stored. The furniture is unsturdy and some equipment has yet
to be unpacked (oven, flasks, beakers, etc.); this should be
used for a total of 20 hours per week for lab work.

Student Flow
Last year there were no repeaters in Forms I, II and III, and only
one in Form IV.
Construction
(a) Water and electricity: there is a well for the water supply but
no water available for the 3chools; there is, however, water for
the boarding facilities. There is electricity that is generated
on site and was supplying adequate current at the time of the
mission's visit.
(b)  bulding:  construction appears straightforward and austere but
has not resisted the effect of earthquakes and bombs. There were
several cracks in the walls and floors. There appears to be no
effort at maintenance of the structure. Also, there was not enough
natural lighting in the laboratories. The roofs were in a bad
state of repair and rubble was strewn all over the courtyards.
There was evidence of drainage problems plus slippage in the found-
ation, due to a bas  of sand.
(c) furniture and 2eui2sent: laboratory furniture is made of wood
with some metal-legged tables and chairs. It is in relatively
good condition but the wood surfaces are not likely to resist
prolonged use. For the school in general, there is much broken
furniture in evidence and, even classrooms with no chairs and
desks at all. The lab equipment is poorly stored, poorly
maintained and under-utilized. The furnaces are not correctly
installed in the chemistry lab, and other material found to be
still in its original packing.
26th June Secondary School, Hargeysa
This is one of five general secondary schools in Hargeysa which is
the second largest city in the country. There are also two technical secondary
schools. Most of the students live within walking distance (i.e. 20-min.) of
the school. The achool runs on two shifts with nine morning classes and four
in the afternoon. There are 13 classes in this school with no Form IV. There
are eleven teachers including one for Biology and Chemistry each, plus the
Principal whc teaches physics. There are 717 students making for a student/
teacher ratio of 65:1 and an average of 55.2 students per class.
Curriculu.m
The school follows the standard curriculum that includes no vocational
subjects and three hours of each scientific subject per week. Students have
Somali language textbooks.
Facilities
(a) Five classrooms were to have been remodelled to become workshops.
No work was done on these rooms which are, at present, being used
as classrooms.



Annex 1D
page 4.12
- 96 -
(b)  the biology/chemistry laboratory is not functioning.  Some equipment
is in a pile and there are scme chemicals.
(c)  the physics laboratory is not functioning and has its furniture
piled up and not yet installed.
(d)  the classrooms lack adequate furniture.  Tne laboratory furniture
is poorly made and of a certain wood that is unlikely to resist
water and acids.
Student Flow
Last year there was a total of four repeaters and 20 drop-outs.
Construction
(a)  Water and Electricity:  there is an adequate water supply from the
town pipes. However, there is no continuous supply of electrical
current for two reasons: firstly, there is often no current in the
city and, secondly, there is a defect in the school's electrical
system (the transformer is not working plus the wires are underground
and there is no diagram on their lay-out).
(b)  building:  the structure appears sound with no cracks.  The grounds
are not kept up, with garbage in ruts over the area. The anticipated
remodelling of the science labs has not been carried out and, in all,
there are five rooms not in use.
(c)  furniture and equipment:  there is no furniture in the biology/
chemistry lab and the furniture for the physics lab is placed in a
pile and not installed. It is of a type of wood that is unlikely
to resist the use of chemicals and water; also, it is poorly
constructed and unpainted. There is no equipment in the physics
lab and some can be found in the biology/chemistry lab that is
not in use and barely unpacked.
Hargeysa Technical School
This was not a project school but it has received the equipment destined
for the workshops of the project schools in the region. Ihis includes wood-
and metalwork equipment as well as some equipment for the domestic science
room. The equipment observed included handtools, lathes, drill presses, saws
and azn oven. The oven was placed outside, half-unpacked and the machinery
installed in a room not closed to the outside and, therefore, open to dust and
sand. Indeed, a fair amount was already in evidence on the machinery.
Further,ore, the electrical supply to the schocl is not enough to operate
this machinery effectively.
This technical school had been a general secondary school until this
year and the transition to technical education is, at present, underway.

Hamar Secondary School, Mogadiscio
The project financed the construction and equipment of two laboratories,
two workshops, two classrooms, a domestic science room and a lecture/social
studies room. The vocational/technical facilities have been transferred to
Hamar Technical School. These facilities are, at present, empty and will be
turned into classrooms. There are two shifts in this school with 1,055 students,
18 classes and 44 teachers, including 12 science teachers (four for each subject).
Of the 44 teachers, ten are doing their national service and are without
professional training. We have, therefore, a student/teacher ratio of 24:1
(including the national service teachers) and an average of 58.6 students per
class. Most of the students come from the surrounding area and walk to school.
Student Flow
Last year there were only four repeaters and two who failed the Forn IV
examination. Five students dropped-out.
Curriculum
The standard academic curriculum with no vocational subjects. All classes
have three hours of each scientific subject per week, including one hour of
laboratory work. Students have Somali language textbooks.
Facilities
(a) The lecture and social studies room is to be used as a general
lecture room and meeting room. At present, it is not in use;
(b) the metal and woodwork shops are, at present, empty and will be
used as classrooms;
(c) the home economics room is used as a canteen;
(d) the commerce room is used as a classroom;
(e) the auditorium is used as a storeroom.
Construction
(a) Floors: cement screed 50 to 80 per cent disintegrated, probably
from lack of adequate cement;
(b) ceilings: hardboard ceilings in various spaces including external
walkways destroyed or stained from 20 to 50 per cent, due to leakage
of rainwater;
(c)  windows:  glass louvers of Naco-type windows are broken 40 to 50 per
cent in classrooms, 12 per cent in biology laboratory, 2C per cent in
physics laboratory and 75 per cent in workshops;
(d) doors: a great number of doors attacked and destroyed by termites;



Annex 10
page 6/12                               - 98 -
(e) blackboards: made of olastif'ied (on one side) paper, l-Mm thick,
framed with wood and not glued to wall.  In many cases, paper
blackboards are torn;
(f)  built-in furniture:  biology/chemistry workbench tops made with
roughly-cut hardboard, no finishing,  Cupboards in biology/chemistry
attacked by termites:  cupboaLrds in home economics also destroyed
by tenlites. 'Fue cabinet has an opening only towards laboratory
and not towards preparation room;
(g)  electrical installations: nearly all switches and outlets are
missing,  Light fixtures in most rooms and external walkways either
missing or disconnected or without fluorescent tubes. Classrooms
have no electric light because nearly all fixtures are either
disconnected or missing. The same applies to laboratories.
(h) water supply: the school is connected to the town water supply
network. However, no water is available during the day because of
low pressure. Laboratories have no water and toilets (old and new)
have been abandoned.
General Daud Secondary School, Mogadl.scio
This school has a total of 1.590 students in 29 classes and 57 teachers,
39 of whom are qualified and 18 doing their national service. This gives us
a student/teacher ratio (based on all 57 teachers) of 27.9:1 and an average of
54.8 students per class. There are eight science teachers, four in biology,
three in physics and two in chemistnr. At present, this school lacks enough
classrooms to meet the demand for Form I and from 1980/81 to 1981/82 the number
of Form I classes decreased from 14 to five. Also, many classes are overcrowded
with up to 70-80 students in one class. Most students live in the area
surrounding the school.
Curriculum
The standard academic curriculum with no vocational subjects. Every
class has three hours of each scientific subject per week with one hour of
laboratory work.
Student Flow
There were 38 repeaters in Forms 7I and I-  last year, and 25 failed
the Form; IV' examinaticn. Promotion from Form I to Form II is automatic.
There were 80 drop-outs.
Facilities
The home economics room is used as a canteen. The lecture and social
studies room is used as a classroom. The woodwork shop is used as a classroom
(students u3e woodwork benches as desks). The metalwork shop is not used at
all; the commerce room is used as a classroom. The biology laboratory did
not seem to be in use. Ablutions are not functioning for lack of water.



Annex 10
page 7: 12
- 99 -
Construction
The construction suffers from inappropriate design (i.e. roof with
inadequate slooe and parapet walls, gutters and down-spouts, obstructing the
free-flow of rainwater, Naco-type windows with glass louvers), low quality
materials and poor workmanship. Termite treatment of foundations was not
efficient and the oresence of termites (in the new parts of the school only)
is evident;
(a)  Roofs and ceilings:  roofs in many parts of the building have been
penetrated by rainwater, thus damaging the roof itself (ccmmerce
room, home economics room (this was very seriously damaged)) and
destroying the hardboard ceilings by varying degrees (metal workshop,
science lab and woodwork shop (heavily damaged));
(b)  windows:  glass louvers of Naco-type windows broken 30 to 40 per cent
in classrooms, 30 per cent in metal workshop, 10 per cent in woodwork
shop, 20 per cent in commerce rooms and home economics room;
(c) doors: a great number of doors attacked and destroyed by termites;
(d) furniture: all furniture foreseen for this school in the project has
been delivered but is not sufficient. Sixty-to eighty new chairs
are already broken;
(e)  electrical suuply:  the school is connected to the town network, but
new buildings have had no electricity for a year due to damage;
(f)  electrical installations and water supply:  same remarks as for
Hamar Secondary School.
Mohamed Abdulla Hasan Secondary School, Merka
Tnere are two general secondary schools in Merka and no vocational/
technical ones. This school has Forms II-IV and the other has only
Form I. The other secondary schocl had been a primary school but is now
being used for Form I classes due to the large increase in Form I enrolments.
The Mchamed Abdulla Hasan School has 6C9 students in 13 classes making for
an average of 46.8 students per class.  There are 240 boarders all of whom
are male. There are 27 teachers, three of whom are science teachers. The
student/teacher ratio is 22.6:1.
The sclool buildings are in two integrated parts with the IDA Project-
financed part housing seven rooms supposedly for workshops and science labora-
tories.  None of these rooms are used for instructional purposes.  One large
double room houses the regional educational offices and another double room
acts as storeroom for the schcol's unused books.  The workshop equipment
has been transferred to schools in Sablale, Kurtunwarrey and Bra,a ,There there
are technical schools. Tne science laboratories are in the older building.
It should be noted here that this is the only secondary schol in the region
(of whi_ch there are 11)  ith equipped science laboratories.

Curriculum
The standard academic curriculum with no vocational subjects.
Students have Somali language textbooks.
Facilities
(a) The biology/'chemistry laboratory has four solid benches, electricity
and water.  The equipment appears well used and the laboratory
properly maintained. The lab is used for 26 hours per week;
(b) the physics laboratory has four roughly-hewn benches and shows
signs of poor maintenance. There is rust on some of the equipment
(the school is about 2C0 metres from the beach). Some scales have
never been unpacked. The room is used 13 hours per week for
laboratory purposes.
Construction
(a) Electricity and water: there is an adequate water supply but the
electricity to the project part of the school was never connected.
The electrical supply comes from the town and is unreliable;
(b) building: the project building is of the same type as the older
part of the school. It is well constructed, showing little sign
of wear;
(c) furniture and equipment: the furniture appears sturdy and better
than that seen elsewhere. The lab bench-tops are of a hard material
that should support the wear of lab work. Some new furniture is
piled-up in a room. The blackboards are of good quality. The
equipment appears to be well-utilized. Scales in the physics laboratory
have yet to be unpacked but, in general, the equipment is in place
and in use.
Student Flow
Last year there were 19 repeaters and eigit drop-outs. There were
no failures in the Form IV examination.
NCMADIC TRAINING CENTRES A4D CC!MUNITY EIDUCATION AND TRAINING CE?rS
The mission visited one of the five Nomadic Training Centres, and two
of the three Community Education and Training Centres.  Tne visits included
discussions with the Centres' Principals and teachers, as well as an extensive
tour of the physical facilities.
Aboorey Nomadic Training Centre
The physical facilities of this Centre were completed by June 1979
and have been operational since December 1980.



page 9/1
- 101 -
Facilities
During the operation of the Centre (two courses of 42 days each up
until now), facilities are fully used for thse purposes for which they have
been designed. Between-courses facilities are not used. The health clinic
and veterinary room are used very little or not at all by the community
because they are not adequately equipped and staffed.  All buildings except
for kitchen-dining and administration blocks have their long sides facing
north or south while the prevailing winds in this area blow from east
(January-March) and west (July-August). Classroom net area per student place
(design capacity: 40) is 1.35 so.m. which is a very low standard, particularly
for Somali adults,
Construction
The construction is of load-bearing walls (local stone) with timber-
truss roof covered with C.I. sheets, cement plastered walls and cement screed
floors. The present state of construction is relatively better than that of
the Sablale and Kurtenwarrey C.E.T. Centres. Roofs, ceilings and floors are
in rather good condition. Electrical and sanitary installations, although
not perfect, are acceptable. The main problem here seems to be that of
termites'- 'Aboorey' meaning 'termite". - which have already attacked timbered
parts positioned on lower levels (doors, windows, cupboards) and there is
evidence that they are on their way to the rocf trusses.
The Centre is equipped with a generator and its water supply system
is connected to the community well, which is at a distance of 200 metres.
Water was not available at the time of the visit because the pump of the
community well had broken down, The access road (16 km. from the main road)
does not appear to be operational during the rainy season.
Sablale Community Education and Training Centre
The physical facilities were completed by December 1979 and they
have been operating since December 1980, accommodating a technical secondary
school. For this reason the facilities are not used for the purpose for which
they were planned, with the result that all spaces designed for community
education and training are either empty or used for other purposes. In detail,
the use of the facilities was found to be as follows:
- five classrooms used as such;
-  one classroom used as a storage room;
- carpentry shop has three workbenches, and is used as such
by the technical school students;
- building shop became metalwork shop and is used by technical
school students;

- hcme eccnomics: not in use:
- materinity and child welfare centre:
staff housing; one room used bY adults for sewing courses;
_ youth centre: Cl3sroom;
- library: storage;
one unit of sin3ie-teachers?flats is locked and not in use;
- abluti4ons: not in use.
Additional facilities consisting of one drafting room and three class-
rooms were added recently and they are not yet in use.  These facilities were
not financed for the Project Credit.
Construction
The construction is of bearing walls, timber-truss roof covered with
C.I. sheets, cement-plastered walls and sement-screed floors. Roofs have no
parapet walls and gutters, so rainwater runs freely. Materials used and
workmanship were very poor and buildings, 'Ln general, are in a very bad state
of repair:
(a) flocrs: most floors have cracks or holes. No Joints in internal
or external (covered walkways) floors;
(b) roof and ceilings: bats have entered in all roofs, resulting in
an appalling odour. Rainwater has entered through the roofs.
The result is that most ceilings have been destroyed (from 10 to
80 per cent in some rooms) either by the rainwater or by having
been opened in order to ventilate and spray against the bat problem;
(c) doors and windows: flush doors made of hardboard instead of plywood.
Ninety per cent of the ironmongery is rusted or broken;
(d) electrical installation: the generator was not yet installed.
Electricity was provided from the town network, but only for lighting
and not for the machines. The electrical installation suffers from
poor woricnanship. Artificial llhting is inadequately designed and
rost of the lighting fixtures, neon tubes, switches and outlets are
missing;
(e)  water su2       4ry and sanitaLr installations:  water was connected to the
houses and to the maternity-child welfare block. Plumbing and sani-
tary fixtures (wash-basins, toilets, bath tubs, faucets, etc.> are
broken or in a very bad state of repair;
(f) general: the home economics room is provided with two cooking corners,
each one equipped with a h,ocd rade of sheet metal withcut a frame.
Each hood is connected to a metal tubular flue which runs horizontally
outside the room without a vertical part. The maternity-child ,welfare
cooking room has no chriney.  Workshops are not equipped weith the
exception of four maohines and three benches in the carpentry shop,
2_ wrenches in the metal shocp and 12 sewing machines in one rocm of
the maternity-child welfare block.

Kurtunwar-rey Cc.=.iniW Bducatior. Centre
The zfysical  acilities were comoleted in 1979 and have been operating
since Novermner 19&C, accommodating a technical secondary school.  Tne remarks
made above for :.he use o. the facilities are also valid here.  In detail, the
use of the facilities was found to be as follows:
-  6 classrooms used as such;
-  carpentry shop has work bencnes and used for carpentry
by the tecnnical school students;
-  building shop now used for metalwork (fitting, bending,
sheet metal);
- building shed (now enclosed) serves as wurkshop;
- shoemaking shop: storage room;
- tailoring shop: used as classroom;
- electrical shop: has three shelves with tools and used
for furniture storage;
home economics room and youth centre:  not used - wind has
blown off the roof, and rains subsequently destroyed ceiling;
library:  used as storage room;
- maternity and child welfare unit: used for staff housing;
* ablutions: not in use.
Construction
Construction is similar to that of Sablale, but the present state is
even worse because of the additional hazard of alluvial swelling-type soil
which has caused, at least twice after heavy rains, very important cracks in
nearly all walls of the buildings, because of inappropriate foundations.
In addition, the roofing of the home economics and youth centre rooms was
blown off by the wind and ceilings were subsequently destroyed by the rain
and wind. A large part of the fence wall built with cement blocks has
collapsed after a strong wind.  Lack of joints and insufficient cement in
the mortar have probably made the wall less resistant. Another serious
problem is the termites, which have attacked timber on the lower levels
(doors, windows, cupboards) and there are signs that they are reaching the
roof timber frames:
(a)  floors:  holes, cracks and disintegrating cement-screed in most
of the rooms.  Lack of joints and cement.
(b)  roof and cei-inzs:  bats have entered t.e roof, as in Sablale.
^aly ceilings are leaking.  External covered walkways have hardbcard
ceilings which are in a very poor state of repair because of leakages.
(c) doors and windows: flush doors are made of hardboard instead of
plrcod.  ;-_st of thre.em are seriously destroyed by termites .wnich ;nave
also at-acked oth-er dccrs and windows.

(d)  electrical installatiar.s:  the generator is insstalled but only two
phases are used because the main cable (running along the ground,
unburied) is only 3-core instead of 4-core.  Workshop machines
cannot be used. There is not encugh petrol to run the generator
(15 litres per day).  7nstallations suffer from pocr wor&mnanship.
Artificial lignt is inadequately designed (i.e. five 5C cm. neon
tubes, 2C-watt each, in carpentry workshop).  Many lighting
fixtures, switches and outlets are missing.
(e)  water supply and sanitary installations:  the Centre has all internal
water supply installations completed, but it is not connected to the
water supply, (nearest well at a, distance of 1.5 an.). Water is
carried by lorries to a central cistern which is at ground-level and
covered   ith C.I. sheets.  Sanitary annd plumbing fixtures are, in
m=ny cases, badly installed and broken.
(f)  general:  hcods in hcme economics cooking areas, maternity-child welfare
cooking room and workshops equi-t.ent:  same observations as for Sablale.
The Centre has received 20 sewing machines.  A sewing course for women
is held not on the premises of the Centre, but in a room, situated in
the centre of town. All furniture foreseen in the project has been
received.

Furniture
Movable furniture for all project components was manufactured
locally with imported materials.
The materials used were steel sect:Lons (L-shaped, round and
rectangular tubes) for frames of chairs, doesks and tables, with hardboard
on timber frame for table desk tops, covered with formica, masonite-type
hardboard for chair seats and backs, and particle board. The quality of
furniture is, in general, very poor and the percentage of damaged furniture
is already increasing.
The reasons for poor quality can be summarized as follows:
(a) inadequate drawings (sketches with overall dimensions only)
and specifications;
(b) non-existence of details and drawings or prototypes;
(c)  non-compliance to specifications;
(d) poor workmanship and lack of supervision and quality control.
Some of the defects in the furniture were:
-  Steel frames:    defective bendlngs (round section tubes)
and weldings;
long tables with two pairs of steel legs
on each far erLd and not connected between;
steel members painted with one coat of
paint on untreated surface; in most cases
only v-isible parts painted.
-  Table and        hardboard covered with formica on one side
desk tops         only of rough wood frame instead of the
specified block- or particle-board laminated
with formica or similar on both sides.
Formica not well glued to hardboard.
- Chair seats       Made with masonite-type 5-rmm hardboard
and backs        instead of the specified laminated wood
or 10-mn plywood.
