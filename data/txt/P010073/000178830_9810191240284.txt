APPRAISAL OF THE
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
(POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project consisting of extensions to the
transmission and distribution facilities of the Ceylon Electricity Board
(CEB). The Project includes the construction of 490 miles of transmission
and distribution lines with associated substations, and distribution facili-
ties for Colombo.
ii.       The estimated cost of the Project is US$9.8 million equivalent,
including US$6.0 million in foreign exchange. An IDA Credit to cover the
foreign exchange component of US$6.0 million is proposed.
iii.      The facilities provided through the proposed Project are needed
to properly serve the expected market and are the most economic among the
alternatives proposed.
iv.       The Credit would be made to the Government of Sri Lanka and re-
lent to CEB at 7-1/4% interest and for a term of 20 years with three years'
grace. The CEB, created by the 1969 Ceylon Electricity Board Act in con-
sultation with the Bank, is a Government-owned corporation, responsible for
generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy throughout the
country. It has the engineering capability to handle design and construction
of the work involved under the Project and will be responsible for its im-
plementation. Procurement financed through the proposed credit would be
carried out in accordance with Association guidelines.
v.        With the agreements reached during negotiations, the Project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$6.0 million equivalent.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
(POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report. covers the appraisal of a Project for extensions of
the Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB) transmission and distribution network.
These extensions are necessary to fully utilize the power soon to become
available when two projects being constructed with Bank assistance are
commissioned in 1974.
1.02      The Government of Sri Lanka has requested an Association Credit
to finance the foreign exchange cost of the project amounting to US$6.0
million equivalent. The Project's total cost is estimated at US$9.8
million equivalent.
1.03      Four Bank loans for power development and one loan/credit for
an irrigation/power project have been made as follows:
(i) Loan 101-CE (US$15.9 imillion) in 1954 to help finance
the 25 MW expansion of the Laksapana hydroelectric
scheme;
(ii)  Loan 209-CE (US$7.4 million) in 1958 to help finance
construction of a 25 MW thermal plant at Grandpas,
Colombo;                                   /
(iii)  Loan 283-CE (US$14.1 million) in 1961 to help finance
a 25 MW expansion at Grandpas;
(iv)  Loan 636-CE (US$21.0 million) in 1969 to help finance the
90 MW Maskeliya Oya Stage II project, a 25 MW gas turbine
and management consultancy and engineering services.
US$4.5 million relating mainly to the gas turbine instal-
lation were subsequently cancelled; and
(v) Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE (US$29.0 million) in 1969 for
the multipurpose Mahaweli Ganga Development project of
which the 50 MW Polgolla power station forms a part.



-2-
The last two projects are currently under execution and work is proceeding
satisfactorily after some initial difficulties, mainly due to delays in
placing major contracts and subsequent delay in the supply of generating
equipment. The other power stations are in satisfactory operation and their
output should be adequate to meet system requirements until early 1974 by
which date the Maskeliya Oya project is scheduled to be commissioned.
1.04      CEB was established in July 1969 by the Ceylon Electricity Board
Act No. 17 of 1969 to replace the Department of Government Electrical Under-
takings (DGEU). Its operations have generally improved from a very low
level of efficiency during the last two years, but further effort is requir-
ed. In accordance with provisions of Loan 636-CE, Management Consultants are
presently engaged in the field of accounting and internal reorganization of
CEB to establish its technical and financial operations on more modern lines.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. K. Stichenwirth and C. K.
Chandran and is based on the findings of a mission to Sri Lanka in July 1972.
II. THE SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Sri Lanka covers an area of about 25,000 square miles and has a
population of 12.7 million growing at 2.4% annually. Its per capita GNP in
1970 was estimated at US$120 by the Bank's economic mission. It has no
large mineral deposits and its economy is largely dependent upon three
agricultural products, tea, rubber and coconuts. Its per capita consumption
of electricity, presently below 60 kWh, is among the lowest in the world.
2.02      In the 1960's there was no real economic growth due to exception-
ally poor market conditions for its two principal exports, tea and rubber.
The country now faces a difficult economic situation, mainly due to adverse
balance of payments and serious unemployment.
2.03      Reversal of the economic decline will depend both on improvement
of traditional exports and diversification of the economy. To this end,
measures are being introduced to electrify and modernize tea estates and to
develop new agricultural exports. New, export-oriented industries, based on
local labor and available raw materials, are also being considered, with
priority to be given to quick-yielding, labor-intensive and financially
productive schemes. An adequate electricity supply is basic to all these
initiatives.
Sector Organization
2.04      Electricity supply in Sri Lanka was initially developed by a
private company. In 1928 the Government purchased the assets of this company
and transferred them to the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings
(DGEU) which has since been, in effect, the national electricity authority



- 3 -
of the country. The Electricity Supply Act, 1950, as amended in 1957,
reserved all electricity generation and transmission to DGEU, which was
the retailer of electricity in most places also, but permitted local authori-
ties in some places to distribute and sell electricity. By 1969, DGEU's
service area had been extended to practically all major towns; but it had
by then become apparent that its organization was weak; it also lacked
independent authority in overall policy planning, financing and personnel
management. In an attempt to overcome these deficiencies, the Government
passed legislation in July 1969 creating GEB as a single autonomous entity,
responsible to the Minister for Public Works, Irrigation and Power, enabling
financial policies to be introduced which would clarify the application of
revenue and specifically provide for financing a reasonable proportion of the
cost of development of electricity services.
2.05      CEB fulfills its operational responsibilities adequately but its
financial management is weak and it does not have complete control of its
system planning because decisions on multipurpose water resource develop-
ment are made by other agencies. After these decisions are made CEB is
given responsibility for design and construction of the development's power
features. While the choice of developments has been acceptable (the Bank/
Association has assisted in their financing) the provisions for eventual
transfer of the value of power assets to CEB is vague and to prevent CEB
from having to assume an undue portion of such costs in the future, it was
agreed during negotiations that the methodology for determining the same
and the amount to be transferred should be acceptable to the Association
(paragraph 6.07).
Existing Facilities
2.06      Annex 1 shows the characteristics of CEB's eight existing power
stations. These provide a total capacity of 261 MW. Five are hydro stations
which together with the three thermal stations, generated a total of 833 GWh
in 1971. Existing plant is well maintained and, together with generating
capacity presently under construction (paragraph 2.10), should meet system
requirements until the end of 1975.
2.07      The transmission and distribution system is described in Annex 2.
The main transmission system at 132 KV has been well designed on the basis
of network analyzer studies.  It enables CEB's existing power stations to
be operated as an integrated power system.  The system has been planned to
facilitate expansion, mainly at 132 KV and 33 KV.
Power Market and Load Growth
2.08      In the early 1960's, the overall demand increased at an average
annual rate of 10.3%. However, during the economic slowdown in 1968-71,
the annual demand growth rate fell to about 9% (Annex 3). At the same
time, the industrial demand had been the most rapidly expanding sector of
the power market, increasing at an annual rate of about 18% between 1961
and 1968, and about 11% thereafter. With the commercial and domiestic con-
sumption maintaining a fairly steady low average growth rate of about 5.5%



-4-
between 1961-71, industrial consumption increased its share of total sales
from about one-third to more than half during 1961-71, becoming the most
important factor in assessing future overall load growth.
2.09      During the appraisal, the Government's plans for industrial expan-
sion over the next 4-5 years, which would have required annual generation
increases of about 18%, were reviewed with CEB and representatives of the
Ministry of Planning and Employment (concerned with the regulation of in-
dustrial development) and were judged as too ambitious in the present eco-
nomic situation of the country. In agreement with Government and CEB a
growth rate of about 13% annually was adopted as reasonable for planning
purposes. Although slightly higher than during the recent slowdown, this
growth rate is based on expected additional sales to existing major indus-
tries only, not taking into account planned new industry, the implementation
of which is not assured at present. Domestic and commercial sales are not
expected to increase above the low recent annual rate of about 5.5%; together
with the industrial growth rate of 13% an overall annual increase of 10% is
therefore projected (Annex 3).
The Development Program
2.10      Two hydroelectric stations are now under construction, the 90 MW
Maskeliya Oya Stage II station being financed under Loan 636-CE which is
expected to be commissioned in early 1974 and the 50 MW Polgolla station due
for commissioning in mid-1974. The power development program for the Second
Five-Year Plan (1972-76) includes two new hydroelectric projects to be com-
missioned by end 1975 and 1977 respectively. The first, Bowatenne, a 40 MW
station associated with the Mahaweli Ganga multipurpose project but carried
out by CEB, was appraised recently by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
an agreement for its financing has been reached. The timing and the means
of implementation of the second, the larger 120 MW station associated with
the Samanalawewa multipurpose project, have yet to be decided but CEB's
capital expansion planning makes provisions for both. The extensions of
the main 132 KV system that are necessary for these projects will be largely
provided by the proposed Project.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The 1969 Act under which the CEB was created (paragraph 2.04) does
not endow the company with all the authority normally expected with an
independent entity. Substantial Government role in important policy matters
such as borrowing power, setting of tariffs, and appointment of the General
Manager is provided for. The CEB has sole discretion only on matters of
day to day management. This is in line with Government policy for control-
ling important sectors of the economy.



-5-
Management Consultants' Study
3.02      The transition from a Government department (DGEU) to an autonomous
Board required total reorganization, establishment of a modern accounting
system and proper transfer and valuation of assets. This task required con-
sultants' assistance and, as a condition of Loan 636-CE the Government en-
gaged management consultants (Urwick International) to render advice on
these matters. The consultants' services were financed from the proceeds
of the loan.
3.03      In the course of their work the consultants have encountered
greater difficulties than expected when they began their assignment in
1970. Shortage of experienced CEB staff and the chaotic state of DGEU's
records caused the consultants to fall considerably behind the originally
estimated schedule (completion of the study by early 1971) and completion
of the management study is now expected by mid-1973. In the meantime, the
consultants' interim recommendations are being implemented step by step by
the CEB.
CEB's Organization
3.04      The CEB has a seven member Board whose members serve for a 5 year
term and may be reappointed. They are all appointed by the Government; four
with experience in engineering, commerce, administration or accountancy, one
representing local authorities, one representing the industry and one the
General Treasury. They can be removed at any time by the respective Ministers
who nominate them. The Chairman, who is the only full-time member, is ap-
pointed by the Government from among the Board members. He may be removed
from office at any time by the Government. With Government approval, the
Board appoints the General Manager who is the chief executive and responsible
for the management of day to day affairs.
3.05      The organizational plan recommended by the consultants and now
being implemented generally follows the pattern suggested by an earlier
DGEU Reorganization Committee with the General Manager as chief executive
assisted by deputies responsible for system planning, construction, operation
and maintenance, administration and accounting. The proposed organization
structure is basically sound.
3.06      The CEB has a total staff of 8,500.  Though CEB's activities cover
all aspects of power generation, transmission and distribution, the number
of employees is high by normal standards. With the severe countrywide un-
employment, however, it would not be reasonable to expect improvement in the
near future. In the long run, however, CEB expects to normalize the employ-
ment situation through attrition and retirement.
Accounts
3.07      The consultants' progress in setting up the accounting system and
undertaking the revaluation of assets has suffered from the problems described
in paragraph 3.03. Due to a severe shortage of competent accounting staff,



-6-
they have had to assume responsibility for supervising implementation of
their recommendations. New accounting procedures have now been introduced
and the staffing improved as much as possible. The asset revaluation study
has been completed and the results incorporated in the 1971 balance sheet.
During negotiations CEB indicated that the final consultants' report would
be submitted to the Association not later than April 15, 1973.
Operations
3.08      The CEB is moving towards developing the required technical and
managerial skills but it has been handicapped during the past two years,
during a crucial stage of development, by changes in key posts including
that of the General Manager. This has resulted in the Chairman having to
take temporary control of a number of operations including the construction
supervision of the Maskeliya Oya Stage II project.
3.09      Noticeable improvement has been made in the CEB's technical opera-
tions and quality of service is improving. In order to be fully aware of
system conditions at all times the CEB is implementing, as quickly as pos-
sible, recommendations made by the consultants in regard to the equipping
and commissioning of a central load dispatch center in Colombo.
Insurance
3.10      CEB is presently permitted to accrue an insurance reserve by making
annual contributions of 0.1% of the capital value of assets. This arrange-
ment, however, does not automatically provide CEB with the foreign exchange
required for damage involving extensive repairs and replacement of plant.
The Government therefore agreed during negotiations to make promptly avail-
able to CEB all foreign exchange required to repair or replace any asset of
CEB in case of damage.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The Project will provide for the extension, during the period
early 1974 to early 1976, of the CEB's transmission and distribution
facilities by constructing:
(a)  86 miles of 132 kV transmission lines and associated
132/33 kV substations;
(b)  400 miles of single circuit 33 kV distribution lines
and associated substations; and
(c)  11 kV and low tension switchgear, distribution transformers,
and ancillary equipment for the Colombo distribution system.



-7-
Complete details of the project are given in Annex 4 and the location of
the transmission lines is shown on the attached map.
Project Cost Estimate
4.02      The project cost estimates are detailed in Annex 5 and summarized
below:

67.14     42.14   109.28        6.00     3.78    9.78
4.03      The project cost estimate was prepared by CEB on the basis of
experience gained during construction of transmission lines of the Maskeliya
Oya Stage I project during 1967-1971. Cost estimates for erection of 132 kV
and 33 kV lines were based on contract payments for similar lines during the
period 1967-71, allowances of about 20% being made to cover cost increases
which have taken place since that time. Costs of equipment are based on
prevailing prices. All estimates take into account changes in exchange rates
after the recent devaluation of the US dollar.
4.04      Local costs include customs duties applicable, which vary from 5%
for transformers, insulators, etc. to 25% for steel towers, conductors and
switchgear. An overall average of 20%, determined by the mix of equipment,
has been applied to the total cost of imports. Although the 132 kV facili-
ties had been estimated as accurately as possible, a 5% provision has been
made for physical contingencies on both foreign and local costs of all 132
kV lines and equipment. For 33 kV and lower voltage facilities no physical
contingencies have been included since any variations in cost are taken care
of by marginally adjusting the volume of work to be constructed. Price
contingencies have been provided separately for foreign and local components
at 7-1/2% and 10% respectively. These provisions are adequate considering
the short construction period of a little over two years.
Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate (FEEC)
4.05      In order to improve the country's balance of payments position and
to increase revenues for the Government's budget, a levy of 55% of the official



- 8 -
exchange rate - the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate (FEEC) - was in-
troduced in May 1968 and has since been extended to most import categories.
Effective November 13, 1972 the FEEC percentage was raised to 65%. This
increase has also been taken into account.
4.06      During negotiations clarification was obtained that CEB is FEEC
exempt for all imports financed under loans extended to it up to December 1,
1972; this applies also to future foreign exchange transactions based on
such imports, for instance debt service on foreign loans and credits secured
for the procurement of equipment and services. For imports financed under
the proposed credit, CEB, though liable to FEECs, will pay them with the
amortization of the Subsidiary '-oan (paragraph 6.15). In estimating the
cost of the Project in both rupees and US dollars as well as converting
future foreign exchange transactions to rupees in the financial tables
of the several annexes, a rate of exchange of Rs. 11.19 to the dollar
has been used as compared to the official rate of Rs. 6.78 in order to allow
for the FEEC charge.
Engineering and Construction
4.07      CEB plans to carry out the engineering, preparation of specifications
and construction of the project using its own staff. CEB staff have gained
sufficient experience in the execution of the Maskeliya Oya Stage I project
and are performing similar work on the Laksapana-Polpitiya 132 kV lines and
other 33 kV lines now under construction. This arrangement is satisfactory.
4.08      Engineering and preparation of specifications is underway and it
should be possible to invite tenders by mid-1973. Field construction is
planned to begin in January 1974 and to be completed by early 1976. Con-
struction of the 12 mile, double circuit line linking the Polgolla station
to the grid will receive the highest priority to coincide with plant com-
missioning in mid 1974.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      In the absence of indigenous sources of supply, all project equipment
will have to be imported. Procurement of equipment will be made through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Association procurement
guidelines.
4.10      Customs duties provide for Commonwealth preferences of 25% on switch-
gear and 10% on steel towers and conductors. However, in previous Bank-fin-
anced projects, CEB evaluated bids and awarded contracts on a c.i.f. basis.
The Government confirmed during negotiations that this practice would be
continued for the Project.
4.,1      The schedule of disbursements, based on the program of project ex-
ecution outlined in paragraph 4.08, is given in Annex 6. No disbursements
would be permitted for expenditures made prior to signing of the Credit.
Disbursements from the proposed Credit would be made for the c.i.f. cost of

imported materials and equipment. Unused funds of the Credit would be
cancelled unless there are grounds to apply them to related works.
Ecological Aspects
4.12      The facilities to be provided by the Project do not pose any en-
vironmental problems.  The Colombo 11 kV distribution system is underground
and only reinforcement of equipment would be involved; the 132 kV transmis-
sion lines pass mostly through jungle areas and the 33 kV lines are short
spurs in rural areas.
V. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
5.01      The facilities provided through the Project are required to satisfy
economically the system's growing market requirements, which could not other-
wise be met; to connect the Polgolla generating facility (Credit 174-CE/Loan
653-CE) presently under construction to the grid network, to improve the re-
liability and quality of supply to existing consumers and to properly utilize
the output from the Maskeliya Oya Stage II project (Loan 636-CE), also pre-
sently under construction. In the light of consumers' demonstrated willing-
ness to pay for the full costs of service and the absence of evident gross
distortions in tariffs which would inflate demand, there is no ground for
questioning the merits of the program to meet the system's groving market
-requirements. The Project forms part of this program. No economic rate of
return has been estimated for the Project because there is no way of iden-
tifying the portion of the system expansion revenues properly attributable
to it.
5.02      The existing 56 mile, 33 kV line from Habarane to Trincomalee,
which serves an industrial complex en route, is now fully loaded. The first
stage expansion of a Rare Earth factory at Pulmoddai, 37 miles from Trinco-
malee, financed by the Asian Development Bank, is initially expected to
require 1,000 kVA with an ultimate demand of 5,000 kVA. Conservative fore-
casts for Trincomalee itself estimate a need for 7,000 kVA by 1976. Con-
struction of a 132 kV line to Trincomalee is the most economic solution since
an alternative 66 kV line would, in any case, have to be designed for later
conversion to 132 kV to cater for loads in the area south of Trincomalee
which are expected to develop shortly after the completion of the Project.
5.03      The 12 mile, double circuit 132 kV line linking the Polgolla station
to the grid is required by mid-1974 to feed about 170 GWh of energy annually
into the system.
5.04      Half of the main 33 kV extensions are intended to provide more
reliable supply to centers presently connected by single circuit lines
only. The rest would connect new centers of consumption as part of normal
system distribution expansion.

5.05      In Colombo, the lack of 11 kV switchgear has led to a 33/11 kV
substation lying idle while another is overloaded. Some of the switchgear
to be procured under the Project would enable about 10 MVA of demand to be
met immediately; the balance will upgrade existing low capacity switchgear.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      CEB's finances are regulated in important matters, for instance
depreciation procedures and dividend limitation, by the stipulations of the
CEB Act. Furthermore, Loan 636-CE introduced the concept of a minimum 8%
rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation as a
measure of financial performance, requiring asset revaluation from time to
time and depreciation provisions based on these revalued assets.
6.02      In October 1971 the Government promulgated the 1971 Finance Act,
the purpose of which was to establish financial regulations applicable to
all public corporations in the country, consequently, also to CEB. This Act
introduced stipulations requiring depreciation to be based on historic cost
of assets rather than on revalued assets and also overruled the dividend
limitation provision of the CEB Act. Application of these requirements
would have resulted in lack of objective standards for measuring the ade-
quacy of CEB's financial return and a reasonable internal contribution to
investments would not have been assured. In discussions, Government and
CEB recognized the need for rectifying the situation, and, consequently the
Government waived the relevant sections of the Finance Act for CEB, in fact
restoring CEB's financial basis as prevailing before promulgation of the
Finance Act.
Past Record and Present Position
6.03      The financial projections are based on unaudited 1971 figures which,
for the first time in CEB's history, incorporate currently valued assets.
These values are based on the asset revaluation study carried out by CEB's
accounting consultants, Urwick International. The financial statements thus
arrived at, and incorporated in Annexes 7 to 9, provide an acceptable basis
for the financial projections.
6.04      CEB's capitalization as of December 31, 1971 was as follows:



- 1 1 -
Rs million            _
Equity
Government Contributions and Reserves       816.0 /1            75
Long-Term Debt
IBRD-Loans                                   156.2              15
Suppliers' Credits                            78.6               7
Local Loans                                   32.7               3
267.5              25
Total Capitalization                            1,083.5             100
/1   Including Rs 280.7 million revaluation reserve.
Apart from the revaluation reserve, equity consists of the net value of
assets transferred to CEB when it was constituted (RS 379.1 million) and
retained earnings. The Bank loans were made between 1954 and 1969 for
periods of 20-25 years, at interest rates of 4-3/4% to 6-1/2%. The terms
of suppliers' credits average about 10 years at interest rates from 5.5%
to 6%. The major portion of the local loans is composed of overdrafts
(7% interest) from local banks which have been included in the long-term
borrowings since they can be considered in effect a floating debt.
Accounting, Billing and Collection
6.05      Once CEB's accounting system is reorganized and in full operation
its management will have the control needed to assist it in carrying out its
financial operations efficiently.
6.06      Loan 636-CE requires that, by the end of fiscal 1970, CEB accounts
receivable should not exceed three months' billing. This undertaking was not
complied with in fiscal years 1970 and 1971 due to deficiencies in the billing
system at that time and very slow payments on the part of public agencies.
Over the past two years the Government has tried to speed up these payments,
and has succeeded in part. The consultants also consider that, after correct-
ing the accounting deficiencies, CEB will be in a position to comply with the
three-month target. The undertaking in Loan 636-CE has therefore been retained.
Transfer of Assets
6.07      As mentioned in paragraph 2.05, a number of future power stations
are associated with multipurpose- projects constructed by agencies other than
CEB. Current legislation makes no mention of the operational and financial
aspects of these projects. The Association, therefore, introduced a covenant
in the Agreement for Credit 174-CE providing for the transfer to CEB of the
power assets in a manner mutually acceptable to the Government, the CEB and
the Association, of the Polgolla station, upon its completion. As mentioned
in paragraph 2.05, agreement was reached during negotiations that this stipula-
tion be extended to all future multipurpose projects for which CEB assumes
partial responsibility.



- 12 -
6.08      Furthermore, there are no regulations at present specifying the
financial arrangements to be made for transfer of such power assets. The
covenant agreed during negotiations (paragraph 6.12), includes 30% of the
transfer value to be financed from CEB's own funds and 70% from other sources,
for instance Government loans.
Tariff and Dividend Limitation Covenant
6.09      Under the stipulations of Loan 636-CE, CEB is required to set
tariffs at levels sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt service,
adequate working capital and dividends, if any, on equity. To achieve
this it must observe the following criteria:
(i) before completion of the asset valuation study (paragraph 3.02)
a reasonable portion of capital expenditures, defined as an
average of 25% for 1970/71, would be financed from internally
generated funds; and
(ii) after completion of the asset valuation study, a minimum
8% return on the average current value of net fixed assets
in operation would be earned to meet the above requirements,
including a reasonable, but after 1971 unspecified,
percentage of capital requirements.
6.10      Section 39(b) of the 1969 CEB Act (paragraph 3.01) limits dividend
payments on CEB's initial equity only to an annual rate of 8%. No dividend
limitation is provided for later equity. This situation could theoretically
impair CEB's finances by lowering its internal cash generation below accept-
able levels. Consequently, the covenants outlined in paragraph 6.11 establish
the 8% rate of return as a reasonable earnings target and, in addition, in-
troduce a 30% contribution to investment concept as a dividend limit. Unlike
the interim 25% contribution for the 1970/71 period stipulated in Loan 636-CE
(paragraph 6.09(i)) which was chosen because lack of earnings prevented a
better target, the 30% now proposed assures proper internal financing of
future capital investment. It can be reached with the recent 16% tariff
increase and with a reasonable tariff policy in the future.
6.11      The following agreements were reached with the Government and CEB
during negotiations:
(i) CEB will be permitted to record its assets as currently
revalued from time to time. The initial valuation will
result from the valuation study as incorporated in the
1971 balance sheet. Depreciation, calculated on the useful
life of assets, will be based on these revalued assets;
(ii) a minimum 30% internal contribution to investment should be
earned in 1973; from 1974 onward, a minimum rate of return
of 8% on currently valued average net fixed assets in
operation should be achieved;



- 13 -
(iii) CEB will review tariffs annually and will include assess-
ment of the asset valuation in a manner acceptable to the
Association;
(iv)  dividend and other similar payments to the Government
will be permitted only after a minimum 30% internal
contribution to CEB's capital expenditures has been made
in any given year; and
(v) any shortfalls or overruns in the investment contributions
will be taken into account in the following year.
6.12      The power investments in multipurpose projects for which CEB is
responsible under the 1969 Act, in effect represent assets of CEB from the
time they are made. In order to assure adequate self financing, they should,
on an annual basis, be added to CEB's investments for determination of the
base for measuring the 30% contribution target. The funds thus generated
would be taken into account at the time of asset transfer and would thus
limit debt incurrence by CEB to a maximum of 70% of the value of transferred
assets. Consequently, the Government and CEB agreed during negotiations that
the annual construction costs made for power facilities by agencies other than
CEB will be included in the basis for determining CEB's 30% contribution to
investment. The Government is charged with the responsibility of provid-
ing CEB, in a timely manner, with the necessary data.
6.13      The rate of return of 4.8% forecast for fiscal 1973 is below the
8% rate of return stipulated in connection with Loan 636-CE. Sales increases
have been significantly lower than expected when Loan 636-CE was made, and
the asset revaluation study produce a higher rate base than anticipated. To
provide an 8% return in 1973, a tariff increase of about 20% would be required
but this would be inappropriate so soon after the 16% increase made in April
1972. Since CEB's financial standing is not seriously impaired by the low
return for one year the 30% contribution to investment (paragraph 6.11(ii)),
which can be achieved in that year even with the low return, will be suffi-
cient. From 1974 onwards, the 8% return will be required and can be achieved.
Audit
6.14      The law requires that public corporations in Sri Lanka be audited
exclusively by the Auditor General who may, however, employ the services of
any qualified auditor to act under his direction. This is a satisfactory
arrangement, to which the Association agreed during negotiations. It was
furthermore agreed that the Association will be provided with copies of the
auditor's report within six months after the close of each fiscal year. In
order to inform the Association as early as possible on CEB's finances, CEB
agreed to send copies of the unaudited financial statements to the Associa-
tion at the same time it furnishes them to the auditor.



- 14 -
Subsidiary Loan
6.15      It was agreed during negotiations that the Government will re-lend
the proceeds of the proposed Credit to CEB at 7-1/4% interest and for a term
of 20 years with three years' grace.
Future Finances
6.16      As indicated in Annexes 7 to 9, CEB's financial prospects are
satisfactory. The financial projections take into account the tariff and
contribution conditions mentioned above.
6.17      The forecast revenues are based on the sales expectations included
in Annex 3 and discussed in Chapter II. They take into account the recent
16% tariff increase effective April 1972 and include a further 10% tariff
increase in 1975 to ensure the stipulated 8% rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation, and to keep a reasonable ratio between internally
generated funds and borrowings.
6.18      The projections of operating expenses are based on past experience.
The cost of fuel takes into account prevailing prices and operation of
thermal stations under dry-year conditions, which is conservative.
6.19      As explained before, the financing plan (Annex 8) aims at cover-
ing about 30% of future investments from internal cash generation and about
70% from borrowings. The 1972-1977 forecast (Annex 8), however, shows
about 55% internal coverage; this is due to the contributions to be made for
the relatively large Samanalawewa project, the transfer of which will not
appear in CEB's books before 1978. The borrowings would consist of the
drawdown of Loan 636-CE, the Government Counterpart Loan for the proposed
IDA-Credit (paragraph 6.15), and assumed Government loans (7% interest,
20 years amortization period) equivalent to 70% of the transfer value of
the power components of multipurpose projects. The financing plan is
satisfactory.
6.20      Within the financing plan described in paragraph 6.19, the Project
would be financed about 30% by CEB's own funds, 60% by the proposed IDA
Credit, and 10% consumers' contributions.
6.21      As shown in the Forecast Sources and Applications of Funds State-
ment (Annex 8), annual debt service coverage by internal sources is expected
to vary between 1.4 and 2.8, which is satisfactory, particularly since the
low figure occurs only in 1973. Debt service coverage based on historical
cash generation 1/ is not expected to fall in future below 1.5. It was agreed
to repeat the covenant in Loan 636-CE permitting CEB to incur debt only if
the maximum future debt service is covered at least 1.5 times by historical
internal sources.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a) the power assets associated with multipurpose projects,
for which CEB is responsible, will be transferred to
CEB upon completion in a manner mutually acceptable to
the Government, the CEB and the Association (paragraphs
2.05 and 6.07);
(b) the Government agreed to make insurance arrangements
explicitly providing for catastrophic damage requiring
foreign currency (paragraph 3.10);
(c) bids will be evaluated on the basis of c.i.f. prices
(paragraph 4.10);
(d) tariffs will be set to earn revenues sufficient to
cover 30% of capital expenditures in 1973, and from
1974 onward to achieve an 8% rate of return on currently
valued average net fixed assets in operation (paragraph
6.11);
(e) the appropriateness of the tariff level and of asset
valuation will be determined once in every year
(paragraph 6.11(iii));
(f) dividend and other similar payments to the Government will
be made only after a minimum 30% internal contribution to
investment has been allowed for in any given year; shortfalls
and overruns in any particular year will be taken into account
in the following year before making such payments (paragraphs
6.11(iv)(v));
(g) CEB will have its books audited by qualified auditors
in an arrangement acceptable to the Association
(paragraph 6.14);
(h) the Government will relend the proceeds of the Credit to
CEB (paragraph 6.15); and
(i) CEB should not incur debt without the Association's concur-
rence, unless its maximum future debt service is covered at
least 1.5 times by historical cash generation (paragraph 6.21).
7.02      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for an Association
Credit of US$6 million equivalent.

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD
The Existing Transmission and Distribution System
The Transmission System
1.        The CEB System operates at 132 kV, 66 kV, 33 kV and 11 kV.  There
are 400 miles of double circuit and 230 miles of single circuit 132 kV lines
in operation. The 66 kV system is limited to about 70 miles of double
circuit lines connected with the earliest developments. Some 2220 miles of
33 kV lines constitute the main distribution system, 11 kV being adopted
only for about 400 miles in Colombo City. These lines are indicated in
the map attached.
2.        There are three main grid centers viz Kolonnawa, Polpitiya and
Laksapana (see map). Kolonnawa is an important load center near Colombo
and the other two are the major generation sources in the central hills.
Norton Bridge hydroelectric and Grandpas thermal power stations are
connected to Laksapana and Kolonnawa respectively through very short 132 kV
double circuit lines. Each of the three grid centers referred to above
have 132 kV double bus arrangements and are interconnected with each other.
There are four 132 kV circuits between Polpitiya and Kolonnawa and two
between Polpitiya and Laksapana. Two more 132 kV circuits are under
construction between the latter points. At Kolonnawa and Laksapana there
are 66 kV bus arrangements with inter-bus transformers; and, in the case of
Kolonnawa, 33 kV bus bars as well. Kolonnawa and Laksapana are also
interconnected at 66 kV through a double circuit line. Two of the four
132 kV circuits which connect Kolonnawa and Polpitiya and the 66 kV circuits
which interconnect Kolonnawa and Laksapana are "teed off" to grid substations
which feed the CEB's extensive 33 kV distribution network.
3.        Apart from 132 kV and 66 kV interconnecting lines referred to
above, there are a number of radial transmission lines to distant load
centers. From Polpitiya, a double circuit 132 kV line runs due north to
Anuradhapura, and on to Chunnakkam (Jaffna), the extension from Anuradhapura
being strung on a single circuit. "Tee off" substations on this route are
Habarana and Kilinochchi. A second radial 132 kV double circuit line runs
south from Polpitiya to Galle, with "tee off" points enroute at Balangoda
and Deniyaya. From Kolonnawa, a 132 kV double circuit line runs north along
the coast to Bolawatta and Puttalam substations with a "tee off" to
Sapugaskanda and a single circuit radial line runs south to Ratmalana
substation.
4.        66 kV double-circuit radial lines connect Norton Bridge power
station to Kandy in the north and Nuwara Eliya and Badulla in the east. An



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3 pages
extension of the latter - a single circuit line from Badulla to Inginiyagala -
has been constructed for future 132 kV operation, in line with the CEB's
policy of relying on 132 kV for all future transmission lines extensions.
This applies also to the single circuit 66 kV extension from Kandy to
Kurnegala.
The Distribution System
5.        Except for the major load center of Colombo, which is served by
a 11 kV network, distribution in Sri Lanka is through an extensive 33 kV
network which now extends over 2220 miles. The system comprises mainly of
single circuit lines. As the system expands alternative supply routes are
being arranged to the more important points. In operation, however, these
33 kV routes are sectionalized by means of airbreak switches. All 11 kV
lines are operated as radial lines.
6.        The city of Colombo receives power from Kolonnawa at 33 kV. Three,
30 MVA, 132/33 kY, transformers installed there supply the normal demand of
the city, with a 30 MVA three winding transformer 132/66/33 kV serving as
reserve. 23 miles of 33 kV underground cables have been laid to four
primary 33/11 kV substations designated A, B, C and D. The southern ring (A)
serves a predominantly domestic market, whereas the central ring (B) serves
a commercial area and ring C, the industrial market. The fourth, viz D,
has not been commissioned mainly due to lack of necessary 11 kV switchgear.
The system is adequate to supply about 120 MVA to the four substations. It
would be seen from the table below that substation A, which at present meets
the demand of the area covered by ring D, is already loaded up to its
effective capacity.
Primary                                           Normal

A                 3 x 12.5 MVA                24.3  MVA
B                 3 x 12.5 MVA                18.25 MVA
C                 2 x 12.5 MVA                10.25 MVA
D                 2 x 12.5 MVA                   NIL
7.        About 165 miles of 11 kV cables have been laid from the four
primary substations to 196, 11/0.4 kV stepdown substations with an aggregate
transformer capacity of 125 MVA. The circuits are arranged in the form of
three rings (a fourth will be formed when primary substation D is comnis-
sioned), with satellite substations connected by 11 kV loop circuits around
the ring. The 11 kV ring circuits are isolated at convenient points and
operated as radial feeders; the problems of load division among the feeders
and complications of protective relaying dictate this arrangement, which
appears to provide fairly satisfactory service. Each of the ring substations
are equipped with two 500 kVA transformers, 11/0.4 kV with a third 500 kVA
transformer being added to meet the load situation in a few cases. Installa-
tions at the satellite substations vary from one to two, 500 kVA, or smaller
size transformers. Many of the satellite substations serve individual
industrial consumers or important commercial loads.



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3 pages
8.        Prior to the commissioning of the primary substations A, B and C,
the 11 kV switchgear had rupturing capacities of 80-100 MVA, corresponding
to the low fault level obtaining at that time. Thereafter, and particularly
with the recent increases in system capacity, it was necessary to increase
the switchgear capacities to 250 MVA. About 80% of the 11 kV switchgear has
since been changed over to the higher rating during the past few years. In
rings A and C the changeover of switchgear has been completed. In ring B,
switchgear at a few substations has been changed. The switchgear ratings of
the remaining stations is barely adequate even at present and would be
inadequate to meet system conditions, by 1973-74.
9.        The low tension distribution network consists of radial feeders
from the 11/0.4 kV substations to feeder pillars and distributor cables
from such feeder pillars. Consumers service connections are provided from
the distribution cables. The greater portion of the low tension distributor
network consists of underground cables, but in some areas of the city a few
overhead distribution lines also exist.

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD
Detailed Description of the Project
for Extension of CEB's Transmission and Distribution System
1.        The project may be subdivided into three main categories as follows:
(a) extensions of the 132 kV network - lines and substations;
(b) extensions of the 33 kV network - lines and substations; and
(c) extensions of Colombo's 11 kV and low tension distribution
network.
Extension of CEB's 132 kV Network
2.        The CEB now has a well developed 132 kV network which enables its
power stations to be operated as an integrated system. The main system has
been studied on the Network Analyser both by the CEB and its consultants,
and found to be adequate for the magnitude of power development during the
seventies. The following extensions of the 132 kV system are now required
for reasons given below.
3.        A 12-mile long double circuit line is to connect the existing
Polpitiya-Anuradhapura double circuit line to the Polgolla power station. An
18-mile long single circuit line from Anuradhapura will connect Rajangane -
a developing industrial center, which has no supply at present. Trincomalee
receives its supply from the CEB Grid through a single circuit 33 kV line,
about 53 miles long, from Habarane. The line also serves industrial centers
enroute. A 56-mile single circuit 132 kV line has been proposed from
Anuradhapura to Trincomalee to meet present demands of the town and future
growth in the North East.
4.        Two new 132 kV substations would be required at Rajangane and
Trincomalee, with 10 MVA, 132/33 kV stepdown transformers. A standby
transformer is proposed to be located at Rajangane. The Anuradhapura
substation would be extended by adding two 132 kV bays and associated control
equipment.
Extensions of the 33 kV Network
5.        About 200 miles of single circuit 33 kV lines are needed to extend
power supply to new industrial centers, and to improve reliability of supply
to others by providing an alternate source of supply. The lines are listed
below.

6.        In addition to these main 33 kV lines, about 200 miles of spur
lines would be needed to nearby distribution points. It is estimated that
about 300 new consumer substations would also have to be built along with
the proposed 33 kV extensions.
Colombo Distribution System
7.        The 11 kV distribution system of Colombo has been arranged in the
form of four Rings, A, B, C and D. The underground cables required have
been laid, and are adequate to meet anticipated requirements, provided
Ring D is commissioned and switchgear capacity increased where necessary.
The development program under the new project is therefore as follows:
(a) Substitution of switchgear at substation Nos. 26 and 76
of Ring A. This will permit these two substations to be
connected to the new primary substation 'D'.
(b) Substitution of 11 kV and LT switchgear at substation
Nos. 6, 8, 9, 10, 25, 27, 34 and 54 in the 'B' ring.
(c) Substitution of 11 kV and LT switchgear in substation
No. 37 in the 'C' ring.
