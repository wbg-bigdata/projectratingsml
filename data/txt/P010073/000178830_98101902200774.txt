INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
(POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION)
1.        I submit the following report and recommenda.ion on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the equivalent of
US$6.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the
extension of the transmission and distribution facilities of the Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB). The proceeds of the credit would be relent to
the CEB for 20 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, entitled "The 1973 Economic Outlook
for Sri Lanka" (No. 47a - CE), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 23, 1973. The report represents the findings of a mission which
visited Sri Lanka between November 10-25, 1972. The conclusions of the
report are summarized below. The country data sheet is given in Annex I.
3.        The economy of Sri Lanka had been profoundly affected by the
insurgency in 1971; the production of major crops declined, and investment
activity reached a low point, particularly in the government sector. Real
income per head declined by about 1.5 percent. In 1972 some recovery of
production would have been possible, but drought conditions affected the
output of paddy as well as tea and coconut, and hence exports. This was
offset only in small part by production gains in onions and chillies (imports
having been banned) and other minor crops. In industry, considerable
improvement in the operation of some public sector firms (textiles and tires,
notably) was in large part offset by the decline in others and in the private
sector.
4.        Activity in the private sector remained depressed.   No massive
nationalization has been implemented or even proposed, but the level of
confidence remains low under the cumulative impact of various pieces of
legislation and new measures designed to impose ceilings on personal incomes.
5.        Overall investment in 1972 did not recover to the preinsurgency
level, and was still lower in real terms than in 1969 both in the private
and public sectors. Private consumption also declined in real terms during
this period; only public consumption expanded at a rate of about 4 percent
a year. Part of this took the form of increased military expenditure.



- 2-
6.        One of the most pressing problems is open unemployment which was
about 13 percent in 1969, and as much as two-thirds for young people under
24. The situation has steadily deteriorated since then, and the number of
new jobs created in 1972 was even less than in each of the two preceding
years.
7.        Given the poor prospect for the revival of private investment,
the key to development in Sri Lanka is capital formation in the government
sector. To raise sufficient investible resources, it is imperative for
the government to generate public savings, which have been negative in the
last few years. There was some improvement in fiscal performance in 1972
compared with 1971, but not sufficient to arrest or reverse the declining
trend in public capital formation.
8.        The 1973 Budget contains new tax measures to increase revenues but
it also envisages an increase in current expenditures; on a net basis,
the new measures will yield about Rs 400 million of new resources or 3% of
GNP; the result is expected to be a small current surplus of about Rs 56
million. The principal new revenue measure is a change in the rate as well
as in the coverage of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate (FEEC) -
a form of general import surcharge. The gross yield of this is Rs 382
million. Another step is the withdrawal of the free rice ration from
income tax payers, yielding Rs 25 million. The remainder consists of various
changes in excise duty, other indirect taxes, and profits from the sugar
monopoly. Additional expenditures arise from wage increases, and from minor
tax adjustments and price support measures for export crops.
9.        The budget measures for 1973, although substantial in appearance,
are insufficient as a basis for a new effort to generate economic develop-
ment. Public investment in real terms will not only remain well below the
peak of 1968, but barely recover from the low point reached in the last two
years. The budget measures also will tend to worsen the disadvantages
borne by producers of export crops by further widening the differential
between the effective exchange rate applied to exports and imports.
10.       Furthermore the budget estimates are based on extremely optimistic
assumptions for the prices of main food imports, e.g., wheat, rice and sugar,
which have increased quite steeply in 1972 and have continued to go up in
recent months. Most recent estimates indicate that the cost of Sri Lanka's
essential imports in 1973 will be higher by almost $50 million, or more than
20 percent, than the estimates underlying the budget. Much of this increase
will fall as a charge on the budget, while at the same time compressing the
capacity to import other goods subject to FEEC's and other taxes, and thereby
causing a reduction in revenues.
11.       Since the report was prepared, the Government has taken additional
measures to raise revenues and reduce pressure on the foreign exchange
resources: (a) an increase in the price of wheat flour and of rice; (b) in-
creases in prices of petroleum products; (c) a reduction in the sugar ration
from 2 lbs to 1 lb. per head per month. In February 1973 the procurement
price for domestic rice was also increased from Rs 14 to Rs 18 per bushel.



-3-
These measures constitute an element of improvement in fiscal policy, and
give an incentive for the increase of local production of rice in substi-
tution of imports. The Government has also cut the allocation for textile
imports by almost half. However, the increase in the cost of both imported
and domestically procured rice, and of other Government imports, together
with the loss of FEEC and other revenue, will more than offset the revenue
gains from the upward revision of prices for consumer goods sold by the
Government.  The result is likely to be a deficit in the Government budget
in the order of Rs 50-100 million instead of the estimated surplus of Rs 56
million.  One problem, of course, still is the reluctance of the Government
to remove the food subsidy, which represents a net charge on the budget of
over Rs 600 million.
12.       As noted in the report, the Government's fiscal efforts to mobilize
resources for economic development have been limited in relation to the
magnitude of the problem which Sri Lanka faces. Yet it needs to be pointed
out that the adversities arising in the external sector, under the impact
of cumulative price developments in the outside world, have hit the country
on an unprecedented scale. While Sri Lanka's major exports continue on a
long term declining price trend, her import prices already went up substantially
in 1972; and the loss in excess of $50 million arising in 1973, on account
of these terms of trade development, is worsening the country's financial
position sufficiently to make it even more difficult at this stage for the
Government to mobilize resources for public investment.
13.       On the balance of payments side, export earnings declined in 1972
by 2.7 percent and are likely to decline further by perhaps 2 percent in
1973 to about US$314 million. This outlook is based on the assumption of a
slight decline in the price of tea, and a reduction in the volume of coconut
exports affected by the drought; this will only partly be offset by an
increase in rubber exports. With the higher world market prices for major
food stuffs, the cost of food imports is now at the equivalent of 14 percent
of GNP or some $190 million, compared with $165 million in 1972.
14.       An Aid Group for Sri Lanka, for which the Bank acts as the Chairman,
was formed in 1965 and has held nine meetings. At the ninth meeting in
February 1973, the participants recognized that the grave economic problems
confronting Sri Lanka had been further aggravated by adverse weather
conditions and deteriorating terms of tade. From indications expressed
at that meeting, it appears likely that assistance by members of the Aid
Group other than IDA and the Asian Development Bank during 1973 will amount
to about $60 million, mainly in commodity assistance.
15.       The current debt service ratio is about 18 percent.   In view of
the poor balance of payments and economic development outlook, external aid
to relieve an exceedingly serious situation should be on very soft terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       Since 1954 the Bank has made seven loans totalling $73.5 million
and the Association has made four credits totalling $20.1 million to Sri
Lanka. The proposed credit would bring the total amount of Bank Group
assistance to Sri Lanka to $99.6 million. The sectoral composition of Bank
Group operations to date is as follows:
Number of            (US$ million less
Sector                    Operations            cancellation)
Irrigation and Power               7                        85.2
Industrial Finance                 2                         5.2
Highways                           1                         0.7
Land Reclamation                   1                         2.5
Total             11                        93.6
17.       Over ninety percent of Bank Group assistance has been in the
irrigation and power sectors. This strategy reflects the irrigation needs
vital to the development of the agricultural sector and the growing demand
for power in the industrial sector. Of the eleven loans and credits, four
are fully disbursed. The FY 69 credit for the highways (originally in the
amount of $4.9 million) was cancelled, after disbursement of $0.7 million,
at the request of the Borrower following Government's decision to make major
changes in the scope of the project. The remaining six loans and credits
have all been made since 1968. There have been some delays in project
execution and disbursements, mainly due to the civil disturbances of April
1971. However, project execution has improved and is now proceeding at a
satisfactory pace. As of February 28, 1973, the total amount outstanding
was $75.4 million, including an undisbursed balance of $38.4 million. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA Credits as of February
28, 1973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects. No IFC investments
have been made in Sri Lanka.
18.       Bank Group assistance to Sri Lanka in the foreseeable future is
expected to be mainly in the agricultural sector which is given high priority
by the Government. Investment in this sector is expected to rasult in an
expansion of output and employment. There are reasonable possibilities of
import-substitution in agriculture along with the development of export crops,
which would have a positive effect on the balance of payments. A credit in
the amount of about $5 million for a livestock project is being prepared for
FY74. Identification of an irrigation project is also currently underway.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN SRI LANKA
19.       Per capita consumption of electricity in Sri Lanka at about 60
Kwh is among the lorw'est in the world. In the early 1960's total electricity
consumption increased at an average annual rate of 10.3 percent but subse-
quently declined to 9 percent per annum during the economic slowdown in
1968-1971. While domestic and commercial electricity consumption has maintained
a fairly steady low annual growth rate of 5.5 percent, the rate of increase
in industrial power consumption fell off notably, from 18 percent per annum
during 1961-1968 to about 11 percent per annum thereafter. Nevertheless,
industry presently accounts for more than half of the total electricity
consumption. According to the Government's Plan for industrial expansion
over the next 4-5 years, industrial demand for electricity was projected to
increase at about 18 percent per annum. However, in View of the current
difficult economic situation, 13 percent would be a more realistic estimate
for planning purposes. This rate, which is slightly higher than the 11 percent
per annum during the recent past, is based only on expected additional sales
to existing major industries, and does not take into acccunt any planned
new industry, the implementation of which is not assured at present. With
electricity demand growth rates of 13 percent per annum projected for the
industrial sector and 5.5 percent per annum for the domestic and commercial
sectors, the overall average growth rate would be 10 percent per annum during
the next few years. Total electricity sales are projected to increase from
787 Gwh in 1972 to 1257 Gwh in 1977.
20.       Up to 1968, electricity generation, transmission and most of the
distribution was controlled by the Department of Government Electrical Under-
takings (DGEU). However, DGEU was not equipped to cope with the growth of
the sector, and in 1969, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), was created as
an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Public Works, Irrigation and Power.
21.       The power system (see map attached) is operated as an integrated
grid. There are three main grid centers servicing primarily the Colombo
area and the central hills. The grid centers are interconnected and in
addition there are a number of radial transmission lines reaching distant
load centers. The transmission system operates at 132 kV, 66 kV, 33 kV and
11 kV. There are 400 miles of double circuit and 230 miles of single circuit
132 kV lines in operation. The 66 kV system is limited to about 70 miles
of double circuit lines connected with earlier development. Except for the
major load center of Colombo, which is served by an 11 kV network, distribution
is through an extensive 33 kV network which now extends over 2,220 miles.
The system is comprised mainly of single circuit lines. As the system expands,
alternative supply routes are being arranged to the more important load centers.
22.       The CEB system provides power to plantation estates, industrial
enterprises, municipalities, commercial and domestic consumers and for rural
electrification programs. Present facilities are adequate to meet the demand
for power until about the end of 1973. Thereafter power requirements will be
met by two new hydroelectric stations with capacities of 90 MW (Maskeliya



-6-
Oya) and 50 MW (Polgolla, of the Mahaweli Ganga complex). The former is
expected to be commissioned in early 1974 and the latter by mid-1974; both
projects are being financed by the Bank Group and the extension to the main
132 kV system needed for these projects will be provided by the proposed pro-
ject. Two more hydroelectric plants are planned for 1975 (Bowatenna - 40 MW
- to be financed by ADB) and 1977 (Samanalawewa - 120 MW).
23.       As a result of the provision of these facilities, the plantation
sector is expected to be fully served; approximately 500 factories will be
connected to the system; the ongoing program of rural electrification of
500 villages will be completed; and a new rural electrification program of
the same magnitude undertaken.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed project was appraised by a mission during June/July
1972. The mission's report entitled "Appraisal of the Fifth Power Project
(Power Transmission and Distribution) of the Ceylon Electricity Board" (No.
21a-CE) dated March 14, 1973, is being circulated separately. A credit and
project summary is attached as Annex III.
25.       At the negotiations, held in Washington in February 1973, the
Government of Sri Lanka was represented by Mr. T.W. Mendis, Chairman of CEB,
and Mr. S. Velayutham, Deputy Director for External Resources, Ministry of
Planning and Employment. Mr. Mendis also represented CEB.
Description of the Project
26.       The proposed project comprises the construction of 490 miles of
transmission and distribution lines together with associated substations.
A part of the project will help to rehabilitate and expand the distribution
facilities in Colombo. The project components are:
a.   90 miles of 132 kV transmission lines and associated
substations;
b.   400 miles of single circuit 33 kV distribution lines
and associated substations; and
c.   11 kV and low tension switchgear, distribution transformers
and ancillary equipment for the Colombo distribution system.
27.       Part of the 132 kV line would strengthen the supply to Trincomalee,
its power requirements being estimated to increase to 7,000 kVA by 1976.
A 12-mile double circuit 132 kV line linking the Polgolla hydro-station to
the main grid system is required by mid-1974 to feed annually about 170 GWh
of energy into the CEB system. About half of the 33 kV extensions are
required to improve reliability of supply to existing load centers by providing
an alternate source of supply. The rest of the 33 kV extensions would connect



-7
new centers of consumption. Some of the 11 kV switchgear would enable the
Colombo distribution system to meet an additional demand of about 10 MVA
immediately. The rest of the 11 kV switchgear would upgrade the existing
low capacity switchgear.
28.       The engineering, preparation of specifications and construction of
the project will be carried out by CEB's own staff which has gained sufficient
experience in the execution of similar projects. Engineering and preparation
of specifications are nearing completion and tenders could be invited in
early 1973. Field construction is planned to begin in January 1974 and to
be completed by the beginning of 1976.
29.       Taking into account the effect of recent changes in exchange rates,
the total project cost is estimated at US$9.8 million equivalent including
$0.5 million for customs duties. 1/ The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$6.0 million and the local costs at $3.8 million. The proposed
credit would finance the foreign exchange component. The proceeds of the
credit would be relent to the CEB for a term of 20 years including three years
of grace, at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The CEB will finance 30 percent of
total project cost from its owm resources and the remaining 9 percent is
expected to be met by connection charges paid by consumers. In the absence
of indigenous sources of supply, all project equipment would be imported.
Procurement would be made through international competitive bidding in con-
formity with the standard guidelines.
30.       The CEB has a seven-member Board of Directors all appointed by the
Government: four with experience in engineering, commerce, administration,
or accountancy; three representing respectively industry, local authorities,
and the Treasury.   The Chairman is appointed by the Government from among
the Board members. The General Manager, appointed by CEB's Board of
Directors, with the approval of the Government, is the chief executive
officer. He is assisted by deputies responsible for system planning,
construction, operation and maintenance, administration and accounting.
Loan 636-CE made provision for consultants services to assist the Government
in setting up an accounting system, undertaking a revaluation of assets
and reorganizing the administration of the CEB. The consultant's interim
recommendations on the accounting system are being implemented. The
revaluation of assets and the reorganization study of the technical depart-
ments are expected to be completed by mid-1973. The financial projections
are based on unaudited 1971 figures which, for the first time, incorporate
current asset values based on the asset revaluation study.
1/   The rupee is tied to the Pound Sterling and is consequently floating
vis-a-vis the Dollar. All estimates and calculations contained in
the Appraisal Report and cited in this report are based on the exchange
rate of Rs 11.19 to the Dollar. This is the effective rate for the CEB
which is required to buy Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates
(FEECs) for all imports; the FEEC charge now amounts to 65% of the
official rate of Rs 6.78.



-8-
31.       A return of 4.8 percent on recently revalued net fixed assets in
operation is forecast for 1973. This would permit generation of sufficient
revenues which would cover 30 percent of estimated capital expenditures in
that year. From 1974 onwards CEB's tariffs would be set to achieve a rate
of return of 8 percent on currently valued net fixed assets in operation.
To meet these requirements no increase in present tariffs is expected to be
needed before 1975, when a 10 percent tariff increase is assumed in forecast
revenues. It was also agreed that dividend or other similar payments would
not be made to the Government until a minimum 30 percent internal contribution
to investment had been allowed for in any year. Debt-service coverage is not
expected to fall below 1.5 times internal cash generation. Further debt will
not be incurred if it would reduce coverage below this level.
32.       To satisfy the growing demand for electricity, for which economic
rates will be charged, CEB is continuing with the implementation of a
program of development of the generation, transmission and distribution
facilities briefly described in paragraphs 22 and 26, of which the project
forms part. The facilities provided by the project will not only make it
possible to utilize effectively capacity made available by other investments,
but will also improve the reliabilitv and quality of service to consumers.
The revenues arisinp from system improvement and expansion cannot be allocated
meaningfully between the various parts of the program and a separate economic
rate of return for this project has not been estimated.
33.       The facilities to be provided by the project do not pose any
ecological problems. Tne Colombo 11 kV distribution svstem is underground
and only reinforcement of equipment would be involved; the 132 kV transmis-
sion lines pass mostly through jungle areas and the 33 kV lines are short
spurs in rural areas.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS XND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Sri Lanka and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the CEB
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution aDproving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft agreements
conform to the normal pattern for credits for power projects.



-9 -
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION   /
(M) Credit No. 121 - Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 million of June 19,
1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
A two-year delay is expected in the completion of the project.
This is partly due to the civil disturbances during April 1971 and partly
because of inadequate facilities to service and repair land-levelling machinery.
A recent supervision mission reported definite signs of improvement in the
implementation of the project: engineering and agricultural staff have been
strengthened and the maintenance of equipment has improved. According to a
revised construction scheduled, the project is now expected to be completed
in December 1974. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1973 has accordingly
been postponed for the first time to December 31, 1975.
(ii) Loan No. 634 - Second Development Finance Corporation Project; US$3
million of July 18, 1909; Closing Date:    December 31, 1975
Due to the slowdown in economic activities, there have been delays
in committing funds. However, an amendment to the Development Finance Cor-
poration of Ceylon (DFCC) Act, now before the National Assembly, should permit
the DFCC to expand somewhat its activities by lending to small-scale industrial
enterprises and cooperatives. In addition to a disbursed amount of $0.7
million, $1.5 million have already been committed.   The original Closing Date
of December 31, 1973 has been postponed for a second time from December 31,
1974 to December 31, 1975, to allow sufficient time for presentation of new
projects to DFCC and the completion of disbursements.
(iii) Loan No. 636 - Maskeliya Oya Power Project; US$16.5 million of
July 28, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The completion of the project is expected to be delayed by about
one year. This is due to:
(a) delays in the preparation of bidding documents and
the subsequent placing of orders;
(b)  delays in the import of adequate construction
equipment by the civil works contractors; and
(c)  a prolonged strike at the turbine factory.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weakness in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
Site works are now proceeding reasonably satisfactorily and the planned
commissioning of the project towards the end of 1973 is realistic. The
original Closing Date of September 30, 1973, has been postponed to
December 31, 1974, to allow for completion of disbursements, including
retention monies on civil works.
(iv) Credit No. 168 - Land Reclamation and Drainage Project; US$2.5 million
of November 13, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The construction is about two years behind schedule, due mainly to
civil disturbances and inadequate construction equipment and lack of facilities
to service and repair this equipment. A revised equipment procurement list
has been agreed and additional equipment is going to tender soon. The project
is expected to be completed by December 1976. A postponement of the Closing
Date will be required accordingly.
(v) Loan No. 653 and Credit No. 174 - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project;
(Irrigation/Power); US$14.5 million each and both
of January 30, 1970; Closing Date: june 30, 1976
Although the expected date of first water deliveries from this
project is one year behind schedule, progress in all construction areas is
generally satisfactory and no further delay is anticipated. Over 90
percent of civil work contracts have already been awarded and all major
equipment contracts are expected to be finalized within three months. The
civil works are expected to be completed by the end of 1974. The Loan and
credit are expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.

Project Description:           The purpose of the project is to extend the
transmission and distribution facilities of the
CEB. Two projects financed by the Bank (one
under Loan 636-CE and the other under Loan
653-CE and Credit 174-CE) will increase the
installed capacity of power by 65% from 261MWJ
to 401MW. The proposed project would enable
utilization of this power. The components
of the project are:
(1)  90 miles of 132 kV transmission lines and
associated sub-stations;
(2)  400 miles of single circuit 33 kV distribution
lines and associated sub-stations;
(3)  11 kV and low tension switchgear, distribution
transformers, and ancillary equipment for the
Colombo distribution system.
