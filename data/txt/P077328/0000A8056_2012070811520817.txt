                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To (a) improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazkopru lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality, and
                         (b) lay the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with financially viable contract arrangements for loss making public services and access
                         pricing of infrastructure.

                         These contractual arrangements and infrastructure pricing are key components of future reform to be implemented under the new railway framework law.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Freight Line Capacity Increase
                         This component finances the installation of a signaling and telecommunications system on the Mersin - Toprakkale and Yenice - Bogazkopru lines. As of April 30, 2012 the
                         investment was 53% complete (physical measure) and 61% disbursed. When finished, this investment is expected to relieve congestion on the railway lines to/from Mersin port so

                         that more of the port traffic may be handled by rail rather than road. This supports the Government✇? s goal to shift traffic from road to rail, reducing road congestion, demand for
                         additional road infrastructure and GHG emissions. The investment will benefit the railway financially by attracting freight traffic and improving network density.

                         Staff Adjustment
                         This component financed the end-of-employment, lump sum payments for retirement of 1,596 TCDD staff. All retirements were voluntary, involving no layoffs. The component was
                         completed in 2009.

                         Advisory Services to TCDD
                         Under this component studies have been successfully completed on (a) Internal Financial Controls Risk Assessment, (b) TCDD Financial Audit for 2009 and 2010, (c) Freight
                         Marketing, (d) Rationalization of Passenger Services and Public Service Obligation (PSO), and (e) maintenance practices. The TCDD Financial Audit for 2011 and 2012 are planned
                         but have not yet been carried out. TCDD has also carried out pilots supporting reforms on public service contract and infrastructure charging. These pilots and studies prepare TCDD
                         to manage reforms, but they can only be meaningfully implemented after revised Railway legislation is passed.

                         TCDD Staff Training
                         Under this component training has been successfully completed on (a) non-destructive testing, (b) project management, (c) delivery of distance (on-line, computer based) training,
                         and (d) training of trainers.

                         TCDD Public Communications and Periodic Surveys
                         Under this component two surveys of customers and stakeholders have been carried out. The third survey will be completed in June 2012.

                         The project was restructured in 2009 to focus the project on the reforms and achievements that could be realized within Turkey’s current legal framework for railways, pending
                         passage of new railway framework and Turkish State Railways (TCDD) laws. The project development objective and the results indicators were changed in this restructuring. The
                         project was restructured again in 2011 to address land acquisition and building renovation activities that trigger Bank policies on involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and physical
                         cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11).

                         The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2012, however, the signaling investment is not complete. The Undersecretariate of Treasury requested an extension of the project
                         closing date on June 14, 2012.
