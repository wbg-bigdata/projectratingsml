                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To (a) improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazkopru lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality, and
                         (b) lay the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with financially viable contract arrangements for loss making public services and access
                         pricing of infrastructure.

                         These contractual arrangements and infrastructure pricing are key components of future reform to be implemented under the new railway framework law.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Freight Line Capacity Increase
                         This component finances the installation of a signaling and telecommunications system on the Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice - Bogazkopru lines. The signaling investment is 56%
                         complete (physical measure, as of October 2012). When finished,this investment is expected to relieve congestion on the railway lines to/from Mersin port so that more of the port

                         traffic maybe handled by rail rather than road. This supports the Government's goal to shift traffic from road to rail, reducing road congestion, demand for additional road infrastructure
                         and GHG emissions. The investment will benefit the railway financially by attracting freight traffic and improving network density.

                         Staff Adjustment
                         This component financed the end-of-employment, lump sum payments for retirement of 1,596 TCDD staff. All retirements were voluntary, involving no layoffs. The component was
                         completed in 2009.

                         Advisory Services to TCDD
                         Under this component studies have been successfully completed on (a) Internal FinancialControlsRisk Assessment, (b) Freight Marketing, (c) Rationalization of Passenger Services
                         and Public Service Obligation (PSO), and(d) maintenance practices. It has supported the TCDD Financial Audit for 2009 and 2010; the audit of 2011 and 2012 are contracted and are
                         expected in mid-March 2013. TCDD has also carried out pilots supporting reforms on public service contract and infrastructure charging. These pilots and studies prepare TCDD to
                         manage reforms, but they can only be meaningfully implemented after revised Railway legislation is passed.

                         TCDD Staff Training
                         Under this component training has been successfully completed on(a)non-destructive testing, (b) project management, (c) how to delivery of on-line, computer based training, and (d)
                         training of trainers.

                         TCDD Public Communications and Periodic Surveys
                         Under this component three surveys of customers and stakeholders have been carried out.

                         Project Restructuring
                         The project was restructured in 2009 to focus it on the reforms and achievements that could be realized within Turkey’s current legal framework for railways, pending passage of a
                         new railway law. The project development objective and the results indicators were changed in this restructuring. The project was restructured again in 2011 to address land
                         acquisition and building renovation activities that trigger Bank policies on involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11). The project was
                         restructured in June 2012 to extend the project closing date until December 31, 2013.
