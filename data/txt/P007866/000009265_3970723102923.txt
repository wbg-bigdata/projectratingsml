FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1529-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I-
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Fifth Highway
Project in Paraguay for which Loan 1529-PA, in the amount of US$33.0 million,
was approved by the Board on March 7, 1978. The Loan was closed on June 30,
1983, and the final disbursement was made on August 5, 1983. Loan funds were
depleted before project completion, and works on the Coronel
Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road are continuing with a US$4.0 million
supplementary financing provided under Loan 2140-PA.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervison Reports for Loan 1529-PA, final reports from the consultants
involved in the project and information gathered during a mission to Paraguay
in December 1983.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion Report
was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1529-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Fifth Highway Project comprised two major civil works
components: (a) the upgrading, including paving, of the Coronel Oviedo-
Tacuara-San Estanislao road (about 98 km) and (b) the strengthening and
resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road (about 302 km). The project also
included procurement of equipment and technical assistance for strengthening
and expanding the capacity of the Ministry of Public Works and Communications
to ensure adequate maintenance of the national highway network (para. 2.01).
The resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road was completed in
July 1981 at a total cost of US$22.4 million, 278% above the appraisal estimate
(para. 3-07). Because delays in starting this element of the project caused the
road to deteriorate to a point at which the original design was no longer
adequate, the appraisal proposed technical solution (application of a slurry
seal) had to be revised to a substantially more expensive concrete overlay.
The Loan financed US$13.4 million vis-a-vis the US$3.4 million originally
allocated to the subproject (para 3.08). Because of an increase in the
benefits expected to be derived from the road resealing works, cost overruns
were partially offset, and the economic reevaluation yielded an expected rate
of return of 48%; the appraisal calculated a rate of return of 71.5X (paras
5.02 and 5.03).
Implementation of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao
subproject experienced delays almost from the start (para. 3.01). The Paraguavan
Government, informed that one of the partners of the joint venture that
presented the lowest bid for the civil works was having financial
difficulties, proposed to award the contract to the second lowest bidder.
The Bank made enquiries regarding the financial solvency of the firm involved
and did not accept the Government's proposal. Finally, the Government and
the Bank agreed to award the contract to a joint venture of the lowest and
the second lowest bidder, at the price and conditions of the lowest bidder.
The financial problems, however, turned out to be real, and resulted in the
collapse of the joint venture and the transfer of all responsibilities to the
other partner (para 3.02). Delays were also caused by construction problems;
the road experienced surface failures attributable to the contractor's use of
contaminated material.  The contractor is repairing the road surface at his
own expense. Works are expected to be completed in December 1984 (para
3.04). Loan funds were depleted before the completion of works on the
Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road because financing of the works on
the Paraguari-Encarnacion road used up most of the contingency funds.
Supplementary financing of US$4.0 million under Loan 2140-PA was approved by
the Board of Directors on June 15, 1983 (para 3.05).



Achievements under the project in the area of road maintenance were
almost nil and mostly limited to the benefits derived from the use of the new
equipment procured under the Loan. The Project Completion Report critically
examines the probable reasons for the minimal effect that the project had
upon institution-building and attributes it to lack of Government commitment,
shortage of qualified staff, lack of communication between Government
authorities and expatriate consultants, and over-sophistication of the
maintenance information system (paras 3.16 and 6.01).
*                  The Report identifies the following lessons to be learned from the
project (para 8.03):
(a) the Bank, before engaging in long-term involvement in road
maintenance, should be reasonably convinced of the Government's
commitment to increase the efficiency of its maintenance
operations;
(b)  during the preparation of technical assistance with a high
institution-building component, the Bank should carefully assess
the absorptive capability of the recipient institution;
(c) the Bank should encourage technical assistance with short-term
staged assignments so that programs can be judged and changed
according to the needs;
(d) the Bank should ensure that it is kept informed of any proposed
changes in consultants' staff, and finds them acceptable, before
they are actually made;
Ce) the Bank should try, as an alternative, the implementation of
projects focusing exclusively on road maintenance; and
(f)  the Bank should pay special attention to the development of
reporting requirements to monitor project implementation.



PARAGUAY
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (Loan 1529-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Republic of Paraguay, landlocked in the middle of South
America, has - as its most important link to the sea - the river system
formed by the Paraguay River, which flows north-south across the country to
join the Parana River at the border with Argentina (Map IBRD 12832R2 (PCR)).
Because of its primarily high-volume/low-product-value-based economy,
Paraguay relies heavily for its continued economic development upon its land
transport system and the connecting links to major ports in neighboring
countries. Domestic traffic is basically carried by road transport, while
foreign trade is carried by river and road transport.
1.02      Paraguay's road network totals about 15,000 km, of which some 90%
are unpaved and susceptible to closure, because of rain, for up to 100 days
per year. About 2,000 km constitute the highway network; the rest are dirt
roads. The network as a whole provides access to most populated areas of the
country. Improvement of maintenance operations and of the feeder roads
system remain the two main issues to be addressed in the subsector. Because
of the extent of the unpaved system, adequate maintenance is critical, and
improvements in this area are required to meet growing traffic volumes. The
rapid growth of agricultural production and the expansion of cultivated
acreage during the last decade have multiplied the need for betterment of
feeder roads.
1.03      The Bank has been involved in Paraguay's highway subsector since
1951, when equipment to build feeder roads was financed as part of an
agricultural project. Since October 1961, seven highway projects have been
approved (total lending about US$149.0 million). When the ongoing projects
are completed, this lending will have resulted in the upgrading or
strengthening of about 1,400 km of primary roads and the strengthening of the
road maintenance capacity of the Directorate General for Highways (DGV). In
addition, four rural development projects have provided about US$16.0 million
for improvement and maintenance of about 1,500 km of feeder roads.
1.04      This Completion Report is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1529-PA and final reports from the consultants
involved in the project. The Borrower did not prepare a Project Completion
Report.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Fifth Eighway Project was designed with the objective of
assisting the Government in: (a) strengthening and expanding the capacity of
the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOPC) to ensure adequate
maintenance of the national highway network; (b) upgrading, including paving,
of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road (about 98 km); and (c)
continuing the strengthening of transport planning and coordination.
2.02      The maintenance component of previous Bank Loans 1/ contributed
toward building up MOPC's maintenance capacity through the establishment of
field organizations, the acquisition of equipment and the increase in funding
for maintenance operations. Assistance for planning and management of road
maintenance under the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA, 1974) was
intended to phase out consultants since DGV was expected, by the end of the
project, to have acquired the expertise to carry out these tasks with its own
staff. However, the know-how was not transferred, as envisaged, for varying
reasons, among which the inability of MOPC to recruit and retain qualified
staff as a result of its non-competitive civil service salaries was
critical 2/. During the period of project identification, it was clear
that, as a result of the strong performance of the Paraguayan economy during
the 1970s, the country was experiencing considerable traffic growth;
consequently, the road network was expanding, and a sustained increase in the
maintenance effort was needed. In particular, the maintenance equipment then
in use, financed under Loan 652-PA, and for which no adequate funding policy
for replacement was followed, was close to the limit of its economic life and
had to be replaced.
2.03      The same US-Paraguayan joint venture of consulting firms that had
assisted the Government in designing the road maintenance elements of two
previous Bank-financed highway projects was retained to prepare the 1979-1982
road maintenance and betterment program with financiag provided by           Loan
1059-PA. During the final stage of preparation of the program, the
Government realized that the Paraguari-Encarnacion road resealing project
(302 km) would require a large lump outlay (roughly estimated at the time
between US$4 million and US$7 million), which the Government was unable to
include in DGV's maintenance budget allocations. In May 1977, the Government
requested Bank assistance to finance the resealing of this road. The
Argentine-Paraguayan joint venture of consulting firms which was assisting
the Government with transport planning, under Loan 1059-PA, carried out the
necessary engineering and economic studies over the period July to October
1977, with financing provided by the Preinvestment Studies Project
(Credit 587-PA).
2.04      The upgrading of the Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao road was
identified by the transport planning consultants (para 2.03) as one of the
highest priority projects in the highway subsector. The same consultants
completed the feasibility study in April 1977, with financing provided under
Loan 1059-PA, and the detailed engineering in June 1977, also with financing
provided by the Preinvestment Studies Project.
1/ Annex 1 presents details of the objectives and achievements of Bank
financed projects in Paraguay's road subsector.
2/ The PCR for Loan 1059-PA, issued on April 21, 1981, discusses
achievements under the project.

2.05      The project was appraised in April 1977.  Since the appraisal
mission's recommendation did not differ substantially from the approach
agreed within the Bank prior to appraisal, no Decision Meeting was held, and
a combined Issues/Decision Memorandum was issued on June 17, 1977. The paper
dealt mainly with:
(a)  The inclusion in the project of the resealing of the
Paraguari-Encarnacion road, provided that engineering and
economic studies were available by mid-October 1977;and
(b) The possible alternatives to finance the foreign exchange gap
arising from insufficient Bank loan funds to cover the foreign
exchange cost of the project. After reviewing the available
alternatives, it was recommended that cofinancing be sought
from commercial banks.
2.06      Appraisal of the additional component, the resealing of the
Paraguri-Encarnacion road (para 2.05), was completed in late 1977, and
negotiations were conducted in Washington between January 16 and January 20,
1978, seven months after project appraisal. A loan amounting to US$33.0
million was approved by the Executive Directors on March 7, 1978. The
original Loan Agreement, dated March 17, 1978, was amended on June 12, 1978
to reflect the changes in loan funds allocation and disbursement procedures
brought about by cofinancing arrangements made with the Bank of Nova Scotia
International Limited for the amount of US$5.0 million.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
A.  Upgrading, including Paving, of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-
San Estanislao Road (98 km)
3.01      Bids for civil works on the Ccronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao
road were opened in Asuncion on August 28, 1978. Fourteen bids were received
through ICB from previously prequalified firms. The lowest bid was submitted
by a Brazilian-Paraguayan joint venture and the second lowest bid, about 3Z
higher, was presented by a Paraguayan-Spanish joint venture. The Government
proposed to award the contract to the second lowest bidder for reasons that
were not acceptable to the Bank. Par%-uayan authorities had been informed
that the Brazilian partner of the lowest bUdder was undergoing financial
difficulties. The Bank contacted the Brazilian National Highway-Department,
wlth which the contractor had major contracts under way, and was informed
that the contractor was complying with his obligations in Brazil. Between
November 1978 and April 1979, the Government and the Bank exchanged several
letters and cables discussing this matter. Finally, in mid-May 1979, MOPC
proposed, and the Bank agreed, to award the contract to a joint venture of
the lowest and the second lowest bidder, at the price and conditions proposed
by the lowest bidder. The contract was signed in Asuncion on July 2, 1979
and was sent to the Paraguayan Congress for approval. MOPC contacted the
Brazilian authorities, as well as the Banco do Brasil, and obtained responses
providing no evidence that the financial status of the Brazilian firm was not
solid. The Pa aguayan Congress was informed of the results of these
enquiries, and the contract was approved in late October 1979.
3.02      Although the order to start works was issued in November 1979, they
commenced in a substantive way only in May 1980, about a year behind
appraisal estimate. This delay was caused by the torrential rains that fell
in early 1980, and by the fact that the financial problems of the Brazilian
partner, which turned out to be real, resulted in the collapse of the joint
venture and the transfer of all responsibilities to the Spanish-Paraguayan
partners.
3.03      Major problems developed almost from the start of construction.
Severe flooding, coupled with the contractor's poor organization and frequent
disputes between the supervising consultant's project manager and the
superintendent of works, slowed the pace of execution. Both men were
replaced in early 1981. Implementation speed improved considerably during
1981, but still, by the date of expiration of the original contract (February
1982), only 60Z of the scheduled works had been completed. The contract was
extended to February 1983, and a revised work program was agreed with the
contractor. The same problems that had affected the early stages of project
implementation, including unfavorable weather conditions, persisted and were
compounded by failures on finished sections of the road (para 3.04) and the
critical financial situation of the project (para 3.05).
3.04      The consultants in charge of the supervision detected, and reported
in their late 1980 progress report, that the crushed rock base included some
weathered rock. This report was confirmed by an Argentine specialist brought
in by the consultants. The consultants instructed the contractor to exploit
the quarry only where material was sound and to store it separately from
already crushed but contaminated material. The contractor openly disobeyed
the consultants because of disagreement over the consultants'



-7-
recommendations. By mid-1981, consultants' progress reports received by the
Bank considered the problem solved through careful material quality control,
but stressed the weakness of pavement design as a possible source of future
problems. Early in 1982, road failures appeared in a few of the completed
sections.   Bank missions requested from the Government and the consultants a
plan of action to clearly identify the source of the problem and possible
solutions. DGV established that the failures were caused by the bad quality
of the base material and instructed the contractor to replace the
contaminated material with sound crushed rock. Since the contractor
requested to be paid for this work, attributing the failures to the
underdesign of the pavement structure, the consultants carried out a study of
the pavement strength, which was completed in mid-1983. This study was not
found satisfactory by the Government or the Bank. Finally, in late 1983, the
Bank sent a specialist consultant who concluded that the road design was
adequate. He found the road failures originated from : (a) improper sequence
of construction activities (e.g., piecemeal construction on different
sections, base course laid left without prime coat during the rainy
season, etc.); (b) non-compliance with base materials specifications by the
contractor; (c) drainage problems along about 2 km of the road; and (d) lack
of maintenance of drainage structures. The contractor is repairing all the
surface failures at his own expense, including the application of a surface
treatment along 10 km of the road affected by major failures. Longitudinal
side drainage problems will be corrected by the contractor during the process
of routine road maintenance. MOPC will finance the cost of the extra
drainage works.
3.05      The additional funding required by the substantial cost increase of
works on the Paraguari-Encarnacion road (para 3.08) was met in part through a
US$9.5 million reallocation within the loan which used up all of the
project's contingency funds and reduced the financing available for civil
works on the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road. By early 1983, when
the latter road was about 85% completed, the balance of the loan was
exhausted and payments to the contractor were not being met. The Government
requested Bank supplemental financing of US$4.0 million under Loan 2140-PA,
which was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on June 15, 1983 and
became effective in early August. This measure solved the problem of
financing the foreign exchange needed for completion of the subproject, but
current budgetary restrictions in Paraguay may delay completion beyond the
current expected date of December 1984, three years later than the appraisal
estimate.   The final cost of this project element is estimated at US$25.2
million (US$256,600 per km), 18% above appraisal estimate.
3.06      Works are being supervised by a Paraguayan-Argentine joint
venture. Surface failures on the first section of the road (35 km)
(para 3.04) were detected in their early stages by the consultants in charge
of supervision. However, the consultants did not take the necessary actions
to make the contractor follow their recommendations (para 3.04), especially
when the original resident engineer was replaced by a new engineer at DGV's
request. The total cost of the supervision is estimated at US$2.2 million,
about 9% of the estimated cost of construction.
B. Strengthening and Resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion Road (302 km)
3.07      The lowest bid for this project element, presented by a joint
venture of Argentine and Paraguayan firms, amounted to US$8.4 million, 100%
above the original estimated cost of US$4.2 million. A Bank review of cost



-8-
estimates concluded that the reasons for the high prices were: (a) price
escalation above appraisal estimate during the one year period between the
completion of the feasibility study and the bidding; (b) cost of works to
widen the paving in urban areas, which were not contemplated during appraisal
but which were included by the Government in bidding documents without Bank
approval;and (c) bidders' cost estimates including reserves against future
inflation, which, they believed, were not adequately covered by the price
escalation clause based on official price indices. The Bank concluded that
rejection of the bid';ing procedures and calling for new bids would postpone
the initiation of works by 9 to 12 months, with the resultant accelerating
price escalation and road deterioration increasing t'e project cost above the
price offered by the lowest bidder. Therefore, the Bank agreed to award the
contract to the Argentine-Paraguayan joint venture but informed the
Government that it would limit its financing only to works agreed at
appraisal. The contract, signed on January 18, 1979, specified two different
groups: (a) works in which the Bank would participate, totaling about US$7.1
million; and (b) works to be financed totally with Government funds (US$1.3
million).
3.08      Overlay and resealing works commenced in March 1979, some six
months behind appraisal estimate. By late 1979, it was clear that a fast
deterioration of the still untreated asphaltic surface was occurring and that
long sections where the contractor had applied a slurry seal,particularly
those along the more heavily trafficked side of the road (northbound), had
failed. The contractor was instructed to stop application of the slurry seal
and, at the Bank's recommendation, a Brazilian expert was invited to carry
out a thorough study of the problem. He recommended replacement of the
slurry seal with a 4 cm thick bituminous concrete overlay, which was about
four times more expensive, bringing the estimated total cost of the works to
US$21.5 million. The Bank, after confirming the economic viability of the
project, agreed with the expert's recommendations. The road works were
satisfactorily completed by July 1981, under a contract totaling US$22.4
million (US$74,000 per km), in which the Bank participated with US$13.4
million (vis-a-vis US$3.4 million allocated originally in the Loan
Agreement). The shortage of funds was covered by a reallocation in loan
funds that used up most of the contingency funds, a reduction in the
equipment acquisition program (para 3.10) and the deletion from the project
of the component for spare parts for overhauling maintenance equipment
(para 3.26).
3.09      Supervision of the rehabilitation works, under the responsibility
of an Argentine-Paraguayan joint venture of consulting firms, was
satisfactory. The final cost of the consultants' services was US$0.8
million, 4Z of the civil works.
C. Purchase of Maintenance Equipment
3.10      Maintenance equipment was purchased in three lots under
international competitive bidding (Table 1). Early in the procurement
stages, in late 1978, there were some cases in which the Government proposed
awarding the contracts to bidders other than the lowest evaluated one, based
on considerations additional to those spelled out in the bidding documents
and therefore not acceptable to the Bank.  An exchange of letters and telex
between the Bank and DGV clarified the Government's obligations with respect
to procurement issues. Subsequent procurement of maintenance equipment
proceeded smoothly, albeit with delays caused by the shortage of staff in DGV



-9-
and the protracted completion of the staffing of the Project Unit         (para
3.14). The purchase of maintenance equipment was completed in mid-1981 at a
total cost of about US$11.2 million, of which US$6.5 million were financed by
the Bank and US$4.7 million by the Bank of Nova Scotia International
Limited.  The appraisal estimated equipment purchases amounting to US$12-1
million.
D. Procurement of Workshop, Miscellaneous and Accounting Equipment
3.11      The project included US$500,000 for the purchase of workshop and
miscellaneous equipment, including a computer to carry out cost accounting,
budgetary control, inventories, etc. A total of US$220,000 was spent on
workshop equipment. The computer was not purchased. The Project Unit
(Section E following) was of the opinion that MOPC staff was not capable of
operating and managing an in-house computer system and that the Computer
Center of Asuncion had sufficient excess capacity to handle the requirements
of the Maintenance Directorate. Bank staff did not agree with this position
at the time, but the matter was not pursued.
E. The Project Unit
3.12      Because of the high demand for qualified professionals for the
major hydroelectric works in Paraguay, DGV experienced a serious under-
staffing problem. Considering the difficulty of launching the project under
the existing staff constraints, the loan included funds for the establishment
of a Project Unit within DGV to assist in carrying out the maintenance and
construction components of the project3/.
3.13      By agreement between DGV and the Bank,  the Project Unit was
staffed and operated through the same US-Paraguayan joint venture of
consulting firms that had provided technical assistance to the Government in
matters of road maintenance under Loan 1059-PA. The contract was signed on
February 16, 1979 and approved by Ministerial Decree dated February 20, 1979.
3.14      The Unit was not fully successful in carrying out its tasks.
Several factors hampered its performance:
(a) The Government did not establish a clear line of communications
with the expatriate consultants. Language barriers constituted one
reason; the opinion of some Paraguayan authorities that most of the
expatriates were not adequately qualified was another.
(b) Because of delays in equipment procurement (para 3.10), the
training specialist, whose arrival should have been rescheduled,
arrived before the equipment, and the training element of the
project never really took off satisfactorily (para 3.17).
3/ The detailed functions and intended staffing of the Unit are presented in
the Project SAR.



- 10 -
(c) Delays in appointing local counterparts resulted from the shortage
of qualified staff, whIch was a pervasive problem throughout
project implementation. The appraisal report identified this
shortage of staff as the major risk in project execution. One
marginal objective achieved through the Project Unit was the
topping up of salaries of key DGV personnel who would otherwise
probably have been discouraged from continuing in their positions.
The experts from the US partner of the joint venture left Paraguay between
December 1979 and April 1980 as their assignments came to an end. The tasks
of the Unit were carried out by the Paraguayan partner and DGV officials.
Their performance is discussed in subsequent paragraphs, in the context of
each of the tasks assigned to the unit.
(i)   Planning, Programing and Supervison of Maintenance Operations
3.15      The institution building objectives, envisaged during appraisal in
the area of road maintenance, were not achieved. In addition to the problems
hampering the efficient operation of the Project Unit (para 3.14), this
element of the project did not have sufficient support from the local
authorities, who seem to perceive planning efforts as extraneous exercises
necessary to obtain equipment financing from agencies such as the Bank.
3.16      Under the subject loan, the Project Unit tried to improve the
existing system (developed under previous Bank-financed technical
assistance) for planning of maintenance operations and for control of the
work programs prepared for each maintenance district. For this purpose, the
Unit designed field report forms for monitoring work crews, equipment
repairs, etc. The system, after a testing period, was extended to all MOPC
districts. However, the collection of field data and their analysis within
DGV offices in Asuncion continued to be deficient. DGV undertook to
establish a small office for the proper collection and analysis of data, and
the Data Section was created, but improvements were minimal. Because of a
lack of qualified staff, data processing was carried out with substantial
delays, and the data base was usually of poor quality and of no use for
management purposes. Government officials did not pay sufficient attention
to trying to improve data collection. Many of them considered (ex post) that
the weight given to each maintenance activity used as an input in the
planning exercise did not reflect actual maintenance needs in Paraguay.
However, no effort was made to request modifications to the planning program
from the expatriate consultants. Maintenance planning operations
deteriorated with the expatriate consultants departure, and deficiencies in
the collection and centralization of field maintenance operation data were
exacerbated by the absence of a coherent and properly funded training
program, the lack of monitoring elements, the complexity and over-
sophistication of the system, and the feeling that no useful guidance could
be obtained from a system artificially implanted and fed.
3.17      The loan financed US$140,000 for training equipment and overseas
training courses. Although there were no covenants relating to training,
under Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement, the Borrower was required to
provide adequate personnel to carry out the project and, under Section
3.03(c), to inform the Bank, by June 1981, of how the Maintenance Project
Unit's tasks would be undertaken by DGV's permanent staff. Bank missions and
action letters asked for the Ministry's specific proposals on training since,
without them, the covenants could not be complied with, but none were



- 11 -
submitted to the Bank. In mid-1981, DGV considered the possibility of
establishing a training center in the headquarters of District I (Itaugua),
which the Bank fully endorsed. The idea was not pursued, however, and the
only more or less effective training received was carried out by the
equipment suppliers. Regarding overseas training under the project, about 37
operators attended suppliers' courses in Brazil. Twelve engineers
participated in the International Symposium on Pavement Evaluation and
Design, and six engineers attended the 16th Annual Meeting of Pavement
Specialists. In addition, two engineers attended ILO's courses in Turin,
Italy, for the training of trainers.
(ii) Traffic Counts
3.18      DGV started, in early 1979, a limited program of traffic counts on
the main roads. The overall counting program was scheduled, according to the
appraisal, to start by mid-1979, when traffic counters and vehicles to be
purchased under the loan were expected to be in place. Inefficiencies in
processing the purchase of the necessary equipment substantially delayed the
launching of the program, which began only in early 1983 under the
responsibility of the Directorate of Land Transport. The program, because of
budgetary constraints, is proceeding at a much slower rate than expected.
The Governmer.t is not giving sufficient priority to this program, despite
its importance in future planning and its negligible cost as compared to
other expenditures being incurred by the Government in technical assistance
to rationalize resource allocations.
(iii) Inventory of the Feeder Roads Network
3.19      The project included the preparation of an inventory of the overall
highway network. The updating of the inventory of roads under maintenance
was carried out by the Project Unit. The original understanding with DGV was
that the Project Unit would also carry out an inventory of the feeder roads
network. However, DGV proposed, and the Bank agreed to, the hiring of local
staff, under the direction of a local expert with previous experience in this
task. The inventory started in mid 1981 and was completed in February 1982.
Aproximately 5.300 km of roads in Eastern Paraguay were included in the
survey, which covered earth roads and also tracks which could be classified
under the category of feeder roads. The total cost of the inventory,
financed under the category of technical assistance to DGV, amounted to
US$71,546 (US$12 per km).
(iv) Road Design Standards and Specifications
3.20      A study of road design standards and specifications was to be
carried out by consultants as part of the technical assistance to DGV.
Decisions on this matter were delayed, mainly because the job entailed only
six-man months of services and no suitable local consultant was interested in
it. Finally, the Bank and DGV agreed to carry out this element of the
project with the technical assistance services provided under the Sixth
Highway Project (Loan 1736-PA).



- 12 -
F.   Technical Assistance to OCPIT4/ for Transport Planning
3.21      The project included funds for a two-year extension of the
Argentine-Paraguayan jo,nt venture of consulting firms assisting OCPIT in
matters of transport planning. The technical assistance, using traffic
studies prepared by, the consultants, completed, in February 1980, the
following tasks:
(a) Road user charges and vehicle operating cost studies;
(b) An updating revision of the ten-year Transport Investment Plan;
(c) A river transport study; and
(d)  A feasibility study of the San Lorenzo-Eusebio Ayala road, which
served as a basis for the ongoing Seventh Highway Project.
3.22      Although hampered by inadequate counterpart staffing, the technical
assistance to OCPIT was productive in terms of broadening the knowledge of
the Paraguayan transport sector. Specifically, the Transport Investment Plan
became a guide for those investment decisions in the sector based on economic
criteria. The technical assistance was less effective in its institution-
building aspects and in the transfer of technology through on-the-job
training, principally because of the insufficient number of qualified staff
in OCPIT.
G.    Control of Weights and Dimensions of Vehicles
3.23      A contract between DGV and a Brazilian consulting firm selected to
undertake a study for the control of weights and dimensions of vehicles was
signed on Kay 31, 1979. The consultants presented their final report in
October 1980. They found the legal framework in Paraguay adequate for
vehicle weight controls and proposed the procurement and installation of
seven fixed weighing stations and the purchase of four mobile scales at an
estimated cost of about US$1.1 million, about US$300,000 above the base cost
appraisal estimate. Since the project included only US$440,000 for the
purchase of the scales and US$440,000 for their installation, the Government
undertook to finance the construction of the weighing stations.
3.24      On March 5, 1981, international bids were open for the purchase of
the weighing scales; two proposals were received, and a German bid amounting
to US$800,000 was selected by DGV. All scales were delivered, and the fixed
ones await completion of the civil works at the selected points on the
network5/-
4/  Office of Coordination and Integral Transport Planning.
51  The mobile scales were found defective upon receipt and were returned to
the supplier for repairs; they are expected to be functional in early
1984. About US$100,000 remain to be paid to the German supplier. Since
loan funds are already fully disbursed, payments will be made from MOP's
special funds.



- 13 -
3.25      On the basis of local competitive bidding, three contracts were
awarded for the construction of six weighing stations. Contracts were signed
on February 6, 1982, and civil works are expected to be completed in April
1984. Works were financed with local resources only. Construction of access
roads and platforms, to be carried out by MOPC's force account teams under
DGV's Engineering Department supervision, was delayed because of budgetary
constraints and bad weather. Works are expected to be substantially
completed by March 1984.
H.   Overhauling of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.26      The project included financing for spare parts to be used in the
overhaul of road maintenance equipment. Because of the shortage of funds
brought about by the cost overrun for the resealing of the Paraguari-
Encarnacion road, this project item was financed by surplus funds from
Loan 1059-PA. Freed funds were reallocated to the resealing program.
About 76 units were overhauled under the program, of which about 50%
represented dump trucks for which minor repairs and body work were carried
out (the original program envisaged the overhauling of 115 units). The
reasons why the program was not implemented in its totality was the lack of
qualified mechanics and the fact that many units could not be overhauled
because of lack of funds to purchase specific parts to complement major ones
procured under Loan 1059-PA.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 2. The estimated final cost of the project is about US$64.4 million,
34% above the estimated appraisal cost of US$48.1 million (including
contingencies). Most of the cost overrun is explained by the 278% cost
increase incurred on the resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road
(para 3.08).
4.02      The allocation of loan funds was revised three times, as shown in
Annex 2, to meet price increases in civil works and to reduce Bank
participation in the purchase of maintenance equipment made possible by
cofinancing arrangements (para 2.06). Bank participation in the financing of
civil works was reduced, on November 21, 1980, from the original 73% to 55%
in order to ensure Bank participation until project completion. However,
loan funds were depleted before project completion, and works on the Coronel
Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road are continuing with supplementary
financing provided under Loan 2140-PA (para 3.05).
4.03      Disbursement lagged behind appraisal estimates from the start
(table below), reflecting delays in commencing civil works. Once civil works
were started, disbursements accelerated considerably. The loan was fully
disbursed on August 5, 1983, five months after the appraisal estimate of
Harch 1983.

V.  ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The appraisal of Loan 1529-PA included quantitative economic
evaluations of: (a) the 1979-1982 maintenance program; (b) the upgrading,
including paving, of the Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao road; and Cc) the
resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion Road (an element of the maintenance
program but evaluated separately). As discussed in paragraph 3.16, data
concerning maintenance operations in Paraguay are gathered partially and in a
deficient manner; a reliable ex post estimation of the economic merits of the
maintenance program could not be carried out. Civil works on the Coronel
Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road will be completed with additional
financing provided under the Seventh Highway Project (Loan 2140-PA). The
economic reevaluation of this project component will be included in the
Project Completion Report for that loan. What follows is a discussion of the
ex post economic evaluation of the resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion
road.
5.02      The resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road was justified at
appraisal on the basis of quantifiable benefits accruing to road users from
reduced vehicle operating costs which would result from improvements in road
surface characteristics and from savings in maintenance costs. The appraisal
estimated an IRR of 71.5%.
5.03      The economic reevaluation of the resealing of the
Paraguari-Encarnacion road was based on a methodology similar to the one used
in the appraisal.  The ex post evaluation estimated an IRS of 47% when only
savings in vehicle operating costs are considered and 48% when savings in
maintenance are included (Table 3)6/. Major differences in the parameters
used in the appraisal and the ex post evaluation are:
(a) Real costs of civil works, measured in constant 1981 prices, were
165% above appraisal estimates.
(b) The appraisal estimated an average daily traffic (ADT) on the
6/ The economic reevaluation was based on vehicle operating costs derived in
the Feasibility Study of the Villarrica-Numi Road; OCIPT, April 1981.



- 15 -
project road of about 650 vehicles per day in 1980. Traffic counts
carried out by DGV, in November 1981, showed a seasonally adjusted
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of 1,004 vehicles per day. For the
economic reevaluation, it was assumed that traffic would grow at an
average annual rate of 2% during the period 1983-1985 and at 5%
p.a. thereafter (Table 4). This assumption, based on the present
lower rate of economic growth being experienced by Paraguay, is
more conservative than the 7% p.a. used at appraisal.
(c)  During the period between project preparation and the start of
works, the Encarnacion-Paraguari road experienced a dramatic
deterioration, far above that envisaged at appraisal. The ex post
economic analysis considered that, for the 'without project' case,
a more intense maintenance effort was necessary to attempt to
attain the same level of service from the original road. Vehicle
operating costs, however, would keep increasing during the twelve
year period (Table 5)7/.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The Borrower's poor performance in the area of institution-building
precluded the realization of the benefits that were expected to be derived
from the substantial expenditures which Paraguay has been making on technical
assistance. Because of the Borrower's lack of commitment toward increasing
efficiency in its road maintenance activities, efforts were not made to adapt
and/or improve the consultants' maintenance management system. This
shortcoming was compounded by the fact that the Borrower did not successfully
address the issue of financial and non-financial incentives to secure proper
staffing of its agencies.
6.02      Because of the shortcomings discussed in the preceding paragraph,
the general covenants of the Loan Agreement on proper maintenance of the road
network were complied with only partially; the specific Road Betterment
Program described in Annex B to schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement was not
implemented as envisaged during project preparation.
6.03      The following discussion reviews major covenants in the Loan
Agreement and the Borrower's efforts to comply with them:
Section 3.03(c): "Inform the Bank, within three years from the
date of this Agreement, on the way the Project Unit's functions and
responsibilities shall be reassigned within DGV after completion of
the Project".
7/ It should be noticed that these estimates are very conservative since,
given the state of the road, it is doubtful that intensive routine
maintenance would have kept the road passable. In that case, a more
realistic "without project case" would be reverting to a gravel road,
with the subsequent loss of investment and dramatic increase in
maintenance costs.



- 16 -
As mentioned in paragraph 3.14, the Project Unit's tasks were carried out by
DGV personnel and expatriate consultants. Therefore, the Unit did not
function as an entity separate from DGV, and reassignment plans were not
necessary.
Section 3.05(a) and (b): This section obligated the Borrower to
enforce vehicle weight controls.
As mentioned in paragraph 3.23, the legal framework for vehicle weight
control was found satisfactory in Paraguay. However, no efforts were made to
enforce present regulations.
Section 3.06(b): The Borrower was obligated, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, to prepare design standards and
specifications for highway construction and improvements and to
adopt them before December 31, 1979.
As explained in paragraph 3.20, compliance with this covenant is now expected
under Loan 1736-PA. To date, the Borrower has taken no action to comply with
this covenant.
Section 3.07: Obligated the Borrower to furnish to the Bank for its
comments, a traffic counting program to be formulated by DGV, not
later than December 31, 1978.
The program existed before Loan signature, and it started to be implemented
gradually in 1983 (para 3.18).
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank became significantly involved in project identification
and preparation by including financing for feasibility studies under
preceding Bank projects and by participating in the review of subsequent
economic and engineering studies of subprojects, later included in the Sixth
and Seventh Highway Projects. The scope and size of the Fifth Highway
Project were reasonable in the areas of civil works and equipment
procurement. However, the Bank was over-optimistic regarding the results
expected from the technical assistance for road maintenance. In this respect,
the Bank did not fully utilize the experience gained from the limited
achievements under Loan 1059-PA. The Bank should have had a more active role
in designing a form of technical assistance more in line with the
institutional constraints of Paraguay, and with enough flexibility to adapt
it to local needs and/or absorption capacity.
7.02      In the case of the resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road,
neither the Bank nor the Borrower seemed to take into account that the
resealing program had been designed for the road condition existing at the
time of appraisal. Delays in starting civil works caused the road to
deteriorate to a point at which the original recommended design was no longer



- 17 -
adequate. Prompt action from the Borrower and Bank awareness of the
time-related limitation of the proposed technical solution might have reduced
the final cost of the subproject.
7.03      Although Bank action regarding surface in the Coronel Oviedo-San
Estanislao road could have been more expeditious, it was instrumental in
finding an independent and objective solution satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Bank.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Fifth Highway Project was successful in its civil works
components, despite the postponement of the completion of the paving of the
Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao Road. The equipment purchased under
the project helped to carry out maintenance of the road network that
otherwise would have not taken place and the technical assistance for
transport planning helped to increase the understanding of the sector and to
guide, to a certain extent, the investment program.
8.02      As discussed throughout this report, achievements in the area of
road maintenance were limited to improvements derived from use of the new
equipment. Maintenance operations in Paraguay continue to be undertaken on
an ad hoc basis, and they concentrate almost entirely on routine activities.
This state of affairs, in which periodic maintenance is uneconomically
neglected, is not unusual in developing countries 8/. Because of its lack
of political appeal when compared with more visible investments, maintenance
is given low priority and insufficient funds. This problem can be tackled
only by raising the Government's awareness of the economic benefits derived
from protecting investments in road infrastructure.
8.03      The major lessons associated with this project relate to the
necessary pre-conditions for the successful delivery of technical assistance
for institution-buildiog and the need to make full use of the Bank's past
experience in this area to adapt the technical assistance to local needs.
These lessons, and the recommendations that they carry, are certainly not new
to the Bank, which has fully recognized that institution-building is a slow
and tortuous process and that improvements are seldom achieved within the
framework of a few Bank Projects 9/. What follows are the main lessons to
be derived from the project:
(a) Before engaging in long-term involvement in road maintenance, the
Bank should be reasonably convinced that the Borrower is aware of
the need to increase the efficiency of its operations, is prepared
8/ See Road Maintenance in Latin America by Melody Mason, prepared for the
CEPAL meeting in Santiago de Chile, August 1983.
9/ On the general subject of technical assistance, the limited success of
technical assistance for institution-building in Bank projects, and
recommendations for the future, see Spring 1983 Project Implementation
Review - A Review Paper on Technical Assistance, July 7, 1983.



- 18 -
to create in its agencies the appropriate attitude to achieve that
goal and perceives the technical assistance as a necessary tool to
strengthen its institutions. In the case of the Fifth Highway
Project, these pre-conditions were not fulfilled.
(b) During the preparation of technical assistance with a high
institution-building component, the Bank should carefully assess
the absorptive capability of the recipient institution. Whereas
oversized bureaucracies seem to be the norm in uDst other
countries, Paraguay's institutional constraints reside not only in
inadequate staff qualifications but also in an insufficient number
of personnel to attend different areas of its maintenance
organization LO/. As a result, DGV was ill prepared to receive
technical assistance that had as a main goal tl:e implementation of
a quite sophisticated information system. The Bank should have
focused, as a first step, on developing DGV'scapabilities, giving
special emphasis to training, hiring of needed personnel and career
incentives to secure a stable organization.
(c) Early in-depth Bank assessment of the technical assistance (i.e.,
bottlenecks, relation between the Borrower and the consultants,
etc.) should be of paramount importance for the effectiveness of
the know-how transfer. In this respect, the Bank should encourage
short-term stage assignments; achievements then, can be judged at
the end of each stage and the program tailored to fit the needs of
the recipient organization.
Cd) The Bank should not limit its review of staff to the original
consultant's proposal, but should be informed of any proposed
changes in the consultant's staff and ensure that they are
acceptable to the Bank.
(e) An alternative approach for the improvement of maintenance
operations could be tried through projects focusing exclusively on
such operations. The implementation of projects in which the
principal element is a detailed program of periodic maintenance
would certainly help to protect investments in the road network.
The impact upon institution building would still depend upon the
existence of the pre-conditions mentioned in (a) preceding.
(f) The Bank should pay special attention to the development of
reporting requirements as a useful tool for monitoring project
implementation. To that end, the Borrower's periodic reports
should cover every single aspect of the project: progress in sub
project implementation and compliance with loan covenants, problems
encountered and the Borrower's plan of action to solve them.
10/ DGV, because of its extremely low salaries, is staffed mostly by young
graduates using the agency as a springboard for moving to the private
sector.

I/ Feasibility Study for the Villarica-Numi Road-OCPIT-April 1981.
For the -with project case- it was assumed a routine and periodic maintenance
that would keep the level of service of the road constant. For the -without
project case- it was assumed that intense routine maintenance could not stop the
deterioration of the road and vehicle operating costs would increase.

B-ink Projects in the Highway Subsector
1.        The First Highway Project (Credit 12-PA, US$6.0 million, 1961) was
completed in 1970 and required supplementary financing (Loan 396-PA, US$2.2
million, 1964). This project included: (a) reconstruction and paving of the
Paraguay-Encarnacion road (302 km); (b) construction of a major bridge; (c)
purchase of maintenance equipment; and (d) preparation of a master plan for
maintenance. The institutional issues that the project addressed were,
basically, the lack of organization, operational planning and proper
maintenance capacity.
2.        The Second Highway Project (Loan 443-PA, US$2.1 million, 1966)
provided for: (a) reconstruction and paving of the Coronel Oviedo-Villarrica
road (43 km) and (b) feasibility studies for 450 km of roads and detailed
engineering for 260 km of high priority roads. The road construction work was
completed in 1969 and the studies in 1973. Besides the physical objectives
and the efforts to help the Government to develop a highway program, the Bank
lobbied for improved maintenance operations, weight control enforcement and
delegation of authority from DGV to its Departments.
3.        The Third Highway-Project (Loan 652-PA, US$6.0 million, 1970)
provided for a four-year (1971-1974) highway maintenance program carried out
with assistance of consultants and for the purchase of maintenance
equipment. A central workshop and 13 regional workshops were built, and the
project was completed in 1975; it achieved the proposed goals of reasonably
organizing and equipping DGV to carry out highway maintenance. The Bank
played a key role in insisting that highway maintenance allocations not be
diverted to other uses.
4.        The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA, US$14.5 million, 1974)
had three main components: (a) construction of the Nbocayaty-Colonia
Independencia road (25 km) and the Encarnacion-Pirapo road (76 km), both to
paved surface; (b) technical assistance for transport planning and project
preparation during two years and extension of technical assistance for
h-'ghway maintenance; and (c) a study of the needs of the local construction
industry and related MOPC practices and regulations. Financing of spare
parts, tires and batteries was also included at the Government's request.
This project was completed in 1981. Civil works components were completed
considerably behind schedule. Assistance for road maintenance was intended
to phase out consultant management and return operations to DGV's control.
This know-how transfer, as well as that intended through the training
component of the assistance in transport planning, was not achieved because
of the inability of MOPC to recruit and retain qualified staff as a result of
its non-competitive civil service salaries.

5.        The Fifth Highway Project is the subject of this report.
6.        The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1736-PA, US$39.0 million, 1979) is
under way. The project includes: (a) construction, including paving, of
Route 6 from Pirapo to Route 7 (180 km); (b) engineering and construction of
500 km of feeder roads; (c) continuation of technical assistance for
transport planning and (d) a survey of local road construction and
maintenance materials and a related study of technology required for
utilizing these materials.  The technical assistance for planning was
completed with expected results and is being extended with financing from the
Seventh Highway Project (para 7). The project is expected to be completed in
1985.
7.        The Seventh Highway Project (Loan 2140-PA, US$46.0 million, 1982)
includes: (a) civil works and related supervision services for: (i) widening
and paving of 64 km of road between San Lorenzo and Eusebio Ayala; (ii)
upgrading, including paving, of a 98 km road between Tacuara and Santa Rosa;
and (iii) upgrading and paving of the Villarrica-Numi Road (28 km); (b)
upgrading of sectoral planning and strengthening of DGV's technical and
managerial capabilities; and (c) improving the efficiency of DGV's
maintenance operations. Budget constraints have delayed initiation of
project implementation, which is expected in early 1984. On June 15, 1983,
the Board of Directors approved the allocation of US$4.0 million to complete
civil works on the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road, started under
the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1529-PA).
