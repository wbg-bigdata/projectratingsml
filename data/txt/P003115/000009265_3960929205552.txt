MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INT'ERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A SOCIAL SECTOR PROJECT
1.    The following report cn a proposed credit to Zaire for SDR 21.9
million (USS 30.4 mil'ion equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, ana
would help finance social sector refoms and programs in Zaire. The proje:.
would be cofinanced with UNDP (US$2.9 million equivalent).
2.    Background.  Despite significant achievements over the past thirty
years --such as an increase in life expectancy from 44 years in 1955 to 52
years in 1989-- social indicators in Zaire remain poor. Under-five
mortality is close to 200 per 1000, maternal mortality is estimated at 6 pe
1000 live births, 25 percent of children and 13 percent of pregnant women
are undernourished and the adult illiteracy rate reaches 45 percent. While
these figures are average for low-income African countries, recent worsening
trends and the potential for further deterioration are matters of serious
concern. For example, enrollment rates in primary education have decreased
from 92 percent in 1978 to the current level of 76 percent.   In addition,
the recent AIDS epidemic 1/ which has already a negative impact on health
status and health syitem in urban areas, has the potential to cause severe
human and economic losses.
3.    The social sectors in Zaire have certain distinct features: the wide
diversity of service providers, the limited (and declining) role of the
Government, the importance of NGOs and the high consumer contribution to
operating costs. In the health sector, approximately 80 percent of health
services are provided by religious NGOs, donor-supported and community-
based projects, private practitioners (including traditional healers) and
the medical departments of large public and private enterprises. In the
education sector, the churches manage 80 percent of primary education and 6:
percent of secondary education. In both sectors, cost recovery through use,
charges is high: in some cases health care consumers contribute as much as
80 percent of operating costs of  health facilities.  In education, parents'
contributions cover on average about 50 percent of school operating costs.
However, low and decreasing social service utilization rates in poor areas
suggest that high user charges (relative to purchasing power) have a
disincentive effect. This situation is inequitable due to the skewed
distribution of income not only in terms of relative shares, but also
between rural and urban dwellers, as well as between those employed in large
public enterprises (who benefit from subsidized social services such as
1/   IDA is contributing to the National AIDS Control Program with a free-
standing project, approved in FY89.



health care and education) and other workers 2/. This is worsened by the
economic deterioration and particularly the high inflation rate which erodes
the purchasing power of the majority of the population. The population has
coped with the economic crisis by increasing recourse to informal sector
activities and extended family assistance. Women, whose workload was
already heavy, are responsible for a large share of the incremental
unrecorded activities with potentially negative consequences for their
health, their children's health and their family life.
4.      In this context, the non-governmental sector has performed
remarkably well in providing basic health and education services to a large
segment of the population. However, the NGOs are reaching their limits in
terms of cost recovery and cannot expand their level of services without
support from the Government. Public spending on health and education has
declined from 20 percent of the central Government's recurrent expenditures
in 1978 to 10 percent in 1989. In health, for the past five years the
central Government has spent on average US$0.33 per capita per year, the
lowest figure among all low-income countries where the average is around
US$2.00.   While the Government should continue leaning on the non-
governmental sector to provide and expand social services, there is an
important complementary role that the Government should play without unduly
interfering with the management of NGOs. This role, which has been
described in a letter of sccial policy prepared by the Government, would
include: cofinancirng NGOs' activities in health and education (to complement
cost recovery); financing national public health programs with large
externalities (such as health education or immunizations); and ensuring a
coherent social sector investment planning and quality-control. In line
with this policy, the Government has already provided in 1990 special
budgetary allocations for Health and Education which represent increases of
25 percent and 10 percent over the regular operating budgets respectively.
5.    Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed operation has the following
objectives: (a) to protect vulnerable population groups from the social
effects of a deteriorating economic situation, by establishing budgetary
allocations targeted to basic medical care and primary education; (b) to
maintain, in collaboration with other donors, essential public health,
nutrition and family planning programs, in order to avoid a further
deterioration in the health status of the population; and (c) to prepare
future projects and programs in the social sectors by developing new
policies on women-in-development, population and environment, and by
establishing a national capacity for collecting and analyzing social
indicators.
6.    Project Description.   Part A of the proposed operation - Support of
Social Sector Reform - aims at (a) establishing and monitoring additional
2/   For example, the 20 percent of the country's population who are
employees of enterprises and their dependents are covered by
employers' health services which account for 70 percent of the health
sector's recurrent expenditures.

budgetary allocations to Primary Health Care (PHC) and education; (b)
delineating and rationalizing the specific roles of non-governmental and
governmerntal iaLstitutions in financing and delivery of social services; and
(c) providing an adequate framework for larger investments in the social
sectors as soon as the country performance improves. These objectives would
be reached through: (a) rationalization of the Government's role in social
sectors by increasing and targeting public funding of health and education,
and developing intersectoral social policies; (b) social surveys and studies
on the social dimensions of development; and (c) pilot projects to lay the
ground for new social policies and strategies. Part B - Support of
Population, Health and Nutrition Programs - aims at responding quickly to
the basic needs of the population for health, family planning and nutrition
services. These programs include: (a) priority public health programs (PHC
strengthening and support to communicable disease control programs); (b)
family planning and safe motherhood activities; and (c) nutrition
activities, including iodine deficiency control. Project management and
coordination will be carried out by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
responding directly to the Minister of Planning. Project activities will be
implemented by selected implementing agencies, including NGOs. The project,
to be carried out over 4 years, provides funds for equipment, medical
supplies, materials, furniture, office supplies, vehicles, civil works,
training, technical assistance, studies, surveys and selected recurrent
costs. The total project cost is estimated at US$37.0 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$25.2 million (68 percent). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement, and the disbursement categories and schedule are
shown in Schedule B. Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in Schedule C
and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
9110-ZR, dated November 15, 1990, is being distributed separately.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Initially conceived as an hybrid
operation, the project has been redesigned as an investment -peratior, in
response to the deteriorating country performance in 1990 which prompted a
suspension of all new adjustments. The proposed operation is a core
component of IDA's strategy in Zaire (discussed by the Lxecutive Directors
on September 11, 1990) which places emphasis on preservation of the
country's long-term development potential, particularly human capital.   The
project would also assist in initiating the first steps of a social sector
reform which should pave the way to larger, more efficient and more
equitable resource allocations to the social sectors. IDA's role in
developing a consensus among donors on social sector priorities, policy
options and strategies is important.   The proposed operation, combined with
the Pilot Feeder Road Project (approved in September 1990) and the Education
Sector Project (to be presented to the Board in early 1991), are part of the
core lending program.
8.    Agreed Actions.  The following actions would be taken by the
Government as conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) staffing the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) with a chief coordinator, a financial manager, a
certified accountant and a procurement specialist; (b) agreement on
managerial procedures and other arrangements under which the implementing
agencies will be charged with carrying out specific project activities; and



managerial procedures and other arrangements under which the implementing
agencies will be charged with carrying out specific project activities; and
(c) establishment of a project account and initial deposit of Government's
contribution. Other agreements include: (a) the regular allocations of
budgetary funds for Health and Education; (b) submission of annual work
programs and budgets of each implementiag agency; (c) submission of the
general work program and budget of the PCU; (d) annual meetings with donors
to review progress; and (e) monthly replenishment of the project account
with counterpart funds.
9.    Justification.  The Project will initiate actions aimed at equity and
efficiency of social programs thereby protecting the poor against declining
access to essential social services. In the short term, the project will
have the following benefits: (a) increased access to PHC services and public
health programs (such as immunization and family planning); (b) qualitative
improvements in primary education through targeted operational inputs; (c)
improved nutrition and food security in poor areas; and (d) pilot
interventions in the areas of women-in-development, environment and
community based initiatives. In the longer term, the policy developments in
population, environment, food security, women-in-development, the capacity
building for public/private sector coordination in social service delivery,
and the strengthening of the statistical data base, are expected to set the
groundwork for future investments in social sectors.
10.   Risks.  The proposed operation presents two significant risks.  The
first risk is the cross-sectoral nature of the operation which might
overstretch managerial capabilities. This has been addressed by: (a) the
establishment of the PCU; (b) the decentralization of management
accountability to each implementing agency involved in the project combined
with the necessary institutional strengthening; and (c) the involvement of
several NGOs with proven managerial capabilities as executing agencies. The
other significant risk is the financial sustainability of incremental
recurrent expenditures implied by the proposed operation. This risk is
being addressed by: (a) improving cost recovery through the development of
cost sharing/risk sharing mechanisms at the community level; (b) including
the regular allccations of budgetary funds for Health and Education as a
project covenant; and (c) maintaining a coordinated external support to
social expenditures until sustained economic growth has taken place.
11.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
