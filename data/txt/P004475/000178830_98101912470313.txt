1. FISHERY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT
1.01      The potential for the expansion of the Philippine fishery industry
is significant.  Over the 1973-77 period, fish production grew at an average
of nearly 6% p.a. from 1.2 million to 1.5 million metric tons (MT).  In 1977
the Philippine :;shery industry accounted for about 5% of GNP and employed
about 900,000 people, or 5% of the total labor force.  Marine fishery
accounted for about 90% of production in 1977, and surveys of potential yields
indicate that production could be more than doubled with appropriate tech-
nology, support services and trained manpower. Currently about 95% of
production is consumed locally, as fish is a staple of the Philippine diet
and constitutes about half of the national intake of protein.  Fish exports,
though relatively small, grew by an average of 37% p.a. between 1973 and 1977;
however, due to the high local demand for fish, the volume of imports has been
almost three times as large as that of exports.
Fishery Grounds and Potential Yield
1.02      The Philippines comprises over 7,000 islands and has. 17,500 km of
coastline which shelters numerous fishing ports in its coves and inlets. The
aquatic resources of the Philippines exist in the different water bodies
detailed in Table 1.1.

1.03      Research indicates an annual sustainable yield from marine fishing
grounds of between 2.5 million MT and 3 million MT, which suggests that
present yields could be doubled without decreasing fishery resources.  The
inland fishery resources area is estimated to cover 2.9 million hectares (ha),
only about one tenth of v.'hich is used for fish farming. While there is a
growing concern about the ecological impact of a major expansion of fishponds,
especially in r.angrove swamps, fishery experts estimate that the present
average harvest of 800 kg/ha/year can be more than doubled when fishponds are
fully developed using modern technology.
Actual and Tar2et Production
1.04      The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) of the Ministry
of Natural Resources has compiled estimates of fish production in the
Philippines as shown in Table 1.2.

1.05      The Fishery Industry Development Council (FIDC) under the Ministry
of Natural Resources has prepared an Integrated Fisheries Development Plan
for 1978-87, whfch has the principal objectives of: (a) raising fish
production to attain self sufficiency in fish/i and increase fishery exports;
and (b) improving fishery resources management. Based on the Government's
targeted growth rates for the industry, fish production can be projected
as shown in Table 1.3. The table indicates an increase in the shares of
commercial and inland fisheries in total production, but a decline in the
share of municipal fishery; however, municipal fishery w-uld continue to
account for the largest percentage of total fish production.

1.06      To attain the above objectives, the Government has identified
problem areas in the fishery industry and devised strategies to solve them.
Principal issues are related to fishery management and stock assessment,
fishing technology, extension, handling/processing/marketing, credit and
trained manpower.
Principal Issues and Strategy
1.07      Fishery Management and Stock Assessment.  Fishery production in
some areas is reported to be declining in terms of the catch per vessel; for
instance, production in Manila Bay is estimated to have declined to 50% of the
1945 catch. Demersal (bottom) fishery in the Central Visayan Seas appears
to have decreased while pelagic (surface) fishery appears to have increased.
Effective management of fishery resources requires continuous research on
the extent of over- and under-fishing of marine waters. Available information
is limited to oceanographic data of the Philippine Sea (mostly gathered by
/1 About 10% of current consumption is imported.

foreign researchers) and limnological studies of freshwater resources of
Laguna de Bay.  The Government plans to:  (a) conduct similar studies of other
water resource to lmprove data on the optimal productivity of water bodies and
to detect changes in their ecology; and (b) develop local research capability.
1.08      Fishine Technoloev.  Marine fishing technology appropriate for
Philippine waters continues to develop. Municipal fishing uses bancas, which
are usually outrig3er dugout canoes, and bigger boats, which are constructed
from lumber. Although about 40% of municipal fishing boats are motorized,
the rest are operated by paddles., oars, or sails. Most municipal boats use
only one type of gear (e.g., gill nets, beach seines and multiple lines),
though production could be increased by the use of alternative gear.  In
commercial-fishery, about half the vessels are more than ten years old and
about 90% of the bigger boats were purchased secondhand from other countries.
The condition of the boats confines their operations to depths of less than 50
fathoms. Most commercial fishing vessels lack equipment and accessories (such
as navigation aids, winches, drums, masts and derricks) which, if installed,
could double the fish catch per vessel.  As with the smaller boats, most
vessels use only one type of fishing gear but could be more effective with
different types of gear.  It is estimated that training for proper operation
of vessel equipment and gear comld contribute to increasing productivity by
30%.
1.09      Different from marine fishing technology, some aquaculture tech-
uology/l is available on an experimental basis, and among progressive fisher-
men. The Government plans to (a) develop indigenous marine technology and
expertise among fishermen in navigation and boat engineering; (b) transfer
available aquaculture technology to fishermne; and (c) increase support of a
loan scheme for needed investment.
1.10      Extension.  The fishery extension service has not yet been fully
exploited as a neans of transferring available technology to fishermen. BFAR
is the main agency for fishery extension /2 and runs about 50 demonstration
stations through its regional offices. In 9t77 these stations employed about
500 agents, an average of one extension worker to 1,000 small-scale fishermen.
This ratio varied from I to 300 im Regioa gII to 1 to 3,000 in Region VIII.
Lj  This includes a plankton methLd and'platfQrm method of fertilization in
brackishwater aquaculture, which produces 2.000 kg/ha/yr; sex reversal
of tilaDia and nonosex cuLture in freshwater aquaculture, which yields
4,000 kg/ha/yr; and in maric=Lture, ropeculture of mussels, oyster
culture and seaweed culture.
/2 Other governnent agencles, =nirersities amd colleges provide an extension
service to fisherett in their immediate vicinity. The latter include

Roughly 20% of the extension workers were fishery degree holders, 60%' fishery
diploma holders, and the remaining 20% nonfishery graduates from colleges and
secondary schools.  Most extension staff specialize in inland fishery or
general marine biology, and few are familiar with boat building techniques or
marine and processing engineering.  The Government intends to increase the
average ratio of extension workers to fishermen to about 1 to 400, a ratio
comparable to those in countries that have developed fishery industries.  BFAR
is expected to increase its extension force about fivefold in the next decade.
The new positions are to be filled by graduates in marine fishery specializa-
tions and those who have pratical skills such as boat building.  BFAR's
recurrent expenditure (over P 80 million in 1978) is expected to increase by
an average of 10% p.a. (at 1978 prices), with roughly 30% of its budget
allocated to support the extension service (up from 15% in 1978).
1.11      Handlinz/ProcessinR/Marketing.  Due to inadequate handling, process-
ing and marketing, 20-30% of the fish catch is spoiled.  The warm and humid
climate of the Philippines contributes to the spoilage, most of which occurs
within 24 hours of capture.  Proper handling of the catch would decrease
spoilage and could increase marketable catch by about 10%.  Commercial vessels
use refrigeration units on board, but methods of icing suitable for small-
scale fishing operations need to be developed and adopted by an increased
number of fishermen.  Other fish preservation methods such as salting,
smoking, drying, marinading and fermenting are of low quality and most of the
fish products are sold exposed and unpackaged, which result in low prices and
limited markets for these fish products.  The Government plans to intensify
research related to fish processing techniques and to urge fishermen to adopt
such techniques.
1.12      Fish catches are often not efficiently distributed and marketed.
Distribution is hampered by poor roads and land transporation facilities,
inadequate shipping and air freight services, and insufficient information on
marketing possibilities and regional demands.  The Government has recently
established a Philippine Fish Marketing Authority (PFMA) responsible for
developing and managing fishing ports and marketing facilities, and monitoring
market information.  The Authority prepared a ten-year National Fish Marketing
Infrastructure Program in 1978, which includes the establishment of 30 munici-
pal and 14 cor=ercial fishing ports and markets throughout the country.  A
northern Palawan project assisted by the Asian Development Bank will develop
marketing facilities that benefit small-scale fishermen.  The Bank is also
considering extending financing for a small-scale fisheries development
project.  This project would provide marketing opportunities for small-scale
fish producers in the Samar Sea area as well as institutional support for
agencies such as BFAR, FIDC and PFMA, so that they can offer a more effective
production service to small-scale fishermen.  The Cold Chain Project of the
Ministry of Natural Resources will further benefit municipal fishery by
setting up a network of icemaking, freezing and cold storage facilities to
complement 16 existing ice plants and cold storage facilities.



m6-
1.13      Credit Facilities.  The availability of credit is an essential
part of an integrated fishery development strategy (paras. 1.08-1.09).  In
the past, groups of 6-21 municipal fishermen obtained loans to purchase
boats and gear through the Municipal Fisheries Financing Program implemented
by the rural banking system, and through the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP). In 1975 and 1976 the DBP also financed a large-scale
credit program for motorization of bancas.  However, serious repayment
problems resulted from insufficient understanding of the credit process
involved in the selection of borrowers, and in the supervision and collection
of the loans.  In September 1978, the FIDC's Technical Board for Agricultural
Credit endorsed a new credit program for small- and medium-scale fishery
similar in concept to the Masagana 99 program for rice growers.  FIDC coordi-
nates the program with the support of BFAR in extension, and evaluation of
borrowers and loan collection; PFMA in marketing; the Ministry of Local Gov-
ernment and Cooperative Development in organization of cooperatives; and the
DBP/the Philippines National Bank/the Central Bank-rural banks in granting
loans.  In 1978, the Ministry of the Budget released P 5 million for rural
bank lending on an experimental basis for priority investment areas and for
projects identified by BFAR regional offices.
1.14      Funds for commercial fishermen who operate vessels of 45 gross tons
and above and for inland fishery operations are available through the DBP with
the assistance of the Bank's Fisheries Credit Projects (Loan 891-PH approved
in 1973 and Loan 1270-PH approved in 1976).  On completion of these projects,
a total of US$42 million will have been loaned to private fishery operators to
improve fishing vessels and gear, ice plants, slipways, and fishponds. The
Bank is presently considering a third fisheries credit project with similar
objectives.
1.15      In summary, the Philippine fishery industry appears to be largely a
subsistence activity bound by traditional technology. The planned changes in
the production structure (para. 1.05), technology and support services (e.g.,
ports, credit, extension), however, indicate a period of transition from
traditional subsistence fishing to efficient commercialized operations.  Suc-
cessful implementation of these changes requires the provision of appropri-
ately trained manpower.
1.16      Trained Manpower.  The fishery industry has an estimated 900,000
workers, i.e., about 10% of all agricultural workers and about 5% of the
total work force.  Roughly 18% of fishery workers are wage/salary earners,
66% self-employed, 2% employers and 14% unpaid family workers./l A majority
of 67% are engaged in municipal fishery, 5% in commercial fishery, 22% in
inland fishery and 6% in fish processing.  The educational profile of fisher-
men by occupation is given in Table 1.4.  The educational attainment of
fishery workers (4%O had education above the primary level in 1976) is low
compared with average educational attainment in the country (23% of the
il Hereafter "employment" refers to workers in all these categories.



-7.-
total work force had education above the primary level in 1965) and is even
low compared with other agricultural workers (of whom 9% had education above
the primary level in 1965).  It is particularly significant that the educa-
tional attainment of over 80% of extension workers in the country is limited
to full or partial primary education.  Increased technology in fi"hery would
require higher levels of educational attainment.

1.17      Based on the Government's fish production targets (Table 1.3),
employ-ment in the fishery industry is projected to increase to 1.4 million
by 1990. Table 1.5 projects employment in municipal, commercial and inland
fisheries to grow at 2.0%, 4.0% and 7.5% p.a., respectively, which is lower
than comparable government projections (3.3%, 6.7% and 11.3%).  The employ-
ment projections of Table 1.5 are based on the assumption that development
programs for the industry would increase worker productivity, primarily
through technological improvements in fishing crafts, gear and methods,
whereas Government projections assume that worker productivity would remain
constant;  The annual rate of employment growth in the secondary subsector is
assumed to be about equal to that of the primary subsector as a whole, since



-8-
processing activities are closely related to fish catch.  The increase in
extension workers is based on the ratios of 1 worker to 10 vessels for
commercial fishery (a total increase of 300 extension agents), and 1 worker
to 400 fishermen for municipal (1,900 new extension agents) and inland
(1,200 new agents) fishery.  The need for extension workers in processing
(200) assumes that half of the workers would be trained by managers/operators
and half by extension workers at the ratio of 1 to 400.  The increase in
researchers (700) is based on the ratio of 1 researcher to 5 extension
workers.

1.19      Based on the broad education and occupation matrix (para. 1.16),
it is calculated as shown in Table 1.7 that the formal fishery training
program needs to produce about 1,300 graduates each year to fill professional
(200) and technical (1,100) positions.  Since existing institutions graduate
about 400 degree holders and 1,000 diploma holders annually, this need can be
met quantitatively but the quality of fishery training does not prepare
graduates adequately for the positions they fill due to changing requirements
of the industry (para. 1.10).  Sufficient numbers of persons with secondary
educatign and below are expected to join the fishery industry; however, a
large-scale nonformal fishery training program will be needed to upgrade the
skills of new workers and those already employed in the fishery industry
(para. 1.09).

2. FISHERY TRAINING /1 AND RESEARCH
2.01      Overview.  Fishery training in the Philippines is of more recent
origin than agriculture training. The oldest fishery training institutions
opened in the early 1940s at Catbalogan and at Navotas (the Philippine
Institute of Fisheries Technology - PIFT); agricultural training dates from
the 1920s when several farm training schools were established.  By 1957 there
were only seven fishery institutions; the administration of six of these
institutions was then transferred from the Bureau of Fisheries of the
Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources to the Bureau of Public
Schools of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC).  The seventh insti-
tution, PIFT, was relocated at Diliman as a part of the University of the
Philippines and became the UPCF.  Since the early 1960s, the number of fishery
training institutions has risen rapidly and by 1977 there were about 50 post-
secondary institutions. This rapid growth, constrained by financial and human
resources, has prevented fishery training from attaining quality and rele-
vance. Fishery research in the Philippines is also at an early stage of
development, and local research capacity needs to be strengthened.
Research
2.02      Overall responsibility for coordinating agriculture-related
research rests with the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources
/1  In this report, "training" is used to cover both vocation-related
"training" and general "education."

Research (PCARR).  The FIDC (para. 1.05) assists the Council in coordinating
fishery research activities carried out by several agencies (Table 2.1).
Peseirch is funded by the Government and multilateral and bilateral
agencies, including the Southeast Asia Fisheries Development Council
(SEAFDEC), UNDP, USAID and West German authorities.  Foreign researcners
often participate in studies to supplement local research capability.

The thrust of research in the Philippines has been in aquaculture.  Assisted
by USAID, UNDP and ASEAN regional governments, staff and facilities are
strong at CLSU-FAC, UPCF-BAC and SEAFDEC.  In comparison, research in marine
fishery lags behind.  UPCF has recently begun studies on marine resources
assessment, fishing gear and fish processing with German and Danish assist-
ance extended to the 1978-81 period.  Further development in these areas is
needed.
Formal Training
2-03      Administration.  Overall responsibility for the education sector
rests with the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC). The National Board
of Education (NBE) is the principal agency involved in formulating overall
sectoral policy and making recommendations to the Minister of Education.  In
1977, the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education was formed as an advisory
body to the NBE for all agricultural education including animal science,
veterinary medicine, crop science, fishery and forestry education. The
activities of the Technical Panel include the development of a national system
of accreditation for agricultural training programs, technical assistance in
the supervision, inspection and regulation of all institutions giving agricul-
tural training, and recommendation of the allocation of resources for
agricultural education.
2.04      Postsecondary fishery institutions are administered by the MEC
except for one private institution and five chartered institutions.  The
chartered institutions, which are governed by their own boards of regents, are
the Colleges of Fisheries of the University of the Philippines, the CLSU, the
Mindanao State University, the Cagayan State University and the Bicol State
University. The Bureau of Higher Education in the MEC is responsible for the
supervision of fishery training.  At the local level, fishery training
institutions are supervised through a regional education director at each of
the 13 regional offices.
2.05      Programs.  The formal fishery training program consists of (a)
a four-year postsecondary course leading to a bachelor of science degree in
fishery (BSF) in one of the three main areas (i.e., marine fishery, inland
fishery and fish processing), and (b) a three-year postsecondary course
leading to a diploma in one of the three main areas (i.e., fish capture,
culture and processing).  The BSF curriculum allocates about 18% of 138 units
to languages, 15% to humanities, 20% to sciences, 25% to general fishery and
22% to a specialized fishery area.  The diploma program uses a curriculum
comprising 120 units for graduation, of which only one-third is allocated to
technical and practical fishery subjects.  An appropriate ratio of technical
and practical subjects to theoretical ones is about 3 to 2.  While the degree
program aims to produce junior fishery scientists, technologists, teachers and
administrators, the diploma program aims to produce technicians mainly for
employment by the Government and the fishery industry.



- 13 -
There were fishery schools at the secondary level until 1975,/1 when all
secondary schools adopted the same curriculum following the recommendations
of a task force.appointed by the National Board of Education.
2.06      Enrollnents.  Enrollments in tertiary fishery institutions have
grown rapidly in the 1970s.  In 1971/72, only 910 students were enrolled in
tertiary fishery courses, which accounted for 1% of the total enrollment in
agricultural education at that level. By 1977/78, enrollment had risen to
5,400, representing 5% of tertiary agricultural enrollments.  Most students
in fishery training are enrolled in public institutions, though the reverse
is true of students in other fields of study at the tertiary level (Table
2.2).

2.07      The chartered institutions (para. 2.04) are generally considered
the leaders in fishery training and together they account for 5% of fishery
enrollments. The UPCF is considered the institution that gives the most
comprehensive fishery training program.  It offers both degree and diploma
programs, and in 1977 enrollment in these programs totaled about 700 (Table
2.3).  The UPCF also enrolls about 50 students in its master's degree in
fishery (MSF) program, which presently offers an aquaculture specialization
only.
/1 Nearly 70 schools enrolling about 20,000 students are still called fishery
secondary schools; these are in essence comprehensive schools that
allocate the learning time for practical arts (about 10% of the total) to
fishery subjects.

2.08      Financing.  Government spending on education (through the Ministry
of Education) has increased from P 1,681 million in 1975 to P 2,605 million
in 1977 (at current prices), which represented about 3% and 3.5% of GNP
respectively. Over the same period, spending on secondary and tertiary
fishery training decreased, from P 36 million in 1975 to P 26 million in _
1977 (at current prices). This decrease has been one cause of the inability
of the fishery training institutions to improve the quality pf their
programs. However, the allocation in the 1979 budget rose to P 39 million,
indicating the growing priority attached to fishery training.
Nonformal Training
2.09      Nonformal training is provided through the Fishermen's Training
Center at Cavite City and a variety of ad hoc programs. The Center, estab-
lished in 1974 with UNDP/FAO assistance, is under BFAR.  It offers six-month
courses for skippers and engineers of commercial fishing boats, and in 1977
trained 170 course participants in four groups. Nonformal training for small-
scale fishery is mainly provided through demonstrations, though only limited
equipment and boats are available. Other nonformal training is provided on an
ad hoc basis through extension activities (para. 1.10). These include short
courses on fish catching, processing and fish culture techniques run in the
villages by small teams of field extension workers.

Princioal Issues
2.10      Inadecuate Manaqement-  Fishery research and training in the
Philippines suffer from weak planning and control.  The MEC's role is
limited to the establishment of academic standards; the National Bcard of
Education and the present Technical Panel (para. 2.03) can devote only
limited attention to fishery training because of their wide range of
responsibilities.  Accurate statistical data on fishery institutions are
absent and inadequate planning has resulted in a structural imbalance
between the suoply and the need for trained manpower.  Fishery training
institutions have proliferated *in response to social and political factors
at the local level.  As a consequence, insufficient consideration has been
given to some forms of training such as inservice training of fishermen and
training in marine fishery.  The uncoordinated development of training has
had an adverse effect on research; since most students (about 70%)
specialize in inland fishery, few graduates can be recruited for marine
fishery research.  Also, the need to use foreign researchers (para. 2.02)
has contributed to the general orientation of studies rather than the
development of indigenous technology (para.s 1.08-1.09).  These problems
would call for stronger and more effective planning.
2.11      Lack of a Coherent Fisherv Training System.  The Philippines has
failed to establish a coherent fishery training system that provides the kinds
of research and the levels and types of training needed by the fishery indus-
try. Largely this is due to ad hoc growth of the fishery training sector.
While the UPCF has developed as an apex institution for fishery research and
training, it has been unable to develop important research programs in such
fields as marine fishery, fishery engineering and management and fishing gear
and boat developments.  Its inability to become a lead institution in these
fields is related to:  (a) inadequate facilities (it has only five
laboratories and one lecture room with sufficient capacity to adequately train
about 200 of the 500 students who are enrolled); and (b) its location (the
campus at Diliman provides no direct access to the sea and no land for further
expansion). Degree and diploma level training is also given at about 50 other
institutions, but these programs fail to produce appropriately trained
manpower for the fishery industry because the programs are not practically
oriented to produce fishery technicians (para. 2.05).  Most teaching staff
have inadequate experience in the industry, and even with such experience they
are disadvantaged in providing good training due to the absence or inadequacy
of equipment and facilities.  Nonformal training is not given on a routine
basis, although such information and skills as relating fishing technology,
marketing, and credit need to be extended to small-scale fishermen to help
increase their production (paras. 1.08, 1.11, 1.13).  Thus there is a need to
establish a system of fishery training comprising a center of excellence for
high level research and training, a technician level training program, and a
continuous nonformal training program for fishermen.
2.12      Low Quality.  Fishery training suffers from low quality.  Both at
the degree and the di?loma level, graduates are poorly trained due to weak
teaching staff, inadequate teaching equipment and facilities, and the type



- 16 -
of training given.  The qualifications of staff are generally low:  at the
UPCF, 13 out of 41 staff (33%) have a graduate degree (beyond BSF); and
throughout the country, the percentage is only about 20%. Thus most staff
have degrees equal to those granted to the students they teach. An important
factor affecting the quality of training is the level of training expenditure,
which has been declining in the 1970s during a period of rapid expansion
(para. 2.08). Limited equipment and facilities have been provided for prac-
tical training; particularly serious for fishery training is the lack of
training vessels at most institutions. If provided, vessels are mostly
outrigger boats which are unsuitable for open-sea fishing with modern fishing
gear. This results in training which is academic rather than practical, and
which does not prepare students for employment in the fishery industry. With
regard to employment opportunities, diploma students are at an added disad-
vantage, because most graduates seek government positions which require either
a diploma plus one year's job experience or a degree. This requirement con-
tributes to the present high proportion of diploma holders (about 30%) who
transfer to degree programs despite the country's need for well-trained
technicians. This result in undesirable pressures to introduce open degree
programs at diploma-granting institutions. Such new degree programs are
usually introduced without corresponding upgrading of staff and facilities,
which results in enrollment beyond the institution's capacity and a further
decline in quality. The quality of fishery training therefore needs to be
improved by staff upgrading and additional recruitment of adequately trained
staff; increased provision of facilities and equipment (particularly training
vessels); a diploma program with a significant amount of practical training;
and facilitation of the appointment and career development of diploma holders
in the government extension service.
Government Strategy
2.13      As part of its strategy for integrated fishery development, the
Government intends to further improve fishery research and training for
the development of management, technology, marketing and appropriate
manpower. To achieve these goals, the Government plans to strengthen
planning of fishery programs, establish a coordinated national strategy,
and introduce measures to improve the quality and relevance of fishery
research and training.
2.14      Management.  Fishery training will continue to be managed as part of
agricultural training (para. 2.03), but the Government further plans to estab-
lish a committee for each agricultural training subsector under the Technical
Panel. The first of these, a Fishery Education Technical Committee, was
created in 1979. It is headed by the Dean of UPCF, who is also a member of
the Technical Panel. The Committee is composed of 12 representatives from
the public and private sectors concerned with fishery development. The main
functions of this Committee are to: (a) monitor fishery manpower need and
supply information to the Technical Panel; (b) adopt a national system of
accreditation; (c) evaluate suggested course changes; and (d) assist in the
supervision, inspection and regulation of fishery institutions.

2.15      Rationalization of a Svstem.  The government strategy for
agricultural training involves consolidation within the framework of an apex
national institution, leading institutions serving the three main geographic
zones (i.e., Luzon, Visavas and Mindanao), regional institutes of technology/l
and nonformal regional training centers.  A similar strategy is being adopted
for fishery training.  This entails developing a University of the Philippines
College of Fisheries in the Visayas (L?VCF) as an apex national institution
and to serve as the leading fishery training institution in the Visayas.  The
UPCF at Diliman will be transferred to the Visayas (Miagao) to form the core
College of the new University of the Philippines in the Visayas (UPV).  In the
other two main regions, the present Colleges of Fisheries of the CLSU and the
Mindanao State University (MSU) will continue to be developed as the leading
institutions serving the Luzon and Mindanao regions. Regional institutes of
fishery technology will be established by improving existing institutions and,
in regions without an institution suitable for upgrading, by establishing new
institutes. The Government plans to develop nonformal fishery training
centers adjacent to the regional institutes of fishery technology.  This
system should provide a basic framework to produce an improved quality of
fishery training for professional manpower (UPVCF, CLSUCF, MSUCF) and for
technical manpower (regional institutes of fishery technology and nonformal
training centers).
2.16      The Government has already made progress towards establishing this
fishery training system.- The Fishery Education Technical Committee has been
created under the Technical Panel (para. 2.14), and a preliminary step has
been taken to create UPV.  This University is being established as part of a
national strateg7 under the current five-year plan which aims to disperse the
population from the congested Metro Manila area to less populated rural areas
and simultaneously to relocate UPCF to a place more suited to fishery research
and training. UPV will be located in M4iagao, Western Visayas (Region VI),
about 40 km west of Iloilo City, where 1,200 ha of land have been allocated
for the campus. The UPV will be an autonomous university headed by a
chancellor who will report to the President of the UP system.  According to
the sic-year development plan of tTPV, it will initially be organized with
three degree-granting units:  a College of Fisheries, a College of Arts and
Sciences, and a School of Development Management. A graduate school will also
be set up to coordinate and provide administrative support to degree programs.
In addition, a Philippine Center for Regional Development is expected to be
established in UPV as a joint undertaking with the National Economic
Development Authority.  In about the third year of the UPV development plan, a
/]  The intitctes of technology will form local centers for training around
vhich smaIler institutions can be developed.  This arrangement offers
the advavtages of shared facilities and joint training programs.



- 18 -
Marine Sciences Center at Iloilo will be organized as a research unit, and
by the fifth year, Schools of Development Technology and Health Services
will be established. Before their establishment, degree programs in these
fields will be offered by the College of Arts and Sciences. At full
capacity UPV expects to enroll about 5,000 students in undergraduate and
graduate programs.
2.17      Quality.  The Government expects that consolidation and rationali-
zation of fishery training and research should effect quality improvements.
The establishment of the UPVCF as a leading institution in fishery training
will be pursued through staff development programs and the provision of more
and better facilities at its new coastal location.  Research will be
strengthened by improving the quality of graduates remaining in research
programs and by UPVCF's emphasis on marine fishery training. The Government
strategy also entails similar improvements in staff, facilities, training
vessels and curricula at the regional institutions.  Curricula have been
revised to produce graduates with specialization in one area of fishery
study. For example, a revised curriculum for the BSF in marine fishery
allocates 44% of the total time to marine fishery, 34% to fishery and
sciences and 22% to languages and humanities, while the present curriculum
allocates 22%, 45% and 33% respectively (para. 2.05). At the regional
institutes of fishery technology, the present BSF will be phased out.  Over-
all the new curriculum of the institutes qill allocate about 60% of course
time to technical and practical instruction (para. 2.05).  Students will
receive a diploma after two years' study on campus and upon completion of
a one-year apprenticeship program.  This apprenticeship program will be
introduced with the help of the Fisheries Training Division and the
Fisheries Extension Division of BFAR, and the private fishery sector.
World Bank Participation
2.18      The World Bank Group has financed five education projects in the
Philipprines for a total of US$70.7 million.  Bank lending has aimed at the
development of agricultural and technical manpower (Loan 393-PH,
Credit 349-PH and Loan 1374-PH) and improvements in primary and secondary
education (Loan 1224T-PH and Loan S-8).
2.19      Bank lending to agricultural training has supported the Govern-
ment's program to create leading national institutions in different agri-
cultural training programs, as well as quality regional institutions and
nonformal training centers (para. 2.15). The First Education Project
(Loan 393-PH, 1964), completed in 1973, assisted in de-veloping the
University of the Philippines College of Agriculture at Los Banos into a
national center of excellence.  The Second Education Project (Credit 349-?H,
1973), completed in December 1978, began the development of two regional
agricultural colleges (in Luzon and Mindanao) and established six barrio
development schools adjacent to them.  Thirteen agricultural high schools
were also developed to increase the relevance of secondary education with an
agriculcultural bias.  The Fourth Education Project (Loan 1374-PH, 1977) was



- 19 -
designed to strengthen the disciplines of animal science and veterinary
medicine, forestry and crop sciences at UP in Los Banos; develop a regional
agricultural college in the Visayas; and introduce nonformal training to
farmers. W4ithin the Bank's emphasis on agricultural training, the fishery
training subsector has not yet been covered.  The proposed project would
therefore focus on development of the subsector and complement past lending in
agricultural training.
2.20      Previous education projects have generally been successfully
implemented and met their development impact targets.  For exampLe,
Loan 393-PH was successful in assisting the Agricultural University, Los Banos
to become a leading institution in its field in the Asia region.  Loan 1374-PH
is further strengthening this University. Good progress has also been made in
Loan 1224T-PH towards achieving the key institution building feature of that
project.  But despite their general success, earlier projects have met with
some implementation constraints, which the design of the proposed project
would reflect. To date one completion report and performance audit has been
prepared (First Education Project, report No. 820).  The main lessons learned
from that Project relate to:  (a) the importance of assuring the operating
budget, counterpart funds, and incentives for retaining high quality staff
especially when the campus relocation of an institution is involved;
(b) implementation procedures regarding procurement and disbursement; and
(c) early preparation of a campus plan. Lessons learned from projects under
implementation relate to provisions for adequate staff/student ratios and
advanced project preparation prior to appraisal.
3. THE PROJECT
Obiectives and Scope
3.01      In support of the Government's Integrated Fishery Development
Strategy (para. 1.05), the proposed project would help the Government
strengthen fishery technology and human resources by establishing a national
system of fishery training (para. 2.15).  The system would comprise the
programs and institutions which would:  (a) strengthen fishery research;
(b) produce appropriately qualified professional and technical manpower
required for the fishery sector; and (c) improve the knowledge and skills
of fishermen. /1
3.02      The project would support the following institutions:

3.03      OS;ecti  s.  The assistance to UPVCF would help the Government
create an apex institution as part of its national fishery training program.
The UPVCF would play a leading role in fishery research and training (para.
2.15) to develop necessary technology and professional manpower for the
country's fishery development program.  The UPVCF would also supply teachers
for postsecondary fishery traintng institutions and provide workshops and
seminars to update faculty's technical knowledge and skills.
3.04     -Location.  The UPVCF would occupy about one tenth of the proposed
UPV campus (para. 2.16). Miagao would be an appropriate location for UPVCF
because:  (a) it is adjacent to rich marine fishery grounds which offer nat-
ural sea laboratories; (b) it is close (15 km) to the SEAFDEC Aquaculture
Center (para. 2.02), which would facilitate sharing laboratories and exchange
of staff and ideas; (c) it is close (45 km) to the UP Brackishwater Aquacul-
ture Center in Leganes (Table 2.1), which could provide supplementary courses
to graduate students; and (d) there is a natural harbor at Guibungan, 5 km
east of the site, where the college's training research vessel can dock.
3.05      Research/Training Program.  The College of Fisheries, together
with its Brackishwater Aquaculture Center and Institute of Fisheries
Research and Development,/2 would conduct research with major emphasis on
marine fishery and fishery management.  The college would adopt the new ,
curriculum (para.  2.17) and offer:  (a) a PhD in aquaculture and fishery
biology; (b) an MSF in aquaculture, fishery biology, fish processing
technology and fishing science and technology; and (c) a BSF in marine
fishery, inland fishery, fish processing technology and fishery business
management.
3.06      Enrollment and Output.  The College would have the capacity to
increase enrollment (including ,MSF and PhD enrollment) from 740 to 850 by
1985/86 (Table 3.1).  The projected BSF enrollment by specialization is as
follows:

11  Proposed outlay excludes contingencies.
/2  Tlec Institute would also be transferred from Diliman to Miagno.



- 22 -
These enrollment levels would reflect the emphasis on marine fishery (40% of
enrollment) and fishery management (10%), which will be important in future
fishery development (paras. 1.01, 1.05). The College would enroll 40
students in the MSF course and 10 In the PhD course. Students would be
selected for the BSF program through the UP-administered entrance examina-
tion. There are 19 testing centers throughout the country and UPVCF could
recruit students from different parts of the country. Many students in
the graduate programs are expected to come from the research staff of BFAR
and other agencies.
3.07      The number of UPVCF graduates would increase from 140 to 180 p.a.
This figure assumes that the wastage rate would improve from the present 40%
to 20% after the college's move from Diliman to Miagao (due to such factors
as improved quality and dormitory facilities). By 1984 all graduates would
have degrees, as the diploma courses would have been phased out.
3.08      Staff Requirement.  To maintain the current average staff/student
ratio of 1 to 12 (Table 2.3),/1  the present degree program staff of 41
would need to be increased to 72 by recruiting graduates of fishery
colleges.  The staff requirement by specialization is given in Table 3.3.
To ensure the effective transfer of the UPCF staff at Diliman to the new
campus at Miagao, the Government has assured the implementation of the
incentive program, as proposed in the UPV Development Plan, which includes
housing and transportation allowances.

Assurances were also obtained that a teaching staff/student ratio satisfactory
to the Bank would be maintained.

students, an apprepriate staff/student ratio at a higher technical
education institution ranges from 1:10 to 1:15.

3.09      Project-Financed Items. The project would assist the development of
UPVCF, including the Institute of Fishery Development and Research, through
the provision of buildings, equipment, furniture and books comprising lecture
rooms, laboratories, a freshwater fishpond system, a library, administration
offices, a student union, and dormitories and housing for 75% of students and
teaching staff.
3.10      Technical assistance would be provided through specialist services
and overseas fellowships (Annex 2). Specialist services would comprise 2.5
man-years in hydrology, planktology and fishery management and economics to
develop the training program. Fellowships would comprise graduate training,
as well as nondegree training for staff needing short observation tours and
retraining as shown below:

/a  The allocation of man-years is based on the assumptions that a
fellow uses two years for MSF, three years for PhD and one year
for nondegree upgrading training. Accordingly, there would be 18
fellows for MSF, 9 fellows for PhD and 27 fellows for nondegree
training.
To maintain a staff/student ratio of about 1 to 12, the selection of fellows
would be staggered throughout the project implementation period (Table 3.5).

Assurances were obtained that (a) specialists would be appointed on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) fellows would be selected in
accordance with selection criteria and procedures for awards of fellowships
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.11      In addition, the project would include a fund for research projects
at UPVCF or contracted by UPCF to outside specialists or agencies. High
priority would be accorded to research projects in fishery engineering,
fishery economics and management, fishing gear development, and fishing boat
construction. Research proposals would be reviewed by a committee represented
by the members of PCARR, UPVCF, the Fishery Education Technical Committee
under the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education, and EDPITAF. The
Government and the Bank have agreed on selection criteria for research
projects to be financed by the project, and the Government assured that a
review committee with terms and composition satisfactory to the Bank would
be established at UPVCF by March 31, 1980.
Technical Manpower Training (Proposed Outlay US$33.2 million) /1
3.12      Objectives.  As part of the national fishery training program, the
proposed Regional Institutes of Fishery Technology would serve as regional
fishery training institutions (para. 2.15), and train technicians for the
fishery industry and extension service. In addition, the proposed project
would establish Regional Centers for Fishermen Training to assist the Govern-
ment in providing nonformal fishery training in support of its national fish-
ery training program. In-service programs would aim at: transferring avail-
able skills and knowledge to fishermen to help increase their production and
better their standard of living; and upgrading technical and administrative
skills of extension workers.
Regional Institutes of Fishery Technology - RIFTs
3.13      Location and Administration.  Seven RIFTs would be developed, six by
strengthening existing fishery training institutions and the seventh by creat-
ing a fishery training program at an agricultural college (Table 3.6). These
/1 Proposed outlay excludes contingencies.

institutions were selected because they are:  (a) appropriately distributed
throughout the country; and (b) have direct access to the sea. Five of the
seven institutions are administered by the MEC, while the Cagayan State
University and Bicol University are autonomous chartered institutions
(para. 2.04). ihese institutes would be supervised by the Fishery Education
Technical Committee (para. 2.14).

3.14      Training Program.  The proposed Institutes would offer a three-year
postsecondary program leading to a diploma in marine fishery,inland fishery
or fish preservation and marketing. The curriculum would be made more prac-
tical (para. 2.17); it would be revised by the participants of workshops con-
ducted by local and foreign experts, that begin about one year before the
Institutes open. Workshops would be held at the country's major fishery
training institutions. Each institute would send about 13 persons represent-
ing different subjects to the workshops. Assurances were obtained that the
BSF programs currently offered at the proposed project Institutes would be
discontinued by 1984 except for the degree programs offered at the Institute
at Zamboanga which provides good quality training and constitutes an important
source of potential teachers.



- 26 -
3.15      Enrollment and Output.  Each Regional Institute of Fishery Tech--
nology would have the capacity to enroll 450 students, including the third-
year students on the apprenticeship program, i.e.9 a total enrollment of
3,150, compared to enrollment at five institutions in 1977 of 1,000 students
in the degree program and 400 in the diploma program (Table 3.6)o Assuming an
annual progression rate of 90%, each Institute would expect to have 140
students in the first year and about 120 in the last year by 1984/85 when
operating at full capacity (Table 3.7). Enrollment in marine fishery would
account for almost half of total enrollment, while enrollment in inland
fishery and fish preservation and marketing would account for one third and
one quarter, respectively.

3.16      Assuming that 90% of the third year students would graduate suc-
cessfully and enter fishery-related employment, the proposed Institutes
would provide about 760 fishery technicians annually (about 30% of the
post-secondary graduates needed to meet manpower requirements over the
1980-90 period); the remaining manpower would be provided by other post-
secondary institutions. To ensure that future resources are directed to
quality improvement of fishery training, the Government assured that no new
public post-secondary fishery institutions would be established during the
project implemetation period unless recommended by the Technical Panel for
Agricultural Education based on the need for fishery manpower. The Government
also assured that the Ministry of Natural Resources would facilitate appoint-
ment and career advancement of the Institute's graduates.
3.17      Staff Requirement.  Staff of the RIFTs would need to be increased
from the present 78 to 210 (Table 3.8) when the Institutes are operating at
full capacity in order to keep a reasonable staff/student ratio (para. 3.08).
Many of the additional staff would be recruited from graduates of UPCF/UPVCF.
The Government assured that a teaching staff/student ratio satisfactory to
the Bank would be maintained.

3.18       Project-Financed Items.  The project would assist the establishment
of the Institutes through the provision of buildings comprising classrooms,
laboratories, libraries, housing and dormitories for 75% of teaching staff and
students. It would also provide furniture and equipment, including items
for programs in navigation, seamanship, fish culture, fish processing and
marine engineering.
3.19      The proposed project would provide training vessels, which would
be shared by the Regional Institutes and the Regional Centers for Fishermen
Training (Table 3.1). The training vessels /1 would include 16 fishing boats
ranging in size from 10 to 40 tons (340 tons total) and 68 smaller boats (16
surf boats, 24 catamarans, 24 bancas and 40 skiffs). The training vessels
would include all weather vessels suitable for year-round operation and
ocean-going vessels for open-sea fishing, which would be equipped to test
new fishing techniques for species not presently exploited by small-scale
fishermen. The annual operating cost of a vessel, including fuel, crew
salaries and maintenance, would range between IIS$4,000 and US$30,000.  The
provision of these fishing boats would allow students at the Institutes to
be trained at sea for 20 days per student per school year (about 10% of
total instruction time), and participants at the Centers to be trained at
sea for an average of 5 days per trainee per course (about 50% of total
instruction time) . The boats would provide about 50,000 days of sea
training to the 900 students in marine fishery at the seven Institutes,
excluding those on the apprenticeship program (para. 3.15), and to over
4,000 marine fishermen trained each year at the Centers. To ensure full
utilization, the Government assured that adequate budgets would be provided to
the proposed Institutes and Centers for full utilization and maintenance of
facilities, equipment and training vessels.
/1 The vessels would be built to meet the international safety standards
recommended by the Intergovernmental Hfarine Consultative Organization.



- 28 -
3.20      The project would also provide technical assistance through special-
ist services and fellowships to develop the curriculum and to strengthen the
quality of staff. One man-year of foreign specialist services would be
included to coordinate the workshops. For workshop trainers, 3.5 man-years
each of local and foreign specialist services would be provided; local
assistance would be provided through experts at institutions such as UPVCF
and BFAR. The fellowships would consist of 42 man-years of overseas gradu-
ate training, 28 man-years of nondegree overseas training, 28 man-years
of local graduate training and 30.5 man-years of local workshop training to
allow a 4 man-month fellowship per participant. The Government assured that
technical assistance would be awarded according to terms, conditions,
selection criteria and procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Regional Centers for Fishermen Training - RCFTs
3.21      Location and Administration.  The seven Centers would be located
adjacent to the Regional Institutes of Fishery Technology (Table 3.6). They
would be administered by BFAR which would appoint the head of each Center and
provide its operating budget. A Regional Fishery Training Development Com-
mittee, composed of the regional directors of the National Economic Develop-
ment Agency (chairman), of the MEC and of the Ministry of Natural Resources
(MNR) and the heads of the Institute and the Center, would be established to
coordinate joint activities. The Government has assured that such a Committee
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank would be set up by June 30,
1980 in each of the seven regions where the Institutes and the Centers would
be located.
3.22      Training Program and Trainees.  The Centers would conduct in-
service training for small-scale fishermen in marine fishery (fish capture),
inland fishery (fish harvest), and fish handling and preservation. To
permit fishermen to exploit presently underfished areas, the training would
teach marine fishermen how to operate fishing vessels ranging in size from
traditional municipal boats to those of larger commercial vessels. The
training would also help fishermen to improve fish handling and processing
methods in order to reduce spoilage of fish after capture and to cater to the
increased fish catch and the growing demand for high quality dried, salted,
smoked, pickled and fermented products. Brackishwater and freshwater fish
farming and mariculture would also be taught as means of increasing yields.
In addition to technology directly related to fish production, handling and
processing, the training program would include subjects such as bookkeeping,
carpentry, boat building and maintenance, small-scale farming (vegetable
production), credit and cooperatives that could improve the fisherman's
circumstances. The training program would be prepared at local workshops held
before the Centers begin operations (para. 3.14). Nine staff from each Center
would attend the workshops.
3.23      Courses would generally last one to two weeks, and each Center would
conduct about 12 such courses p.a. in each area of training. Each Center



would have the capacity to train 100 fishermen at a time, 50 in small-scale
marine fishery, 30 in inland fishery, and 20 in fish processing.  Thus, an
estimated 8,400 fishermen annually would receive in-service training at the
seven Centers. BFAR regional offices would be responsible for identifying
trainees and their expenses would be paid by the Government. In addition,
in-service training courses for extension workers would be conducted at the
Centers, about twice a year, to improve their technical and administrative
skills. Over 1,000 agents would expect to participate annually.
3.24      Staff Requirement.  Each Center would require five administrative
staff and a total of ten teaching staff in the areas of fishing gear tech-
nology, marine engineering, processing technology, marketing and cooperative
management, fish culture (brackishwater), fish culture (freshwater), boat
building, crew duties and mechanics, as well as a training vessel captain.
BFAR would be responsible for selecting prospective staff members from among
its own staff, fishery college graduates and those in the fishery industry.
Staff would be appointed with the approval of the Regional Fishery Develop-
ment Committee.
3.25      Project-Financed Items.  The project would provide classrooms,
simple basic equipment, housing for 75% of the staff and dormitories for all
trainees. The Centers and all the Institutes would share training vessels,
fishponds, net lofts, and all major laboratories and workshops (paras. 3.18,
3.19). The Government has drafted an acceptable memorandum of agreement
between the MEC and the Ministry of Natural Resources on mutual sharing of
facilities, and on ownership of and responsibility for maintenance and repair
of shared facilities.
3.26      Technical assistance would be provided through specialist services
and fellowships. One man-year of foreign specialist services would be allo-
cated for a fishery training specialist to coordinate the establishment of
the proposed Centers. In addition, 3.5 man-years each of local and foreign
specialist services would be provided to conduct workshops in different
subject areas for the Centers and the Institutes (para. 3.20), and 16 man-
years of local fellowships would allow a 3 man-month fellowship per partici-
pant. The project would also provide 24.5 man-years of overseas fellowships
for staff. This would allow each Center to send a key instructor in each of
the three main areas for one year's training and an administrator for a six-
month observation tour of a nonformal fishery training/extension program in
other countries. The Government assured that technical assistance would be
awarded according to terms, conditions, selection criteria and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Management (Proposed Outlay US$2.6 Million)
Management Support
3.27      A Fishery Education Division was set up in 1979 within EDPITAF to
take main responsibility for implementing the proposed project (para. 4.17).
The Division includes units dealing with data gathering, curriculum, physical



- 30 -
requirements and finance, and monitoring. About 1.5 man-years of specialist
services would be required to supplement local capabilities in campus planning
(3 man-months), naval architecture (12 man-months) and equipment specification
writing (3 man-months). EDPITAF's staff would be strengthened in these areas,
and in education statistics and finance through the provision of 8 man-years
of fellowships for overseas study tours.
Evaluation
3.28      Project achievements would be monitored and evaluated during imple-
mentation, and the development of local evaluation capability would ensure
continuing evaluation after project completion. Evaluation would analyze the
extent of achievement of specific project objectives (para. 3.01). It would
measure qualitative improvements in training, employability and job effec-
tiveness of graduates, and estimate the success of fishery training as a
national system. Special attention would be given to evaluating the Centers'
effectiveness in helping fishermen increase fish production, which would
involve such follow-up as to study change in their capability to obtain loans
and in their fishing techniques.
3.29      Data to be gathered and evaluation methods would be developed by a
Monitoring, Review and Research Division of EDPITAF in cooperation with the
Fishery Education Division. Assistance would be provided by the Fishery
Education Project Advisory Group, which was created in early 1979 as a con-
sultative and advisory body to assist EDPITAF in policy matters concerning
the establishment and operation of fishery institutions under the project./l
The group is composed of ten members, each representing a different public/
private agency involved in fishery development. The project would assist
EDPITAF by providing: (a) 2 man-years of foreign specialist services in
fishery training, economics and evaluation; (b) 10 man-years of local special-
ists in the same three fields; and (c) 2 man-years of overseas fellowships in
fishery economics/business management and in evaluation to strengthen the
analytical skills of EDPITAF staff. The Government agreed that it would:
(a) develop the monitoring and evaluation system for the project institutions
by June 30, 1980; (b) complete the collection of baseline data by March 31,
1981; and (c) furnish an annual report to the Bank for its review each June
beginning in 1982 until 1985.
Studies
3.30      The proposed project would include assistance to the Government in
conducting feasibility and engineering studies for future projects in the
education sector in the Philippines. The Government agreed that selection
of such studies would be made in consultation with the Bank.
/1 In comparison, the Fishery Education Technical Committee under the
Technical Panel deals with national policies for fishery training. The
Group would, however, work closely with the Committee.

(a) estimating the required new academic and communal facilities for planned
enrollment and staff; (b) assessing minimum boarding requirements as a
function of planned enrollment, student catchment areas, area requirement/
student, and the availability of alternative lodging; (c) assessing staff
housing requirements to attract qualified staff; and (d) establishing the
appropriate area unit cost of recently constructed facilities under the
Fourth Education Project (Loan 1374-PH) and other comparable facilities.



- 33 -
4.04      Base costs per square meter of gross floor area range from US$230
for staff housing to US$270 for university buildings./l  These unit prices are
reasoaable for the intended purpose of the structures. Cost adjustments for
location have been added to the building cost of individual project items.
Estimated site development costs at the RIFTs/RCFTs range from 15% to 20% of
building costs and are based on costs at comparable sites under the Fourth
Education Project. Site development costs at the UPVCF (37% of construction
costs) are based on detailed engineering studies.
4.05      The cost of professional services has been determined by using the
applicable fee scale of the Philippine Institute of Architects, which amounts
to about 8% of construction costs, and by determining the scope of required
master planning, architectural design and engineering services. Furniture
costs are based on analyses of recent bid results in comparable teaching
institutions. Equipment cost estimates are based on detailed equipment
lists. Foreign fellowships costs have been estimated at about US$15,000 per
man-year and foreign expert costs at US$80,000 per man-year.
4.06      The facilities of the UPVCF in Miagao compare well with similar
training facilities under earlier Bank-financed education projects. The
faculty area per student place would be 12.8 sq m at UPVCF,/2 compared to
12.2 sq m and 13.1 sq m for the University of the Philippines Veterinary
Medicine/ Animal Science Complex and the Visayas State College of Agricul-
ture, respectively; a comparable figure outside the Philippines would be the
17.9 sq m of the Kasetsart University in Thailand (Loan 822-TH). The cost
per student place at UPVCF would be US$11,800 for its academic and communal
facilities, which is moderate for a specialized tertiary-level institution.
4.07      Existing facilities at the seven institutions (Table 3.6) which
would host the proposed RIFTs and RCFTs are overcrowded and not well suited
to the proposed fishery training programs. The host institutions would
continue to offer secondary level teaching programs and the existing facili-
ties (averaging 4.5 sq m per currently enrolled secondary school student)
are adequate for this purpose. Entirely new facilities would, therefore,
be provided for the proposed RIFTs and RCFTs. Comparison of areas with
other Bank-financed training institutions indicate that the proposed
Institutes are within the normal range. Comparisons should, however, be
made with caution because of differences in levels, length, complexity and
specialization of the courses offered. The area and cost per student place
at these institutions, net of contingencv allowances and professional fees,
are shown in Table 4.3.
/1 Costs at December 1979. Rapid inflation has caused construction prices
to increase in excess of 35% during the past year.

4.08      Customs Duties and Taxes.  All items specifically imported for the
proposed project would be exempted from direct customs duties and taxes in
accordance with Presidential Decree No. 6A of 1972. Materials acquired
locally would, however, be subject to taxation. Major levies include the
following:  (a) 20% customs duty on c.i.f. prices for imported items;
(b) 3% on the gross value of construction as the contractor's ta:x; (c) 4% on
payable wages as the employer's contribution to social security; and (d) 5%,
sales tax on imported and locally produced items. On the estimated civil
works cogt, therefore, about 14%, or US$6.3 million equivalent, would repre-
sent customs duties and taxes. The total customs duty/tax component of the
project is estimated to be about US$6.8 million.
4.09      Contincencv Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$17.1 mil-
lion includes:  (a) physical contingencies estimated at an average of 5% of
the base cost of the project; and (b) price contingencies estimated at an
average of 26% of the base cost plus physical contingencies.  Estimated price
increases from the base cost date (December 1979) are based on the implemen-
tation schedule shown in Annex 3 and the annual escalation rates shown in the
following table:

4.10      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component of the
various categories of expenditure has been estimated by determining the for-
eign exchange content of each of the following subcomponents of locally
procured goods and services: taxes, profits, overhead, materials, equipment
and labor. The resultant foreign exchange content of each category of
expenditure is as follows: (a) civil works, 33%; (b) furniture, 33%; (c)
equipment 89%; (d) local design services, 10%; (e) fellowships, 73%; and
(f) specialist services, 80%.
Financing
4.11      The total project cost of US$70.6 million would be financed as
follows:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$38.0 million (60% of total project
cost net of taxes) would meet 100% of the foreign exchange cost
and US$6.0 million equivalent of local costs; and
(b) the Government would finance the remaining cost of US$32.6 million.
Details of the financial plan are given in Table 4.5.

- 36 -
In addition to the above, the costs of design services, i.e., master planning,
sketch plan preparation and the completion of tender documents (US$1.6 mil-
lion) would be financed from the proceeds of Loan 1374-PE.
4.12      Recurrent Cost.  The annual additional recurrent expenditure gener-
ated by this project (excluding RCFTs) when it is in full operation in 1984
would be about US$3.6 million equivalent (at 1979 prices).  This would
amount to about 0.4% of the MEC's recurrent expenditure in 1984, assuming
the Ministry's expenditure grows at an annual average rate of 10%. This
cost is reasonable for operating the types of training institutions provided
under the project and the Government will be capable of budgeting the 0.4%
share of the MEC budget for the proposed institutions. The annual recurrent
cost required for seven RCFTs in full operation in 1984 is estimated at
about US$ 0.9 million equivalent (at 1979 prices). This accounts for 6% of
the recurrent expenditure of BFAR in 1984, assuming BFAR's expenditure
increases at an annual average rate of 10%. The Government agreed that it
would allocate the required budget for full operations of the Centers.
Implementation
4.13      Administration.  EDPITAF is charged by the Government with planning
education development strategy; identifying priority projects; preparing,
evaluating and monitoring projects; and implementing all education development
projects. It would be responsible for implementing all physical aspects of
the proposed project, exercising financial control during implementation
and maintaining liaison with the Bank. Upon completion of the physical
facilities, EDPITAF would hand over control of project institutions to:
(a) the UP system (UPVCF); (b) the MEC (RIFTs); and (c) the MNR (RCFTs). An
acceptable agreement on sharing of physical facilities between the RIFTs/
RCFTs has been drafted (para. 3.25). Formulation of education policy, devel-
opment of teaching programs and financial aspects of the RIFT/RCFT operations,
would be controlled by the Fishery Education Technical Committee (para. 2.14).
4.14      Physical Design Services.  Master Planning of the UPVCP has been
prepared by local consultants with experience in campus planning, who were
assisted by a short-term foreign consultant. Local consultants have been
appointed for all project design work; sketch plans have been completed; and
working drawings are expected to be ready by April 1980. Supervision would be
carried out by the same consultants. Designs and specifications for project
vessels have been prepared with the assistance of FAO and foreign consultants.
Supervision of the boat-building activities would be carried out by local
consultants.
4.15      Sites.  A large tract of land (1,200 ha) has been earmarked in
Miagao for development of the UPV. The seven RIFTs and RCFTs would be
extensions to existing facilities. Sufficient land is available at six of
these sites. Acquisition of land at the remaining site is in progress. The
Government assured the Bank that all sites necessary for project institu-
tions would be legally acquired by May 31, 1980.



- 37 -
4.16       Maintenance.  Construction and equipment financed under earlier
education projects have generally been well maintained.  The Government
provides an adequate budget for chis purpose. The Government confirmed that
an adequate budget would be provided for the maintenance and operation of
project vessels.
4.17       Implementation Period.  The project is in an advanced stage of
preparation. Sketch plans have been completed and working drawings are
expected to be fully developed by April 1980.  Equipment tender documents for
first phase procurement are expected to be completed by June 1980. Construc-
tion is expected to start in January 1981 and to be completed-by the end of
1983. Procurement of equipment and vessels is expected to be completed by
mid-1983 and the fellowship program by the end of 1984. The Completion Date
would be December 31, 1984.
4.18       Procurement.  Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and
sixteen training vessels ranging in size from 10 to 40 tons would be grouped
to the extent possible to form attractive bid packages and awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement except for:
(a) civil works contracts (total value less than USS2.0 million),
estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equi-valent each, which
are units to be constructed on scattered locations and based on
past experience, are unlikely to arouse the interest of inter-
national construction companies; and
(b) bid packages for furniture, equipment and, smaller training
boats (total value about US$2.0 million), estimated to cost less
than US$100,000 each.
Contracts for items procured under (a) and (b) could be awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding procedures in accordance with government pro-
curement practices which are acceptable to the Bank. Foreign bidders would be
allowed to participate. In addition, miscellaneous items, in contracts not
exceeding US$25,000 equivalent and subject to an aggregate total of US$500,000
equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of a minimum of three price
quotations. Books would be procured directly from authorized distributors.
Local bidders for furniture and equipment, offering goods to be procured in
accordance with international competitive bidding procedures, would be allowed
a 15% preferential margin, or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is
the lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing foreign suppliers.
4.19       Bank Review and Approval. Master plans and sketch plans have been
reviewed and are appropriate in scope and standards. Master equipment lists,
and draft tender and contract documents would be reviewed and approved bv the
Bank upon completion of the documents. Review of tender evaluation documents
would be required prior to the award of:  (a) civil wor'kcs contracts exceeding
USS200,000 equivalent; and (b) furniture and equipment contracts exceeding
US$100,000 equivalent.



- 38 -
4.20      Disbursements.  The proposed loan of US$38.0 million would be
disbursed over a period of five years. Disbursements would be on the basis
of:
(a) 40% of the cost of civil works and furniture;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditure for directly imported equipment,
vessels, books and materials;
(c)  100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured books,
materials and equipment;
(d)  65% of the total cost of locally procured equipment, vessels,
books and materials;
(e) 100% of the total cost of specialist services and overseas
training; and
(f) 65% of the cost of local fellowships.
Withdrawal applications would be aggregated in groups of a minimum of
US$50,000 prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement from the proceeds
of the proposed loan. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30,
1985. The schedule of expenditure and disbursements is shown in Table 4.6.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The benefits expected from the proposed project would be summarized
under institution building, manpower development and research development.
These benefits together should contribute to increasing the output and
productivity of fishermen, especially municipal fishermen, who would be taught
to apply improved fishery management and technology.
5.02      Institution Building.  The project would assist the Government
in developing a national system of fishery training and rationalizing the
structure of the system and improving the quality of training.  Specifically,
the proposed project would create: (a) an apex institution with national
leadership in research and training; (b) seven technical fishery institutes
to serve regional needs; and (c) seven nonformal training centers to serve
working fishermen and extension workers.
5.03      M4anpower Development.  The broad guidelines for manpower needed
over the 1979-90 period indicate that the Philippine fishery development
program would require an additional supply of 2,500 professionals and 12,500
technicians (para. 1.19). The apex institution (UPVCF) would contribute 30%
of the projected professional manpower need and the seven Regional Institutes
of Fishery Technology would contribute about 30% of the projected technical
manpower need. In addition, the seven Regional Centers for Fishermen Training
would provide in-service programs by 1990 for over 65,000 fishermen, which
represents about 10% of existing small-scale fishermen and for all the exist-
ing extension workers. The provision of trained manpower should permit the
Philippines to continue to increase fishery production and productivity.
5.04      Research Development.  The project would assist the Government to
strengthen the fishery research program and staff of UPVCF, mainly through
the provision of technical assistance. The Institute of Fisheries Research
and Development of UPVCF would improve and develop research programs in such
areas as fishery stock assessment, management, engineering and economics,
which should produce technology and management methods suited to the
Philippine fishery industry. The degree programs of the UPVCF would be
expected to enroll a high percentage of students in marine fishery. Some of
these graduates would remain at UPVCF on research programs and thereby
strengthen local research capability, especially in marine fishery. Past
bias in favor of aquaculture technology would thus be corrected.
Risks
5.05      This project is designed to assist the Government's fishery
development programs with well-trained professional and technical fishery
manpower.  Should the Government's programs not proceed as envisaged, there
would be a risk that an over-supply of such manpower would be created.
However, without the trained manpower to be produced by the proposed project,
the Government would suffer from inefficient implementation of the programs.



- 41 -
5.06      The largest potential for growth of fishery production has been
identified as marine fishery resources. However, the present bias of research
and training toward inland fishery could continue, especially since most fish-
ery research and teaching staff have been primarily trained in fish biology or
aquaculture. To establish marine fishery as a sector priority, the project
would: (a) finance fellowships for teaching staff in marine fishery discip-
lines; (b) provide specialists' services for development of curricula in these
areas; and (c) establish a monitoring and evaluation system to measure
progress against desired results.
5.07      Other risks are related to the effective operation of project
institutions. UPVCF might suffer from being unable to attract sufficient
qualified staff to the rural area of Miagao during the initial years of the
university's operation. To reduce this risk, the Government has developed a
program of incentives, including staff housing and transportation allowances.
There might also be a risk that social and political pressures would prevent
the Government from phasing out degree programs at the proposed RIFTs. The
Government provided assurances that these programs would be discontinued by
1984. Also, problems of coordination and implementation could arise because
two ministries (including a weak extension service agency, BFAR) would have
responsibility for the Institutes and Centers. The two ministries would share
some facilities and large equipment items. To minimize this risk, the
Government would: (a) establish a Regional Fishery Training Development
Committee to be responsible for coordinating activities between the Institutes
and Centers; and (b) provide in-service training programs to BFAR staff.
Another risk is that project facilities, particularly the 16 fishing training
vessels and those operated by BFAR, might not be fully utilized and well
maintained due to insufficient allocation of operating funds. To reduce this
risk, the Government provided assurances that a sufficient budget would be
allocated to fully utilize and maintain the project facilities.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreement was reached with the Government on the following principal
points:
(a) the establishment of an incentive program for UPVCF staff reloca-
tion, a research review committee at UPVCF, and seven Regional
Fishery Training Development Committees (paras. 3.08, 3.11, 3.21);
(b) criteria and procedures for the appointment of specialists, and for
the selection of fellows and future studies (paras. 3.10, 3.20,
3.26, 3.30);
(c) maintenance of an appropriate teaching staff/student ratio at
UPVCF and the Institutes (paras. 3.08, 3.17);



- 42 -
(d) phasing out of BSF programs, and a moratorium on the establishment
of postsecondary fishery training institutions (paras. 3.14, 3.16);
(e) budgetary allocation for full utilization and maintenance of project
institutions (para. 3.19, 4.12, 4.16);
(f) establishment and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation
system (para. 3.29);
(g) employment and career advancement of graduates (para. 3.16); and
(h) acquisition of project sites (para. 4.15).
6.02      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a loan of US$38.0 million equivalent to the Republic of the
Philippines for-a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.
