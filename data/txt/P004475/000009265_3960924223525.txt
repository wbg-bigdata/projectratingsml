PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FISHERY TRAINING PROJECT
(LQAN 1786-PH)
PREFACE
This is a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the Fishery
Training Project in the Philippines, for which Bank Loan 1786-PH, provided
US$38.00 million to establish a comprehensive fishery training system. The
Loan was approved on December 18, 1979 and became effective on May 19,
1980. Over the course of project implementation, a total of US$8.4 million
Was cancelled.   The Closing Date of June 6, 1985 was extended to, and
ultimately closed on December 31, 1987.   Final disbursement was made on
August 20, 1988. Cofinancing in the amount of US$7.6 million was provided
by the Government of Norway.
The report consists of the Project Performance Audit Report,
prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and the Project
Completion Report (PCR). The PCR consists of a Completion Report, prepared
primarily by the Borrower in compliance with the provisions of SectLon 3.14
(c) of the Loan Agreement and a section on Observations and Lessons Learned
by the Bank, prepared by the Population and Human Resources Operations Unit
of the Asia II Country Department. The PPAR is based on the attached PCR,
the Staff Appraisal Report, loan documents, the transcript of the Executive
Director's meeting at which the project was considered, a study of project
files, and on discussions with Bank staff familiar with the project.  An
OED mission visited the Philippines in July/August 1989, and discussed the
effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with officials of EDPITAP, NEDA, the
Departments of Education, Culture and Sports, Agriculture, and Natural
Resources, as well as with staff of project institutions.   Their kind
cooperation and valuable assistance in the preparation of this report is
gratefully acknowledged.
The PCR provides a satisfactory assessment of the project experi-
ence, the performance of the executing agencies and the performance of the
Bank. The executing agency, EDPITAP, compiled many useful statistics on
project institutions, which appear as annexes to the PCR.   The Audit
validated most of the findings in the PCR. In fact, the high quality o£
the PCR has allowed the Audit to explore and speculate upon underlying
causes of prvject outcomes.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PCR and
PPAR were sent to the Borrower agencies for comment. Responses to the PCR
have been incorporated and appear as Attachments I and II at the end of
this document.   Responses to the PPAR have been similarly reflected and
appear as Attachment III and IV.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FISHERY TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1786-PH)
EVALUATIOU SUMMARY
Introduction
5.       This project sought to establish a national fishery training
system which vould strengthen research, meet the needs for technical and
professional manpower and upgrade the knowledge and skills of fishermen.
It vas the fourth project financed by the Bank/IDA to provide assistance to
agricultural higher education. It was appraised in August-September 1979,
and a Loan for US$38.0 million equivalent was approved in December of the
same year. The Loan vas to cover 1001 of the foreign exchange component of
a project estimated to cost US$70.6 million or Pesos 522.1 million. Loan
amounts were revised three times during implementation.  In 1981, US$7.6
million equivalent of Bank financing ws. replaced by a grant from the
Norwegian government and in 1987, US$.8 million was cancelled. The project
was closed in December 1987, two and one half years later than expected.
Disbursements continued until August 1988, at which time the remaining
balance of US$1.5 million was cancelled, leaving the actual amount of Bank
financing at US$28.1 million.
Obiectives and Pro1ect Content
6.       The project was prepared during the mid-1970s, at a time when
significant shifts in the fisheries sector were expected, including the
development of commercial fishing, the reduction of artisanal activities,
and the growth of Government-sponsored fisheries extension. It was there-
fore designed to respond to the anticipated acceleration in demand for
technically skilled and specialized manpower.   It was also to assist in
strengthening fisherien research capacity, especially in areas like marine
sciences, economics and fishery engineering, which would compliment the
Government's developmental strategies for the sector. Finally, the project
was to provide the impetus and context for upgrading and consolidating the
existing fisheries training system and reducilg the dispersion of
government resources over a wide array of mediocre institutions.
7.       The project would establish a network for fisheries training
consisting of the University of the Philippines College of Fisheries as the
apex institution for professional studies and seven Regional Institutes of
Fishery Technology and Regional Fishermen Training Centers which would
share facilities and be responsible for training technicians and fishermen.
It was to develop facilities and programs for these eight institutions,
including the relocation of the College from its site on the main campus
near Manila to a new location in the Visayas.   The project financed



- viii -
buildings, equipment, furniture, training vessels, textbooks and learning
materials, a fund for research, specialist services for curriculum develop-
ment and fellowships for staff development.
8.       Six autonomous bodies were to participate in the project, includ-
ing 4 chartered education institutions, the Ministry of Education, Culture
and Sports, and the Ministry of Natural Resources. The project was to be
implemented by the Educational Development Projects Implementing Task Force
assisted by representatives from project institutions and participating
agencies.
Implementation Experience
9.       The project was largely implemented as designed from a physical
standpoint.   With the approval of the Bank, over half of the original
allocation of specialist services was reallocated to fellowships. Project
execution was lengthy and problematic, with an overall time overrun of 622.
Construction lagged because ot delays in the tendering process and
shortages of materials and counterpart funds.  Delayed construction also
had repercussions for equipment and furniture procurement.   Equipment
procurement was troubled by attempts to manipulate the process and by Bank
and Borrower ignorance of the type of equipment required. Implementation
problems were exacerbated by an ill-fated attempt to decentralize project
management after the project started.   Because lines of authority were
unclear and agencies insufficiently prepared to accept responsibility for
implementation, especially in respect of bidding and tendering equipment
contracts, controversies arose and further delays resulted. Furthermore,
with few exceptions, the various intra-agency bodies constituted to facili-
tate certain aspects of project implementation did not function as
expected.
10.      The project closed with an 832 cost overrun in Pesos and a 232
underrun in US$ currency equivalent. This variation is largely attribut-
able to declining exchange rates, delays, and price escalations which
resulted in a higher involvement of Government funds than anticipated.
Greatest cost overruns were in the equipment/furniture and technical
assistance categories. By the end of December 1987, when the project was
closed, implementation   stood as follows:   civil works and technical
assistance, 85-862 complete; equipment, 852 delivered to site; and
furniture, 97Z delivered to site. By the time of the Audit mission in June
1989, virtually all equipment and furniture were installed, if not yet in
use, and most fellowships had been completed satisfactorily.   Several
buildings at the university remained unfinis.ed, however, with little hope
for their completion.
Results
11.      The achievement of project objectives has been mixed.  As noted,
project facilities were built and equipped as anticipated. The College of
Fisheries was relocated, albeit 4-5 years later than expected.  Curricula
for diploma and degree programs in fisheries were developed and staff were
upgraded,  ia some cases above appraisal expectations.   The Regional
Institutes of Fishery Technology streamlined their offerings by focusing on



- ix -
diploma-level education, vhile the College of Fisheries eliminated diploma-
level courses in favor of expanded degree and post-graduate programs. Such
outcomes point toward the development of a stronger fisheries training
capacity and the achievement of a major project objective.
12.      Nevertheless, project institutions remained seriously under-
utilized and course preferences skewed toward inland fisheries.   Under-
graduate enrollment at the College of Fisheries was less than one-fifth of
appraisal estimates, and in fact was in decline since the mid-1980s.
Enrollment in diploma programs and attendance of fishermen in training
programs were less than half of what was anticipated. Whatever interest
there was in fisheries education and research remained concentrated largely
in inland, as opposed to marine, studies.   These disheartening outcomes
were chiefly attributable to the lack of development of the fisheries
sector, especially the commercial fishing industry, and the unanticipated
stagnation and subsequent restructuring of fisheries extension.
13.      Furthermore, the continued proliferation of low quality institu-
tions and programs meant that the project did little to achieve a rationa-
lization and consolidation of programs.   Efforts to develop internal
cohesion and encourage self-regulation within fisheries education were also
not particularly successful.   The fact that many project institutions
retained their pre-project administrative affiliations perhaps contributed
to this la..k of cohesion among them.  Finally, with some notable excep-
tions, project institutions appeared only weakly linked to either fishing
communities or modernized fishing operations.
Sustainabilitv
14.      Since the fisheries sector did not develop to the degree or in the
way desired at appraisal, the demand for manpower did not materialize. And
since the project did not succeed in reducing low quality training pro-
grams, resources are still scattered over a wide array of institutions.
These factors do not bode well for the ultimate sustainability of project
benefits, although the project institutions will probably continue to
exist.
Findinas and Lessons
15.      Project expectations for sectoral performance were overoptimistic,
especially in light of the lack of a comprehensive long term development
plan and requisite investment financing.   The Audit also feels that the
Bank was too optimistic regarding the synergistic effect of agricultural
higher education institutions given the absence of a strongly supportive
institutional structure and economic policy framework.   In essence, a
growing economy creates the demand for a technically competent workforce,
not vise-versa.
16.      The question of whether the project supplied an appropriate frame-
work for fisheries training is moot given the non-appearance of the
economic assumptions upon which the project was based. Thus, an evaluation
of the project on its technical merits is somewhat premature. The Audit



feels that an elaborate pyramidal structure such as the project sought to
develop can function vwll if there is internal cohesion as well as a close
linkage to those the system seeks to serve. On both these counts, better
integration is needed.
17.      The Audit also finds that project made little impact on turning
attention or interest toward marine fisheries. Given the economic boom of
inland fishing during the 1980s, the lack of investment incentives for
marine activities, the traditional inland orientation of scholars, and lack
of research funds and structure for utilizing research, it was beyond the
scope of the project to expect such a radical reorientation.
18.      Finally, it was beyond the scope of the project to expect a
rationalization of the fisheries training system.   The previous three
projects had tried similar measures for agricultural higher education, also
without success. This experience points to the ineffectiveness of projects
for achieving results that are more a matter of political will.



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FISHERY TRAINING PROJECT (LOAN 1786-PH)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.       The generation of the Fisheries Training Project should be seen
within the context of two unfolding scenarios:   (i) the development of
fisheries activities in the 1970s and rising expectations regarding the
economic performance of the sector and (ii) evolving patterns of Bank
lending for agricultural education in the Philippines from the mid-1960s
onwards. A background paper on the fisheries sector is presented as Anrex
1.
A.   The Fisheries Sector in the 1970.
2.       There was great enthusiasm regarding the potential development of
the Philippine fisheries sector in the 1970s. Many aspects appeared very
positive. As an archipelago with vast territorial waters and an excellent
reproductive environment, the country appeared to be a rich fishing ground.
Fishing was a significant economic activity, contributing to 51 of the GNP,
employing 5 of the labor force and growing at a rate of 51 per year.
Domestic demand was high, as fish products constituted over half of all
protein in the local diet, and 95Z of the total annual catch was consumed
locally. Local demand was such that, while exports grew at a substantial
rate of about 37Z per year, imports still outstripped them by a factor of
three. Thus, the goals of becoming self-sufficient and increasing export
earnings from fisheries seemed highly desirable and achievable.
3.       Other aspects of the sector, equally important but less conducive
to a favorable assessment of fisheries potential, were either ignored by
sectoral analysts or not adequately reckoned with.   In the first place,
little was known about the nature, extent, and accessibility of aquatic
resources.   Available research presented a conflicting picture of the
resource base and was apparently not very useful in formulating rational
and long term fisheries development policies.   Stock assessments were
undertaken only sporadically, yet projections of sustainable yields were
consistently quite optimistic.
4.       In the second place, fishing activities themselves were largely
artisanal, with fishermen historically numbering among the poorest, most
isolated, and least educated of the population.  Living at a subsistence
level in coastal communities, artisanal (or municipal) fishermen depended
upon primitive vessels and traditional marketing systems which kept them



dependent upon middlemen for selling their catch.   Incomes were low and
losses from spoilage were very high. Yet these municipal fishermen sup-
plied about 54X the total catch each year. Moreover, their annual output
during the 1970w grew at 8%, a faster rate than any other subsector. By
contrast, the few commercial fishing ventures in operation relied on a
small fleet of secondhand vessels in deteriorating condition which were not
competitive by international standards.   The proportion of output from
commercial marine sources, which was about 37X in 1974, actually declined
relative to other subsectors, growing at a rate of some 3X per year.
Aquaculture activities, consisting mainly of small scale, undercapitalized
fishpond operations, supplied a steady share of about one-tenth of the
total production and grew at a rate of about 5% per year.
5.       Infrastructure, whether physical or institutional, was not geared
to large scale, modern fishing operations. Commercial size fishing ports
were nonexistent until the middle of the decade.  Storage and processing
capacities were extremely limited.   Because local tastes favored fresh
fish, almost all production was consumed on a daily basis, thus limiting
sharply the size of local markets. Whatever remained of the daily catch
was sold cheaply and further processed using fairly primitive methods.
Attempts to establish canneries had not been successful because of domestic
preferences and economies of scale which favored Japanese imports.
6.       The Government's relationship to the sector--whether in terms of
setting policies, providing incentives or services or regulating national
resources--was only just emerging. Within the governmental administration,
there was a rapid and unplanned growth of several agencies. Institutional
mandates and responsibilities shifted and overlapped and a lack of clear
direction prevailed. Although the desire for an umbrella organization to
unite various fisheries interests surfaced in the early 1970s, there was
very little coordination of administrative efforts. The growing pains of
bureaucratic development left little energy to deal with the genuine needs
of the sector. Extension services were in their infancy, with few messages
for clientele groups and even less understanding of how such messages
affected production levels.  Finally, institutionalized sources of credit
were too meager to make much of an impact.
7.       The Government began to seek assistance from the international
donor community in the early 1970.. Early investments focused on develop-
ing the physical infrastructure to support modern fisheries activities. In
1971, the Asian Development Bank lent US$5.5 million for the construction
of the Navotas Fisherieb Port.  In 1973 and 1976 the World Bank provided
loans totalling US$23.6 million to the Development Bank of the Philippines
(DBP) for on-lending to individuals and companies. The primary investment
targets were fishing vessels, ice plants, slipways, and fish ponds. These
early investments took place despite an acknowledged lack of information



about the resource 'ase, a long-term fishery development plan or a strong
extension system.1'
B. Bank Assistance to Philigtine Education
8.       Early Bank-financed projects were focused almost exclusively on
agricultural higher education. Of the first four projects. three provided
nesarly US$44 million to assist four agricultural colleges and a host of
related institutions.   The first, a loan of US$6 million (Ln. 393-PH)
approved in 1964, assisted with the upgrading and renovation of the
University of the Philippines (UP) College of Agriculture at Los Banos.
The second, a credit for US$12.7 million (Cr. 349-PH) approved in 1973,
assisted with the campus development of two state agricultural colleges in
central Luzon and central Mindanao.   The Fourth Education Project, Loan
1374-PH approved in 1977, provided US$25 million to establish an agricul-
tural college in Visayas, as well as to strengthen veterinary and forestry
programs at Los Banos.2/
9.       The underlying macro-economic justification for these projects was
the perceived need to develop a local capacity to produce professional
manpower and research in agriculture. It was assumed that such investments
in human and institutional capital would have the synergistic effect of
both supporting and driving agricultural growth. Influenced by the experi-
ence of agricultural land grant colleges in the United States, Philippine
institutions incorporated into their charters the ideals of public service
and the tripartite functions of education, research and extension.  Bank
education and agricultural projects alike promoted this role by establish-
ing farmer training centers near college campuases, strengthening research
capacities of faculty, and building up regional and crop-based research
facilities at the colleges.
10.      The rationale for financing successive investments in several
institutions was the desire to establish a network of agricultural higher
education institutionL with the college at Los Banos (which became the
University of the Philippines, Los Banos, or UPLB, in 1972) as the national
center of excellence and the various state colleges or universities as
regional centers.   Although a loose system of publicly-funded tertiary
1/ Paragraph 2.20 of the SAR for the First Fisheries Credit Project
states, "Although the base for fishery statistics is poor, crude
estimates of marine resources and research results of inland fisheries,
together with a growing demand for fresh fish, suggest a substantial
expansion potential.   However, requirements for rapid and sustained
growth of the fishery sector would be: (a) improved knowledge of the
resource base to formulate a rational fishery policy, including sound
investment criteria, (b) additional investments in supporting
infrastructure, and (c) improved extension services, especially for
inland fisheries."
2/ ORD has audited these projects.   See OED Reports No. 820 (July 30,
1975), No. 4162 (November 2, 1982) and No. 6348 (July 17, 1986).

level institutions had been in place for quite some time, the programs were
of variable quality and frequently irrelevant to sectoral needs.   Such
problems were exacerbated by the tendency of local politicians to create or
upgrade agricultural schools by fiat without reference to actual need or to
the financial requirements of running tertiary level education programs.
The Bank recognized this problem in the early 1960s and tried to influence
the Government to take measures to rationalize the system and support a few
quality institutiorts only.3/
II. PROJECT GENERATION
A. Proiect Prenaration
11.     In the early 19709, the Government expressed interest in improving
fisheries education and research.   A fisheries training component was
initially suggested as part of the Fourth Education Project. The proposal
involved support for a number of regional technical schools and relocating
the UP College of Fisheries (UP-CF) from the main campus at Dilliman in
Manila to the Visayas region. The January 1976 appraisal mission rejected
the proposal because the economic and sector work was insufficient to
justify it.   In September 1976, President Marcos issued a Letter of
Instruction directing all relevant government agencies to participate in
putting together an Integrated Fisheries Development Plan (IFDP) which
ostensibly would provide the context for the development of the manpower
training aspects. Concurrently, FAO assisted the Government in undertaking
a Fisheries Sector Study.
12.     Throughout its preparation, education staff had reservations about
the merits of the project. They found the IFDP and the Sector Study did
not develop sectoral priorities that would support proposals for manpower
training or suggest the content of educational programs in fisheries4/
3/ Paragraph 18 of the SAR of the First Education Project states, "In
recent years the network of agricultural high schools and colleges has
expanded rapidly and without careful design. Knowledgeable observers
are now worried that the system is becoming larger than the country
needs or can support at reasonable standards."  Paragraph 57 of the
same report states:  "...the Government should be strongly advised not
to authorize the establishment of any new agricultural colleges, public
or private, before 1970 without first conducting a thorough study of
the need for new facilities."
4/ Internal Bank memoranda from mid-1977 are very instructive. One staff
member reviewing the IFDP stated: "Although one of the objectives of
the Fisheries Development Strategy is to protect fishery resources from
illegal practices, over exploitation, and pollution, the survey does
not indicate how the government intends to attain this objective.,,
Another staff member reviewing the Sector Study states, "After reading
it one has no clear idea of what is required in fisheries education
over the next ten years or the justification for proposed project
financing."



- 5 -
Although no evaluation of existing output was available, it was apparent
that there were already more graduates of post-secondary fisheries programs
than demand for them, owing to a proliferation of low quality fishery
training inastitutions that paralleled that for agricultural schoo'ls in
general. Pinall:. the proposal to relocate the UP College of Fisheries to
the Visayas apt,    d ill-considered given the more pressing need to improve
programs and limit growth and the nearly universal opposition from the very
faculty who would have to undertake the move. Other than establishing the
faculty as a potential "growth pole" in a relatively backward area, the
proposed relocation of an established institution appeared to have little
intrinsic merit, but distinct drawbacks.51
13.      Staff also expressed concerns about the fisheries sector itself.
They noted conflicting signals and a lack of direction in fisheries on the
part of the Borrower. While verbally supporting the need to strengthen the
marine sector, most government attention and assistance, as vell as educa-
tion programs, were directed at inland aquaculture activities.   Students
preferred programs in inland fisheries over marine sciences because career
opportunities were perceived to be better.   Although the destruction of
mangroves and overfishing in coastal areas were becoming recognized as
environmental time bombs, efforts to change the exploitive nature of the
practices were insufficient and the Government's response ineffective. The
fisheries extension service was not an attractive career, and needed much
more substantive reform than merely improving training programs for
extension wvrkers.6/ Bank education staff voiced the need for the regional
operating division to review the investment priorities in the fisheries
sector before decisions were made to support a project focusing on manpower
training.{/ There is no evidence that such a comprehensive review was ever
undertaken.
14.      The concerns regarding basic premises and possible outcomes not-
withstanding, the moderate and cautious attitude of the Bank's technical
specialists did not prevail in the face of enthusiastic proponents within
51 Internal Bank memoranda presented the following arguments against the
relocations (i) the high cost of the move in relation to the number of
students benefiting; (ii) the opposition of the College staff and
officials of BFAR; (iii) the risk of potential duplication with other
tertiary level institutions in Visayas; (iv) the dislocation of farmers
from the proposed site; and (v) lack of water at the proposed site.
6/ An internal Bank memorandum states: "The complete reorganization of
the fisheries extension service will drive student enrollment and
career choice, not new facilities."
Z/  An internal Bank memorandum from August 1977 states:  "It was agree
that the investment priorities in the fisheries sector should be
examined by the Region before deciding to support a project focuslng on
manpower training."



-6-
the Bank and the Government.!/ Pressure mounted within the Philippines to
finalize a project which would relocate the College of Fisheries. Although
the Bank opposed this and advised the Borrower to undertake an economic
analysis of alternative sites, this was never done because the location was
favored by President Marcos.9/  Within the Bank, broader fears about
fisheries and the underlying economic context for the project were eclipsed
by more iediate concerns such as the desire keep up pressure on the
Government to rationalize agricultural higher education and to strengthen
research and extension activities.
15.      When it event.ally emerged, the project rested on a set of assump-
tions regarding the future performance of the fisheries sector and the role
of manpower training. These assumptions are worth making explicit because
of their explanatory power for ultimate project outcomes. They are:
(i) That substantial aquatic resources existed, with sustainable
yields from marine fishing grounds alone averaging 2.5 to 3
million tons annually.
(ii) That significant potential for expanding the fishing industry
existed, and that total production from both marine and
inland sources would grow from about 1.50 million tons in
1977 to 2.45 million tons in 1987.
(iii) That the Government would capitalize on this potential
through attracting investments, supporting favorable poli-
cies, and improving services.   The Government would place
epecial emphasis on the needs of subsistence fishermen. In
this regard, it would, inter alia, provide credit and
increase ratio of extension agents to fishermen from 1s:O0O
in 1977 to 1:400 by 1990.
(iv) That the Government would actively encourage a shift in fish-
ing activities away from artisanal to commercial operations.
It was assumed that by 1990, municipal and commercial fishing
would each contribute 42-43% of the total ca:ch, while the
remaining 15% would come from inland sources. Employment in
the industry would increase to 1.4 million by 1990, with
higher percentages working in extension, research, inland and
commercial fishing, and more modern processing operations
than in the past.
8/ During subsequent Board discussions, several Executive Directors also
expressed concern regarding the oversupply of fisheries graduates and
the possible problems of relocating university staff.
9/  A Back-to-Office memorandum discussing the issue of relocating the
university states:   "The Government cannot accept the mission's
suggestions to undertake an economic analysis of alternative sites
since the decision on the site has been made by President Marcos."



- 7 -
(v) That sectoral growth and the changing requirements of the
industry would call for a better trained workforce at all
levels which could be supplied through a consolidated system
of publicly-financed training institutions. The system would
also serve to generate research necessary to inform govern-
ment policies on fisheries.
16.      Probably aware of the fragility of these suppositions, staff pre-
paring the SAR acknowledged potential problems but followed with a caveat
about the importance of the project in the development of the sector.
Paragraph 5.05 in the "Benefits and Risks" section of the SAR states,
"Should the Government's programs not proceed as envisaged, there would be
a risk that an over-supply of such manpower wouid be created.  However,
without the trained manpover to be produced by the proposed project, the
Government would suffer from inefficient implementation of the programs."
That this project was clearly an example of the cart leading the horse
would become increasingly apparent during the course of implementation
(PCR, paras. 2.15-2.16).
B. Project Objectives. Components and Implementation Design
17.      Not surprisingly, the Bank-assisted project that was eventually
approved in December 1979 was consonant with prevailing beliefs about and
lending practices for agricultural manpower development and fisheries
sector development in the Philippines. It also shared many features with
the original ptoposal. It was considered an important impetus to upgrading
the quality of education and consolidating the existing system of fisheries
training. It sought to establish a national fishery training system which
would strengthen rese..rch, meet the needs for technical and professional
manpower and upgrade the knowledge and  .dills of fishermen.   The system
would consist of the UP-CF as the apex national institution for fisheries
and seven Regional Institutes of Fisheries Technology (RIFTs) and Regional
Fishermen Training Centers (RFTCs), which would share facilities and train
technicians and fishermen. When completed the College of Fisheries and the
RIFTs would supply about 30% of the total professional and technical man-
power needed through 1990, while the RFTCs would provide inservice training
for over 65,000 fishermen and extension workers. The SAR estimated that
the formal fishery training program needed to produce about 1,300 graduates
each year to fill 200 professional and 1,100 technical positions. Although
these targets could be met quantitatively by existing output, the quality
of graduates was inadequate (PCR, paras. 2.11-2.14, 2.17-2.18).
18.      The project provided a loan of US$38.0 million to finance a
project estimated to cost US$70.6 million equivalent. The loan was to meet
100% of the foreign exchange costs and US$6.0 million (or about 20%) of the
local costs. Items financed under the project included buildings, equip-
ment, furniture, training vessels, texttooks and learning materials, a fund
for research, specialists services for curriculum development and fellow-
ships for staff development.  The College was to be relocated to Miagao in
Western Visayas, in close proximity to the Southeast Asian Fisheries
Development Council (SEAPDEC) a&.d the Brackishwater Aquaculture Center of

the University.   It was to become the University of the Philippines in
Vissyas College of Fisheries (UPV-CF). The Government agreed to develop a
program of incentives to attract staff to live in that rural area, includ-
ing staff housing and transportation allowances.
19.      The project was to involve six autonomous bodiess  four chartered
institutions (including the College of Fisheries and three would-be RIFT,),
the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (which was responsible for
the other four schools scheduled to become RIFTs), and the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) under the Ministry of Natural
Resources, (which was to be responsible for the RPTCs). Potential coordi-
nation problems were addressed by forming various inter-agency committees.
The Project Standing Committee, consisting of the Directors of the RIFTs,
the Chancellor of UP Visayas, the Dean of the UPV College of Fisheries, and
the RFTC project officer appointed by BFAR were to oversee the project on
the national level. Regional Fisheries Training Development Committees
(RFTDCs) end ProJect Executive Teams (PETs) were to be constituted at the
regional/institutional level. In an effort to head off possible adminis-
trative problems in the sharing of facilities between the two ministries,
the Government drafted a memorandum of agreement on the ownership of and
responsibility for maintenance and repair of facilities. The RFTDCs would
be composed of regional officials and heads of the institutions and would
also oversee the administrative aspects of sharing facilities.
20.      Project designers felt that a coherent and comprehensive fisheries
training system would set the context for developing relevant education
programs and eliminating low quality ones.   In order to support the
Government's intended shift toward commercial marine fisheries, the project
financed fellowships for teaching staff and specialists for development of
curricula in marine fisheries.   At the Bank's instigation, the Borrower
agreed that the fund for research projects at UPV-CF would accord high
priority to research projects in fishery engineering, fishery economics and
management, fishing gear development and fishing boat construction.   A
Research Review Committee (RRC) also would be established to ensure that
these priorities were followed.
21.      The project was to be implemented by the Educational Development
Projects Implementing Task Force, or EDPITAF, which had been specifically
established within the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) in
the early 1970. to administer Bank-financed education projects. In 1979, a
Fishery Education Division was set up within EDPITAF to administer and
evaluate the project. The project was to provide foreign and local specia-
lists in fishery training, economics and evaluation as well as fellowships
for staff fishery economics/business management and evalration to streng-
then the analytical capacities of EDPITAF.

III. PROJECT IHPLBHBUTATIOU
A.  Tmplementation ONerview
22.     As the PCR details, project execution was flawed and lengthy, with
a time overrun of 621. When the project was finally closed on December 31,
1987, about 14-152 of the civil works, furniture delivery and technical
assistance componentz remained to be completed (PCR, para. 7).  Most of
this, however, had been taken care of by the time of the audit mission some
18 months later, with the exception of some buildings on the UPV-CF campus
(para. 34).
23.      During its eight-year implementation period, the project suffered
the vicissitudes attendant upon an attempted decentralization of EDPITAF.
Delays resulted, partly because insufficient groundwork had been done to
prepare the system for the transitionlO/ Management difficulties were com-
pounded by site problems and the declining availability of count-rpart
funds, all of which effectively brought the project to a halt during the
end of the Marcos regime. Not surprisingly, there were major repercussions
for contractors and the construction of project facilities, both in terms
of time and cost.   Average construction times increased from 30 to 77
months, while costs exceeded original contract estimates by about 602 on
average in local currency terms (PCR, paras. 3.34-3.41 and Annexes 5 and
8).
24.      The overlong implementation period notwithstanding, the project
was basically executed as designed, with most stipulations and covenants
complied with, in letter if not in spirit (para. 54; PCR, para. 3.58 and
Appendix 2).  Total areas constructed approximated appraisal estimates,
with an increase of 71 overall (PCR, Annex 12).  Academic and communal
areas were increased slightly, whereas boarding and staff housing were
reduced, a tendency observable in other Bank-assisted education projects.
Facilities were equipped as planned, although there were significant
procurement problems, particularly regarding the vessels for the
RIFTs/RPTCs (PCR, paras. 3.42-3.52).  The technical assistance componant
was executed with a shift from expert services toward fellowships, another
tendency observable in education projects. With the approval of the Bank,
nearly 270 staff months of specialist services, or about 552 of the
original amount, were reallocated to fellowships (PCR, paras. 3.25-3.33 and
Annexes 1-4).
10/ It is noteworthy that, although EDPITAF ostensibly had a ten-year life
span and was destined to be phased out or absorbed into the MECS in
1982, this fact and the probable disruption to project implementation
were never acknowledged during project preparation.  The changes to
EDPITAF also adversely affected the implementation of the Fourth
Education Project (See paragraph 9 of the PPAR for that project, OED
Report No. 6348).



25.      The project was to be financed by a loan of US$38.0 million, but
the Banik's final contribution was US$28.1 million due to successive reduc-
tions of the loan amount. In 1981, the Borrower received a grant of -'S$7.6
million from the Norwegian Government, and the equivalent amount of Bank
financing was cancelled.ll/  In 1987 and again in 1988, US$0.8 miJ  .  and
US$1.5 million were cancelled respectively.
26.      The existence of audited accounts notwithstanding, it has been
difficult to determine actual project costs in either local currency or US
dollar terms, and therefore equally hard to compare estimated with actual
costs.  The PCR presents one set of findings in Section V and Annex 20,
although the Borrower disputes some of these figures, as noted in their
correspondence appended to the PCR as Attachment 1. The Audit mission was
given a slightly different set of figures, which appears as Anmex 2 to the
PPAM. Differences among the various sets of figures are generally minor.
27.      The total cost of the project in local currency was 957.06 million
pesos, an 832 overrun when compared with appraisal estimates.  The total
cost in US$ equivalent was roughly $54.7 million, a 232 underrun. As noted
in the PCR, the major factors accounting for the differences were the
declining value of the peso and the increase in equipment costs due to the
extended implementation period.
_. Selected Imlementation Issues
28.      Proiect Management.  Implementation problems arose out of the ill-
considered attempt to restructure project administration and the sadly
predictable inability of various inter-agency committees to function as
desired.   Managerial difficulties and the long implementation time also
interfered with effective and sustained end user participation in the
i--nlementation process.   The attempt to phase out EDPITAF resulted in
shifting administrative arrangements and disrupted implementation consider-
ably (PCR, paras. 3.1-3.10). Originally, EDPITAP was responsible for all
aspects of implementation for all project institutions.  In 1981-82, some
of EDPITAF's functions were decentralized, and its successor retained the
responsibility for only those institutions within MECS, while the remaining
institutions were to receive their own budgets and make their own arrange-
ments.12/ Because lines of authority were not clearly designated and the
J1/ Borrower officials queried why some of the Norwegian grant funds had
been cancelled at the end of the project. The grant was intended to
replace one-fifth of the original loan amount and be disbursed in
parallel with Bank financing at a ratio of one to four.  Therefore,
when US$2.34 million of Bank financing was cancelled, the relevant
portion of Norwegian funds was also cancelled.
12/ EDPITAP's successor was originally called the Office of Foreign
Assisted Projects and later the Project Development Implementation
Management Office (PCR, pars. 3.2).



- 11 -
individual institutions were not adequately prepared, questions arose,
delays ensued, and the Bank encouraged the Borrower to appoint a committee
to sort it out.
29.      The com-ittee decided that decentralizing equipment procurement
would be inefficient and costly, adding to the paperwork and time and
recommended that central procurement responsibility be retained.   This
recommendation did not suit all participants, and much discussion ensued,
further delaying the project. Eventually, EDPITAF was reconstituted with
its original functions intact, including the important aspects of the
bidding process. In the meantime, individual project institutions prepared
specifica'51ons, signed some contracts, and decided whether or not to accept
deliveries, all fairly limited responsibilities in the context of this
project. It is the opinion of the Audit that the attempt to broaden the
participatory base of implementation netted few real benefits since major
procurement responsibilities were never devolved to the end users.
30.      Another aspect of p:.oject management that did not work well was
the attempt to coordinate thrwugh inter-agency bodies. As detailed in the
PCR (paras. 3.11-3.13), performance of these committees varied, depending
upon their perceived utility and importance. Despite the obvious need for
a mechanism to facilitate the sharing of facilities, the Memoranda of
Agreement between the RIFTs and RFTCs and the Regional Fishery Training
Development Committees failed to fill this requirement. While some of the
RIFT/RFTC administrators may indeed have come to mutually agreeable
arrangemeiats, it was apparent to the Audit mission that others had not.
This experience reinforces OED observations concerning the difficulty of
administering shared facilities, and underscores the futility of mandating
cooperation when competition for scarce resources or space is at issue.
31.      Procurement.  At the time, neither the Borrower nor the Bank had
much familiarity with this type of project. It was the first Bank assis-
tance to fisheries training, and probably one of the more innovative proj-
ects in the fisheries sector. Given the nature of items being procured and
the Bank's relative ignorance of specific equipment, procurement problems
were almost inevitable. In this case, shifting management arrangements and
the lengthy implementation period made the situation even worse.   At
various times the Bank engaged the services of experts to sort through and
give recommendations on equipment lists and specifications, but these ad
hoc arrangements proved only marginally useful in the long run. In retro-
spect, the technical assistance provided to the project unit (12 staff
months in naval architecture and 3 staff months in equipment specification
writing) was inadequate, in part because Bank staff did not have the
technical expertise to allow identification of potential procurement
problems before they had become serious.13/
13 The Borrower notes that: (i) the simplification of specifications led
to confusion and the procurement of inappropriate items; (ii) the naval
architect had minimal experience with fishing vessel design; (iii) the
fishing consultant (for the net design) was unfamiliar with local
conditions (see Attachment III).



- 12 -
32.      There were numerous attempts to influence the procurement process,
some of which may have been successful, although this has not been docu-
mented. The project files contain over a dozen cases of formal protest to
the Bank from potential suppliers of everything from radar and fishing
simulators to training vessels to spectrophotometers. The most serious and
lengthy problems centered around the procurement of fishery training
vessels for the RIFTs/RETCs and involved suspending bids for eighteen
months.  The Borrower tr'ed to nullify the bidding process in October 1982
because a domestic preference clause had been omitted from the bidding
documents.   The Bank refused to agree to rebidding, however.   When the
process was eventually resumed in March 1984, some contractors found that
they had been given insufficient time to reconfirm their prices and re-
validate their bid bonds, and this led to a further series of complaints.
Even though vessels were eventually procured, their marginal utility under
the circumstances makes them appear as questionable investments (para. 45
and PCR, paras. 3.47-3.52).
33.      Civil Works and Equipment at UPV-CF.  The Audit mission found site
work and infrastructural development inadequate at the College of Fisheries
(PCR, paras. 4.4-4.6, 4.18-4.21, and 6.14-6.15).   Sources of power and
water were unreliable, the latter being all too near the local cemetery for
the peace of mind of some university staff.   The nearest telephone
connection was in Miagao, several kilometers away, which contributed to a
sense of isolation.   Some facilities and equipment also evidenced poor
communication between end users and those implementing the project.
Equipment was incompatible with university level programs or was poorly
situated.  Staff discovered that one of the academic buildings had been
located closer to the sea than they had expected, and that sensitive
instruments housed in those building were now needlessly exposed to salty
air. University officials interviewed by the Audit mission noted several
reasons for these poor outcomes, inter alia: (i) the long and confused
implementation process; (ii) distance from the Diliman campus to the
project site; (iii) absence of specialized staff in EDPITAF and
questionable quality of consultants hired to monitor equipment; and (iv)
the lack of appreciation for equipment needs of university level programs
among members of the Project Standing Committee.14I
14/ The Borrower nooves that a "turn-key" approach, wherein the donor agency
is entirely rf Jnsible for constructing and equipping a facility prior
to turning it over, might have worked better (see Attachment III).



- 13 -
34.      Performance of some university contractors was poor.  At the time
of the Audit mission, some buildings were not only incomplete but unin-
habitable and in clearly deteriorating condition.51/  Having noted that
facilities provided UPLB under the Fourth Education Project (which closed
in 1984) remained unfinished in 1989, the Audit holds little hope for a
better outcome for the College of Fisheries.   This is all the more
disturbing given emerging evidence regarding the patently poor quality of
some of the finished buildings at UPV-CF. The library was already showing
evidence of structural damage, such that university officials felt
compelled to close off major portions of the building and move the books
into as yet unoccupied dormitory space.   It would seem that, once loan
funds and Bank involvement cease, there is little opportunity for redress
from poor performing contractors. When queried regarding possibilities for
rectifying the situation, officials commented that the 10S retention fee
was insufficient leverage and that withholding a greater percentage in the
future might encourage better performance from contractors.   The Audit
concurs.
III. PROJECT OUTCOHES
35.      The achievement of protect objectives has been mixed.   Many
project outcomes--such as the general improvement of physical plant, staff,
and academic programs--point toward a stronger fisheries training capacity
and the achievement of a major project objective. Other outcomes--such as
enrollment levels, course preferences, and continued proliferation of post-
secondary fishery training institutions--signify serious underutilization
and suggest that the project has not met its larger goals.    Within the
context of the development of the fisheries sector during the decade of the
1980s, the Audit comments upon the achievement of immediate and longer term
project objectives.
A. DeveloDment of the FishLeries Sector. 1980-1990
36.      Resources and Production.  Crucial to project outcomes and pros-
pects for sustainability is the fact that the fisheries sector did not
develop to the degree or in the way desired at appraisal. For one thing,
subsequent studies determined the resource base to be smaller than gene-
rally expected, particularly pelagic species in coastal areas, which have
15/ The most affected facilities includeds   the student union,  the
administrative building, the motor pool, the infirmary, the library and
one staff house. These buildings were not in use at the time of the
Audit mission, some for want of completion, others because contractors
had not placed footings deeply enough and ensuing structural cracks had
rendered the building unsafe.



- 14 -
been greatly reduced because of the Government'e inability to control over-
fishing of municipal waters.16/
37.      The sector grew at a slower pace than hoped for.  Total production
reached only 2.1 million tons in 1987, some 0.35 million tons less than
anticipated in the SAR for the Fisheries Training Project. There was no
perceptible shift toward large commercial operations, Bank assistance not-
withstanding.17/   In fact, producti.n from commercial sources actually
stagnated during the decade of the 1980s. Municipal and inland activities
grew, with attendant ecological problems for coastal areas. And vhereas
productivity increased for inland fishing, it actually declined for arti-
sanal fishing, stark testimony to the overfishing problem.   Predictions
regarding the quantities contributed from the sub-sectors were also proven
false. By 1987, proportions from commercial sources had declined from 34%
to 27%, proportions from municipal sources also declined from 55% to 49%.
By contrast, the economic boom in the fishpond industry meant that aqua-
culture more than doubled its contribution to sectoral production, from 11%
to 23%.
38.      Employment.  Employment opportunities in the sector did not emerge
as expected. Municipal operations continued to intensify. The demand for
skilled   commercial fishing operators did not materialize, nor did the
number of extension agents increase sevenfold as expected.   Except for
aquacultural activities, where significant growth occurred, there was
little appreciable shift toward technology-intensive operations that would
require a more highly skilled labor force.   The growth in aquacultural
production, while not leading to growth of employment opportunities in
quantitative terms, conceivably has been spurred by the growth of techni-
cally qualified manpower. The table below illustrates these points.
16/ Fisheries Sector Development Program:   Final Sector Study Report;
prepared for the Government of the Philippines by Agrodev, Canada,
Inc.; December 1988.
17/ The Audit of the First and Second Fisheries Projects noted that much
smaller and less costly vessels were constructed under these two
projects than had been anticipated, a trend which continued in
subsequent credit projects. (OED Report No. 4222, December 13, 1982)
There is no evidence to suggest that the experience of these credit
projects informed the Fishery Training Project.

39.      Public Administration and Policies.  The Government's relationship
to the sector did not evolve as anticipated or needed. Research did not
improve, and with the exception of inland activities and the motorizing of
the bancas, there was no perceptible improvement of the technologies being
extended.   Management of fisheries resources, including enforcement of
conservation laws, continued to be lax. Government agencies remained in a
state of upheaval, the efforts by the Bank to strengthen them notwith-
standing.161 The competition between the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) and
the Ministry of Natural Resources (NNR) to oversee sectoral development and
house the two major agencies for fisheries, BFAR and the Philippine
Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA), added to the confusion.
18, The National Fisheries Development Project (Ln. 2157, approved in May
1982) sought to upgrade staff of the three main Government agencies
involved with fisheries, with appiarently only marginal success.   A
Project Completion Report for this project is pending.

40.      The extension services did not develop as expected, thus invali-
dating many of the premises on which the project was based. In addition to
offering far fewer employment opportunities than hoped for, the structure
and coverage of the extension service changed radically, reducing the need
for fisheries extension agents. In the 1984, SPAR was transferred from the
MNR to the MA and converted from a line agency into a staff agency.
Fisheries extension vas integrated with other types of agricultural exten-
sion services in an effort to support the new agricultural policy that
favored ^n integrated/farming systems approach to development.   The move
toward a8 integrated extension service featuring generalists rather than
specialists was disorienting and demoralizing, and the service was still in
transition at the time of the Audit. As noted in the recent Sector Study,
"The-tug-of-war between Agriculture and Natural resources for these two
agencies and the bureaucratic ambivalence accorded to BFAR during the last
10-15 years has produced much uncertainty and frustration in the fisheries
community. *191
B. Operating Outcomes for Proiect Institutions
41.      Staff Develoament.   The numbers and qualifications of teaching
staff of project institutions generally increased along the lines envisaged
at appraisal. As noted in the PCR, there was a larger compliment of staff
at the RIFTs and RFTCs than anticipated. For the Centers, the recruitment
of additional administrative staff is anomalous given the low utilization
rates of these institutions and should be halted. Although the Institutes
currently maintain a higher staff:student ratio than expected (1:10 as
opposed to 1:12 as envisioned in the SAR), this will even out if enroll-
ments increase (PCR, paras. 4.16, 4.26-4.27).
42.      About two-thirds of the projected number of UPV-CP faculty bene-
fitted from post-graduate degree fellowships, the majority at the doctoral
level. In fact, the proportion of PhDs to Masters candidates was reversed,
thus raising the overall academic profile of staff beyond appraisal expec-
tations (PCR, paras. 3.26, 4.3; Annexes 1 and 2). As UPV-CF is expected to
conduct graduate programs itself, the Audit considers the shift toward PhD
level training for its staff appropriate.
43.      Academic qualifications aside, the Audit notes that the streng-
thening in certain specializations apparently did not obtain as desired, as
illustrated in Table 1, below. A supervision mission undertaken by an FAO
fisheries expert in early 1981 found "the emphasis on new areas (economics,
marine fisheries, engineering) is under-appreciated, and a lack of aware-
ness permeates all activities," and stated that effecting an increased
emphasis towards marine fisheries in the face of the traditional inland
orientation of the faculty would be difficult. He further noted that the
proposed fellowship program for UPV-CF diverged from project objectives and
recommended that the Bank review the fellowship program, the research pro-
gram and the Research Review Committee. Subsequent supervision missions,
less familiar with the fisheries sector, ignored his advice.

44.     Proaram Development and Reatulation.   The quality of academic
offerings was to be strengthened by upgrading and consolidating curricula
and programs.   Degree courses at the RIFTs were to be abolished and
replaced instead with standard three-year diploma courses.   Additional
post-graduate degree programs would be developed for the College of
Fisheries, including a PhD in aquaculture and fishery biology. The Fishery
Education Tecenical Committee, created in 1979 as part of the Technical
Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE), would have an Important role in
improving the quality of programs.20/ The main functions of the Committee
were to monitor fishery manpower needs and supply information to the TPAE,
adopt a national system of accreditation in fisheries, evaluate suggested
course changes and assist in the supervision, inspection and regulation of
fishery institutions.   In order to control the proliferation of sub-
standard programs, the Government agreed to a moratorium on the establish-
ment of new post-secondary fishery training institutions unless speci-
fically endorsed by the TPAE.
45.     Much streamlining of academic programs did take place.  In acco.-
dance with Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement, degree programs were phased
out at the RIFTs and three courses leading to a Diploma in Fisheries
20/ The TPAE had been established under the Fourth Education Project to
oversee the upgrading and standardization of tertiary level

Technology were introduced which had greater practical content, including a
10-month practicum (PCR, paras. 3.17-3.19). Although the curriculum was
set in place as planned--albeit tardily--some courses have been marred by
non-operational equipment or difficiulty in organizing the practica.
Problems with the vessels have been legion and many are not in regular use.
Some were not built to specifications and required significant alterations
simply to make them seaworthy. Some vere too small to operate successfully
in offshore waters where students needed experience most. Finally, vessels
needed to be at least partially self-financing, given their high operating
costs, but had difficulties in becoming so. Few contributed sufficiently
to their upkeep, acting instead as a net drain on RIFT resources.  Some
RIFTs had solved the problem by forming partnerships with local business-
men, essentially allowing commercial operators use of the boat and profit
from its catches in exchange for training students. The Audit feels that
such arrangements can work well as long as the training function remains
paramount.   The Audit also questions whether vessels should have been
provided at all, or whether a more effective apprenticeship scheme with
local commercial fishermen could have been developed at less cost. (PCR,
paras. 3.51-3.52, 4.8 and Appendix 2).
46.      The relevant TPAE Committee was active in revising curriculum (for
both degree and diploma courses) and developing better statistics on
fishery institutions.   The College of Fisheries curriculum was generally
revised as called for, but with considerable delays. The new Bachelor of
Science in Fisheries was not introduced during 1983-84 as expected, but in
1988-89, after the move from Dilliman to Miagao had finally been accom-
plished. The Audit also notes that doctoral level programs were not intro-
duced but considers that, given the delays and severe disruptions attendant
upon reestablishing the campus in Miagao, this is not unreasonable (PCR,
paras. 3.15-3.16)
47.      Enrollments and Outnut from Proiect Institutions.   Since the
anticipated demand for professional and technical labor did not materialize
in the way expected, the low enrollment/utilization rates and the continued
concentration in inland fishery courses are hardly surprising outcomes.
The College of Fisheries was to expand undergraduate degree enrollments
from around 500 to 800 in 1985186, with 402 of the students involved in
marine fishery programs.   The number of post-graduate students was to
increase from 40 to 50 (including those in the PhD program). In terms of
output, the College was expected to double the number of degree graduates
from 80 to 160.  In fact, as the table below indicates, enrollments and
output generally declined throughout the 1980s, apparently in response to
the impending move of the c   us.

48.     The desired shift of students into marine fisheries courses did
not obtain, possibly because the majority of the faculty continued to be
oriented toward inland fisheries (Bank-assisted fellowships notwith-
standing); and the inland fisheries orientation was reinforced through the
economic boom of the subsector and the existence of the Brackishwater
Aquaculture Center and proximity of the Southeast Asia Fisheries
Development Council (SEAFDEC). In fact, at the time of the Audit mission,
pressure from students to go into aquacultural studies was so strong that
quotas had been instituted, with 602 being allowed into aquaculture, 152
going into marine fisheries and 252 into fish processing.
49.     Attendance and output were lower and student drop-out rates were
higher at the RIFTs than targets set at appraisal (PCR, paras.4.9-4.12 and
Annexes 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17).  Total enrollments were about half and
graduates were about 40X of what was expected. The fact that the extension
service (which was to absorb over a third of the graduates annually) did
not expand to the degree envisioned undoubtedly dampened enthusiasm for
RIFT programs.   Following the trend observed at UPV-CF, enrollments in
inland and fish processing courses increased much faster than enrollment in
marine courses, which had virtually stagnated. In the 1988-89 school year,
marine programs had about one-quarter of their targeted enrollment.
Although the PCR, attributes this lack of interest to delayed procurement
of vessels, interviews conducted during the course of the audit mission
suggest other causes, inte-r alia:   (i) that commercial operations fre-
quently have their own--frequently informal--training programs and do not
rely on the education system for manpower; and (ii) that cultural, historic
and economic factors reinforce student preference for inland or onland
occupations over deepsea commercial activities.



- 20 -
50.      Numbers and specializations apart, it was hard to follow up on
graduates from project institutions, as no standardized procedures for
tracing graduates existed. University officials said that the high quality
of the UPV-CF education and the informal network of College of Fisheries
graduates already in the workforce virtually ensured that graduates had no
trouble locating appropriate employment.  RIFT graduates were apparently
not so lucky. One tracer study revealed that of the 363 graduates of SY
1985-86, only 412 were gainfully employed, whereas 442 were unemployed and
82 were pursuing higher studies.   The PCR states, "In some RIPTs, the
unemployment of graduates was attributed to the lack of job openings in the
fishery astablishments both public and private, located in the region"
(PCR, para. 4.15). To the Audit mission, it appeared that those who had
the least trouble finding gainful employment quickly were those who had
specialized in inland fisheries.
C. Development of a Fisheries Training System
51.      One of the major objectives of the project was the transformation
of a loose collection of fisheries education institutions into a unified,
self-regulating and comprehensive fisheries training system. Such a system
would  transcend the different academic levels, roles, responsibilities,
functions, and regional and administrative affiliations of its membership.
It would also provide mechanisms for financial support from users of che
system and feedback from employers on the quality and relevance of educa-
tion programs.   Although programs have been strengthened and facilities
improved, it is the opinion of the Audit that at this time, the existence
of such an education system is more apparent than real.
52.      Internal Cohesion and Self-Reaulation.  Project efforts to develop
internal cohesion and encourage self-regulation within fisheries education
were not particularly successful, as institutions continued to expand with-
out a national plan, concept or philosophy defining fisheries education
needs, or relevance to the fishing industry.   In the first place, few
genuine linkages grew between institutions involved in the project. What-
ever connection existed between them as a result of implementing the
project or collaborating on research seems to have collapsed since project
completion.211   This may be exacerbated by the fact that the RIPTs have
retained their pre-project administrative affiliations.  Some are part of
chartered institutions, and share the identity of their parent institu-
tions.  Others are still administered by the Department of Education.22/
21/ The Audit mission did not see much evidence of what the PCR refers to
as the bonding of project institutions into a network under the UPV-CF
(par&. 6.6).
22/ For some RIPTs, the continued administrative affiliation with the
Department of Education has led to their being classified and staffed
as secondary schools, not tertiary level institutions as agreed. The
PCR notes that such anomalies need to be worked out, and the Audit
agrees  (PCR, para. 6.18).   There is no evidence that this was
recognized as a potential problem during either project preparation or
supervision, except for the inclusion of fairly standard covenants on
the acceptable staffing of project institutions.



- 21 -
The transfer of responsibility for monitoring RIFT programs from EDnITAF to
the Bureau of Technical and Vocational Education, while logical from an
administrative standpoint, may not be sufficient to ensure future coordina-
tion, given the acknowledged weakness of that Bureau.
53.      Other linkages have not developed to the degree desired or anti-
cipated.   At no time Was realistic provision made for attracting the
systematic support of or feedback from commercial operators and other
would-be users of the system. Although it is still too early to comment on
the strength of the linkages between UPV-CF and its clientele in the public
and private sectors, there are indications that the move to Miagao has
disrupted, at least temporarily, some long-standing affiliations. Further-
more, the relationship between UPV-CF and SEAFDEC currently seems to be
more one of competing for trainees in various non-degree programs than
collaborating over research.23f   With some notable exceptions, the RIFTs
and REICs do not seem as attuned to regional needs as they might be.
54.      Finally, the project had little impact on improving the overall
quality of education by containing and consolidating institutions. At the
time of the Audit, there was still no appropriate national distribution of
fisheries schools and colleges, yet unnecessary duplication of courses
continued.   The production of fisheries degree holders, some 2,000 per
year, far exceeded the actual need. Schools not financed under the project
deteriorated, while additional schools were created. Project conditiona-
lity notwithstanding, the TPAR was powerless to institute accreditation
procedures or stem the growth of fisheries colleges. Although, as noted in
the PCR, Appendix 2, "No new publiclprivate post-secondary fishery institu-
tion has been recommended by TPAE to offer any fishery program," such
programs continued to grow in defiance of practical need, TPAR advice, and
the Bank'8 wishes.   The 48 degree and diploma granting institutions
existing in 1977 grew to 66 by 1984, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of
projects for resolving issues that are a more matter of political will.24I
There is no evidence that Bank supervision missions monitored this aspect
of the project.
55.      Monitorina and Evaluation.  One important feature of any workable
system is a mechanism to provide feedback on system activities.  Recog-
nizing this, technical assistance was provided to EDPITAF to: (a) measure
qualitative improvements in training, employability and job effectiveness
of graduates and (b) evaluate the RFTC effectiveness in helping fishermen
to increase production. The files indicate that, at least initially, the
Bank took great interest in this aspect of the project, devoting several
supervision missions to setting up evaluation mechanisms. As the project
dragged on, however, interest waned and expectations for the quality of
231 The Borrower notes that a collaborative agreement covering research and
training exists between UPV-CF and SEAFDEC (see Attachment III).

- 22 -
butput were lowered. In the end, evaluation resi4lts were mixed. The moni-
toring of the project institutions' progress in attracting and retaining
trainees was consistently excellent, as amply demonstrated by the PCR.
Specific questions, such as those regarding the effectiveness of the
fishermen training programs were also answered.
56.      However, many broader concerns were not addressed.  There is still
no realistic basis for projecting the demand for trained labor. The man-
power study surveyed characteristics of schools and the perceived needs of
employers, but stopped short of establishing statistics on those actually
employed in the sector or the real prospects for future growth of employ-
ment. Furthermore, as the project made no effort to institutionalize a
monitoring and evaluation capacity within the fisheries training system
itself, it is unlikely that even ad hoc efforts such as those financed
under the project will continue.  The Bank has frequently underestimated
difficulties in setting up and maintaining monitoring and evaluation mecha-
nisms.   This project did not even address the intrinsic need for such
mechanisms, and its conception from this perspective was seriously flawed.
D. Fisheries Research Capacity Development
57.      The weakness of fisheries research, particularly in marine
sciences, had been long recognized, and the project sought to improve capa-
city through scholarships for faculty and financing research projects. The
project financed nearly 40 fisheries research projects whose implementation
was overseen by the Research Review Committee. In an effort to broaden the
base of the research effort, the College of Fisheries encouraged participa-
tion from the RIFTs and met with an apparently enthusiastic response (PCR,
paras. 3.14-3.25, 4.2, 4.15 and Appendix 1).
58.      The Research Review Committee was to ensure that project-financed
research focused o* fishery engineering, fishery economics and management,
fishing gear development and fishing boat construction. During implementa-
tion, consultants supervising the project on behalf of the Bank expressed
the belief that these guidelines were not being followed, but apparently to
no effect. Table 3.2 in the PCR gives the number of research projects by
fishory area, noting that the majority of projects were in the area of
marine fisheries. While not disputing these numbers, the Audit notes that
an analysis by levels of financing presents a different picture. A full
652 of all World Bank-financed research completed at UPV-CF during 1983-87
was devoted to fish processing studies, whereas 30% went for marine-related
studies. An analysis of all research completed by the College during those
years indicates that: (a) the greatest number of research projects were in
brackishwater studies (46) and (b) the greatest concentration of funds was
in fish processing (372), followed by brackishwater (33%), marine (282) and
freshwater (2%).L25

59.      It is the opinion of the Audit that, while undoubtedly streng-
thening research capacity at the College, the project neither produced
sufficient or suitable research to make much of an Impact in the sector nor
succeeded in orienting UPV-CF toward marine research.  The recent Sector
Study tends to confirm these findings, and points toward the continuing
problems of fisheries research:  (a) the unresponsiveness of the national
agricultural research council to fishing industry needs; (b) the continued
concentration of financing in aquaculture research; (c) the high percentage
of research projects remaining unfinished; (d) lack of stock assessment and
of a fishery information system; (e) lack of a network of fisneries
research institutions. The difficulty in completing research projects was
especially notable for marine fisheries due to the shortage of trained
researchers and the lack of adequate research vessels and financing for
operating and maintaining them.261 Staff of the College noted that their
own vessel was not operating for this reason.
60.      Although not one of the original research goals, it is arguable
that the project made little impact on improving awareness of environmental
problems affecting fisheries, including destructive harvesting activities,
destruction of coral beds and mangroves, siltation due to deforestation,
and pollution due to industry wastes. It is worth noting that of the 38
research projects mentioned in Table 3.2 of the PCR, only 3 were in the
area of fishery resources management, assessment and ecology, the very
areas most crucial to development of sustainable development of fisheries.
61.      In retrospect, the attempt to reorient research at the College was
largely ineffective, and the belief that the project could increase uarine
research in general was unrealistic. At a minimum, the project coal.41 have
financed the costs of operating the College's research vessel. Also, the
Bank should have been more careful and consistent in monitoring research
activities to determine whether appraisal objectives were being met. Tho
attempt to influence national research priorities through the project was
misguided, given the larger problems of a clear predilection of researchers
for other areas, the lack of linkages between researchers and the commer-
cial fisheries industry, and the lack of Government commitment to improve
either environmental control measures or the prospects for commercial
fishing.

62.      Project designers recognized that artisanal fishermen comprised
the vast majority of producers and hoped to effect an increase in their
productivity through training. They also recognized that a comprehensive
training system that ignored the needs of this important majority would be
incomplete.   Despite the time devoted to preparing and executing this
component, it was not successful.   Only about 40% of the nearly 55,000
fishermen expected to participate in RFTC programs between 1982 and 1988
did so. Noting clientele indifference and a lack of time or interest in

government programs, the PCR states, "Despite the incentive program that
the RPTCs had set up... they failed miserably to attract enough fishermen
trainees" (PCR, paras. 4.22-4.25, Anex 18). Paradoxically, however, those
attending the training courses did appear to inerease their productivity.
In the final analysis, it is difficult to comment upon the RFTC programs
given the radical reorganization of BFAR and the extension service.
However, it is the opinion of the Audit that, as with expectations for
research, project designers were overoptimistic about what could be accom-
plished within the confines of an education project.
IV. FINDINGS AND LESSONS
63.      Aside from the problems attendant upon its lengthy implementation,
both Bank and Borrower have expressed satisfaction with this project,
claiming, as stated in the PCR, "The Project has provided the impetus in
establishing a more coordinated and rationalized system of fishery training
in the Philippines" (PCR, para. 6.5).  While the Audit agrees that the
project supplied a structure for fisheries training upon which future
improvements may be built, there is little evidenice of much improvement at
this time given the lack of demand for trainer; manpower.  The reorgani-
zation of the extension ssrvice was particularly devastating to project
outcomes, as it greatly reduced the need for fishery specialists and ran
counter to the rationale for the project. Furthermore, the Audit queries
the intrinsic merit of this investment given the failure to achieve either
a more dynamic fisheries economy or a cohesive agricultursl education
system.
64.      It is the opinion of the Audit that the project expectations for
sectoral performance were overoptimistic, especially in light of the
absence of a comprehensive long term development plan, incentives and
requisite investment financing.  After two decades, the problems in the
fisheries sector remain the same and largely unresolved.   Municipal
fisheries activities have intensified rather than lessened.  This plus
other land and water use patterns have contributed to possibly irreversible
environmental degradation of coastal areas.  Meanwhile, marine potential
remains untapped.27/   Exacerbating these problems are the facts thats (i)
knowledge of the resource base is still inadequate, and there is no system
for supporting appropriate research and linking it to users, (ii) extension
is ineffective, (iii) relevant laws are still only cursorily enforced, (iv)
incentives for investment in sustainable operations are weak and (v)
administrative responsibility for putting the industry on a sustainable
27/ The Philippines sits within FAO Statistical are-. 71, from which half of
the world's skipjack and one third of the world's yellowfin catches are
taken. Although yellowfin resources may be approaching their maximum
sustainable yield, skipjack resources apparently are not being
harvested to their full potential.   Philippine fishermen presently
catch about 17 percent of the area 71 tuna catch (Fisheries Sector
Development Program: Final Sector Study Report. op cit; page 10).

yield and environmentally benign basis remains diffused.  Many of these
issues are being taken up in the context of subsequent lending operations
to the fisheries sector by the Asian Development Bank.
65.      It is also the judgement of the Audit that the Bank assumed too
much regarding the synergistic impact of agricultural education institu-
tions, especially in the absence of a strongly supportive institutional
structure and economic policy framevork.  A growing economy creates the
demand for a technically competent workforce, not vise-versa.   Without
parallel developments in several areas, but notably research and extension,
there is little education institutions can do on their own to induce
economic development.
66.      The non-appearance of the economic assumptions upon vhich it wat
based rendered moot the conception of the project. Whether the comprehen-
sive pyramidal structure advocated by the project was the best solution
from a educational standpoint cannot really be addressed. However, as a
proposed system, the project design showed several flaws: (i) there was no
mechanism (whether formal or informal) for linking the education/training
service provided with those demanding the service--essentially employers
and other user groups; (ii) there was no formal linkage between the insti-
tutions themselves that survived the project; and (iii) there was no
mechanism for evaluating the performance of the system in meeting manpower
needs.
67.      It was apparently beyond the scope of the project as structured to
effect a "rationalization" of fisheries education. Many problems that were
recognized at the time of the appraisal of the First Education Project and
reiterated in this, the fourth lending operation in agricultural higher
education, are still present today. Although some progress was made over
the course of the four projects, chiefly the establishment of the Technical
Panel for Agricultural Education, Bank-financed projects had little impact
on slowing down the growth of institutions, programs or output, despite
continued efforts.
68.      Aside from these major findings, the project has other lessons to
offer regarding:  (i) Bank lending for innovative education schemes; (ii)
the locus for project management; (iii) dealing with the performance of
contractors and suppliers.   The project was venturing into totally
uncharted waters of investment in fisheries training. Given its innovative
character, the Bank's lack of familiarity with the sub-sector, and the
early evidence of questionable procurement decisions, the Bank should have
monitored project implementation more closely. In this regard, the Audit
would like to endorse the comment in the penultimate paragraph of the PCR
which recommends higher coefficients for supervision.
69.      The project also offers lessons about project implementation.  The
first, and most obvious, concerns the age-old admonition not to change
horses in mid-stream. Why the Bank did not recognize a potential problem
and allowed changes to take place without much initial protest is difficult
to fathom. No less puzzling is the fact that the Bank, which had helped to



- 26 -
establish EDPITAF and knew of its "ifespan, did not recognize the repercus-
sions of dissolving it and act dLring project preparation.   It is the
opinion of the Audit that the attempt to decentralize project management
mid-course only added to the time and confusion of implementing this
project.
70.      Despite the acknowledged attempt to broaden the participatory
base, the presence of the Project Standing Committee and individual Project
Executive Teams, some end users expressed dissatisfaction with their own
participation. The Audit mission was also told of suspected instances of
collusion with equipment suppliers and contractors.   If the impetus to
dacentralize implementation arose from a desire to stem corrupt practices
and devolve more responsibility to end users, it is laudable and should be
encouraged, even though this project was neither an appropriate nor suc-
cessful mechanism for doing so. One underlying issue is balancing effi-
ciency of the procurement process with accountability for its result.
Another is the building up of implementation capacity where it will do the
most good in the long run.   The Audit feels that, in general, tertiary
level institutions--with their greater autonomy, technical and administra-
tive capabilities, and specialized and sophisticated needs--should be given
more responsibility in implementing their own components. The Audit also
recommends a closer integration between the implementing unit (in this case
EDPITAP) and the line units within the education ministry responsible for
overseeing the development of particular education subsectors.  Not only
will those units gain useful experience, but they also will develop a sense
of ownership over the resulting institutions.
71.      Finally, the Audit would like to endorse the PCR's recommendation
that EDPITAP take a tougher stance with non-performing suppliers and
contractors, including exercising its legal option to withhold suppliers'
bonds and/or blacklist them (para. 6.15).   The Audit also feels that
similar practices should be developed or strengthened to deal with errant
contractors.   Paradoxically, centralized implementation arrangements are
supposed to facilitate performance accountability, but it does not seem to
have done so in the case of EDPITAF.28/
281 The Borrower notes that procurement problems would be lessened through
comodity loans and turn key arrangements which would avoid a middle
man agency such as EDPITAP altogether.  The Borrower also expresses
wonderment at EDPITAF's continued existence (see Attachment III).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FISHERY TRAINING PROJECT (LOAN 1786-PH)
THE PHILIPPINE FISHERIES SECTOR IN THE 1970S
1.       Natural Resources.  Geographically, the Philippines would appear
to be a natural fishing ground. As an archipelago of over 7,000 islands,
its vast territorial waters occupy about six times as big an area as does
the total land mass of the country. The large continental shelf, abundance
of plankton and fertile bottom soil are conditions that provide an
excellent living and reproductive environment for most tropical species of
sea fauna. The extent and distribution of marine and inland waters in the
mid-1970s is given in the table below.

2.       The natural environment in the Philippines is strongly shaped by
the monsoonal climate. Monsoons ara largely responsible for the numerous
typhoons that hit the country eac' year and reduce the number of available
fishing days.  Concerning the actual inhabitants of Philippine waters, a
satisfactory picture has been slow to emerge.   Reliable and consistent
assessments of fish stocks were not available during the 1970s, as informa-
tion was limited to oceanographic data of the Philippine Sea (mostly
conducted by foreign researchers) and limnological studies of freshwater
resources of Laguna de Bay.   The morphology and extent of aquatic
resources, as well as maximum sustainable yields from fishing activities,
were matters of speculation and controversy.



- 28 -
3.       Cultural Factors.  Fishing has always been an important activity
in the Philippines, particularly in terms nutrition and employment. Fish
products constitute over half of all animal protein consumed and fishing
activities have been a major source of income for coastal communities.
Nevertheless, fishing is a low status occupation, and the socio-economic
profile of fishermen is indicative of their poverty. Coastal communities
are among the le&st well served in terms of education, health and public
utilities like electricity and potable water. Hampered by low levels of
investment, traditional, irregular, and/or seasonal fishing methods and
inadequate handling, processing and marketing systems which result in high
wastage, fishing has typically been considered the employment of last
resort. Norms and customs have further reinforced the precarious existence
of fishermen and have militated against the formation of cooperatives or
other forms of socio-economic cohesion.
4.       Fishery Technoloav. Production. and Contribution to the Economy.
The sector grew at an average annual rate of 5S during the decade of the
1970s and accounted for about 51 of the total GNP. Total production grew
from 1 million tons in 1970 to 1.5 million tons in 1977. Marine waters
accounted for nearly 90X of the total production. Ninety-five percent of
the total catch was consumed locally. Although exported volume grew by an
average of 372 per year between 1973-1977, the volume of imports was still
triple that of exports.
5.       Production came to be defined according to whether the activities
were considered commercial, municipal, or aquacultural.251  During the
1970s, commercial fishing grew et an average of less than 31 per year, and
produced 518 million tons in 1977.   Of the 2,000 licensed commercial
vessels, most were purchased secondhand and lacked equipment and acces-
sories. Over half were relatively small--between 3-20 gross tons--and more
than 10 years old. The condition of these vessels confined their opera-
tions to depths of less than 50 fathoms.
6.       Municipal fishing was typified by the banca, an unmotorized dugout
canoe about 6-10 meters in length which could be operated by one or two
fishermen and was therefore ideally suited to family-based operations.
There were an estimated 300,000 bancas in the late 1970s.   In spite of
their relatively primitive technology, the production of municipal fisher-
men not only surpassed the combined output of all other suppliers in the
19709, but also grew at over 81 per year to reach 875 million tons in 1977.
25/   Commercial fishing involves the use of vessels in excess of three
gross tons and occurs in marine waters more than seven fathoms deep
(about 13 meters) and more than seven kilometers offshore. Municipal
fishing utilizes vessels of less than three gross tons or gear not
requiring boats. It takes place in inland and tidal waters within a
municipality as well as marine waters within seven kilometers of the
municipal coastline. Aquaculture refers to the controlled rearing of
aquatic plants and animals in fresh, brackish and marine waters.

7.       The third subsector, aquaculture grew at a rate of about 4% during
the 1970. and produced about 116 million tons in 1977. While subsuming a
variety of cultivation and capture techniques, fishponds tend to dominate
aquacultural activities.
8.       The balance between the three subsectors remained quite stable
throughout the decade. Municipal fishing activities consistently supplied
between 53-58% of total annual production, while the proportion of commer-
cial landings declined slightly, from 392 in 1973 to 342 in 1977.   The
remaining supply, hovering around 111 annually, came from aquaculture
activities.
9.       Financial Askects.  The major sources of institutional credit in
the 1970s were the rural banking system (privately owned and supervised by
the Central Bank), the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and
commercial banks.   Ron-institutional credit sources included traders and
middlemen, equipment suppliers, and oil companies. The domestic financial
system tended to favor aquaculture projects; investments in riskier
enterprises--particularly marine and small-scale fishing activities--were
undertaken only at the behest of the government. While credit assisted in
motorizing bancas and increasing yields in aquaculture it otherwise had
minimal impact on upgrading the quality and efficiency of operations, and
was plagued by high default rates.
10.      External loan and grant assistance to the sector began in 1971 and
went mainly to aquacultural research, training, credit and some infra-
structural development, such as fishing ports and post-harvest facilities.
Early World Bank assistance to the sector included the First and Second
Fisheries Credits (Ln. 891-PH, approved May 1973 and Ln. 1270-PH, approved
May 1976) which provided US$ 11.6 million and US$ 12.0 million, respec-
tively, to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for on-lending to
individuals and companies.   The primary investment targets were fishing
vessels, ice plants, slipways, and fish ponds.  Steep collateral require-
ments, the onslaught of the oil crisis and its impact on vessel operating
costs, and lack of sufficient extension staff to follow-up with technical
assistance to sub-borrowers affected both implementation and outcome of the
two projects. Significantly, both projects had to scale down the desired
size and number of fishing vessels to be financed, and the objective of
strengthening the commercial fleet was not met.
11.      Human Capital Issues.  About 5X of the total labor force (and 10%
of the agricultural labor force) have been engaged in fishing activities.
By the late 1970s, nearly a million people were working in the sector, some
600,000 in municipal or small-scale capture fisheries, 200,000 in inland
aquaculture--chiefly fishpond operations, and about 50,000 in commercial
fishing ventures.   Another 50,000 were engaged in post-harvest handling,
processing and marketing, boat building and equipment manufacture and
distribution. Of the nearly 2,000 employed in tertiary level activities,
some 1,400 were involved with teaching, research and administration and
another 500 were employed as government extension agents. Four-fifths of
all fishery workers were considered self-employed or unpaid family workers,
while one-fifth were wage/salary earners or employers.



- 30 -
12.      Most people working in the sector in the 19709 had little formal
education and no specialized training in fisheries. Fishermen were among
the least educated people in the country. Studies indicated that, while
23% of the total workforce and 91 of agricultural workers were educated at
the primary level or better by 1965, only 4% of all fishery workers had a
similar level of educational achievement a decade later. Furthermore, over
80% of all extension workers and those running their own commercial or
fishpond enterprises also had only a primary education or less.
13.      Institutional Setting.  The policies and organizational structures
governing the fisheries sector became more sharply articulated in the 19708
as the government took on a larger role in regulating and influencing
sectoral development. Traditional fish marketing systems, which involved
little oversight, interference or assistance from the government, were
organized around informal institutional mechanisms. Such marketing systems
were characterized by .L.w returns to producers, the preeminence of middle-
men, poor handling, preservation and other post-harvest practices, and the
lack of adequate market information. Middlemen typically engaged in price
and supply manipulation, but they also performed important services to
fishermen by extending credit and assuming processing and distributional
risks associated with the industry.
14.     While fish culture, capture and marketing continued to remain in
private hands, in the 1970s the c3ntral government became more active i..
establishing and regulating both the physical and institutional infra-
structure aspects of sectoral development.  Three main bodies within the
Ministry/Department of Natural Resources eventually evolved: the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), the Philippine Fisheries
Development Authority (PFDA) and the Fishery Industry Development Council
(FIDC). BFAR became responsible for regulating the quality and output of
fishing industry through issuance of licenses, fishery extension and train-
ing, research and demonstration activities, and compilation of statistics.
PFDA became responsible for establishing processing facilities and improv-
ing the handling, preservation, and marketing of fish products.   This
included managing fishing ports and cold storage plants and providing
information to the fishing industry. FIDC was created in 1975 to formulate
and coordinate fisheries policies, including proposals coming from such
implementing agencies as BFAR and PFDA. As a high level interagency plan-
ning body, FIDC has been technically responsible for promoting investments
in the fisheries industry and coordinating private sector and government
efforts in fisheries development.
15.     While a succession of Presidential Decrees sought to define and
clarify the functions of these bodies, the documents did not sufficiently
delineate activities. Bureaucracies grew, but their operational effective-
ness was hampered by inadequate budgets, internal organizational problems
and lack of skilled staff and appropriate facilities. As a result, there
was overlap and duplication of some programs and insufficient attention to
others, particularly the enforcement of fishery regulations.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FISHERY IRAINING PROJECT (LOAN 1786-Pin
REPORT PREPARED BY THE GOVERNHENT
Summary and Hixhlithts
Proiect Backaround
1.       Taking its cue from the educational policy and program recommenda-
tions of the Presidential Commission to Survey Philippines Education
(PCSPE) pertaining to agricultural education, the Educational Development
Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF) of the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Sports (1IECS) in 1976 led other agencies in identifying speci-
fic areas of this sub-sector of education which required development assis-
tance. One such area was fishery training. A project study of national
fishery education and training was conducted by the PCSPE with a view to
establishing a coherent fishery training system that would provide the kind
of research and the level and type of training needed by the Philippines'
fishery industry.
2.       As a result, the Fishery Training Project was formed with the
following objectives: (i) to strengthen fishery research; (ii) to produce
the appropriately qualified professional and technical manpower required by
the fishery sector; and (iii) to improve the knowledge and skills of
fishermen. It was envisioned that the Project would support the Government
of the Philippines'  (GOP) Integrated Fishery Development Strategy.   The
proposed project called for the establishment of the University of the
Philippines in the Visayas-College of Fisheries (UPV-CF) as the apex
national institutioa for fishery training and of a network of Regional
Institutes of Fishery Technology (RIFTs) and Regional Fishermen Training
Centers (RFTCs) to serve as regional training institutions for technical
manpower and non-formal fishery training, respectively.   Seven each of
these institutes and centers were identified for assistance under the
Fishery Training Project. The development package for these institutions
was to include institutional and laboratory equipment, buildings and faci-
lities, furniture, textbooks and reference materials, vessels, specialists'
services, and fellowships.
3.       The Project was presented to the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBID) for possible loan assistance.   In
1979, a US$S8.0 million loan was negotiated with the IBRD while the GOP
stood ready with local counterpart funds of US$32.6 million equivalent.
4.       The signing and effectiveness of the Project took place in
February and May 1980, respectively.   Project completion was originally
scheduled for December 1984 and closing for June 30, 1985, for a 65-month



- 36 -
implementation period (i.e., from loan signing to the closing date). The
project was actually closed on December 31, 1987, with most of the physical
vorks completed, representing a tice overrun of 62S (see para. 7).
Protect Implementation
5.       The management and administration of the Project was to be
centralized at EDPITAF.  Owing to the decision of EDPITAF management in
1982 to support the decentralization thrust of the GOP, however, project
management was subsequently shared by EDPITAF with the recipient Project
Institutions (PIs). At the EDPITAP level, detailed implementation activi-
ties were coordinated by its Fishery Education Division (FED) while at the
PI level, implementation work was coordinated by the Project Executive
Teams (PET). The following aspects of project implementation were given to
the PIs   entering into contracts as owners with civil works contractors
and equipment suppliers; exercising direct management and supervision of
the civil works components; preparing equipment lists, specifications and
quantities; administering the technical assistance programs; and making
payments to contractors.
6.       During implementation, the project implementation period was
extended by 30 months for a total period of 95 months from loan signing to
the closing date. An additional seven months were further allotted for the
completion of disbursements. The extension was necessary due to a combina-
tion of factors.   During its second year of implementation, the project
schedule was derailed because of the shift from a centralized to a decen-
tralized project implementation scheme (para. 5).   The shift required a
period of adjustment both at the EDPITAF and PI levels. Further readjust-
ments had to be made until a suitable scheme combining some centralized and
decentralized features, that served the interest of the Project, was
arrived at. Also, the Project was plagued by delayed and insufficient fund
releases by the GOP. The difficult financial position became more evident
in late 1983, just when project was starting to take cff, and in the years
4immdiately following, due to the unstable political and economic condi-
tions suffered by the country at that time.
7.       By project closing, physical accomplishments stood as follows:
civil works: 861 complete; equipments 971 delivered at site; furniture: 852
delivered at site; and technical assistance: 851 complete.
8.       One notable development under the civil works component was the
strengthening of the procedures for pre-qualification of contractors, exe-
cutive architects and construction managers.  This strengthening was in-
tended to make the selection process of these professionals more stringent.
During the early stages of the Project, however, there was some laxity in
enforcing the new procedures for pre-qualification, resulting in instances
where contracts had to be cancelled due to poor performance.
9.       Building construction and site development works were contracted
to thirteen private builders at an original coatract cost of Pesos
307.8 million.   The actual construction cost, however, for revised con-
tracts including escalation costs, supplementary agreements, and change
orders ballooned to Pesos 496.6 million, an increase of 612. This increase



- 37 -
in cost can be attributed to the continuous devaluation of the peso during
the implementation years and the spiralling of prices of construction
materials, equipment and related  services used under the Project.
Construction-related services such as those of construction managers and
executive architects were also engaged.  The total cost for the former,
which vas not given any allocation at appraisal reached Pesos 19.1 million
while the actual cost for the latter amounted to Pesos 23.8 million or 120S
more than the appraisal eptimate.  The total gross area cnestructed
increased slightly (72) from 90,680 square meters to 97,478 square meters.
The construction period which was estimated at appraisal to last 24 to 30
months, on average, turned out to be longer, at 73 months, on average.
10.      In equipment procurement, improvements in the procedures for pre-
qualification of suppliers we_e also put into effect to ensure that the
equipment suppliers and contractors allowed to participate in the Project
were limited to those who had the capability to do the work and had proven
track records.  Another significant development under the Project was the
revision of the mode of payment for equipment which was an attempt to
protect the interests of the end-users. The 80X-201 mode of payment was
adopted over the 90X-102 payment scheme as originally practiced. Equipment
items procured under the Project include institutional equipment, fishing
vessels, and books and reference materials valued at Pesos 226.8 million
which is 2272 higher than the appraisal estimate of Pesos 69.4 million.
Furniture was estimated at appraisal to cost Pesos 17.2 million; the actual
value of contracts awarded amounted to Pesos 35.1 million, or double the
estimate.
Protect Outcomes
11.      Generally, the stipulations and covenants governing the execution
of the Project were adhered to and special conditions and provisions were
complied with.  Whenever required, the concurrence of the IBRD was sought
by the GOP.
12.      With respect to the investment inputs, there were notable delays
in their provision. On the whole, however, the facilities provided were
rated good by the recipient institutions, in terms of their aesthetic and
functional quality, designs and space standards, and adequacy.  Notwith-
standing the deficient and defective equipment items delivered to the
project sites, it was generally agreed that the number, types and kinds of
equipment acquired under the Project were acceptable and adequate to imple-
ment the curricular programs and attain the program training objectives.
13.      With respect to the implementation of the new training programs,
the following can be noted:
14.      The transfer of staff and personnel from the University of the
Philippines-College of Fisheries (UP-CF) campus at Diliman, near Manila, to
the nw UPV-CF site at Miag-ao, did not take place in 1982 as scheduled due
to the delayed completion of facilities and the delayed acquisition of
equipment and furniture at the site. As a result, the new curriculum for
the Bachelor of Science in Fisheries (BSP) and the post-graduate programs



- 38 -
were not offered by the original target dates.  However, with the transfer
in June 1988 of UP-CF personnel to the Miag-ao site, it is expected that
the new curriculum will be offered starting the second semester of school
year (SY) 1988-89.
15.      The new Diploma in Fishery Technology (DFT) course at the seven
RIFTs vas first offered in SY 1983-84 coinciding with the schedule set
during appraisal. Yearly enrollment at the RIFTs at full capacity averaged
about 1,360 which is only 482 of appraisal targets. The average drop-out
rate in all the RIFTs from SY 1983-84 to SY 1987-88 was 28Z which is con-
siderably higher than the 101 estimated at appraisal (Table 1.1).  The
first batch of graduates was produced in SY 1985-86.  The average yearly
output of the RIFTs between SY 1985-86 and SY 1987-88 is 300 graduates, 602
below the targets. This discouraging picture of the sub-sector's perform-
ance has been caused by a number of factors. One probable reason for the
low level of attraction of fisheries courses is that students perceive
employment opportunities in this area as limited. The tracer study cover-
ing the first batch of RIFT graduates indicates that only 411 of these
graduates were able to find gainful employment, 872 of which were in the
fishery sector. Another possible reason is that some of the students who
end up taking fishery courses are not there by choice and thus are less
likely to pursue or finish the course.   In addition, the new programs
encountered difficulties due to the delays in the provision of facilities,
furniture, laboratory equipment, textbooks and reference materials, and
fishing vessels.

16.      The RFTCs were expected to train 8,400 fishermen annually.  The
actual yearly output, however, has averaged only 3,880, a shortfall of 542
from the yearly target estimated at appraisal despite the fact that the
number of training programs conducted was more than envisaged at appraisal.
About 700 extension agents of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
(BFAR) have attended in-service training courses during the implementation
period, 901 short of the projected number.
17.      The entire technical assistance program provided under the Project
was re-aligned in 1984 with the conversion of some foreign experts' slots
to local experts' slots and some to degree fellowships. This was done in
order to include additional fellowships, extend the duration of some exist-
ing fellowships, and replace foreign experts with local experts who were
more acquainted with Philippine conditions.
18.      A total of 4,268 man-months of overseas and local degree and non-
degree training for 960 fellows were used by the project institutions.
This is an increase of 37% and 170S over appraisal estimates for man-months
and fellowships, respectively. In addition, the project management support
(PHS) staff of EDPITAP used 49 degree and non-degree overseas fellowship
slots.   This is equivalent to 121 man-months, a 63% and 1S increase in
number and duration over those allocated at appraisal, respectively. Ten
of the trained staff which utilized 41 of the total man-months provided
under the Project failed to satisfy the full terms of their contracts with
the agencies that sponsored them. Most did, however, and are now serving
at their respective institutions. These staff will provide leadership in
the institutions on program/project and research undertakings. A total of
143 man-months for 28 specialists in different fields of fishery and
fishery-related areas were also used for PMS. This is lower by 122 and 282
in man-months and slots, respectively, when compared with appraisal esti-
mates. Any benefit or impact derived from the experts' services was mini-
mal as their training and orientation did not fit local conditions and
their hiring was untimely as the required equipment and facilities were not
yet available.
Proiect Cost and Financing
19.      The original IBRD loan of US$38.0 million was restructured twice-
-first, to accommodate a Norwegian grant of US$7.6 million in 1982 which
necessitated a corresponding reduction in the loan, and second, due to the
cancellation in 1987 of US$0.75 M estimated to be unutilized at the closing
date, as part of the Aquino administration's effort to reduce the country's
debt burden.   Thus, the foreign assistance available totaled US$37.2
million.
20.      At the close of the disbursement period in July 1988, a total of
US$35.1 million (US$28.1 million from the loan and US$7 million from the
grant) had been disbursed, or 94% of the total.   The remaining US$2.1
million (61) remained undisbursed and was subsequently cancelled. In addi-
tion, the GOP's total counterpart funding reached US$25.9 million. Thus in
terms of sharing, the GOP/IBRD/Norvegian government assistance to the
Project stood at 421/46Z/12X, respectively.



- 41 -
21.      In terms of the allocation by project component, the foreign
assistance was distributed as follows:   civil works - US$15.6 million
(441); furniture -US$.10 million (01); equipment - US$16.0 million (462);
and technical assistance - US$3.4 million (101).
22.      In terms of allocation by project components, the investment
inpats, including GOP's share, were channeled as followss US$20.3 million
(332) for the development of the UPV-CP, US$38.2 million (631) for the
establishment of the RIFTs and RFTCs; and US$2.5 million (41) for project
management support.
Conclusions and Recommendations
23.      Proiect Preparation and Appraisal.  In hindsight, project prepara-
tion and appraisal work appear to have suffered one serious deficiency.
The provisions for building facilities seem ambitious. Physical facilities
consumed more project funds than necessary. In future projects, care must
be given to weighing the extent of provision of physical facilities against
the requirements of the program. This provision should be kept at a more
reasonable and modest level. However, the SAR appears to have anticipated
correctly the major constraints that were likely to be faced by the
Project.
24.      Management and Oraanizational Effectiveness.  The decentralization
of implementation responsibilities from EDPITAE to the PIs brought mixed
results. On the one hand, it contributed to delays in project execution,
while on the other hand, institutional capabilities of the PIs were
enhanced. It appears that the primary concern of EDPITAE management was
more to address the long-term aspect of ensuring the effectiveness of the
Project through institution building rather than the immediate concern for
project implementation efficiency.
25.      Nevertheless, at the EDPITAF level, ways and means were devised to
improve internal efficiency, particularly with respect to selection of
project contractors and equipment suppliers. Improved procedures for pre-
qualification were put into operation to ensure that the GOP selects only
those contractors and suppliers who are the most capable and have the best
track records in te-ms of performance.   Such stringent measures should
remain in force for future projects to protect adequately GOP's interest.
26.      On the other hand, procurement was not carefully prioritized in
the case of books and reference materials and of the vehicle requirements
of the RPTCs' training and extension agents. Contract monitoring was lax,
equipment was left un-inspected and deficiencies were left unrectified for
a considerable length of time.  It is suggested that EDPITAP management
look into the following: (a) strengthening of systems and procedures in the
areas of contract preparation and contract management; and (b) streng-
thening of over-all planning to ensure that the investment inputs are well
prioritizsed and synchronized across project components.



- 42 -
27.      Implementation of Proiect Components and Outcomes - Program
Implementatlon. The Project has provided the impetus in establishing a
more coordinated and rationalized system of fishery training in the
Philippines which is one of the five sub-sectors of the National
Agriculture Education System.1/
28.      Technical Assistance.   The fellowship program was successful in
upgrading the skills and competence of the staffs of the PIs. The program
has enabled the staff to keep up with the latest developments in their
respective areas or fields of expertise. These staff must be provided with
the necessary incentives to keep them in their present posts and given the
support necessary to help them become leaders in propelling their respec-
tive institutions to be centers of quality fishery education and training.
29.      Civil Works.   Generally, the buildings and structures provided
under the Project were rated good by the end-users with respect to func-
tional and aesthetic qualities, designs and space standards and adequacy.
Sufficient funds must be provided for the up-keep and maintenance of these
facilities so as to maximize their use and to prevent early deterioration
and destruction.
30.      Eouiument Procurement.  Items acquired under the Project in terms
of numbers, types and kinds were judged adequate to implement the curric-
ular programs and attain the program and training objectives. Support must
be provided to train and maintain staff to operate these equipment items.
In addition, adequate financial support for operation and maintenance of
the items must be guaranteed in order that maximum benefits be derived from
their use.
31.      As with the provision of building facilities, in future, care must
be taken with the provision of equipment so that acquisition of sophisti-
cated items beyond those reasonably required by the program components is
avoided.   The RIFTs, which offer the DFT program,  in most instances,
patterned their equipment requests after those of the UPV-CF which offers
degree and post- graduate fishery programs.
32.      Proiect Financing.   Obviously, the financial position of the
Project was crucially linked to implementation performance. In retrospect,
it may be noted that had the GOP been able to release sufficient funds
following the appraisal schedule, implementation and performance would have
been facilitated. Perhaps there would have been no need to increase the
GOP's contribution to the Project.
33.      One lesson that may be drawn from the Project is the need for
closer interaction between a project's executing agency and the GOP's
fiscal agency during project preparation. Closer coordination could help
identify more clearly the needs of the executing agency and the expected
critical support from the fiscal agency. Further, this coordination would
help the executing agency understand budgetary procedures before it pre-
pares implementation schedules.
JLI The other four sub-sectors are: agriculture education, agriculture
engineering, forestry, and veterinary medicine.



- 43 -
34.      Performance of Consultants.  Contractors and Suppliers.   In
general, the technical consultants hired under the Project were able to
carry out their duties satisfactorily. However, the naval architects and
shipbuilding consultants, performed below par as borne out by the dissatis-
faction of the Pls with the design and construction of the fishing vessels.
35.      Three of the building contractors experienced difficulties.  Two
civil works contractors failed to comply with the terms of their contracts
resulting in cancellation of the contracts.   The performance of still
another was slow. The latter resulted in court proceedings which are still
in progress.
36.      The performance  of suppliers of equipment and furniture was
varied. Some religiously complied with their contract obligations while
others did poorly by supplying defective and deficient items not conforming
to specifications and by refusing to rectify noted deficiencies. In such
instances, it is recommended that EDPITAF exercise its legal option to
withhold the suppliers' bonds and/or blacklist said suppliers.   EDPITAF
should also notify other GOP agencies of the same as a warning to the
agencies not to engage the services of the delinquent suppliers.
37.       Outstanding Policy Issues.  The Project illustrates how decen-
tralization can be effected, if only to a limited extent. Needless to say,
decentralization has its positive and negative aspects.   In the future,
decentralization should be approached more realistically. The proponents
should set up, at the appropriate time, the mechanisms by which it could
sufficiently be implemented; they should consider the preparedness and
absorptive capacity of the institutions who will assume new roles and
functions. 
38.      Measures should be taken to attract a sufficient number of stu-
dents into PIs offering the new curricula both at the professional and
technician levels, and trainees into the non-formal fishery programs.
39.      Institutionalization of the RIFTs and the RFTCs which would
guarantee the provision of sufficient funding support for their up-keep,
maintenance and operation, must be pursued.  The regularization of the
positions of an adequate number of staff and personnel must be effected in
order to sustain the continuity of program implementation initiated under
the Project. Support and assistance must be particularly accorded to the
Samar and Davao RIFTs which, up to this late stage, remain classified as
secondary schools.  As early as SY 1983-84, these two institutions were
offering the post-secondary program. Because their re-classification has
not been acted upon, these two institutions continue to be %lagued by the
imbalance between the financial and manpower support provided and that
which is required to enable them to reasonably meet their new program
concerns and responsibilities.   It is strongly recommended that the GOP
lose no time in re-classifying these institutions in order to pave the way
for the upgrading of their staff positions and to funding support at a
level fitting a post- secondary institution.



- 44 -
40.      Howevor, institutionalization should also be viewed in a broader
and wider context in terms of how effective the UPV/RIFT/RPITC networking
is operationalized and maintained to produce the desired benefits. Insti-
tutionalization should detail the flow of responsibilities and accountabi-
lities between and among the agencies or institutions involved.
41.      The high drop-out rates of fishery students and the seemingly low
attractiveness of the fishery training programs both demand considerable
attention. The underlying factors need to be looked into. The institu-
tions should also strengthen their student recruitment and placement
programs.
42.      The situation with respect to the demand for fishery graduates on
a regional basis should also be investigated. The RIFTs are expected to
assume a lead role in such studies in their respective regions.   The
information that may be generated would help the regional institutions in
collaboration with the education policy makers to formulate and adapt
appropriate policies and programs.
43.      On a broader scale, DECS plans to undertake a review of the
fishery education and training sub-sector which would generate data and
information about the state of the art of fishery education and training
with a particular focus on the fishery labor and market situations. It is
intended to generate data that will provide education planners some funda-
mental bases for making decisions as to whether or not the macro-plan,
particularly concerning the fishery sub-sector, should be pursued in its
entirety or be amendedimodified.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The preparation of this Project Completion Report (PCR) is in
compliance with the provisions of Section 3.04(c) of the Loan Agreement
(Loan 1786-PH) entered into by and between the Republic of the Philippines
and the IBRD in February 1980.
1.2      The purpose of this report is to review the execution and initial
operation of the Fishery Training Project in order to gauge the results of
the investment made by the GOP in this Project.  The PCR describes and
analyzes the state of project results to compare the costs and realized
benefits with those defined during project appraisal.   The PCR also
analyzes major problems and takes note of project experiences and the
lessons learned.
1.3      For the purpose of preparing the PCR, EDPITAF organized a team
whose members were non-project staff (i.e., those who were not directly
involved in the Project's implementation). This step was adopted to ensure
greater objectivity in the assessment of the performance of the Project.
The team, however, worked closely with project implementation staff to
obtain factual information. Later it became a Desk under the umbrella of
the Research and Project Development Office (RPDO), the unit in EDPITAF in
charge of sector studies, project development and post-project evaluation.
Before the final report was issued, RPDO subjected the draft PCR to a
series of internal reviews involving EDPITAP management and staff know-
ledgeable either about the Project itself or about particular aspects of
project management and implementation as a whole. Feedback on the draft
report was also obtained from the PIa and their comments were subsequently
incorporated.
1.4      In the preparation of this report, references were made to the
project proposal documents, loan negotiation documents, the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR), the Loan Agreement, project files and records, answers to
questionnaires by PI staff and interviews with personnel who were involved
in the execution of the Project.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic and Political Settina
2.1      The Fishery Training Project was undertaken in support of the
GOP's Integrated Fisheries Development Plan for 1978-1987 which had the
principal objectives of: (i) raising fish production to attain self-
sufficiency in fish and increase fishery exports; and (ii) improving
fishery resources management.   Fish production was projected to have a
growth rate of 4.52 per annum with a proportional growth rate in fishery
employment of 3.81 per annum.



- 46 -
2.2      Fishery training suffered from low quality both at the degree and
diploma levels. Graduates were poorly trained due to weak teaching staff,
inadequate teaching equipment and facilitles and the type of training
given.   This situation was exacerbated by the decline in the level of
training expenditures in the 1970'. which, ironically, was accompanied by
expansion or proliferation of schools offering degree programs in fisheries
and other agricultural and allied disciplines.   Generally, the education
and training provided was not sufficient to prepare students for employment
in the fishery industry, resulting in a structural imbalance between the
supply and the need for trained manpower.
2.3      As part of the strategy for integrated fishery development, the
GOP sought to improve research and training for the development of manage-
ment, technology, marketing and appropriate manpower and to strengthen the
planning of fishery programs. This was to be carried through the estab-
lishment of a coordinated national system and the introduction of measures
to improve the quality and relevance of fishery research and training.
Proiect Formulation
2.4      Among the educational reforms recommended by the PCSPE 21 was the
rationalization and improvement of the agricultural education sub-system
where fishery training is one sub-sector. A macro-plan was designed which
provided for the establishment of a fishery education system.3/ The system
would help effect the changes needed by the fishery industry through the
provision of appropriately trained manpower.
2.5      In September 24,  1972, Presidential Decree 6-A created the
Educational Development Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF) under
the office of the Secretary of Education and Culture. It was assigned the
implementation, management and supervision of foreign-assisted education
development projects.   EDPITAF has since implemented and managed eight
major projects financed through the IBRD and the Asian Development Bank.
These projects addressed priority needs in the areas of basic education,
vocational and technical education, development of quality instructional
materials for primary and secondary education, and agricultural education.
2.6      During tne formulation of the Third Education Project with the
IBRD in March 1975, two main programs were identified--a basic education
development program and a rural development program.   The former con-
centrated on the total reform of elementary and secondary education through
2/   The PCSPE, by virtue of an Executive Order, was created in 1970 to
assess the Philippine Education System. The assessment was completed
in 8 months and the recommendations were embodied in the report
"Education for National Development."
3J The macro-plan would be composed of four levels patterned after the
pyramidal structure of fishery manpower requirements for national
development, including a national university for fisheries, three zonal
universities/ colleges, 12 regional institutes of fisheries training to
be established, and a number of fishery high schools.



- 47 -
the adequate provision of quality instructional materials and the re-
training of teachers to handle these materials. The latter called for the
development of one regional agricultural college in the Visayss, a fishery
education system with the proposed UPV-CF as a nucleus, a forestry educa-
tion system with the University of the Philippines in Los Banos-College of
Forestry as the nucleus, a combined veterinary medicine/animal husbandry
complex in Diliman and Los Banos, and development of multi-purpose training
centers for agriculture and rural development.
2.7      Due to the magnitude of these programs, the Third Education
Project subdivided into two separate projects: the basic education develop-
ment program covering reforms in basic education which eventually became
the Third Education Project, and the rural development program concen-
trating on agricultural education which became the Fourth Education Project
but excluded fishery education.
2.8      On September 8, 1976, the GOP, by virtue of Letter of Instruction
No. 459, designated sixteen government agencies to assist in the implemen-
tation of the Integrated Fisheries Development Plan.   These agencies
included the Ministry of Natural Resources, BFAR, MECS, EDPITAF, the
University of the Philippines (UP), and the Fishery Industry Development
Council.   As a result, the Ministry of Natural Resources  (now the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)) authorized EDPITAF
to conduct a feasibility study on the development of a national fisheries
education and training system.   EDPITAF then organized a multi-agency
project study group known as the Committee on Fisheries Integrated
Development Education Study (CONFIDES) with members coming from various GOP
and private agencies concerned with fisheries development.
2.9      In June 1977, a Food and Agricultural Organization team composed
of three consultants was hired to extend assistance to CONFIDES.   In
January 1978, a project proposal titled "Development and Upgrading of
Fisheries Education and Training" was finally presented to the GOP which
readily expressed its own commitment. In June of the same year, the IBRD
sent a pre-appraisal mission to review the total project proposal.   The
Project was appraised in August-September 1979, and became the Fishery
Training Project.  Negotiations were held in November 1979 and the Loan
Agreement was signed in February 1980.
2.10     The Project was to be financed through an IBRD loan of US$38.0
million and GOP counterpart funds of US$32.6 million equivalent. The loan
became effective in May 1980.
Proiect Description
2.11     The principal objective of the Project was to upgrade fisheries
education and training in order to produce highly trained fishery manpower
at all levels vis-a-vis the strengthening of the fishery work force and the
upgrading of technological know-how mn fisheries development.   Specifi-
cally, the Project aimed to assist the GOP to strengthen fishery technology
and human resources by establishing a national system of fishery training.
The system was intended to achieve the following:  (i) strengthen fishery



- 48 -
research; (ii) produce appropriately qualified professional and technical
manpower required for the fishery sector; and (iii) improve the knowledge
and skills of fishermen.
2.12     In support of these objectives, the Project vas to: (a) relocate
the UP-CF and strengthen its programs to produce highly qualified manpower
for positions in teaching, business, management, research and extension;
(b) establish Regional Iastitutes of Fisheries Technology (RIFTs) to
provide for middle-level manpower requirements (extension workers, fishery
technicians, fishery entrepreneurs, research aides); and (c) establish
Regional Fishermen Training Centers (RFTCs) for small-scale fishermen,
fishfarmers and processors to improve their production and income through
improving their skills using new methods of training. The above objectives
were to be pursued through the provision of: (4) building construction;
(ii) furniture; (iii) training vessels, vehicles, books and instructional
equipment; (iv) technical assistance in the form of fellowships, non-degree
training and specialists' services; and (v) a fund for research projects.
2.13     The Project supported the following recipient institutions:
(a) the UPV-CF at Miag-ao, Iloilo in Region VI;

2.14     These institutions were selected as recipient institutions on the
basis of two criteria: (i) they were appropriately distributed throughout
the country; and (ii) they have direct access to the sea. The seven RFTCs
were established at the sites of the RIFTs. The decision to establish the
A/ Now the Zamboanga State College of Marine Science and Technology.



- 49 -
Centers and the Institutes at common sites was prompted by the desire to
promote resource-sharing and maximization of investment inputs. The RIFTs
and RPTCs were expected to benefit from the joint training operations.
2.15     The risks associated with the Project as determined at appraisal
were as follows: (i) an over-supply of well-trained professional and tech-
nical fishery manpower could be created, if the GOP's fishery development
programs did not proceed as envisaged; (ii) the GOP could suffer from
inefficient implementation of the programs without the trained manpower to
be produced by the Project; (iii) the UPV-CF might encounter difficulties
in attracting a sufficient number of qualified staff to the rural area cf
Miag-ao during the initial years of its operation; (iv) social and politi-
cal pressures could prevent the GOP from phasing out degree programs at the
proposed RIPTs; (v) problems of coordination and implementation could arise
because two ministries would have responsibility for the RIFTs and the
RFTCs; and (vi) project facilities, particularly the 16 fishing training
vessels and those operated by BFAR, might not be fully utilized and well-
maintained due to insufficient allocation of operating funds.
2.16     The benefits expected from the Project would be derived from its
contribution to institution building, manpower development, and research
development, namely: (i) the Project would assist the GOP to develop a
national system of fishery training, to rationalize the structure of the
system, and to improve the quality of training; (ii) the Project would make
available the supply of professional and technical manpower needed by the
country's fishery development program; and (iii) fishery research programs
would be improved and developed which would produce fishery technology and
management methods suited to the Philippine fishery industry.



- 50 .
Proiect Goals and Scove
2.17     The Project aimed to consolidate fishery education and training
within the framework of an apex national institution (UPV-CF) and the
RIFTsIRFTCs.  This system would provide a basic framework to produce an
improved quality of fishery training for professional and technical man-
power and on a non-formal basis.
2.18     The UPV-CF would be able to contribute 302 of the professional
manpower requirements of the industry over the 1979-90 period.   Thirty
percent of the technical manpower needs would be supplied by the RIFTs. In
addition, in-service programs would be provided for over 65,000, repre-
senting about 102 of existing small-scale fishermen, and for extension
workers at the GOP's fishery agency.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overall Project Management
3.1      National Level.  As stipulated in the Loan Agreement (Article 1,
Section 1.02(e)], EDPITAF served as the Project Unit charged with imple-
menting the Project.   The office within EDPITAF which was specifically
designated to coordinate implementation activities across components and
institutions was the Fishery Education Division (FED).
3.2      During its eight-year life span, the Project witnessed four
changes of leadership at EDPITAF which at times even meant a change in its
name (to Office of Foreign Assisted Projects, later to Project Development
Implementation Management Office, then back to EDPITAP). These develop-
ments affected project continuity and to some extent led to confusion in
implementation in view of the varying management styles that came with each
change of leadership. Even within the FED, leadership changed hands three
times.   Some staff were also reassigned to other units during project
implementation which hampered the coordination and moniLoring of the
Project.
3.3      The management schemes introduced by EDPITAF's various managers
were characterized by shifts from centralized management to decentralized,
and later to a combination of centralized and decentralized management. At
the early stages of project implementation covering the period 1980 to
early 1981, management of the Project was highly centralized. EDPITAF was
responsible for over-all administration of the Project and of procurement
and implementation of all its physical aspects. It exercised full finan-
cial control and supervision of implementation.
3.4      However, as early as 1980, some steps were taken by the then
Executive Director towards devolvement of project implementation res-
ponsibilities, in support of a national policy calling for decentralized
operations.   At his instance, a provision was incorporated into the
Appropriations Act of 1980 calling for the release of the loan proceeds,



- 51 -
counterpart funds and operating expenses provided in the allocations for
the PIe directly to PIe. This decentralized system required the PIe to be
more active in implementation, with EDPITAP providing necessary assistance.
The PIe assumed the following roless (i) entering into contracts as owners
with civil works contractors and equipment suppliers; (ii) exercising
direct management and supervision of the civil works components;
(iii) preparing equipment lists and specifications and determining quanti-
ties; (iv) administering their technical assistance programs; and
(v) effecting payments to contractors upon the advice and certification of
these payments by EDPITAF. On the other hand, EDPITAP maintained responsi-
bility fort   (i) preparation of architectural briefs and civil works
designs and bid documents; (ii) selection of civil works contractors and
construction managers; (iii) conducting of bidding and award of civil works
and equipment contracts; and (iv) facilitating the technical assistance
program and the remittance of allowances to overseas fellows and grantees.
3.5      The shift in project management from a centralized system to a
decentralized one had mixed results. It had a positive effect in buiilding
institutional capabilities in project management and implementation at the
PIe which were forced to make vital decisions for themselves. On the other
hand, implementation delays were encountered primarily because there had
not been enough groundwork done to prepare the system for the transition.
The budgetary system was decentralized but the implementing mechanisms were
not geared for such operations. One notable delay occurred in the awarding
of civil works contracts as it was unclear as to who was to sign the
contracts. Compounding the problem was the lack of understanding at the
PIe of IBRD requirements and procedures.
3.6      In 1986, when substantial funds for equipment remained unutilized
within the first revised closing date of December 31, 1986, EDPITAP and the
PIe concerned entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) aimed at con-
solidating equipment funds at EDPITAP to enable the acquisition centrally
of the remaining equipment packages. This resulted in a combined central-
ized and decentralized project management.
3.7      The MOA allowed the release of unspent funds for equipment
directly to EDPITAP, and authorized EDPITAP to have full control of the
management and disbursement of these funds. As a result, EDPITAF, repre-
senting the PIs, signed as owner, contracts with the winning equipment
suppliers. Fund management and other roles already performed by the PIs
under the decentralized scheme remained unaltered.
3.8      Experience showed that the centralized part of the combination
management scheme proved beneficial to the Project as the procurement
process was expedited owing to a decrease in the documentation load, the
reduced number of signatories to contracts, and easier contract management
work.
3.9      With EDPITAP as coordinating body, decision and policy-making
relative to project implementation processes were shared with the PIs. In
May 1981, the respective heads of the PIe bonded themselves and organized
the Project Standing Committee (PSC) which served as a forum for consulta-
tion and discussion on the progress of project implementation and of the



- 52 -
problems and issues confronting the Project. The PSC enabled the various
institutions to take concerted action in setting up implementation plans
and in seeking solutions to problems common across project sites.
3.10     Providing EDPITAF with guidance in program Implementation, was the
Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE). It offered recommenda-
tions on appropriate strategies for rationalizing and improving the effec-
tiveness of fishery education in the country such as the setting of minimum
standards for fishery programs which were subsequently adopted by all
existing fishery schools.  The activities of the TPAE also included the
development of a national system of accreditation for agricultural training
programs (fishery included), and technical assistance in the supervision,
inspection and regulation of all institutions giving agricultural training.
3.11     Regional and Institutional Levels.   At the regional level,
Regional Fishery Training Development Committees (RFTDCs) were established
early in the implementation period to oversee and coordinate the joint
activities of the RIFTs and the RFTCS. The RFTDCs were established in all
regions except at the Palawan RIFT (Region IV-A) as the RIFT headmaster
there did not see any need for such a committee.  Specifically, the RFTDCs
served as advisory bodies tackling matters relative to the sharing of
equipment and facilities and on the formulation of guidelines and policies
attendant to the sharing arrangements.   However, the operation of the
RFTDCs did not last long due to the difficulty of convening the members,
the lack of funds to pay for the committees' activities, and the fact that
matters of conflict arising were within the competence of the RIFTs and
RFTCs to resolve themselves.
3.12     To oversee the on-site implementation of the Project, a Project
Executive Team (PET) was organized at each project site. The effectiveness
and efficiency of the PETs varied. Some PIs considered the PETs as unne-
cessary while others recognized their effectiveness in implementation as
they provided advice to the PI headmasters and performed monitoring tasks.
One notable problem that affected the operation of the PETs was the absence
or inadequacy of funds to cover costs of salaries or honoraria for the PET
members.
3.13     To foster program coordination and cooperation between the RIFTs
and the RFTCs in their joint operations, Memoranda of Agreement on the
"Sharing of Facilities and Equipment" were entered into by and between the
RIPTs and RFTCs which aimed at achieving efficient programming and optimum
utilization of  facilities and equipment.  The MOAs specified the general
guidelines governing the use of the facilities, as well as the responsibi-
lities of each party.  The most notable problem experienced in the sharing
was the inability of the RFTCs to assume their share of the expense of
operating and maintaining the facilities and equipment.   This problem
continues to persist.
Imnlementation of Proiect Comonents
3.14     Proarams -and Research.   The assistance provided by the Project
comprises the development of the UPV-CF as the apex institution for fishery
training and the establisbment of RIFTs and RPTCs to serve as regional



- 53 -
institutions for technical manpower and non-formal fishery training,
respectively.
3.15     The UPV-CF failed to offer the new BSF curriculum in SY 1983-84 as
targeted because of the delay in the provision of facilities and equipment.
Development of facilities at the new site commenced only in November 1981
and construction reached substantial completion in 1987. The first equip-
ment package was bid only in June 1984 and first deliveries were made in
September 1985.  Moreover, the offering of post-graduate courses, i.e.,
PbDs in aquaculture and fishery biology, was also suspended.   Thus, for
some time both the Diliman and Iloilo campuses of the UP continued to offer
the BS? program using the old curriculum. Finally in ST 1988-89, the new
BSF curriculum with a major in inland fishery was first offered at Niag-
ao. The Master of Science in Fisheries (MSF) program was offered at both
campuses.
3.16     The revision of the old curriculum was made possible through the
collaborative efforts of key staff of the different departments of the UP-
CF, i.eo, Marine, Inland, Processing Technology and Fishery Management,
each reviewing the curriculum of the others. Further improvements to the
curriculum were made by the UPV-CF Curriculum Committee. The University
Board of Regents gave final approval to the revised curriculum.
3.17     At the seven RIFTs, the Diploma in Fishery Technology (DFT) was
offered starting in SY 1983-84 as scheduled. This is a three-year post-
secondary program leading to a diploma in marine fishery, inland fishery or
fish preservation and marketing. The program was designed to train techni-
cians for the fishery industry and the extension service. About 60S of
course time is allocated to technical and practical instruction and 402 to
pedagogical courses.   Students receive the DFT after two years study on
campus and completion of a one-year apprenticeship program. In compliance
with the loan covenant, the fishery degree program previously offered in
these institutions, except at Zamboanga RIFT, was phased out starting
SY 1983-84.
3.18     The new DPT curriculum departs from the traditioaal curriculum as
it gives more emphasis to technical and practical training rather than
theory. It was developed through a series of seminar workshops attended by
the heads of the RIFTs, consultants from the UP, the DECS, and the TPAE.
The adoption of the curriculum was facilitated by the use of syllabi which
fully detailed the training content of each course in line with the
practical and theory hours required by the new curriculum.   Teacher and
student manuals were developed and subsequently put into use.   The RIFT
instructors also attended training programs on teaching strategies and
methodologies designed by UPV to upgrade and improve their teaching
competence.
3.19     The first off-campus on-the-job training (OJT) of RIFT students
under the new DPT curriculum was carried out in SY 1985-86. The ten-month
practicum is part of the DFT curriculum which requires third year students
to undergo intensive exposure to fishing and fishery activities in GOP and
private companies in the province where the RIFT is located or in nearby



- 54 -
provinces, before they are considered qualified to graduate.   Financial
support for the students' transportation expenses is provided by the RIFTs.
Students who perform vell during their OJT are given assurances of employ-
ment after graduation.   The strong linkages initiated by the RIFT heads
with the different private and GOP firms helps to expedite the conducting
of the OJT program and facilitates job placement of the graduates.
3.20     The seven RFTCs are located within the RIFT campuses.  They were
established to assist the GOP to provide in-service training for extension
workers and non-formal fishery training for small-scale fishermen through
conducting courses in fish capture, fish harvest and fish handling and
preservation. These in-service programs are aimed at transferring avail-
able skills and knowledge to fishermen to help increase their production
and. better their standards of living, and at upgrading the technical and
administrative skills of extension workers.
,.21     Each RFTC was expected to conduct about twelve courses (generally
lasting from one to two weeks) per annum to benefit 100 fishermen per
course.  It was also expected that a total of about 1,000 extension agents
would be trained annually. The actual courses for small-scale fishermen,
fishfarmers and fish processors include fish pond construction, fish net
making, bangus fry gathering, integrated fish livestock production, rice-
fish culture, construction of hatcheries, fish processing techniques like
fish sauce making, kropeck making, etc. Instructional materials are given
free to participants. Visual aids adapted to the low level of knowledge of
the participants are also provided. In some cases construction materials
are provided for the completion of support projects, as in gill net
construction, fish corrals and multiple hooks and lines.
3.22     In carrying out the provisions of the Loan Agreement, a Research
Review Committee (RRC) was established and organized at the UPV-CF in May
1979 to supervise the implementation of the Project's research program
component. The RRC was composed of a chairman, three technical officers,
and selected consultants. The committee administered the disbursement of
funds from the research component (amounting to US$500,000) which was
intended to promote research in the UPV-CF and the RIFTs.  The selection
criteria for the research projects adopted by the RRC were in accordance
with those set by the Philippine Center for Agricultural Resources and
Research Development, the national research coordinating body. Approval of
research proposals was granted by the RRC in conformity with the
established target areas in fisheries of municipal, commercial, fishery
product utilization and aquaculture.
3.23     Throughout the project period, interest and enthusiasm toward
undertaking research were consistently shown by the staffs of the RIFTs and
the UPV-CF. A total of 38 research projects in fishery and fishery-related
areas were completed at a total cost of Pesos 3,174,390 (Table 3.1).

3.24     The research which placed emphasis on marine fishery satisfied the
recommendation given in the SAR.  Of the total of 38 research projects
undertaken, 14 (37Z) were in marine fisheries. Most of this research was
in fishing gear development and marine fishery resources management. Table
3.2 shows the distribution of research projects in the different fishery
areas. As expected, the UPV-CF was the most active in research having
undertaken a total of 14 research projects or 37S of the total, at a cost
of Pesos 856,939 (27% of the total cost).

3.25     Technical Assistance.  The Project provided support for specialist
services and fellowships to develop training and curricular programs and to
strengthen the quality of staff. At appraisal, a total of 3,228 man-months
of fellowships were allocated for 386 fellows and 492 man-months of specia-
lists services were planned from 92 experts. For the fellows, 1,596 man-
months were allocated for 62 degree fellowships and 1,632 man-months for
324 non-degree fellowships (Annex 1).
3.26     From the total fellowship programs planned at appraisal, 90 man-
years of overseas graduate training as well as non-degree training for
staff needing short observation tours and retraining were allocated to the
UPV-CF. This was expected to benefit a total of 54 UPV-CF staff--9 PhDs,
18 MSFs, and 27 fellows for non-degree training.  Specialist services of
2.5 man-years were also to be provided in planktology, hydrology, fishery
management and economics.  In fact, 1,380 man-months or an equivalent of
115 man-years were provided under the Project. Twenty-one fellows used a
total of 963 man-months for PbDs of which 89.25 man-months will be com-
pleted beyond final disbursements (July 1988). For MSFs, 12 fellows used
371.75 man-months and 26 fellows were benefited through non-degree
training. Compared with appraisal targets, there was an increase of 12 PhD
fellows and a decrease of 6 MSF fellows (Annex 2).  One fellowship reci-
pient from the UPV-CF failed to return and thus did not comply with her
service contract with the university.  It is expected that the PhD fellows
who are still completing their studies will be back at the university by
December 1990.
3.27     A total of 92 RIFT staff were able to undergo degree training
using 2,386.5 man-months, including 425.75 man-months for 36 fellows who
will complete their training beyond final disbursements (Annex 3).   In
addition, 644 slots were utilized for non-degree training for a total of
832 man-months, including observation and management tours and local work-
shops.  Altogether this is an increase of 184% in man-months for degrees
and 18% in man-months for non-degree training over the appraisal estimates.
Six fellows from the RIFTs failed to satisfy the full terms of their con-
tracts with the sponsoring institutions.
3.28     The majority of the present RFTC staff including the RFTC Central
Coordinating Staff based at BFAR, were able to undergo non-degree local and
overseas fellowship training as well as to attend local workshops and
seminars.  A total of 442 man-months will be utilized for 308 staff, of
which 212 and 14S in man-months and staff respectively, will be completed
beyond final disbursements (Annex 4).
3.29     The utilization of fellowships was made in conformity with the
procedures and criteria set forth by EDPITAF at the start of project imple-
mentation. Selection of fellows during the early implementation phase was
made at two levels--first, at the PI level by the institutions' Fellowship
Selection Committees and second, at the EDPITAF level by the Technical
Assistance Coordinating Committee.   However,  in the middle of project
implementation when decentralization of project management was initiated,



- 57 -
the selection task was devolved entirely to the PIs with RDPITAF under-
taking coordination with outside agencies ln matters such as facilitation
of acceptance by host institutions, travel arrangements, processing of per
diems, allowances and stipends, documentation of travel requirements
(pasesports, visas) and the like.
3.30     A re-allocation of 269.5 man-months of specialists services (552
of the original allocation) to fellowships was made in mid-1984 with the
approval of the I8RD. The reallocation was made possible by the conversion
of several slots intended for foreign specialists to slots for local
specialists. The belief then was that the need for specialists' services
could be sufficiently met by local consultants who were more familiar with
the situation and conditions of the local fishery industry as well as with
the state of fishery training and education in the Philippines.
3.31     The average actual time taken to complete the fellowships took
longer than was estimated at appraisal.   Local masters two-year degree
programs were completed in three years on average, while the three-year
overseas PhD fellowships undertaken by UPV-CF faculty took about 4.5 years
on average.   As mentioned above, some fellows are expected to complete
their courses beyond final disbursements, with the last fellow due to
return by December 1990.
3.32     One reason that caused delay in implementation of the foreign
degree fellowship program by the UPV-CF was the fellows' difficulties in
gaining admission to reputable fishery training institutions overseas. The
problem was subsequently solved when the (then) Dean of the UPV-CP visited
possible host institutions and made arrangements for fellows' admission to
these institutions. A cause of delay at the RIPTs was their inability to
recruit substitute teachers to replace those scheduled to undergo training
because of the GOP's "ban on hiring" policy which was in effect during SYs
1983-84 and 1984-85.
3.33     Foreign specialists' services were generally utilized on a short-
term basis and were contracted by EDPITAF for the PIs and for project
management support (PMS). The UPV-CP also engaged the services of foreign
specialists in the areas of microbiology, planktology, and marine fishery,
with each one remaining ten months on average.   An expert on impact
evaluation Was contracted for the BFAR RFTCs, while for the EDPITAP-PMS,
specialists' services were engaged in monitoring and evaluation, naval
architecture and program development.  Local consultants provided assis-
tance in naval architecture, management and curriculum development, and
equipment specification vriting.5/

3.34     Civil Works and Professional Services.  Civil works contracts were
awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Contractors were chosen
from EDPITAP's list of prequalified contractors who had consistently parti-
cipated in IBRD projects in the past. The profiles of these contractors
5/  The Borrower n. .es a discrepancy with their figures regarding the
technical assistance allocation to EDPITAP (See Attachment I).



- 58 -
are regularly updated by EDPITAP to ensure that the contractors' capabili-
ties warrant their participation in EDPITAP projects.   Recommended con-
tracts awards vere subject to review by the Contract Review Committee of
the National Economic Development Authority and approval by the President
of the Philippines. The IBRD was duly notified of approved awards. Civil
works contracts including site development, were awarded to 13 contractors.
3.35     In addition, the professional services of executive architects and
construction managers were utilized under the Project.   The awards of
executive architects' contracts were made on the basis of recommendations
by the executive architect of EDPITAF, following IBRD guidelines on the
selection of consultants.   The employment of construction managers was a
first in the experience of EDPITAF. In past projects, construction manage-
ment services were supplied by EDPITAE staff through its Civil Works
Division but with the advent of decentralized management, it became neces-
sary for the PIs to retain their own construction managers, as they did not
have the capacity to undertake this function themselves.
3.36     Pinancing of the construction managers was obtained from the civil
works and technical assistance categories of the loan. Initially, fees for
executive architects were financed from the proceeds of the Fourth
Education Project (Loan 1374-PH) under the allocation for preparation of
future projects.  This loan provided 492 of the total architectural fees
for the Fishery Training Project. After Loan 1374-PH closed, architects'
fees were financed from the technical assistance category of the Project.
Contracts with the construction managers were also financed under the tech-
nical assistance category. The RIFT at Palawan did not engage a construc-
tion manager. Instead, construction management services were performed by
the RIFT's resident engineer.
3.37     The SAR estimated the cost of building construction and site deve-
lopment at Pesos 359.1 million, but the original contract cost amounted
only to Pesos 307.8 million or 142 lower than the appraisal estimate.
Actual construction costs after contracts were revised to include escala-
tion costs, supplementary agreements, change orders and additional works,
reached Pesos 496.6 million by disbursement closing, an increase of 612
over the original contract costs (Annex 5).   Construction management
services under the original contracts (including technical consultants
hired by EDPITAP to beef up its Civil Works Division) amounted to Pesos 9.5
million but was later increased by 101 to Pesos 19.1 million. Architec-
tural fees for the entire project amounted to Pesos 23.8 million, 14:
higher than the original contract amounts and 94S more than appraisal
estimates (Annex 6).
3.38     The total civil works cost by disbursement closing (including
building construction, site development and professional services) for the
entire project amounted to Pesos 539.5 million, a 46% increase over apprai-
sal estimates (Annex 7), and represented 582 of the entire project cost
including future obligations. The UPV-CF's share of the civil works cost
amounted to Pesos 192.0 million or 36Z of the investment in -ivil works
while that of the RIFTs/RFTCs amounted to Pesos 341.7 million, or 641 of
the total civil works investment.

3.39     Construction works were expected at appraisal to be completed
vithin 30 months at most. The actual construction work, however, averaged
77 months to complete (Annex 8). Building construction at the UPV-CF was
expected to start in January 1981 and to be finished by June 1983 for a
construction period of 30 months.   At the RIFTs/RFTCs, construction was
also to commence in January 1981 and was to have been completed within 24
months.
3.40     The delays experienced in civil works construction can be attrib-
uted to various factors affecting, at one time or another, all the project
sites or a particular project site. The GOP took steps to deal with these
problems. A summary of the most notable problems and the remedial measures
undertaken to correct them are presented below:
(a) The Samar project site had problems with squatters who
occupied 48X of the Project site until mid-1985 when 1.38 ha
were reclaimed from the sea adjacent to the site on which to
construct the remaining buildings. Also, construction work
at the site halted completely in November 1987 pending
resolution of a litigation initiated by the contractor
against EDPITAF; it was expected that after resolution of
this case, a new contractor would be hired to finish the
construction.
(b) Tendering was undertaken 10 months behind schedule and, as a
result, awarding of contracts was also delayed. A further
delay in contracting was caused by the unclear identity of
the GOP contracting agency, brought about by the unusual
arrangement whereby tendering and awarding were undertaken by
EDPITAF while financing was lodged with the PIs. The matter
was resolved when the Pls were finally designated as the
owners, and as such, were the contract signatories.
(c) The 1980 budget release of funds for building construction
(in the form of an obligational authority) was inadequate to
warrant the awarding of contracts. It was only in June 1981
that the obligational authority covering the full amount of
the construction cost was released, following consistent
application   by EDPITAF to the Office of Budget and
Management (OBM).
(d) On several occasions construction work slowed down and,
towards the end of 1983, drew to a halt (except at the Samar,
Davao and Zamboanga project sites) with about 701 overall
physical completion. Construction works recommenced only in
December 1985.  The problem stemmed from a combination of
factors, foremost of which were the following: lack of local
counterpart funds resulting from the devaluation of the peso
which unnecessarily required a drastic increase in local
currency requirements; nonpayment of the billings under the
contracts; and a shortage of construction and building



- 60 -
materials. This precarious situation necessitated the adop-
tion of immediate remedial measures, vizs amendment of the
original contracts to extend contract completion times and to
increase contract amounts; prioritization of structures or
buildings for completion; tapping of financial support from
other sources (i.e., Foreign Assisted Projects Support Fund
and Economic Support Fund which provided an aggregate sum of
Pesos 181.7 million in 1985 and 1986); and restructuring of
the loan allocations and modification of disbursement per-
centages for civil works (with the approval of the IBRD) from
40S to 702 and later to 95S of expenditures to be financed
from the loan.  Under the restructured loan, disbursements
were effected through direct payment to the contractors.
This eventually eased up the local currency requirements of
the Project as the GOP was no longer required to advance
payment for 100S of billings.
(e) Construction contracts of some original contractors had to be
cancelled for non-performance. The Aparri RIFT civil works
contract was cancelled in July 1984 when construction was
about 302 complete, and at the UPV-CF, the contract for the
instructional building works was cancelled in June 1983 when
physical completion was about 252.   A new contractor was
hired to take over at the Aparri project while the UPV
administration itself arranged for completion of the
unfinished instructional buildings at the site.
3.41     Payment for the services of the contractors was made through the
"progress billing system', a scheme instituted by the GOP as a means to
provide budgetary controls in the civil works component. This was adopted
as a protective measure in the interest of the GOP.  In the case of the
Aparri and Samar contracts, however, this measure worked otherwise. When
the contract of the original Aparri contractor was cancelled, there had
been an overpayment to him of Pesos 2.5 million, while at Sanar an overpay-
ment of Pesos 16.9 million had been made before EDPITAF finally decided to
rescind the contract. The collection of these amounts from the contractors
is still a subject of court proceedings.
3.42     Equipment and Furniture Procurement. Tendering for procurement of
goods to be financed from the loan was undertaken in accordance with the
IBRD's Guidelines for Procurement.  Some items were acquired through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) and international shopping, especially
in the last phases of implementation. The Project provided instructional
materials and textbooks, and fishing vessels to support the instructional
and training needs of the PIs in the offering of their curricular and
training programs.   The first package was tendered in June 1984, 4-1/2
years behind the appraisal schedule while the last package was tendered in
July 1987.
3.43     Lists and specifications for the equipment and furniture require-
ments were prepared by the PIs while the segregation of the items into
bidding packages, tendering and awarding were the responsibilities of



- 61 -
EDPITAF. The first equipment package was awarded in December 1984, more
than three years behind the appraisal schedule. The total value of equip-
ment contracts awarded equalled Pesos 226.8 million (about US$13.6
million), distributed as follows:   institutional equipment--Pesos 185.7
million (822); fishing vessels--Pesos 34.7 million (15X) and books and
reference materials -- Pesos 6.4 million (31), more than three times
appraisal estimates (Annex 9). The four furniture packages awarded under
the Project had an aggregate value of Pesos 35.1 million (US$1.8 million)
(Annex 10), of which 522 was charged against the equipment category used to
cover the costs of furniture items acquired through indent.   The total
furniture cost is double the SAR estimate.  Tenders for furniture were
first called and evaluated in 1983 but due to apparent overpricing of the
bids offered, no awards were made and rebidding was scheduled. Finally,
furniture packages were again tendered in 1984-and 1986 and awards were
subsequently made.
3.44     The delay in building construction had serious consequences for
equipment and furniture procurement which were aggravated by other factors.
There were no cash disbursement ceiling releases for equipment in 1982 and
1983 owing to the failure of the PIs to satisfy the documentary
requirements of the OBM. The Project Bids and Awards Committee was also
dissolved and as a consequence bidding and awarding were suspended for
almost a year until a new Committee was appointed. Bid evaluation drew to
a complete halt--eight months for the vehicle package and 16 months for the
fishing vessels. The latter was the result of a disagreement between the
IBRD and the GOP on whether or not to grant a margin of preference to
domestic shipbuilders who participated in the bidding (para. 3.48).
Contract processing was also disrupted sometime in 1985 when a disagreement
arose between the GOP and the IBRD concerning the mode of payment for
equipment.   EDPITAF felt that the interests of the end-users were not
protected by the existing 90-10S mode of payment (i.e., 90% payment upon
shipment of goods and 10% upon delivery and acceptance at the project
sites) and sought to modify the payment mode to 40-50-10S (i.e., 40% upon
shipment of goods, 50% upon acceptance at the port of Manila and 10% upon
delivery and acceptance at the project sites). EDPITAP initiated communi-
cations with the equipment suppliers on this matter without seeking IBRD's
concurrence. Upon being informed by disgruntled suppliers of this proposed
modification of the tender documents under which they had bid, the IBRD
insisted on an 80-20% scheme (80% payment upon shipment of goods and 20%
upon delivery and acceptance at the project sites) which was finally
adopted in all succeeding equipment contracts. The issue took some time to
be resolved causing further delays in the equipment procurement process.
3.45     In the case of the acquisition of books and reference materials,
procurement was not carefully prioritized. Reference materials which are
vital in the implementation of an institution's curricular programs, were
among the last items to be procured. Their earlier acquisition would have
benefited both faculty and students. In some cases, the delivered equip-
ment could not be installed due to unfinished buildings or the lack of
required installation facilities (e.g., three phase power lines, mounting
pads for generating sets, etc.).   There was some mismatch between the
equipment items supplied and the building designs (i.e., walk-in freezers



- 62 -
were too big for the bu'lt structures, no structural provisions were made
for generators and fish canning plants, etc.). There was incompatibility
among equipment items which should operate together as a system (i.e., fish
canning and fish draining equipment), resulting from procurement on a piece
meal basis instead of on a system basis. Contract monitoring was poorly
undertaken so that site deliveries were not closely monitored; equipment
deficiencies were left unrectified for as long as six months from the time
of delivery; equipment items were left uninspected at sites so that some
cases of pilferage/losses occurred, etc. Also, there was some ambiguity in
the contract provisions as to who would supply the required materials for
testing, demonstration and installation of the equipment items. This was
often a source of conflict between suppliers and end-users. The equipment
end-users lacked familiarity with some of the equipment procured.   Some
equipment items requested by the RIFTs were too sophisticated for techni-
cian course purposes owing to a tendency for them to pattern their equip-
ment requests after those of the UPV-CF. Due to delays in construction,
suppliers of some furniture items were unable to assemble and install their
goods even though a large part had been delivered and accepted at the
sites.
3.46     Deliveries of equipment and furniture were very much delayed as a
result of the delayed tendering and awarding of contracts.   The first
equipment delivery to the sites was made in May 1985, 41-63 months behind
the appraisal schedule.   The value of equipment delivered (including
vessels) by the end of project disbursements totalled Pesor 220.7 million
or 97% of the total value of equipment contracts awarded (Annex 9).
Furniture deliveries are estimated at Pesos 29.9 million or 85% of the
total value of furniture contracts awarded.
3.47     Originally 16 fishing boats ranging in size from 10 to 40 tons and
68 smaller boats were proposed to be procured under the Project. During
implementation, a decision was reached, however, to delete some items,
especially the small fishing vessels, due to anticipated cost overruns.
The total number of boats was finally reduced to eight (one 20-meter steel
purse seiner, five 16-meter steel multi-purpose vessels and two skiffs) to
keep within the budgetary allocation. Aparri RIFT was excluded from the
list of RIFTs/RFTCs to receive vessels after it was able to acquire a
fiberglass vessel from the Japanese government.
3.48     The contract awarded for construction of the fishing vessels was
the outcome of an ICB procurement exercise conducted in October 1982 in
which 24 local and international shipbuilders participated. The contract
was awarded only in April 1985, however, after a lapse of 30 months follow-
ing the 1982 bidding. The delay was due to the suspension of evaluation
activities by order of the Minister due to the presence of so-called "fatal
defects" in the bidding. A domestic preference clause (allowable under the
IBRD's Guidelines for Procurement) had been omitted from the bidding docu-
ments which would have provided an advantage in evaluation in favor of
local shipbuilders. The order to nullify the bids triggered an unfavorable
reaction from the IBRD which expressed disagreement with the decision,



- 63 -
giving the reason that a margin of prefereneo could not apply in this case
as it was not specifically stipulated in the bid documents and that
rebidding would be too costly and time-consuming. The conflict was finally
settled when evaluation of the original tenders recommenced in 1984.
3.49     The total cost of construction of the eight fishing vessels
amounted to US$3.4 million which included the original contract amount
(US$2.6 million); the cost of additional equipment, i.e., fishing gear, and
communications and zoning devices, acquired through a supplementary
agreement with the shipbuilder (US$0.3 million); the cost of a four-year
supply of vessel spare parts contracted with another private supplier
(US$0.4 million); the cost of repairs at the sites (US$0.1 million); and a
consultancy contract awarded to Lloyds Register of Shipping (US$30,000)
whose services were engaged to undertake for EDPITAF and the end-users, the
review, evaluation and approval of the vessel designs and plans prior to
actual construction. In dollar terms, the total investment in the vessels
constitutes 25% of the total value of equipment contracts awarded under the
Project.
3.50     Numerous complaints about the fishing vessels have been received
from the end-users.   The UPV-CF's skiff boat  .Al incompatible with the
college's existing research and training vessel, the TRV Sardinella, owing
to the design of the skiff which has two keels instead of one as originally
requested.  The RIFTs' complaints included inappropriate designs for the
vessels which are unsuitable for local waters; poor vessel stability and
maneuverability; the provision of white fishing nets which are unsuitable
for use in Philippine waters, etc.
3.51     According to the RIFTs, the vessels could not be fully utilized
for fishing operations because of these inadequacies. In fact, one insti-
tute has never even operated its vessel for production purposes citing the
problem of instability. Compounding the technical problems and contribut-
ing to the limited utilization of the vessels are the lack of competent
crews for fishing boat operation and inadequate funds for the operation and
maintenance of the vessels.   In all the RIFTs, it is thought that the
vessels may well serve the purposes of providing hands-on training to
marine fishery students in the areas of navigation and seamanship, radar
operations and actual fishing operations. On the other hand, some RIFTs
propose to use the vessels for the research activities that they undertake.
3.52     Efforts were made to put pressure on the fishing vessel supplier
to carry out repairs and maintenance to equipment and components found by
end-users to be unacceptable and to supply, replace or modify, items not
received, not meeting specifications, wrongly installed or badly posi-
tioned.   Nevertheless, complaints raised by some institutions were not
promptly attended to by the supplier especially in the cases of the Samar
and Cebu RIFTs, who mentioned the in-appropriateness of the fishing gear,
unserviceable parts and the like.

3.53     EDPITAP-PMS staff were strengthened through the provision of
degree and non-degree fellowships in the areas of project management, maoni-
toring and evaluation, financial analysis, international procurement and
other relevant field. Some senior staff were able to attend international
symposia, conferences and workshops. A total of 49 fellowships were uti-
lized for an equivalent of 121.2 man-months. The total current allocation
of which 51.5 man-months for 17 fellows are still to be completed beyond
the project closing date, represents an additional 801 and 120S respec-
tively, to the appraisal allocations. A number of EDPITAF staff sent for
training abroad failed to return to fulfill their contractual obligation of
three years of service to the GOP. These staff utilized Pesos 0.4 million
or 1S of the fellowship funds intended for EDPITAF-PMS.
3.54     Experts'  services, both foreign and local, were procured by
EDPITAF to provide assistance to itself and to the PIs.  The UPV-CF was
provided with foreign consultants in the areas of marine fisheries, fish
microbiology and advanced planktology, and the services of an expert on
impact evaluation were hired for the BFAR-RFTCs.  Other areas where foreign
experts were utilized included monitoring and evaluation, aquaculture,
naval architecture and program development.   On the other hand, local
experts provided assistance in naval architecture, management and curri-
culum development and specifications writing.   A total of 28 experts
provided 143 man-months of services for PMS (Annex 1).
Monitorina and Evaluation
3.55     To comply with Section 4.08 of the Loan Agreement, a monitoring
and evaluation plan was developed by EDPITAP in September 1980 to assess
the operation of programs and total activities of project implementation.
Project monitoring provided feedback of information from the institutions
and from EDPITAF relating to policies and to agreements reached between the
different government agencies involved in executing the Project, as well as
information on every pbase of activity during project implementation. The
project monitoring work was undertaken with the cooperation and assistance
of the PETs (para. 3.12) organized at the institution level. Regular pro-
gress reports were submitted by EDPITAF to the IBRD.   Two evaluation
studies were conducted under the Project--a baseline study on Small Scale
Fishermen, Fishfarmers, Fish Processors and Fishing Communities, conducted
in 1981, and an assessment of Fisheries Manpower Supply and Demand in the
Philippines, in 1982.  The highlights of these two studies are found in
Appendix 1.  During the last s' age of project implementation, a Tracer
Study on Graduates was carried out by the respective institutions with
EDPITAP coordinating and directing the activity.   The 15-month study
covered the first batch of graduates and put emphasis on the educational
aspirations, occupational expectations, attitudes towards the RIFT course,
job search experiences, job entry outcomes, job motivations and satisfac-
tion of these graduates (para. 4.14).



- 65 -
Participation of the IBRD
3.56     The IBRD sent several review missions to the country as part of
its monitoring and evaluation of the progress of project implementation.
In most instances, the presence of these missions in the country helped
expedite the carrying out of project activities as current project issues
were -esolved during their visits.
3.57     During the course of project implementation, the IBRD showed some
liberality in acceding to the GOP's suggestions concerning the Project,
viz:   reallocation of te:hnical assistance funds from foreign experts'
services to fellowship degree programs (para. 3.30); the revision of the
loan allocations to allocate additional amounts to the civil works and
equipment categories; the modification of disbursement percentages for
expenditures financed by the IBRD (40S to 702 and later to 952 for civil
works); and the extension of the project closing date three times. There
were occasions, however, when the IBRD adamantly rejected proposals of the
GOP to introduce some changes which the latter thought would best serve the
Project's and the country's interests.  The proposed modification of the
mode of payment for equipment packages is one instance (para. 3.44).
Another issue was whether or not the bidding for the fishing vessels should
be nullified (para. 3.48). The IBRD insisted that there was no legal or
practical basis for nullifying the bids.
Fulfillment of Special Covenants
3.58     Generally, the stipulations and covenants governing the execution
of the Project were adhered to and special conditions and provisions were
complied with. Wherever applicable, concurrence of the IBRD was sought by
the GOP. The status of compliance with the special covenants is found in
Appendix 2.
Prolect Schedule
3.59     Overall, the actual schedule for the execution of the Project did
not conform with the expectations at appraisal. An additional 42 months
was needed to substantially implement the Project up to the closing date.
The closing date was extended three times, the last time to December 31,
1987. The final disbursement was made on August 19, 1988.
IV. PROJECT OUTCOMES
Professional ManDower Trainina
University of the PhililDines in the Visavas-Colleae of Fisheries (UPV-CF)
4.1      Curriculum Development.  As called for under the Project, the old
BSP curriculum was revised to allocate 44X of course instruction to the
major fishery courses, i.e., marine, inland and processing, 342 to fishery
and sciences, and 222 to languages and humanities. Some existing courses



- 66 -
were revised in terms of course description and prerequisites, and new
courses were instituted to replace other existing courses. These modifica-
tions and revisions of the curriculum were made to strengthen the existing
program, to make the curriculum more relevant to the development of the
fisheries industry in the Philippines, and to provide a stronger foundation
in the basic sciences.
4.2      Research.   The UPV-CF coordinated the undertaking of research
under the project (para. 3.22).  Of the 38 research projects that were
undertaken, 15 final research papers have been submitted to the RRC. Two
of the papers have already been published in the UPV-CF Fisheries Journal,
seven are being revised to incorpora_e basic information and appropriate
statistical analyses, and six have been submitted to the editorial board of
the Journal for technical editing and possible publication. Dissemination
of research findings has been made through distribution of the results to
persons, agencies or associations requesting them and through publication
in the Fisheries Journal.
4.3      Technical Assistance and Staff Development.   Upon completion of
the still on-going fellowship program, the UPV-CF will have 50 staff
holding graduate degrees or 75% of its current staff of 67 (Annex 11).
This is a significant upgrading of the staff profile which, at appraisal,
showed only 47% with graduate degrees. Faculty and staff who successfully
completed their training have been asked by the UPV-CF to review the
present curriculum and introduce further improvements as necessary. Acade--
mically, these staff are given a regular workload of twelve units, six of
which are devoted to classroom instruction and six either t  research or
extension work.
4.4      Civil Works.  Like the RIFTs, the buildings at the UPV-CF under-
went changes from the original designs due to the de-sophistication of the
designs and materials in an effort to save on costs and to additional
security and sanitary measures. The UPV-CF is satisfied with the buildings
in terms of their functional and aesthetic qualities and the adequacy of
their designs and space standards. At the time of final disbursement, all
the UPV-CF facilities except for the four unfinished buildings--the student
union, the administration building, the infirmary, and the motor pool--were
occupied and were being utilized for the purposes for which they were
intended.
4.5      The approximate gross area constructed at the UPV-CF is 16% larger
than planned at appraisal as the appraisal estimate of 28,203 square meters
was increased to 32,591 square metura (Annex 12).  The significance of this
increase is a corresponding increase in the cost of maintenance. Almost
all the buildings increased in area with both boarding and staff housing up
by 142 compared to appraisal estimates and academic and communal buildings
up by 172.
4.6      EquiDment and Furniture Procurement.   The UPV-CF had stipulated
that the number and types of equipment and furniture procured under the
Project should satisfy the requirements of the program offerings of the



- 67 -
College. Some of this equipment and furniture is now being utilized by the
College. It was noted, however, that some equipment items are not opera-
tional due to the absence of major accessories, consumables and spare
parts, such as line haulers, canning systems and electrophoresis systems.
4.7      Notwithstanding the non-compliance of some items with the specifi-
cations, the equipment and furniture items delivered were generally accept-
able.  Of the items delivered, about 1S had deficiencies.   On the other
hand some items are yet to be delivered after loan closing, i.e., the
simulator, and the goldfish fat extractor and uther chemistry equipment,
costing about Pesos 0.8 million.

Retional Institute of Fisheries Technology (RIFTs)
4.8      Curriculum Development.  Based on an initial survey conducted by
EDPITAF of RIFT faculty members, the new curriculum appears to have been
received favorably.   The RIFT staffs believe that the new curriculum
provides better training and prepares students more thoroughly for the
world of work due to the curriculum's comprehensive content and the OJT
which exposes students to actual situations and activities in the industry.
4.9      Admission and Enrollment.  By virtue of MECS Order No. 31, Series
of 1983, the three-year diploma course of the RIFT curriculum was first
offered in June 1983. A total of 4,420 applied for admission to the RIFTs
for SYs 1983-84 to 1987-88 of which 3,226 or 73% were admitted (Annex 13).
However, there were not enough students interested in entering the new
fishery program to be able to meet appraisal projections.
4.10     Yearly enrollments at the RIFTs were below the targets set at
appraisal. Each RIFT was expected to enroll 150 students in the first year
with 140 surviving to the second year and about 12C to the last year so
t=hat at full capacity, 410 students would be enrolled both on-campus and in
OJT. Annex 14 shows the enrollment data by institution and by school year.
Overall, total enrollments for the full diploma program starting in SY
1985-86 was 1,360 on average. This is a decrease of 1,490 from appraisal
estimates.
4.11     Moreover, the appraisal estimates of enrollments of 50% in marine
fisheries, 301 in inland fisheries and 201 in fish processing was not
realized as students continued to flock to the inland fisheries course.
One reason was that the vessel needed for marine fisheries was not secured
on time. The presence of the vessel might have motivated more students to
enroll in marine fisheries. Actual enrollment from SYs 1983-84 to 1987-88
show that 301 were in marine, 351 in inland, and 351 in fish processing
(Annex 15). During the three years following the commencement of the new
curriculum there was sn increasing deviation of actual enrollments from
earlier enrollment targets; the highest deviation was recorded in SY 1986-
87 when there was a shortfall of 571 from the estimate.
4.12     Interviews with RIFT headmasters and a number of faculty members
reveal that beginning the new curriculum in SY 1983-84 was ill-timed



- 68 -
because the facilities, equipment, books and instructional materials
required for program implementation were not yet in place.   The general
reaction was that the new curriculum should have been offered only when
these investment inputs were on hand. This non-completion affected program
implementation adversely.
4.13     Drgg-Outs.  The RIFTs experienced their highest student drop-out
rate (291) in SY 1985-86.   On average, the yearly drop-out rate in all
RIFTs from SY 1983-84 to SY 1987-88 was 281, considerably higher than the
102 estimated at appraisal. Among the reasons cited for this drop-out were
economic difficulties, failure to meet academic requirements, health
problems and the poor peace and order situation in some RIFT areas, such as
Zamboanga. Annex 16 indicates the drop-out and graduation rates for all
institutions by school year.
4.14     Graduates.  The RIFTs graduated their first students in SY 1985-
86, a total of 363 or about 48% of the 760 annual output projected at
appraisal. The shortfall was attributed to both the failure to meet the
targeted 150 first-year students at each RIFT and to the high drop-out
rates occurring every school year at all RIFTs. The actual total yearly
output of the RIFTs is about 300 on average, 601 below the appraisal
estimate (Annexes 16 and 17).
4.15     Research and Other Studies.  In collaboration with the UPV-CF the
RIFTs have conducted research into the three fisheries areas (paras. 3.23
to 3.24). The findings and results of this research were submitted to the
UPV-CF RRC for dissemination in the manner described in para. 4.2.  The
tracer study undertaken by the RIFTs and coordinated by EDPITAP revealed
that out of the 363 graduates in SY 1985-86, 41% (148) were gainfully
employed, 441 (160) were unemployed, 8S (30) pursued higher studies and the
rest were unaccounted for (para. 3.55). In some RIFTs, the unemployment of
graduates was attributed to the lack of job openings in the fishery
establishments both private and public, located in the region.
4.16     Technical Assistance and Staff Development.  As a result of the
staff development program, RIFT staff qualifications have improved.   The
program provided the staff with the opportunity to be in touch with the
latest developments in their respective areas of expertise. One immediate
result of the staff training was the enrichment of the course syllabi and
the preparation of teaching modules by the returning fellows. RIFT staff
which totalled 78 at appraisal, grew to 213 over the project implementation
period.   The current teacher-student ratio for all the RIFT's averages
1:10.
4.17     Expert services were utilized by the RIFTs only during the first
two years of project implementation. These services did not provide many
benefits or much impact as the experts' training and orientation did not
fit local conditions and the hiring was untimely, as equipment and facili-
ties were not yet available at the RIFT sites.
4.18     Civil Works.  The RIFTs have varying views as to the adequacy of
the facilities provided in terms of designs and space standards.  They,
however, all appreciate the facilities for their functional and aesthetic



- 69 -
qualities. The RIFTs at Davao, Zamboanga, Bicol and Palawan pointed out
some deficiencies and inadequacies in the facilities, including: excesses
in designs so that much space has been wasted in unnecessary corridors;
cabinet shutters that do not fit; the poor state and even absence of
storage cabinets in some buildings; poor water supply systems; and poor
ventilation. All the buildings and structures erected under the project
are operational and are now being used.
4.19     Approximately 64,886 square meters gross area was constructed at
the seven RIFTS/RFTCs which is about 41 more than the appraisal estimate of
needs (Annex 12). Academic and communal buildings increased in area by 281
over the appraisal estimate while the boarding and staff housing facilities
decreased by 141 and 132, respectively.6/ Modern architectural designs and
larger buildings than the existing buildings as called for in the plans
precluded unification of the project buildings, with existing structures,
on the sites.
4.20     Equipment and Furniture Procurement.  The numbers, types and kinds
of equipment acquired under the project were adequate to implement the RIFT
curricula and attain the program and training objectives. However, some
equipment items cannot be utilized due to the unavailability of spare parts
and accessories. There are no qualified personnel to operate other items.
Defective equipment items as delivered to the RIFTs make up about 12 (Pesos
0.9 million) of the total value awarded for the RIPTs. In addition, items
such as weighing and recording instruments, glassware and plastics and
major chemistry equipment costing about Pesos 4.3 million or 31 of the
total had not yet been delivered to the RIFTs by the closing date.
4.21     The delay in acquisition of the fishing vessels imp4ired the
efficient implementation of the programs as the first two batches of gradu-
ates from the RIFTs and the trainees of the RFTCs were deprived of the
opportunity to gain actual knowledge and experience in sea training and
operation.   Similarly, the delay in the acquisition and installation of
equipment deprived the students and the trainees of the benefits of better
instruction and learning.
Reg ional Fishermen Training Centers (RFTCs)
4.22     Trainint Needs Aseessment.  The training programs adopted at the
RPTC8 were distinct for each site and were based on the identified training
needs peculiar to the site. Training needs assessments were done by the
RPTC staff at each location by looking at the fishing activities of their
clientele and the level of their skills. From these, appropriate training
programs were evolved. The bases for the types, extent and methods of the
training programs resulted from a nationwide survey of fishing communities
and of the socio-economic status of small-scale fishermen, fish farmers and
fish processors (para. 3.55). Training programs were also developed based
on clientele requests.

their calculations (See Attachment I).

4.23     Trainina Prosrams and Operations.  Despite the incentive program
that the RFTCs had set up (i.e., free training, and assistance in access to
the GOP credit program), they failed miserably to attract enough fishermen
trainees. The reasons cited for this failure include clientele apathy or
lack of interest in GOP programs, a lack of time and the perception that
there was very little prospect of utilizing the technology learned after
training.   On the other hand, the RPTCs' programs were constrained by
insufficient budgets, and the mobility of the RFTCs' technicians was
hampered due to the lack of motor vehicles.   Thus they could not reach
fishermen in remote villages which were accessible only by four-wheel drive
vehicles. It should be noted, as reported by the RFTCs, that the fishermen
who did attend the training programs and adopted the technology taught, had
an increase in their fish catches. A monitoring program to look into the
benefits earned from the training programs will be undertaken by the BFAR-
RFTC Central Coordinating Staff.
4.24     Trainint Output.7/ It was estimated at appraisal that 1,200
trainees per year would receive in-service training from each of the seven
RPTCs for an annual total of 8,400. At each RPTC 600 or 50X would receive
training in small-scale marine fishery, 360 or 301 in inland fishery and
240 or 201 in fish processing.   The actual number of fishermen trained
yearly averaged only 3,880, however. This is a shortfall of 541 from the
yearly target made at appraisal despite the fact that there were more
actual training programs conducted than projected at appraisal (Annex 18).
To date, a total of 8,130 fishermen have participated in the training
programs in marine fishery or 361 of the total trainees, 6,652 (301) in
inland fishery and 7,780 (341) in fish processing (Annex 19).
4.25     Extension agents of BFAR also attended in-service training courses
conducted by the RFTCs to improve their technical and administrative
skills. An average of 100 trainees per year participated in these courses,
only 102 of the annual appraisal estimates. Over the first seven years of
RFTC operation, about 700 extension agents attended training sessions, 901
short of the projected number.
4.26     Technical Assistance and Staff Development.   Indications of the
benefits earned by RPTC staff from the fellowship training program include
their construction of a 70-foot multi-purpose fishing boat, installation
of a marine propulsion engine and stern gear therein, and construction of a
skiff boat and a purse seiner. The multi-purpose boat is used in fishing
operations and in the training of RFTC clientele.
4.27     As expected at appraisal, each RPTC was to have a total of five
administrative staff and ten teaching or training staff. All together the
RPTCs were to have employed a total of 105 staff, 35 administrative and 70
training staff. At present there are 119 staff at the RPTCs, 42 of whom
are training staff and 77, administrative staff. Recruitment of training
staff is being neglected in favor of administrative staff.
7/ The Borrower notes some discrepancy regarding the average yearly output
of the RPTCs and percentage shortfall (see Attachment I).

Institutionalization
4.28     In order to sustain the continuity of the Project and to realize
effectively its development targets, EDPITAP and the PIe worked towards the
institutionalization of all PIe included in the Project.   The regulari-
zation of sufficient funding support for the PIe and their staffs was
explored. To effect this, an Executive Order was submitted to the Office
of the President for approval, but as of this writing no positive news had
been heard.   Requests for the conversion of contractual positions to
regular positions for existing staff were also submitted to the OBM and the
Office for Compensation and Position Classification. BPAR also requested
the institutionalization of funding for the RPTCs from the OBM including
the creation of 150 new positions on permanent status. It must be empha-
sized that the sustainability of the PIe hinges upon the GOP's commitment
to provide sufficient and adequate operating funds for these institutions
and to support their continuing development. Support and assistance must be
particularly accorded to Samar and Davao RIPTs which so far still remain
classified as secondary schools despite their having offered the DFT, a
post-secondary program, as early as SY 1983-84.
4.29     To ensure regular monitoring of the DFT program beyond the project
implementation period, a DECS Order was issued in August 1987 ptoviding for
the transfer of field monitoring functions from EDPITAP to DECS Regional
Offices. It also provided that overall monitoring and coordination of the
.FT programs across the seven RIFTs be transferred from EDPITAF to the
DEC's Bureau of Technical and Vocational Education.   This Bureau is now
responsible for providing the linkages and coordination necessary to moni-
tor effectively the overall programs of the seven RIFTs and to integrate
the DFT program into the mainstream of the education system. The monitor-
ing and evaluation of the RFTCs will now be undertaken by the RFTC Project
Coordinating Committee stationed at the BFAR-Fisheries Training Division,
Quezon City.
V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
Proiect Costs8'
5.1      The total project cost estimated at appraisal was Pesos 522.1
million (US$70.6 million equivalent) consisting of Pesos 287.4 million or
US$38.9 million (55%) local costs and Pesos 234.7 million or US$31.7
million (45S) in foreign exchange costs. US$38.0 million was borrowed from
the IBRD to meet 100% of the foreign exchange cost and US$6.0 million
equivalent of local costs.  However, a portion of the loan amounting to
US$7.6 million was cancelled in late 1981 and substituted by an equivalent
amount provided by the Norwegian government in the form of grant as its
participation in the project. Hence, the IBRD loan then amounted to only
S/ The Borrower has noted discrepanacies between the original EDPITAF PCR
and the subsequent version, attributing these differences to dissimilar
points of reference and methods of calculation (see Attachment I.)



- 72 -
US$30.4 million.   The loan vas further reduced to US$29.65 million when
US$0.75 million estimated to be unutilized at the closing date was
cancelled in 1987. The project financed four major types of expenditure;
(a) building construction costs including site development costs and
professional services fees; (b) furnishing and installation of furniture;
(c) procurement of training vessels, vehicles, books, and instructional
equipment; and (d) technical assistance for fellowships, experts' services,
and research.
5.2      In peso terms, the project cost increased by the closing date to
Pesos 964.6 million, 851 above the appraisal estimate. Tao major factors
caused this increase. The rate of exchange of the peso to the US dollar
shifted constantly over the implementation period from a low of Pecos 7.40
at appraisal to a high of Pesos 20.85. Consequently the GOP had difficulty
putting up sufficient local counterpart funds due to the drastic increase
in local currency requirements and fund releases were therefore often
delayed. In addition, the continuous increases in the costs of equipment
and construction materials over the three-year extension of the implementa-
tion period caused the original estimates and contract amounts to be insuf-
ficient, despite the contingencies provided.   A comparative analysis of
appraisal and actual project costs showing the percentage deviation from
the appraisal estimates for each project component is provided in Annex 20.
5.3      In an effort to expedite project implementation and speed up loan
disbursements, the IBRD agreed in August 1984 and again in June 1987 to
proposals by the GOP to reallocate the loan proceeds and to modify dis-
bursement percentages so that the loan's share of the fast-moving com-
ponents like civil works (para. 3.40 (d)) and local fellowships (Table 5.1)
was increased.  Moreover, the IBRD agreed that loan funds could be dis-
bursed by direct payment to contractors and suppliers in all categories.
This agreement helped ease the GOP's burden of having to put up sufficient
local counterpart funds.  Table 5.1 below shows the revised loan alloca-
tions as compared with the loan allocation at appraisal.

5.4      Buildin* Construction and Supervision of Works.  This component
was financed originally on a 40Z-601 sharing ratio by the IBRD and the GOP
which was later modified to 702-301 and even later to 952-51. The actual
disbursement from this category was US$15.6 million, just above the ori-
ginal amount in the category (without contingencies).   The contingency
allowances of 51 for physical and 262 for price increases allocated at
appraisal were utilized to cover the costs for supplementary civil works
agreements and contractors' claims for escalating prices. Included in this
category were expenditures for architectural and construction management
services acccunting for 91 of total civil works costs. Architectural fees
amounted to Pesos 23.8 million while construction management fees totalled
Pesos 19.1 million.
5.5      Furniture Procurement.  The appraisal allocation for this item was
Pesos 17.2 million but the actual furniture costs totalled Pesos 35.1
million or an increase of more than 1001. The actual cost includes costs
paid out of the equipment category for laboratory furniture and fittings
and fiberglass furniture.
576      Equipment Procurement.  A total of about 30 equipment packages
including vessels and books and reference materials were procured. About
671 of the equipment allocation of US$9.4 million, including contingencies,
was expected to be spent on institutional equipment, 5S on books and
reference materials, and 281 for fishing vessels. A comparison with the
actual value of contracts awarded for the same categories shows that insti-
tutional equipment amounted to 821 of the total with a decrease for the
other two equipment categories.
5.7      Technical Assistance.   The technical assistance category of the
loan was decreased by US$1.6 million at the time U$0.75 million was
cancelled from the loan due to delays in its completion. To finance the
still on-going fellowship programs at disbursement closing, a total of
US$250,000 was earmarked for this purpose from Loan 2030-PH (Elementary
Education Sector Program), then on-going.
Loan Disbursements
5.8      Two procedures were employed by EDPITAF to withdraw loan proceeds:
reimbursement and direct payment.   The estimated disbursements schedule
shown in the SAR was not strictly adhered to, however, due to delays in
project implementation in general.  The actual schedule of disbursements
compared with the appraisal estimates is presented in Annex 21.
5.9      Disbursement of loan proceeds extended into August 1988, 38 months
behind the original schedule of June 1985, due to the multifarious problems
that beset project implementation especially during its early and middle
stages. Actual loan disbursements including the Norwegian grant, totalled
US$35.1 million as itemized in Table 5.1 and Annex 22, or 941 of the loan
and grant total of US$37.2 million.  A disbursement shortfall of US$2.1
million or 61 resulted. The unspent portion was subsequently cancelled.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND AkECMMENDATIONS
Project Preparation and Appraisal
6.1      In hindsight, project preparation and appraisal work appear to
have suffered one serious deficiency. The provisions for building facili-
ties seem ambitious.9/   Physical facilities consumed more project funds
tban necessary.   In future projects, care must be given to weighing the
extent of provision of physical facilities against the requirements of the
program.   This provision should be kept at a more reasonable and modest
level. However, the SAR correctly anticipated the major constraints that
were likely to be faced by the Project.
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.2      The decentralization of implementation responsibilities from
EDPITAF to the PIs brought mixed results. On the one hand, it contributed
to delays in project execution, while on the other hand, institutional
capabilities of the PIs were enhanced. It appears that the primary concern
of EDPITAP management was more to address the long-term aspect of ensuring
the effectiveness of the Project through institution building rather than
the immediate conce:rn for project implementation efficiency.
6.3      Nevertheless, at the EDPITAF level, ways and means were devised to
improve internal efficiency, particularly with respect to selection of
project contractors and equipment suppliers. Improved procedures for pre-
qualification were put into operation to ensure that the GOP selects only
those contractors and suppliers who are the most capable and have the best
track records in terms of performance.   Such stringent measures should
remain in force for future projects to protect adequately the GOP's
interest.
6.4      On the other hand, procurement was not carefully prioritized in
the case of books and reference materials and of the vehicle requirements
of the RETCs' training and extension agents. Contract monitoring was lax,
equipment was left uninspected and deficiancies were left unrectified for a
considerable length of time. It is suggested that EDPITAY management look
into the following:   (a) strengthening of systems and procedures in the
areas of contract preparation and contract management; and (b) streng-
thening of overall planning to ensure that the investment inputs are well
prioritized and cynchronized across project components.10/
91 The Borrower notes that the mismatch of facilities with requirements
was also a result of inexperienced consultants (see Attachment II).
10/ The Borrower also advocates greater end user participation in all
sspects of implementation (see Attachment II).

Implementation of Pro1ect Comoonents and outcomes
6.5      Proaram Implementation.  The Project has provided the impetus in
establishing a more coordinated and rationalized system of fishery training
in the Philippines, which is one of the five sub-sectors of the RAES. The
establishment of the MAES is provided for under the Macro-Plan for
Agricultural Education.
6.6      The PIs under the leadership of the UPV-CP have bonded themselves
ine, a fishery education and training network which alms to sustain the
gains earned under the Project and to continue pursuing the program objec-
tives beyond project closing.   This initiative and enthusiasm should be
encouraged and supported by the DECS, in particular, and the GOP, in
general.
6.7      Technical Assistance.   The fellowship program was successful in
upgrading the skills and competencies of the staffs of the PIs.   The
program has enabled the staff to keep up with the latest developments in
their respective areas or fields of expertise.   These staff must be
provided with the necessary incentives to keep them in their present posts
and must be given the support necessary to help them become leaders in
propelling their respective institutions to be centers of quality fishery
education and training.
6.8      Civil Works.   Generally, the buildings and structures provided
under the project were rated good by the end-users vith respect to func-
tional and aesthetic qualities, designs sad space standards and adequacy.
Sufficient funds must be provided for the up-keep and maintenance of these
facilities so as to maximize their use and to prevent early deterioration
and destruction.
6.9      Equitment Procurement.  Items acquired under the project in terms
of number, type and kind were judged adequate to implement the curricular
programs and attain the program and training objectives. Support must be
provided to train and maintain staff to operate these equipment items. In
addition, adequate financial support for operation and maintenance of the
items must be guaranteed in order that maximum benefits be derived from
their use.
6.10     As with the provision of building facilities, in future, care must
be taken with the provision of equipment so that acquisition of sophisti-
cated items beyond those reasonably required by the program components is
avoided.   The RIFTs, which offer the DFT program, in most instances,
patterned their equipment requests after those of the UPV-CP which offers
degree and post-graduate fishery programs.11I
11/ The Sorrower suggests reviewIng equipment utilization of P.I.s (see
Attachment II.)



- 77 -
Proiect Financint
6.11     Obviously, the financial position of the Project was crucially
linked to implementation performance. In retrospect, it may be noted that
had the GOP been able to release sufficient funds following the appraisal
schedule, implementation and performance would have been facilitated.
Perhaps there would have been no need to increase the GOP's contribution to
the Project.
6.12     One lesson that may be drawn from the Project is the need for
closer interaction between a project's executing agency and the GOP's
fiscal agency during project preparation.  Closer coordination could help
identify more clearly the needs of the executing agency and the expected
critical support from the fiscal agency. Further, this coordination would
help the executing agency understand budgetary procedures before it pre-
pares implementation schedules.
Performance of Consultants. Contractors and Sugnliers
6.13     In general, the technical consultants hired under the project were
able to carry out their duties satisfactorily. However, the naval archi-
tects and shipbuilding consultants performed below par as borne out by the
dissatisfaction of the Pls with the design and construction of the fishing
vessels.
6.14     Three of the building contractors experienced difficulties.  Two
civil works contractors failed to comply with the terms of their contracts,
resulting in cancellation of the contracts.   The performance of still
another was slow. The latter resulted in court proceedings which are still
in progress.
6.15     The performance of suppliers of equipment and furniture was
varied.   Some religiously complied with their contract obligations while
others did poorly by supplying defective and deficient items not conforming
to specifications and by refusing to rectify noted deficiencies. In such
instances, it is recommended that EDPITAP exercise its legal option to
withhold the suppliers' bonds andlor blacklist said suppliers.   EDPITAF
should also notify other GOP agencies of the same as a warning to the
agencies not to engage the services of the delinquent suppliers.
Outstandina Policy Issues
6.16     The Project illustrates how decentralization can be effected if
only to a limited extent.   Needless to say, decentralization had its
positive and negative aspects. In the future, decentralization should be
approached more realistically. The proponents should set up, at the appro-
priate time, the mechanisms by which it could sufficiently be implemented;
they should consider the preparedness and absorptive capacity of the insti-
tutions who will assume new roles and functions.



- 78 -
6.17     Measures should be taken to attract a sufficient number of stu-
dents into Pla offering the new curricula both at the professional and
technician levels, and trainees into the non-formal fishery programs.
6.18     Institutionalization of the RIFTs and the RFTCs which would
guarantee the provision of sufficient funding support for their up-keep,
maintenance and operation must be pursued.   The regularization of the
positions of an adequate number of staff and personnel must be effected in
order to sustain the continuity of program implementation initiated under
the Project. Support and assistance must be particularly accorded to the
Samar and Davao RIFTs which, up to this late stage, remain classified as
secondary schools.  As early as SY 1983-84, these two institutions were
offering the post-secondary program. Because their re-classification has
not been acted upon, these two institutions continue to be plagued by the
imbalance between the financial and manpower support provided and that
which is required to enable them to reasonably meet their new program
concerns and responsibilities.   It is strongly recommended that the GOP
lose no time in re-classifying these institutions in order to pave the way
for the upgrading of their staff positions and to funding support at a
level fitting a post-secondary institution.
6.19     However, institutionalization should also be viewed in a broader
and wider context in terms of how effective the UPV/RIFT/RFTC networking is
operationalized and maintained to produce the desired benefits.  Institu-
tionalization should detail the flow of responsibilities and accountabili-
ties between and among the agencies or institutions involved.
6.20     The high drop-out rates of fishery students and the seemingly low
attractiveness of the fishery training programs b-  demand considerable
attention. The underlying factors need to be looked into.12/ The institu-
tions should also strengthen their student recruitment and placement
programs.
6.21     The situation with respect to the demand for fishery graduates on
a regional basis should also be investigated. The RIFTs are expected to
assume a lead role in such studies in their respective regions.  The infor-
mation that may be generated would help the regional institutions in colla-
boration with the education policy makers to formulate and adopt appro-
priate policies and programs.
6.22     On a broader scale, DECS plans to undertake a review of the
fishery education and training sub-sector which would generate data and
information about the state of the art of fishery education and training
with a particular focus on the fishery labor and market situations. It is
intended to generate data that will provide education planners some funda-
mental bases for making decisions as to whether or not the macro-plan,
particularly concerning the fishery sub-sector, should be pursued in its
entirely or be amended/modified.
12/ The Borrover notes that low enrollment ratios raise policy issues
regarding the relevance and direction of fisheries education in its
relationship to the industry (see Attachment I}).

OBSERVATIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED BY ThE BANK
1.       All in all, the Bank is fairly satisfied with the way the project
was implemented.   In spite of EDPITAF's having had a large, extremely
competent staff and the presence of additional competent staff at the PIs,
progress was excruciatingly slow during most of the implementation period
due to delayed or no budget releases and to a variety of procurement
problems. Funds and therefore implementation picked up in 1986, however,
due to the new Government's determination to complete unfinished projects.
Equipment and furniture procurement was a problem throughout implementation
with long delays (some over two years) between bidding and awarding of
contracts (especially for fishing vessels and simulators but for other
items as well). The designs for the vessels were disappointing as so many
problems with them have surfaced subsequently.  Project educational out-
comes have also been disappointing as neither the RIFTs nor the RFTCs were
ever fully enrolled or offered all the planned programs. Also the RFTCs
have so far not been able to supply their share of the operating budgets at
the institutions nor have the RIFTs been institutionalized. The latter is
becoming a serious problem at two RIFTs as they are still classified as
secondary schools even though both are attempting to offer the post-
secondary programs with secondary school financing. Budgets are also not
available for operation of the fishing vessels as required by the Loan
covenant. Two bright spots, however, are the facts that the BSF programs
,were phased out at the RIFTs, except at Zamboanga, now a state college, and
that EDPITAP appears dedicated to damping down the paper chase for degrees
and diplomas simply to hang on the wall.  It is also gratifying to note
that a thorough review of the fishery education and training sub-sector is
now to be undertaken in an effort to rationalize the system and prevent
duplication of educational efforts.
2.       The Bank would like to endorse the recommendation in the GOP PCR
that the implementing agencies and the fiscal agencies work together in
formulating projects so that each has realistic expectations of what to
expect from the other.   Also, in view of the massive equipment and
furniture procurement problems experienced under this project (underplayed
in the GOP PCR but a serious problem throughout for Bank staff, not to
mention suppliers), it is recommended that for any future projects in the
Philippines in education/training, a realistic amount of Bank staff weeks
be allocated for supervision, especially with regard to procurement. This
would likely be higher than the recommended coefficients for supervision.
If the Bank were to catch mistakes, like the omission of the local pre-
ference clause in the fishing vessel bid documents (which the Bank failed
to notice when it gave its no objection to the documents), it would ease
matters for everyone. The Bank would also like to urge the DEC's Bureau of
Technical and Vocational Education, now responsible for monitoring the RIFT
programs, and the BFAR to continue to press for institutionalization of the
RIFTs and RFTCs, respectively.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PNILtPPINES - FISNRY TRAINING PROECT (LN. 18M-PR)
Highlights of the Baseline Study of Fishing Communities,
Municipal Fishermen, Small-Scale Fish Farmers and Fish Processors
Summary of Findings
Fishing communitiess
1.    Inadequate service facilities (i.e., fishing suppliers, stores,
repair shops) to meet the needs of people residing in fishing
communities.
2.    Inadequate ice supply at this level.  Only 102 of sample
communities reported to have access to nearby ice plant or dealer.
3.    About 481 of surveyed communities are not yet reached by
electrical services.
Municipal fishermen:
1.    Lowest income bracket nationwide (from Pesos 1,000 - 5,000
annually).
2.    Majority have not completed elementary school.
3.    Majority are willing to undergo training.
4.    Few have membership in fisheries organizations which is attributed
to their lack of interest and unwillingness to participate in
group activities, unless such membership directly benefits the
individual or his immediate family.
c.    Very few have used credit to finance; their fishing units.
6.    Development of technology in municipal fisheries occurs at a
slower rate than in other fisheries sectors.
7.    Ratio between cost of and return on, production is a function of
how fishermen dispose of their catch--either directly to final
consumer, through middlemen, or to a processor through an
association.
8.    Majority of fishermen do not use extension services from BFAR,
SEAFDEC, PFMA, BAEX or other agencies involved in fisheries
development. However, due to presence of BFAR regional and
district offices, 24.7Z of respondents have used BFAR extension
services compared to SEAFDEC--0.2Z, PFMA--0.2Z, BAEX--2.8Z and
other agencies--3.2Z.
Small-Scale Fish Farmers:
1.    Majority have an annual income of Pesos 5,001 - 10,000.
2.    2.9Z had no education at all, 6.7Z--elementary school, 39.1?--
intermediate, 24.62--high school, 25.62--college and 1Z--
vocational training.
3.    20.4Z had less than 5 years experience, 27.12 had 5 - 10 years,
10.1Z had 11 - 15 years, 15.72 had 16 - 20 years and 26.72 had 21
years and above.
4.    Out of 585, 57.4? are full-time, 38.8? part-time and 38? are
occasional.



- 108 -
5.    Out of 585, 26.52 are willing to shift to other occupations.
However, between fish farming, sales, clerical, services, etc.,
fish farming is most favored. 73.5Z of fish farmers are not
inclined to shift to other occupations.
6.    702 are not members of any organization.
7.    Majority of those who had vocational and college education would
try improved technology immediately. Those with no schooling or
only up to grade 3, would first consult a technician.
8.    On information/technique utilization, 51.92 responded that the
information/techniques are not applicable, 12.72 do not utilize
the information/techniques, 16.62 find them very useful, 12.3Z
useful and 5.82 slightly useful.
9.    Of the 21 fields of training available given in the checklist,
bangus culture was most preferred.
Fish processors:
1.    Very few (6.82) of the respondents earn Pesos 25,000 or more,
mostly belonging to Region IV. 13.42 earn Pesos 15,001 - 20,000,
5.9X--20,001 - 25,000 and 16.8Z--1,001 - 5,000.
2.    Of the 555 fish processors covered in the survey, 274 or 49.42
have completed grades 4 to 6, 142 or 25.6Z have high school
education, while 68 or 12.32 have been to college. Only 13 or
2.3Z do not have any education and 4 or 0.7Z have had vocational
training.
3.    39.42 have 5 - 10 years experience, 26.62 less than 5 years, 122--
21 years or more, 1l.9S--ll to 15 years and 9Y--16 - 20 years.
4.    752 are full-time fish processors, 242 - part-time.  Their other
activities are in sales, farming. transportation, craft
production, etc.
5.    80.92 are not members of any organization.
6.    Only 62 or 112 took advantage of credit.  Of these, 22 are engaged
in fish drying, 15 in one processing activity and 14 in bagoong
making. Credit used ranged from less than Pesos 1,000 to more
than Pesos 10,000.
7.    The level of fish procesuing technology is either low or high
depending on the extent of adoption of an improved technology.
The traditional methods like salting, drying, fermentation and
smoking have a low technology while canning and freezing use
higher technologies. However, a traditional fish processor can
use high technology in drying and smoking fish while a fish canner
may be using an inappropriate technology.
8.    Some fish processors would try immediately a new technology,
others would let others try it first while the rest would seek
recommendations from technicians.
9.    In the seven identified fish processing activities, the total
labor force is 2,010. Of these, 1,306 are non-family members
hired on a regular or casual basis.
10.   Fish processors need either technical ass!stance, training
programs or information.

Fisheries Manpower Supply and Demand Study
(Conducted in 1982 by Bicol University with
Financial Assistance from EDPITAF)
Swumary of Findings anu Recommendations
The supplier situation (educational institutions)s
School characteristicst
1.    The education services offered by the tertiary fisheries
institutions included three functionss instruction; research; and
extension services. While all the institutions offered
instruction, the MECS schools did not do as much research or offer
as many extension services as the chartered institutions.
2.    The majority of the institutions offered a 3-year diploma course
and two 4-year degree courses--a Bachelor of Science in Fisheries
and a Bachelor of Science in Fisheries Education. The
specialization offered most was inland fisheries while the least
offered was marine fisheries.
3.    Guidance, placement and follow-up services for students were
provided by the majority of the institutions.
4.    Facilities for all three areas of specialization, i.e., marine,
inland and fish processing were inadequate.
Faculty characteristics:
1.    The specializations of the faculty matched the major fields of
study offered by the institutions.
2.    A majority of faculty members had baccalaureate degrees and had
been teaching for 9.3 years. Faculty turnover has averaged 16.52
annually over the last five years.
3.    Although the facultysstudent ratio was only 1:7, the majority of
faculty members carried a normal teaching load as they taught in
both the tertiary and secondary departments of their institutions.
4.    The staff development programs enabled a number of faculty members
to raise their educational qualifications. The size of the
program was, however, inadequate.
5.    Faculty concern for students was high, as assessed by the
graduates themselves.
Financing:
1.    Inequitable distribution of GOP financial resources worked to the
disadvantage of some schools and prevented them from fully
realizing their objectives. Income from other sources helped
somewhat, however.
2.    Per capita expenditure on tertiary fisheries education by GOP was
about Pesos 5,000 per year. For MECS schools it was about Pesos
6,100 per year and for chartered institutions about Pesos 6,500
per year.



- 110 -
Enrollment and projections:
1.    Except for BSF students in MECS schools, a general downward trend
in enrollment was noted from 1978 to 1980, apparently because the
male population dramatically decreased.
2.    Despite decreasing enrollments, projections for the future were
high and increasing. This was because there was no integrated
development planning among the sisheries institutions. Each
school planned its enrollment targets independently of the other
institutions.
The supply situation:
1.    The majority of BSF graduates sampled were female, single, of low
socio-economic status, had attended a secondary fisheries school,
had fisheries as first choice for a career, had had OJT, graduated
in 1979, found a job less than six months after graduation in a
permanent position, worked for an average of 23 months in a
fisheries-related job with an average monthly salary of Pesos 738,
felt that their educational preparation was adequate for their
present employment, were satisfied with their work and had plans
for pursuing higher education in the next five years.
2.    The majority of diploma graduates sampled were male, married, of
low socio-economic status, had attended a secondary fisheries
school, had fisheries as first choice for a career, had had OJT,
graduated in 1978, found a job less than six months after
graduation in a permanent position through writing an application
letter, worked for an average of 29 months in a fisheries-related
job with an average monthly salary of Pesos 562 and had plans for
furthering their studies.
3.    The peak in the t-nout of graduates occurred in 1978 and 1979.
4.    452 of the diploma graduates majored in fish preservation while
37X of the BSF graduates majored in inland fisheries.
5.    As a whole, BSF graduates spent more than the diploma graduates
during their last year in school. The former spent an average of
Pesos 370 for tuition and school fees while the latter averages
Pesos 210. For the other expenses, the BSF graduates spent Pesos
2,480 while the diploma graduates spent Pesos 1,520
6.    Of the graduates, 58S were employed, 52 were self-employed and 382
were unemployed. Of those employed, 20? were in Region VI and 182
in Region IV. Of those who were self-employed, 28? were in Region
I. While Region VI had the highest rate of employment, it also
had the highest rate of unemployment.
7.    Apparently, BSF graduates had relatively greater employment
opportunities than diploma graduates.
8.    The unemployed graduates gave the following reasons for their
dilemmas:
a.    they were not interested in employment because they were
still studying;
b.    they had no capital;
c.    they had no sponsors;
d.    employers were selective; and
e.    there was not much demand for their specializations.



- ill -
The supply sample was among three groupss the employed, the self-
employed and the unemployed. A question can be asked about the
real factors behind the 382 unemployment. Were the graduates
oriented toward the world of work? Were values and attitudes
developed to turn them into productive workers? Can the monthly
earnings of the fisheries graduates be raised? Why were 342 of
them not satisfied with their jobs? Why were the majority of them
not productive in their chosen fields? These are questions to
consider in planning the future of fisheries education.
The demand situation (the employer sector):
1.    Fishing enterprises had 171 positions which were unfilled in 1981.
They project hiring about 8,400 over the next five years--89% in
operations, 9.6Z in administrative/supervisory positions, 0.42 for
research and 12 for instruction/extension.
2.    The educational institutions project that they will need a total
of about 2,450 new staff--42Z for operations, 372 for instruction,
112 for research, 92 for administration and 12 for consultancies.
3.    GOP agencies project a need for about 1,450 new staff to support
its expanded Fisheries Development Program. Of this number, 62
would be administrative, 1? consultancies, 11.22 for research,
6.42 for instruction/extension and 75.42 for operations.
4.    Research and development activities in the next five years would
be handled by the existing force in the research agencies plus
about 210 additional personnel. Of this number, 52 would be
administrative/supervisory, 722 in research and 232 for
operations.
5.    Banking institutions would need about 360 new personnel, 42 for
research and 962 for operations.
6.    Overall, of the approximately 12,900 new personnel to be hired,
the majority would be for operations with 122 for consultancies,
92 each for instruction and administration and 52 for research.
7.    Private sector fishing enterprises would employ about 652 of the
additional personnel. Fishery educational institutions would
absorb 192 of the projected labor force while 112 would be taken
in by GOP agencies.
Recomvendations:
The following recommendations are based on the above conclusions:
1.    There should be a moratorium on the opening of new fishery
institutions over the next five years at least, to prevent an
oversupply of graduates. Instead of establishing new schools,
existing schools should be upgraded.
2.    The focus of training should be redirected from inland fisheries
to marine fisheries, fisheries technology and economics.
3.    The faculty of the fisheries institutions should be upgraded in
competencies needed for instruction, research and extension work.
Since a master's degree with a major in fisheries is required to
become a college instructor, the fisheries institutions should
plan and implement a massive, innovative and vigorous faculty
development program.



- 112 -
4.    Instruction in entrepreneurship needs intensification and a
package of incentives is necessary. The looking-for-a-jobs
syndrome of graduates can be diminished if they are equipped with
knowledge and skills in business management.
5.    Training facilities need to be improved so that instruction,
research and extension services can be accomplished efficiently
and effectively. Fishinp vessels and gear need to be purchased.
Adequate fish processing facilities, laboratory and library
facilities, classrooms, lecturelseminar/demonstration rooms need
to be provided to make curricular experiences for the students
more meaningful and challenging.
6.    Placement services in the educational institutions need to be
stepped up. This should be done in coordination with the
national/regional offices of the Ministry of Labor and Employment.
Linkages with public and private agencies will also facilitate the
flow of information regarding employment opportunities for
fisheries graduates both at home and abroad. Effective monitoring
of job opportunities is an important service for the graduates.
7.    Prototype projects for fisheries development should be implemented
vigorously. If this is done, unemployed fishery graduates can be
absorbed into employment.
8.    Further research is recommended to identify accurately the macro-
and micro-factors that govern the law of supply and demand in the
field of fisheries manpower. Other recommended research would be
an in-depth study of the managerial capabilities and training
needs of top and middle-level fishery school administrators.

Dear Mr. Donaldson:
This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 11, 1989 requesting
our comments on the Project Completion Report (PCR) for Loan t786-PH. Following Q
are our reactions:
1. We note that the Bank adopted almost entirely the GOP PCR except for a mrter
of statements introduced by the Bank in some portions (i.e., paras. 3.44,
3.48, 4.23, 5.7) and an added one page uObservations and Lessons Learned by
the Bank".
2. While there are some discrepancies as to some dates, figures and financial
data between the GOP version and the Bank's re-written portions, such
discrepancies constitute no intolerable differences and will not affect
consequent analyses and conclusions.   The dissimilarities in the Project
Costs and Financing appears to be due to differences in point of reference
: the GOP PCR analyzes Project Costs using the IBRD-GOP Sharing Scheme while
Bank's version analyzes Project Costs in the light of the FOREX-LOCAL Costs
Financing Scheme. The attachment hereof shows the more notable discrepancies
that we noted.
3. However, it is our wish that the Bank's data and-that of the EMPITAF's with respect
to Actual Loan Amount, Amount Disbursed and Cancelled both from Loarr and
Grant be reconciled.
4.  Regarding the observations/lessons learned by the Bank, we find the statement
"... appears dedicated to damping down the paper chase for degrees and
diplomas simply to hang on the wall" (p. 44 para. 1) too abrupt although
it is intended to inject a positive note.   Perhaps the Bank can put some
context into it - is the paper chase phenomenon limited to EDPITAF, to DECS
as a whole, or is it commonly encountered in other countries as well?
5. We trust that the GOP authorship of the Fishery Training Project's PCR will
be recognized and acknowledged in World Bank documents and publications.
Thank you for eliciting our views.

Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Subject:  PHILIPPINES - Fishery Training Project
(Loan 1986-PH) - Draft Project Completion
Report
This   refers  to  your  letter  dated  11  July   1989
requesting for comments of the NEDA Secretariat on the
above-cited subject.
In general, the PCR is comprehensive in terms of
highlighting the implementation problems and issues related
to the project. The major factors causing the delays and
the   corresponding  recommendations  for   future   similar
projects  are  well  noted.   There  are,  however,  certain
relevant issues which the PCR should have also addressed.
These are presented in the attachment.
We hope you will find our comments useful in drawing
lessons learned from the experience of the project.
Very truly yours,
RIAN. AL 
Acting Director-General



-118-e
Fi-hery Training Project (IBRO Loan 1786-PH)
Comments on the Draft Project Completion Report
1.   The   PCR  noted  a  serious  deficiency   in   project
preparation and appraisal work as regards the provision
of building facilities. This is reported to be brought
about by the non-compliance of building standards
required by the project. Given this, the PCR should
have assessed the mechanism and decision-making process
involved in the identification and designing of the
physical  facilities  financed  by  the  project.   The
apparent mismatch of facilities with the requirements
of the project may be traced, among others, to the
inappropriate choice of consultants whose appreciation
of"the educational and training needs of the fisheries
industry is far less comprehensive. In addition, the
extent of consultation with the target end-users i.e.,
UPV, should have been closely examined.
2.. There is also a need to review, among others, the
extent of utilization of v~arious equipment purchased,
the timing of delivery to coincide with the deployment
of trained users, and the appropriateness to local
academic, trainings and research conditions.
3.   The  PCR  raised some issues on  the  preparedness  and
absorptive capacities of the implementing institutions.
To a large extent, this may be due to the lack of
perspective on the respective long-term roles of these
institutions insofar as the relation of fisheries
education and training to the overall development of
the sector is concerned. As such , the choice of
equipment, facilities and fellowships may have been
guided more by personal biases instead of the relevance
of  the  institution's  envisaged roles.   It  *is  also
possible that the issue raised could be attributed to
deficiencies in planning and scheduling of the various
components   which  resulted  in  the  mismatching   of
resources with the program requirement. Ideally, the
type and nature of equipment and facilities should have
been identified by the end-users who, in turn, should
have already acquired the requisite knowledge and
* skills relevant to the overall thrusts of the project.
Such deficiencies may explain the presence of many idle
equipment   and  facilities  whose  users   are   still
completing their studies abroad.
4.   The   PCR,   likewise,   noted   the   seemingly    low
attractiveness of the fishery training programs as
indicated by the low rate of enrollment. It suggests
the need to investigate the underlying factors causing
this  condition.   The  demand  for  fishery  graduates
should have been projecteo prior tc the inception of
the project. Admittedly, the private fisheries sector



- 119 
(ft8e 3[3)
absorbs a very limited number of fishery graduates
which reflects the quality of the academic and training
programs.    A  majority  of  fishery  graduates   find
employment  in  the  government  agencies  as  well  as
academic  and  research institutions.   This  situation
raises some policy issues regarding the relevance and
direction of fisheries education to the overall growth
of the industry.
5.   One  important  lesson  that  can  be  drawn  from  the
experience of this project is the need to phase the
massive procurement of equipment and furniture into
more manageable levels. Furthermore, this component
shbuld   have   been  closely  coordinated   with   the
implementation   of  other   components,   particularly
training and fellowships, to ensure compatibility with
the   envisaged   academic,  training,   and   research
activities.   Likewise, more serious efforts should  be
exerted during the project inception and preparation
stages in identifying and establishing the actual needs
based on clearly defined policies.

1786-PH)-Draft   Project   Performance    Audit
Report
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Re your letter of 28  March  1990  the  following  are  my
comments on the subject Report.
(1)    p.10,  para  31. Procurement.    There  were  a
number   of   equipment   workshops  organized
by EDPITAF during which the CF sent its
faculty members who, armed with catalogues,
deligently    provided    detail   specifications
of the  equipment needed.    However,  because
of   Philippine   Government   regulations   the
specifications   were  simplified   so   as   not
to gear the procurement to a specific equipment
brand. However, the simplification of specification
lead  to  confusion.    A  worst  example  was
when Boy Scout field compass was to be
procured instead of a magnetic compass for
navigation.    We  will admit that we  favored
Japanese brands because of reliability, familiarity,
availability   of  spare   parts  and   service
offices  in  Manila.    The  naval architect had
minimal experience  with  fishing  vessel design
and the fishing consultant (for the net design)
was not familiar with local fishing conditions.

(2)  p.11.  para  33.    Civil  Works  and  Equipment
of  University  of  the  Philippines,  College  of
Fisheries.
Civil works and equipment procurement follow
Philippine   Government   procedures  which   is
full  of  red  tapes.    What  would  have  been
a better procedure was to make civil works
and equipment components as commodity loan
wherein the bank receives the approved civil
works plan and equipment listing, cost them,
implemerst civil works and procure the equipment
and  then  turn  over  the  finished   buildings
and  other  infrt tructures  and  the  equipment
required.    This  is  what  is  done  with
bilateral  grand-aid  projects  except  that  the
recipient  government  does  not  pay  but  gets
the commodity for free.   The donor government
in paper gives the money to the receiving
overnment and what actually happens is that
the donor government implements the project
with the use of a consulting firm and charge
the  cost  to  the  project  money.    When  the
project  is  completed,  say  a  construction  of
a building, the building is turned over to
the  receiving   government.      Project  savings
are restructured and inputted into the project.

With the transfer of the College to Miagao,the
College was reorganized to form four institutes,
namely,  Institute  of  Aquaculture (formerly  the
Department of Inland Fisheries; the Brackishwater
Aquaculture Center is now under this institute),
Institute  of  Marine  Fisheries  and  Oceanology
(formerly the Department of Marine Fisheries.
the  College  training   vessel,  TRV  SARDINELLA
is  under  this  institute),  Institute  of  Fish
Processing and Technology (formerly the Department
of Fish Processing Technology), and the Institute
of Fisheries Policy and Development (a newly
created institute).  The researches of the Institute
of Fisheries Research and Development (IFDR)
were transferred to the above different institutes
depending on their areas of sl*cialization.
The  IFDR  now  therefore  does  not exist.    All
the  new  institutes  perform  teaching,  research
and extension functions.

and  civil  works  were  treated  as  commodity
loans  (as  stated  previously).    The  EDPITAF,
created  to  implement  loan   projects  under the
then Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports
is aul organization which is "ad hoc" in nature.
Being  so,  changes  in  personnel  during  the
term of the project was so often that we keep
on  talking  to  different  people  resulting  to
lack  of  continuity.    The  EDPITAF  now  has
a  new  role;   it is  seeking  new  projects for
the Ministry or Department so as to justify
its existence otherwise it should have been
disbanded  after  the  project completion .    With
its past performance, I do not know why the
government allows it to continue to exist.
Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  comment on  the  said
Report.   I hope I have contributed  something of value
to  improve  future  activities  of  the  World  Bank.    I
look forward to receiving a copy of the final form
of the report.
Sincerely yours.

Thank you.
