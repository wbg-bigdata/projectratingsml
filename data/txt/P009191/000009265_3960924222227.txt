PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: MONTENEGRO EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION (RAILWAYS) PROJECT
(LOAN 1769-YU)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) describes implementation of
the Montenegro Earthquake Rehabilitation (Railways) Project. As an
emergency, a Bank loan (Loan 1769-YU) of US$14.0 million was approved in
November 1979 based on a President's Report to provide assistance in
restoring railway facilities damaged by the earthquakes which occurred in
April and May 1979. The loan was closed in June 1984 after a cancellation
of US$38,573, one year after the original closing date.
The report was prepared by the Transportation Division of the
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region from the information contained
in a Project Completion Report prepared by Railway Transport Organization
(RTO) Titograd and the Design Institute of the Community of Yugoslav
Railways Belgrade and data in project files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their reply is
shown as an annex.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: MONTENEGRO EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION (RAILWAYS) PROJECT
(LOAN 1769-YU.
HIGHLIGHTS
The primary objective of the Montenegro Earthquake Rehabilitation
(Railways) Project was to provide assistance to RTO Titograd for
rehabilitation of railways damaged by a series of earthquakes which
occurred in April and May 1979 along the Adriatic Coastline of the Republic
of Montenegro. During this period, intensive earth tremors covered also
the southern part of the Republic of Croatia as well as the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina (PCR, para. 2.01).
Heavy damage occurred on the snuthern part of the Belgrade-Bar
Line, one of the main lines in Yugoslavia connecting Republics of Serbia
and Montenegro. There were also damages on the northern part of the line
between Titograd and Trebesica, but of smaller scale. The whole
Niksic-Titograd line was in the earthquake zone where the line structures
were also damaged (PCR, paras. 2.02 and 2.08).
The Bank loan (Loan 1769-YU) of US$14.0 million was approved in
November 1979 to rehabilitate and restore about 90 km of railway lines
damaged in the earthquakes and to expand railway yards at Bar and Titograd
(PCR, para. 2.07).
A Federal law providing for local funds from all Republics and
Provinces was enacted (SFRY Official Gazette No. 36 of July 27, 1979) in
order to provide direct financial assistance for rehabilitation. This
interim contribution amounted to US$37.6 million for the rehabilitation
project (PCR, para. 3.16).
The project was problem-free despite some delays in project
completion and disbursements. Supervision requited a relatively low effort
and was always undertaken with other ongoing pr'jects (PCR, paras. 3.07,
3.08 and 3.17).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: MONTENEGRO EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION (RAILWAYS) PROJECT
(LOAN 1769-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Railways form an essential part of Yugoslavia's transport system
with the main trunk line running from Italy and Austria in the northwest to
Greece and Bulgaria in the southeast and main lines lanking the trunk line
to the Adriatic coast. Although road transport now carries a bigger volume
of freight, the railways play a vital role in the economy as the principal
carrier of bulk materials over long and medium distances. By the early
1960s the railways had experienced an extended period, of only minimum
investment going back to before the Second World War. At that time, 2000
of the system's 2,300 locomotives were steam driven and 70% were over 35
years old, and two-thirds of the rolling stock was over-age. Stations,
marshalling yards and signalling systems were in urgent need of
modernization.
1.02     In 1963, a First Railway Project from the Bank financed the
conversion of the Sarajevo-Ploce iine to standard gauge with electric
traction and signalling. In 1964, a Bank loan was concluded for the Second
Railway Project to support the railways' 1964-70 Modernization Program.
This was a comprehensive program designed to modernize operations and
equipment, in particular the modernization of some 1500 km of main lines
with track renewal, signalling and electrification, the acquisition of
motive power and other equipment as well as the construction of extension
of six major marshalling yards. The project turned out to be over
ambitious, and was beset by major problems. The railways' financial
performance deteriorated. Investment cost escalated due to inflation
- whose effects were compounded by delays of execution - and design
changes. As a result, the Bank loan was fully disbursed well before the
Modernization Program was completed. The Third Railway Project, for which
a loan was made in 1968, was for the construction of the Belgrade-Bar line,
a development project of great technical complexity involving the
construction of over 300 tunnels and several major bridges. Although the
project was completed successfully, there was a four-year delay because of
technical difficulties, and soon after the line was opened, traffic on the
railway and through the port of Bar was disrupted by the 1979 earthquake in
Montenegro.
1.03     Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the
railways with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for
the Fourth Railway Project, agreed in 1974, under which the Bank's loan was
allocated to the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and to
"Related Investments" needed to maximize its benefits, all to be completed
by the end of 1976. In contrast to earlier projects which consisted only
of investments to which the Bank loan had been allocated, the fourth



- 2 -
project was defined as the totality of the railways' investments in
1974-76, whose cost was estimated at US$1,138 million; the Bank loan thus
amounted to about 12% of project cost and comprised one of the first
Bank-financed sector projects. Agreement was reached on measures to
resolve the railways' financial problems, principally by tariff increases.
An important feature of the project was the preparation of comprehensive
Action Plans which, given Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed
to contribute to a common understanding of objectives and responsibility by
all concerned. Although only about two-thirds of project investments were
executed by the end of 1976, these were reasonably balanced to maximize
system effects; the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment
Plan. Execution of Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially
better (about 752), and the electrification of the main line traversing
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to Skopje, near the Greek
border was completed.
1.04     Yugoslav railways envisaged the Fifth Railway Project as a major
contributor to their principal objective of improving further the
efficiency and the competitive position of the railways mainly through
track overhaul of about 1,400 km of main lines and electrification of about
300 km of high density routes. The project was successful in achieving the
objectives despite some delays in procurement of track materials and a
shortage of local funds caused by increasing difficulties of the Yugoslav
economy.
1.05     In May 1981, the Kosovo Railway Project financed rehabilitation of
the railway network of RTO Pristina. The main components are
reconstruction of Kosovo Polje Junction* signalling and teleconmmunnication
on the line Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic, procurement of rolling stock and
training and technical assistance to improve management and freight
operations. Progress of works on the major parts of the project suffered
delays of seven to nine months for various reasons. The obstacles have
been resolved and execution will be completed in autumn 1986. The Closing
Date has now been extended to December 31, 1986.  The Sixth Railway Loan
was made in October 1983 and consists of a slice of the 1983-86 core
investment plans of four Railway Transport Organizations in the
Republics/Province of (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Serbia and
Vojvodina. The project aims at strengthening the four RTOs by improving
productivity, quality of service, investment and operational planning, and
by putting the railways on a path to financial viability through tariff
revenues. The project includes track overhaul, procurement of traction and
rolling stock, modern signalling and telecommunications, electrification,
integrated transport facilities, training and technical assistance. The
project execution is progressing well. Additional items in the investment
programs have recently been approved for Bank-financing under the loan.
1.06     The Bank approved the Montenegro Earthquake Rehabilitation
(Railways) Project (Loan 1769-YU) on November 27, 1979 to assist in
financing re3toration of the railway lines damaged in the earthquake and in
extending yard facilities in Bar and Titograd.

the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) in May 1985, project supervision
and on a review of the Bank's files in Washington.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     A devastating earthquake measuring 9 degrees on the modified
Mercalli Intensity Scale (MCS) with its epicentre located near Kotor on the
Montenegro coastline was registered at 7:19 a.m. local time on April 15,
1979. After, several lesser after-shocks and a last one measuring 8
degrees on the MCS scale hit the same area on May 24, 1979. Earth tremors
of strong intensity were also felt in other parts of Yugoslavia - the
southern part of the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as north-western Albania. However, the
earthquake had the most disastrous consequences on the coastal region of
Montenegro where significant part of the Republic's transport
infrastructure were either destroyed or extensively damaged.
2.02     The physical consequence was evident on the Lutovo-Titograd-Bar
section of the Belgrade-Bar line where the earthquake severely damaged
about 40 km of the line and about 10 km of the Titograd-Niksic branch
line. The earth tremors that followed did further damage to some 33 km of
the main line (with irregularities up to 65 cm). About 6 km of track had
to be renewed completely due to damage caused by falling rocks on the
line. Renewal of 3 km and repairs of 20 km of the overhead contact line
system were also necessary. The signalling system was also damaged. The
tunnels of Sumanovica and Susanj on the Titograd-Bar section and the Ostiog
and Bare Sumanovica tunnels near Niksic also suffered extensive damage.
The basic geometry was distorted in the 6 km Sozina tunnel and water
seepage stopped temporarily the use of electricity traction. At the 200 m
long Skadar Lake bridge, a lateral movement downward of one side of 12 cm
was noted, and at the 80 m long Moraca River bridge, a similar movement of
both sides of 2 and 9 cm and transversal movement of 4 to 6 cm occurred. A
number of railway stations suffered damage, in particular those of Zeta,
Virpazan and Sutomore. The latter was so badly damaged it had to be
rebuilt. Other facilities damaged by the earthquake were the locomotive
depot at Bar, three buildings at Bar with 70 apartments, RTO Titograd's
apartment building for its workers with 36 apartments, 1 locomotive and 13
freight wagons.
2.03     Immediately after the earthquake, emergency repairs enabled train
traffic to be restored after 13 days, however, with speed restrictions on
bridges (10 km/h) and in areas with unstable slopes (20 km/h). RTO
Titograd formed commissions of specialists which provided extensive
assessment on the level of the damages as well as the amount and costs of
rehabilitation of damaged and demolished structures. The Design Institute
of the Community of Yugoslav Railways, Belgrade, prepared a program of
rehabilitation of items damaged by the earthquake on the railway line and
structures.



- 4 -
2.04     The Federal Government of Yugoslavia requested the Bank to provide
financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the earthquake damage in the
Republic of Montenegro. The Government's request emphasized the extremely
high cost of restoring the *hysical damages as well as the losses to the
economy of the Republic as a result of the damage to the tourist facilities
and the industries in the region of Bar.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.05     The proposed project was appraised by the mission which visited
Yugoslavia in April and August 1979. The primary objective of the project
consisted of remedial works to restore the damaged railway facilities, and
the expansion of the yards in Titograd and Bar. A report on Effects of the
Catastrophic Earthquake on Railway Facilities was prepared by the Design
Institute of CYR with a cost estimate of rehabilitation works. The
proposals for rehabilitation did not include evaluation and justification
of investments because these were provided at the time of preparation of
the Belgrade-Bar project which was financed under Bank Loan 532-YU, and the
Fifth Railway Project, Loan 1534-YU where the Bank financed track overhaul
on a section of Titograd-Bar line. Because of the urgent nature of the
project no Staff Appraisal Report was prepared to accompany the President's
Report. As agreed during appraisal, negotiations were based on the
Inatitute's report.
Negotiations
2.06     During negotiations the Federal Government requested that the
US$2.0 million proposed to be provided in the form of retroactive financing
be increased. The Government pointed out that expenditures already
incurred by RTO Titograd for initial project related works exceeded
estimates prepared during appraisal. The Bank agreed that the amounts to
be provided for retroactive financing should be increased to US$3.0 million
in order to assist as fully as possible in the rehabilitation of
Montenegro's earthquake damage. While recognizing that the proposed
lending represented an increase in total Bank lending to Yugoslavia, the
delegation requested increasing the loan amount of the proposed loan. The
Bank rejected the request on the grounds that the proposed loan amount
would be additional to the substantial normal lending program to Yugoslavia
amounting to over US$300 million per year. The Bank and the Federal
Government both agreed that Investment Bank of Titograd (IBT) should act as
fiscal agent for the Bank loan and assist in preparing plans, bidding
documents and procedures and reporting on thie progress of project
implementation. It was agr-id that CYR's involvement would be restricted
to planning and procurement assistance and project reporting.
2.07     Negotiations for the proposed loan of US$14.0 million equivalent
were held in Washington from October 22-26, 1979. The loan was approved by
the Board of Directors on November 27, 1979, and the Loan Agreement signed
on November 30, 1979. The loan became effective on April 29, 1980, due to
delay in obtaining the necessary legal decisions from the Republic.

Proiect Description
2.08     The project comprised of the following components which were
financed by the Bank:
-    repair works required to protect the damaged railway
structures;
-    rehabilitation works on about 40 km of Lutovo-Titograd
section and 30 km of Zeta-Bar section on the Belgrade-Bar
main line and on about 10 km of Niksic-Titograd branch line;
-    expansion of Titograd and Bar yard facilities with the
construction of loading and unloading tracks to handle
expected extra traffic necessary for rehabilitating the
damaged areas; and
-    geological and soil mechanical research.
2.09     Due to the urgent nature of the work involved, the above
rehabilitation works were broken down into four components (Table 1):
Group I: Urgent rehabilitation works - repair of substructures
including ballast, repair of tunnels on Titograd-Bar section,
repair of bridges, buildings, electrical equipment, track renewal,
lining and levelling of track points, provision of traction and
rolling stock, and preparation of rehabilitation designs.
Group II: Expansion of yards at Titograd and Bar - building of 5
new tracks in Titograd and 8 in Bar and installing outdoor
lighting at both yards.
Group III: Other rehabilitation works - (a) Belgrade-Bar line:
rehabilitation of embankment on Titograd-Bar section,
rehabilitation of cuttings on Trebesica-Lutovo-Bratonozici and
Bioce-Titograd section, rehabilitation of drainage systems,
rehabilitation of two bridges and Sosina tunnel, and building of
office and apartment buildings at Bar and Sutomore; (b)
Niksic-Titograd line: repair and install drainage systems,
landslides and steel nets at Povije and Bare Sumanovica, repair
damaged tunnels at Ostrog and Bare Sumanovica.
Group IV: Geological and Geomechanical Research - examination of
underground water flows at Sosina tunnel and carrying out of
investigations for renewal of demolished structures.
2.10     The estimated cost of rehabilitation including contingencies was
Din 978.0 million (US$52.3 million) excluding duties and taxes. Estimated
foreign cost component was US$14.7 million or about 282 of total costs.
Table 2 shows detailed project costs. Map IBRD 14638 shows the lines
affected. The cost estimates included a provision for price escalation on
the basis of 12% annually for local costs and 7% for foreign costs and a



- 6 -
physical contingency of 15%. The foreign exchange component of the works
included in the project was based on likelihood that all but one of the
major contracts (electrical installations) would be executed by local
contractors.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
Start-Up
3.01     The renewal and construction of facilities damaged by the
earthquake commenced immediately, with much success. However, difficulties
arose with establishing the geological conditions in the vicinity of the
Sozina tunnel delaying the starting of work until 1982.
Implementation Schedule
3.02     General.  The loan became effective April 29, 1980.  The
implementation schedule provided for completion of rehabilitation works in
Groups I and II in 1979 and 1980, as well as a part of works from Groups
III and IV (Table 1). Except for preparation of designs for reconstruction
of Sozina railway tunnel where geological research was to be made first the



works in Group I were actually completed on schedule. Concerning the
expansion of marshalling yards capacity (Group II) more rehabilitation work
was carried out in Bar station and less in Titograd station. From
Group III items, priority was given to constructing part of the depot and
workshop at Bar and rebuilding the 36 apartments at Sutomore and 70 at Bar
for employees, however, meeting the Yugoslav law on building in the
earthquake area slowed down preparation for designs which was completed in
1981, a year behind schedule. All works were completed by July 1984,
except for works in Sozina tunnel which was completed in September 1984
(Table 1).
3.03     The major reasons for delays in implementation were the need for
major geological investigations, need for detailed designs and lengthy
bidding procedures for Sozina tunnel, Povija landslide, galleries, handling
space in Titograd yard and the shortages of supplies and materials.
3.04     Revisions and Financin4g.  The Bank agreed several times to alter
percentage of disbursement at the request of the Borrower. On March 12,
1981 the disbursement percentage was changed from 27% to 100% financing of
foreign expenditures and 27% of local expenditures. On July 23, 1981, a
further change was made on disbursement percentage to finance 100% of
toreign expenditures and 51% of local expenditures. The reasons for the
change in disbursement were: (i) to enable the RTO to use more of its own
funds for local expenditures while the Bank financed imported equipment;
and (ii) the devaluation of the Dinar against the US dollar which resulted
in underdisbursement of loan proceeds.
3.05     A request was made to the Bank by CYR by telexes dated January 21,
and February 1, 1983 to reallocate the loan proceeds to permit the use of
surplus loan funds for the purchase of urgently needed spare parts for
traction and rolling stock, track maintenance machines and signalling and
telecommunication equipment. At the time of the request, about 701 of RTO
Titograd's locomotive fleet, as well as other equipment was immobilized due
to lack of spare parts which resulted from scarcity of foreign exchange.
The Bank agreed to reallocate US$2.8 million for spare parts by letters of
February 16 and October 12, 1983, with financing of 1001 of foreign
expenditures. Since the equipment to be purchased was standardized,
procurement was made directly from the original manufacturer and on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
3.06     After preparing new cost estimates in 1983, CYR requested the Bank
by letter of August 10, 1983 to increase the volume of rehabilitation works
by Dinar 110 million (about US$1.2 million) and to increase funds for spare
parts by US$200,000. The additional volume of work would cover parts of
earthquake damage which was initially excluded from the project due to
financial constraints of the RTO. It would also help prevent
underdisbursement of loan funds resulting from the further rapid
deterioration of the Dinar exchange rate against the US Dollar. By telex
of September 2, 1983, the Bank agreed to the request concerning the
rehabilitation works provided the additional works could be completed
before June 30, 1984 Closing Date. This increased cost estimates from
Dinar 978 million to Dinar 1,348 million. A further request to reallocate



- 8 -
an additional US$1.5 million to increase funds for spare parts was made by
RTO Titograd on December 29, 1983. The additional funds would be used to
purchase from abroad more spare parts for electric and diesel locomotives
and for signalling and telecommunications in order to complete a
rehabilitation program for all of the RTO's electric locomotives and to
increase the availability of diesel locomotives. The Bank, realizing the
RTO would have severe difficulties in finding funds, especially foreign
exchange, agreed by telex of January 26, 1984 to reallocate funds for spare
parts, increasing funds available under Category 4 to US$4.5 million.
3.07     Time schedule.  At appraisal, the Closing Date was estimated at
June 30, 1983. However, progress with the project was slower than expected
mainly due to: (i) time required to carry out extensive geological
investigations for the tunnels; and (ii) slow rehabilitation progress on
locomotives - the item agreed for Bank financing in February 1983
(para. 3.C5). The main cause of the delay was the extensive geological
works required to complete designs for tunnel rehabilitation and also for
works on slope protection. A drainage tunnel was built 15 meters from the
Sozina tunnel and during excavation it was discovered that the geological
structure was different from that of the main tunnel. Work was also
interrupted by floods during winter months. The possibility that works
might require an extension of the Closing Date was recognized during
supervision missions in 1981 and 1982 when the Borrower was urged to take
all steps possible to prevent further delays. A new category for spare
parts for traction and rolling stock, track maintenance machines and
sign'Liing and telecommunication was added later during project
implementation (para. 3.05). The foreign spare parts used in the
rehabilitation of locomotives were installed by a local firm whose
capabilities slowed down rehabilitation progress.
3.08     On March 15, 1983 CYR requested the Bank for an extension of the
Closing Date to allow for completion of the tunnel rehabilitation works.
In order that loan funds could be used for outstanding contracts, the Bank
agreed to postpone the Closing Date for one year to June 30, 1984. At that
time, rehabilitation works were not expected to be completed until late
1983 and the loan proceeds were anticipated to continue until first quarter
of 1984. These works were actually completed in September 1984, however,
the outstanding contracts for locomotives spare parts delayed disbursements
for the loan proceeds until April 1985.
3.09     Reporting.  Initial reporting was behind schedule but this
improved through Bank supervision activity.
Procurement
3.10     General.  Due to urgent nature of a large proportion of the
rehabilitation works and due to the fact these works were limited in scope
and widely scattered, their aggregation into packages suitable for
conventional contract bidding under International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
would have been impractical and would have imposed unacceptable delays on
the rehabilitation program. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures
were applied, except where appropriate, existing contracts employed under



- 9 -
ICB procedures in connection with the ongoing Bank financed project (Loan
1534-YU) were used. All contractors prequalified for the original
construction of Belgrade-Bar line were invited to bid. In addition, the
works were undertaken on the basis of fixed prices per unit agreed between
the Borrower and the contractors. Only from 1983 onwards, did new contract
include a price escalation clause.
3.11     Civil Works.  There was no signifinant foreign interest in civil
engineering contracts for construction of the line and renewal of
buildings. Many of the works were limited in scope and widely scattered
which rendered them unattractive to foreign bidders. The damaged electrical
installations were standardized and therefore not suitable for ICB.
Procurement of these installations was therefore on negotiated contracts
awarded to the highly specialized French firm which had installed the
original signalling devices. The rehabilitation works at the Sozina tunnel
were procured under LCB, because the Bank accepted the RTO Titograd's and
CYR's view that no experienced foreign firm would be interested in carrying
out this type of rehabilitation work.
3.12     Rails and Track Materials.  Quantities of rails and other track
materials were relatively small, so it was reasonable to allow the railways
to acquire steel materials by extension of contracts awarded thL ugh ICB
under the Fifth Railway Project (Loan 1534-YU).  Sleepers and ballast were
also procured by extension of existing contracts. 1/
3.13     Rolling stock, SS & TT equipment and track maintenance machines.
At the request of the RTO through CYR, US$4.5 million was made available
for procurement of spare parts for rolling stock, signalling and
telecommunication equipment and track and maintenance machines
(para. 3.06). Spare parts to repair 18 electric locomotives, signalling
and telecommunication equipment and surve!ing instruments were purchased
from the loan proceeds and procured directly from the manufacturers.

1/ In US$ terms.
3.15     The value of the Dinar relative to the US Dollar changed over the
project period from YD 18.7 in March 1979 to YD 143.2 in June 1984. The
variations in the Dinar/US Dollar exchange rates resulted in project cost
being 13.3% less than estimated expressed in US Dollar. The cost in Dinars
increased relative to the appraisal estimate from 978 million to 1,348
million (1979 prices), with a cost overrun of 38%, mainly due to increased
cost of constructing ancillary facilities necessary in marshalling yards at
Titograd and Bar and in rehabilitation works at the Sozina Tunnel. These
costs for the tunnel had been underestimated at appraisal and increased
after geological and geomechanical investigation was completed. Inflation
was another contributing factor, because works at the tunnel started two
years later than originally planned (paras. 3.02, 3.03 and 3.07).



- 11 -
3.16     The Bank loan was for US$14.0 million of which US$13.96 million
was disbursed and US$38,572.90 was cancelled. The Republic Fund for
Reconstruction provided direct financial assistance for rehabilitation
amounting to YD 702.3 million (US$37.6 willion equivalent).
3.17     Disbursements.  Planned and actual disbursements by year are shown
below:

3.18     During the course of project implementation and at the request of
the Borrower, the Bank agreed to increase the disbursement percentage from
27S to 51%. The loan was mainly disbursed on the basis of 1001 on foreign
expenditures and spare parts and up to 51% on all civil works and domestic
goods (para. 3.04). Due to delays in preparing withdrawal documents and
the Yugoslav laws on building in the earthquake areas which slowed down
implementation schedule, disbursement lagged well behind the initial
forecast (para. 3.02). Due to financing of the spare parts (para. 3.05 and
3.06) the last disbursement was made on April 16, 1985.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
4.01     The primary objective of the project was to restore both freight
and passenger traffic, by rehabilitating the damaged railway facilities and
extending marshalling yards. This objective has been achieved.
4.02     The construction of the Bank-financed Belgrade-Bar line has been
an important factor in opening up less-developed region and integrating it
more closely with major Yugoslav and international market centers. The
development and rehabilitation of the railway facilities has thus
stimulated national and international trade and economic development. The
Belgrade-Bar line carries passengers to the growing international tourist
resorts along the coast and is a major national and international link into
the Port of Bar. The damage on the southern section of the line (about
52 km) interrupted the flow of traffic. However, after initial emergency
repairs on the line traffic increased substantially for which no forecast
was made at appraisal. Actual traffic figures for 1979-84 as are follows:



- 12 -
1979   1980   1981   1982   1983    1984
Freight NTK (million)       304    304    340    342    400      523
Passenger-km (million)      175    201    197    223    253      257
Traffic Units (million)    479    505    537    565    653       780
4.03     RTO Titograd could not carry out the six years major overhaul of
the locomotives for lack of funds which decreased the availability of
locomotives. After completion of locomotive rehabilitation from the loan
proceeds, availability of locomotives improved, and enabled to achieve a
higher traffic volume for both passenger and freight. This trend is
expected to continue during the period 1985-1990. The availability of
locomotives and the restoration of traffic volume has, in a wider sense,
assisted in the institutional performance of RTO Titograd.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01     The project contributed substantially to the resumption of
economic activity in the Republic of Montenegro by restoring operations on
the Belgrade-Bar and Titograd-Niksic railway lines. US$30.2 million was
spent on rehabilitation works under the project which permitted the
Belgrade-Bar line, constructed with Bank financing (Loan 531-YU) at a 1979
cost of US$700 million, to resume operations. US$10.6 million was spent on
expanding the Titograd and Bar marshalling yards to cope with earthquake
related traffic and to accommodate future traffic (traffic increased 8.71
p.a. from 1979 to 1984). US$4.5 million was also spent on spare parts
under the project, which resulted in an increase in locomotive availability.
5.02     The economic return for the project was not quantified because the
project was one of the several interrelated investments which were all
necessary to recover from the earthquake, including the Bank-financed road
and port rehabilitation projects. However, there is no doubt that the
regional economy would have suffered severely if railway services had not
been restored expeditiously. The project is therefore considered to be
strongly justified.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The project has been successfully implemented, having achieved its
objective of restoring both freight and passenger traffic, and was strongly
justified. The delay in completion of the original project scope was
largely due to the need for major geological investigations for Sozina
tunnel. Only 34% of the loan was disbursed by the initial Closing Date
(June 30, 1983).



- 13 -
6.02     RTO Titograd organized and provided overall planning and
coordination of the rehabilitation effort. Its maintenance BOALs 1/ for
track, signalling and telecommunications started immediately after the
earthquake to clear the damaged line and repair the electrical facilities.
The track renewal BOAL from Novi Sad, present in Titograd during the
earthquake for track overhaul, worked as part of the Fifth Railway Project
(Loan 1534-YU)9 and commissions of experts from all RTOs and from Railway
Institute in Belgrade carried out systematic inspection to locate and
define types of damages sustained and repair work needed. These efforts
and technical assistance from RTO Belgrade and RTO Zagreb in the repair of
two damaged bridges displayed teamwork between Republics, contractors and
maintenance enterprises.
6.03     Most emergency works were limited in scope and largely scattered
to be aggregated into sizes suitable for conventional contract bidding.
The Bank was flexible in agreeing to emergency repair and rehabilitation
works being carried out on the basis of contracts with unit rates,
established in advance and agreed by all contractors (para. 3.10). Bidding
through ICB would have been impractical under these conditions and would
have caused unnecessary delays on the entire rehabilitation program. This
approach proved to be very expedient despite some delays mentioned in
para. 6.01.
6.04     The role of the Investment Bank of Titograd (IBT) as fiscal agent
for the Bank loan, with the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) providing
assistance in procurement and reporting, proved satisfactory. Overall,
this was a successful project despite the disastrous consequence that
prompted the loan.
6.05     The concept that the Bank would consider retroactive financing
provided support to the RTO Titograd which wished to undertake emergency
works to reopen the line as soon as possible. A policy of providing a
substantial amount of retroactive financing for similar disaster relief
loans would seem an efficacious way for the Bank to overcome its built-in
inability to respond quickly to natural disasters.
