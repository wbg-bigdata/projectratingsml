MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC Od URUGUAY
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a propo.,ed development
loan to Uruguay for US$65.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with fifteen years' maturity, a
five-year grace period and variable irnterest rate, and would help to finance an
agricultural development project.
2.       Background.  The agricultural sector contributes only 12? of Uruguay's
GDP, but its exports including agro-industry make up over 801 of foreign
exchange earnings. Uruguay's comparative advantage lies mainly in extensive
livestock production, and pastures occupy 85? of all productive land, but there
is also good potential for annual and perennial crop production and for
forestry. In terms of natural resources and known technology, the sector
operates at a level far below its potential. The area annually available for
cropping is 1.6 million ha, but the cropped area in 1987 was only 282 of this.
Between 1970-87, the sector grew at only 0.52 p.a., one-third the rate of the
economy as a whole.
3.       Uruguay is almost self-sufficient in agricultural production, so
further development of the sector is dependent mainly on export markets.
Diversification of production aimed at exports is a key objective of Government
policy. In recent years, encouraging results have been shown in dairy produce,
citrus, malting barley, rice, forestry and fisheries, indicating that the
private sector is capable of responding to a favorable economic climate.
4.       The recently-reorganized Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and
Fisheries (MGAP) controls several key institutions in the sector, including the
Livestock Plan (PLAN) which has served as the major conduit for technical
assistance and credit under successive Bank loans. In recent years, PLAN has
suffered a loss of tutonomy and its influence with producers has declined.
Agricultural research also comes under the MGAP. The Alberto Boerger
Agricultural Research Center (CIAAB), which was seriously *seakened during the
1970s and early 1980s, is being strengthened under a recent loan from the Inter-
American Development Bank. The reorganization of agricultural research will
shortly remove it from MGAP's direct control, creating a mixed public/private
institution which will allow producers a bigger role in the definition of the
research agenda.
5.       Most credit to the sector is provided on a short-term basis at market
interest rates. However, demand for investment credit has grown strongly since
1985, in line with macroeconomic policy designed to achieve export-led growth.
Long-term lending has been supported in the past by Bank (and, more recently,
IDB) loans channelled through the Bank of the Republic (BROU). Credit lines
supported by the Bank made up about 42 of total lending to agriculture in
1987-88.
6.       Bank lending to the agricultural sector in Uruguay has been almost
continuous since 1960. Five livestock development projects, supported by seven
loans between 1960 and 1980, provided supervised credit for pasture improvement
and livestock development. The Agricultural Development Project (Ln. 1831-UR)
continued this support, but also aimed to encourage the integration of crop and
livestock farming.  Thu Agricultural Sector Loan (Ln. 2468-UR) of 1984 was a
quick-disbursing operation to support policy reforms, including reductions in



-  3  -
export taxes and simplification of import procedures, which contributed
materially to reducing Goverrnment intervention and enhancing the role of market
forces in agriculture. The most recent Bank review of the agricultural sector
was made in 1987 (Report No. 7502-UR, dated November 14, 1988) and subsequent
discussion of the findings of this review was an integral part of the
preparation of the proposed project.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government is committed to
structural reform and to an open economy as the basis for economic development.
Consistent with this overall economic strategy, the Government is relying on the
exploitation of comparative advantage in agriculture to achieve its objectives
of increased productivity, output and exports. With little public expenditure
in agriculture, few policy instruments are available to the Government, which is
acting mainly through the progressive removal of market distortions and the
generation of public goods in the form of research-based technology, technical
assistance and infrastructure.
8.       Current Bank assistance to Uruguay is designed to support reforms aimed
at removing distortions and to finance projects that foster the growth of
exports. The Government's 1989-91 medium-term program, as described in the
Letter of Development Policy for SAL II, identifies three principal objectives
in the agricultural sector: (a) to increase output and productivity in the
livestock subsector; (b) to diversify output, with emphasis on high-value export
products; and (c) to develop forestry in priority areas. The proposed project
would contribute to meeting these objectives. While it would continue to
support investment in the traditional crop and l',estock subsectors, which are
vital to continued economic growth and external adjustment, it would broaden the
scope of Bank lending to the sector by providing resources for forestry and for
non-traditional agricultural export (NTAE) sec7tors, including agro-industry.
9.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project would: (a) increase and
diversify agricultural production and exportE; (b) encourage better use of
Uruguay's natural resources, promoting the adoption of technology in the
extensive pasture areas, diversification of production in the more
intensively-farmed southern and western areas, and establishment of commercial
forestry in priority areas; (c) encourage competition in the provision of
long-term agricultural credit and increase market influence in the determination
of interest rates paid by final borrowers; and (d) encourage privately-financed
extension services to compete with those provided by the Government.
10.      Proiect Description.  The project components would be:  (a) investment
to support production and processing (89.3Z of total project cost); (b)
technical assistance for the livestock subsector, including demonstration farms,
training, and applied research (3.7?); (c) institutional support and technical
assistance for forestry (2.52); and (d) technical and financial assistance for
the promotion of NTAEs (4.5Z).
11.      Loan funds would be on-lent by the Central Bank (BCU), as financial
agent and apex institution, to participating financial intermediaries (IFIs),
which would make subloans to sub-borrowers denominated in NU$. Sub-borrowers
would have a choice between three principal adjustment mechanisms: (a) a US
dollar index; (b) one of three product basket price indices (PBPIs) appropriate
to the producer's enterprise (beef/wool, beef/wool/crops, or dairy); or (c) the
local Consumer Price Index (CPI). BROU, the major traditional lender to
agriculture, would be the main financial intermediary, but other commercial
banks would also be able to participate. The credit regulations were agreed at
negot-ations and would be enacted before loan effectiveness.



- 4 -
12.      Technical assistance associated with subloans to producers would be
provided by qualified professional extension agents from the private sector as
well as those from the PLAN. This would encourage the development of extension
beyond that available from official sources. The PLAN would have responsibility
for training, the establishment of demonstration farms, and a program of applied
research on pastures and their management. Institutional support, training, and
applied research for forestry would be provided through the Forestry Directorate
of MGAP. Technical assistance for the promotion of NTAEs would be provided
through a Coordinating Unit made up of representatives of MCAP, the Ministry of
Economy (MEF), and the Office of Planning and Budget (OPP). The Unit would be
supported by a small Technical Secretariat, and would:  (a) provide technical
assistance in a Program of Export Awareness, and (b) channel grant resources for
market research and test marketing through a Promotional Fund, on a cost-sharing
basis, to producers and exporters.
13.      The total cost of the project not of taxes and duties is estimated at
US$132.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$43.1
million (33Z). An analysis of the project's costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. A description of the proposed procurement arrangements is
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Uruguay are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The map, IBRD No. 21503, indicates, inter alia, areas defined as being of
priority for forestry. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7796-UR dated
September 15, 1989, is attached.
14.      The Goveriunent has asked for retroactive financing from the proposed
loan for the BROU/PLAN 1989 credit campaign. The terms and conditions of
subloans eligible for retroactive financing would be similar to those agreed
during appraisal. Retroactive financing has also been requested for initial
expenditures by the Forestry Directorate and by the NTAE Coordinating Unit.
Retroactive financing of up to US$6.0 million, equal to 9% of the proposed loan,
is therefore sought for the period from January 1, 1989.
15.      Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached at negotiations on the
following: (a) the appropriate Credit Regulations to be issued by the BCU;
(b) the appropriate Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the BCU, BROU and other
IFIs; (c) assurances that index switching (the doble tope, used in the previous
project) will not be employed under the project or for competing lines of
credit; (d) a minimum spread of 22 by IFIs; (e) a minimum on-lending rate to
final borrowers of 5% p.a. (where the CPI or PBPIs are utilized), or of the
six-month US dollar deposit rate in Uruguay plus minimum spree (for the US
dollar-indexed subloans); (f) Government assumption of the risks associated with
currencies and the use of PBPIs; and 'g) the need for a regular review mechanism
of lending terms and conditions for agricultural credit. The Government has
defined the methodology by which the fiscal cost of lending under the project
(if any) would be quantified, which would be included in the periodic review of
lending terms and conditions. The Government will undertake a study of
alternatives to using PBPIs to achieve its objectives in the sector within one
year of loan effectiveness, and the recommendations of the study will be subject
to the above review mechanism two years after loan signing.
16.      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be:  (a) that BCU would issue
the Credit Regulations, publicize them, and sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
with BROU; and (b) that BROU would produce evidence that it has introduced
procedures to provide its management and the Bank with timely information on the
portfolio of project subloans as required by the Credit Regulations.



17.      Conditions of loan disbursement would bes  (a) for the livestock
sub-component, the selection ot demonstration farms to be incorporated in the
first year and the definition of technology and management practices to be
employed; (b) for the forestry subcomponent, the establishment of the Forestry
Unit and appointment of the manager; and (c) for the NTAE subcomponent, the
establishment of the Coordinating Unit, the creation of the Fund and the
definition of the Fund rules, the availability of sufficient financial
resources, and the appointment of the Technical Secretary.
18.      Environment Impact.  There is a growing recognition of the problem of
soil degradation and erosion resulting from inappropriate land management
practices. The project would address this through various actions.
Institutional strengthening in the forestry subsector would support the
Government's initiatives in encouraging forestry development in priority areas
both for commercial and watershed protection purposes. Demonstration farms
would emphasize soil conservation measures and crop/livestock integration
practices. It is expected that agro-forestry practices will be increasingly
adopted.
19.      Benefits.  The main project benefits would include:  (a) increased
volume and diversity of agricultural exports; (b) creation of closer links
between the private ar.d public sectors in export promotion; (c) development of a
critical mass of forestry resources for the subsequent establishment of forest-
based industry; (d) improved efficiency of farm extension through greater
involvement of the private sector; and (e) a more competitive and market-
oriented system for supplying investment credit to agriculture. The actions
proposed under the project to encourage forestry developmert and to undertake
research on improved pasture management are expected to have a significant
positive effect on the environment.
20.      RL_k and Uncertainty.  The major uncertainty involves credit demand by
producers, resulting from the incorporation into the project of new agricultural
enterprises and from the changes in the terms and conditions of lending from
those which have been established over a long period. However, the steady
demand for investment credit experienced in recent years is expected to continue
with the maintenance of an economic environment designed to stimulate export-led
growth. Substantial price risks are inherent in an agricultural project that
relies on export markets. However, the diversification of output and exports,
which is one of the main objectives of this project, would help reduce the
impact of those risks. Investment in processing and other agro-industry would
increase domestic value-added and thereby provide the basis for the penetration
of more demanding markets.
21.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
