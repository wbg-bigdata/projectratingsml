PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1018-TO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Education
Project in Togo, financed by the International Development Association
(IDA) through a Credit Agreement which was signed on September 15, 1980,
and became effective on January 27,  1981.   At appraisal the total cost of
the project was estimated at US$16.8 million, with financing cf $11 million
from IDA, $3.1 million from the French Aid Agency (FAC), $2 million from
the Saudi Development Fund and $0.7 million remaining in the IDA Credit
Account was cancelled and the account closed.
Unesco accepted the invitation of the Government to send a mission
under the Co-operative Agreement between Unesco and the World Bank to
prepare  this  report.      The   mission   comprising  Mr.  Andre  Elkrief,
agricultural  education  specialist   (mission   coordinator)  and  Jacques
Waechter, consultant architect, visited Togo from November 9 to 21, 1987.
In preparation for field work, the relevant files of IDA were reviewed by
Mr.  Waechter  and  discussicns   were   held   with  available  IDA  staff
knowledgeable about the project. In Togo, the mission collected additional
data, held meetings with the relevant authorities and visited project
institutions. This report is therefore based on the file research, field
observation, discussions held with IDA and country officials and meetings
held with the French Aid Agency (Fonds d'aide et de cooperation - FAC)
representatives in  Paris  and  in  Togo.    The  valuable  cooperation and
assistance provided by the Government and Bank staff in the preparation of
the report is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies, as well as the two cofinancing agencies for
comments in August 1988.   An  English  translation of two telexes received
from the Borrower are reproduced as Attachments I and II.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TOGO
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1018-TO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.      This project, being the first Bank Group operation in Togo in the field
of Education took substantially more time than the average project between
Identification, Appraisal and Board Presentation. In fact, the Identification
mission was carried out in 1975, the Appraisal mission by end 1978 and Board
Presentation in May 1980.  The total cost of the projei-t was estimated to be
US$20.0 million, including US$11.0 million from IDA, US$3.1 million from the
French Aid Agency (FAC), US$2.0 million from the Saudi Development Fund, and
US$3.9 million from the Government of Togo (Preface, paras. 1.01 and 3.07).
Obiective and Content of the Project
ii.     The objective of the Project, designed in conformity with a comprehensive
Education Reform Plan, was to help the Government to: (a) improve the quality
of primary education; (b) provide skilled manpower for agricultural development;
and (c) strengthen the institutions responisible for primary education and the
training of agricultural mF-"'ower.   A further aim was  to consolidate the
management of the education system as a whole. Co-financing was provided by FAC
and the Saudi Development Fund (paras. 1.08 and 1.09).
iii.    At Appraisal, the Project was expected to be completed over a periud of
45.5 months and comprised: (a) construction and equipping of two primary teachers
colleges (ENIs), each with 360 student places; (b) construction of and equipping
physical facilities and providing technical assistance (expert services and
fellowships) for the upgrading of teachers, and the operating funds to enable
the Directorate of Education Research and Teacher Training (DIFOP) to undertake
the in-service training of primary school teachers, training for school
supervisors, pedagogical advisers, and teacher trainers, and curriculum
development; (c) the extension and strengthening of the National Institute of
Agricultural Training at Tove (INFA) in order to train agricultural staff,
teachers of agriculture for secondary schools and agricultural advisers for
primary schools; (d) the preparation of educational projects suitable for
external funding; and (e) technical assistance expertise, fellowships and
operationEl expenses for Project implementation (para. 1.11).
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.     The implementation of the Project, which was spread over a period of 81.5
months (a 79 per cent time overrun) was generally satisfactory. The time overrun
was due mainly to some additional work undertaken in training and new
construction; this work was financed through "savings' resulting from the
favourable trend in the dollar/FCFA exchange rates during the initial
implementation period. The major problem encountered was the under-utilization
of educational facilities, due in large measure to financial difficulties
encountered by the country which led to the freezing of recruitment into the
civil service, including a temporary suspension of pre-service training in the
ENIs, and the discontinuation of appointments of teachers to the demonstration
classes in those institutions. The Second Education Project will benefit only
partially from the experience and training acquired by the personnel responsible



(viii)
for implementing the First Education Pr.4ct, because of transfer and promotion
of implementation staff (para. 2.05).
v.      Because of exchange rate trends, despite the considerable extension of
the implementation period and the financing of additional operations, there has
been comparatively little change in the overall cost of the expanded Project in
US dollars (minus three per cent) compared with the Appraisal forecasts.  By
contrast, there has been a 71 per cent cost overrun in terms of CFA francs (para.
3.01).
vi.     As  regards  primary  education,  the  limited  pre-service  training
accomplished covered 245 primary school teachers to replace teachers undergoing
in-service training, 26 teachers trainers for the primary teachers colleges
(ENIs), and 56 inspectors and 66 pedagogical advisers. The in-service training
activities within the Primary Teachers Colleges, at DIFOP and in the regional
inspectorates, were devoted to the upgrading of teachers and other educational
staff. These in-service training activities assumed a much greater importance
than had been anticipated at Appraisal, since they sought to make up for the very
limited pre-service training (paras. 4.04-4.11 and 4.21).
vii.    DIFOP activities, assisted particularly by support from FAC and a UNDP-
Unesco project, have been very successful in training teachers through
educational television, in curriculum development and in the production of
teaching aids.   This  institution, with more  specialized staff and better
facilities provided under the Project, is now in a better position to accomplish
its tasks.   The  implementation of this comp.nent,  however,  suffered from
insufficient collaboration between FAC and DEPE.
viii.   At INFA in Tove, pre-service training of agricultural staff was fully
achieved in regard to extension workers  (grade C).   It was, however, only
partially completed for middle level agricultural staff (grade B). The planned
training for higher level agricultural staff (grade A2) was not done in spite
of the pressing need.   The limited achievements in training were due to the
budgetary constraints of the public sector which is practically the only outlet
for graduates.   Some in-service training for professionals in grade C is now
being provided (although not planned for at Appraisal) and seminars have also
been organized for training professionals in groups in the rural sector. This
achievement shortfall in agricultural training is similar to those in other
Bank/IDA financed projects with components in secondary level agricultural
education arid training. In many of these projects, the design was flawed in that
it was based on an overestimate of the capacity of the public and private sectors
to absorb the graduates of such institutions.
ix.     The INFA training course included in the Project to prepare persons as
agricultural teachers in secondary schools was not implemented because of (a)
budgetary constraints and (b) deletion of the agricultural secondary scl.ools from
the  Project.   Agricultural  training  in some  lower  secondary  schools was
nevertheless launched and developed through co-operation with the USA Peace Corps
in Lome.   Finally, INFA, which has benefited from a UNDP-Unesco project and
technical assistance from FAC, as well as from this Project, has become a well..
organized and adequately-equipped institution capable of meeting the rural sector
needs in human resources development.   However,  because of the Government
financial crisis, it is under-utilized (paras. 4.32-4.36).



(ix)
x.      In view of the freeze in recruitment for the civil service in 1983 when
the physical components were co.dpleted, the objectives of the Project in regard
to pre-service training of agricultural and education personel have been only
partially met.   By contrast,  the activities connected with the in-service
training of teachers and educational supervisors in primary education have far
exceeded targets.  How far the raising of the qualifications of the personnel
concerned has improved the quality of teaching is a matter which current follow-
up activities should be able to assess with some degree of accuracy.
xi.     As far as IDA performance is concerned, in hindsight it seems clear that
this Project - the first in the sector in Togo - should have been preceded by
thorough sector analysis which would have clarified some aspects of the Reform
Plan. IDA supervision was satisfactory except in that it failed to identify and
correct in a timely manner problems relating to equipment, training of teacher
trainers to handle audio-visual material and the overgenerous allowances paid
to in-service trainees and the insufficient coordination between FAC and the
Project Implementation Unit, DEPE. It would also have been helpful if IDA has
(a) assisted DEPE to design a means of maintaining Project accounts so as to
enable unit costs and costs per Project component to be determined readily, and
(b) provided guidelines to DEPE on the objectives and content of a Project
Completion Report (paras. 5.01 - 5.05).
Sustainability
xii.    It is expected that once the country's budgetary stringency has bean
eased and current restrictions on teachers recruitment have been lifted, the
activities developed under the project for primary education will become fully
sustainable. However, regarding agricultural training, developments in the labor
market will have to be closely followed to determine whether it is necessary to
proceed with program revisions and curriculum adjustments in order to secure that
project investments are effectively utilized in a sustainable manner.
Findings and Lessons
xiii.   In hindsight it is clear (a) that the Reform Plan and the cost and
financing of the education and training system (whether reformed or not) required
thorough scrutiny; (b) that more importance should have been accorded to sector
analysis as a basis for determining a lending strategy, especially since this
was the first education sector operation in the country; (iii) greater caution
with secondary level agricultural education and training in which the capacity
of the labour market (including the Government job market) to absorb the outputs
has been often overestimated, should have been exercised especially in the light
of experience in other countries.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TOGO
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1018-TO)
CHAPTER I
THE PROJECT
Socio-economic Setting
1.01    In 1980 Togo had an estimated population of 2.5 million, including
two million in rural areas, unevenly distributed among the five regions of the
country.  Two thirds were concentrated in the south, where density was as
high as 100 inhabitants per square kilometre.  There were also numerous
ethnic groups speaking various languages. Ewe (20.76 per cent of the
population) in the south and Kabye (13.89 per cent) in the north being the
two major languages.  The annual population growth rate was approximately
2.5 per cent. - 2.1 per cent In rural areas and five per cent in urban areas.
Approximately 50 per cent of the inhabitants were aged 15 and under.
1.02    In 1980 Togo was a low income country classified among the Least
Developed Countries.  It had a GDP per capita of US$380 (only S180 in the
rural areas), of which agriculture comprised 30 per cent and employed 80 per
cent of the work force.  The main feature of farm  organization was the
predominance of small holdings;  their yields were low but these holdings
nevertheless accounted for 70 per cent of agricultural production. Industrial
crops (cocoa, coffee, palm nut and, more recently, cotton) had been developing
gradually and provided 30 per cent of the country's foreign currency earnings.
Phosphate mining, which employed 1.600 people, accounted for only six per
cent of GDP but provided 40 per cent of foreign exchange earnings and 30 per
cent of the  revenue.   The  tertiary  sector comprised  mainly  commercial
activities, transport and services.  It furnished 50 per cent of GDP and
employed 15 per cent of the working population.
1.03    The decline in phosphate prices led the Government in 1979 to adopt
an economic austerity programme aimed at reducing public expenditure in real
terms and reducing commercial borrowing for three years.  AS the country
possessed real potential for the expansion of agriculture, mining and services,
the long-term prospects were comparatively favourable.
The Education Sector - Problems and Strategies
1.04    The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research (Nlnist6re
de l'Education nationale et de la recherche scientifique - MENRS) Is respon-
sible for all types of school education and training, including curricula which,
though managed by the technical ministries, are still subject to ultimate
review. The Ministry of Rural Development (Ministere du developpe:nent rural
- M4DR) is in charge of the training of agricultural staff.  The Directorate of
Agricultaral Education and Training (Direction de l'education et de la forma-
tion agricoles - DEFA). established in keeping with a proposal by the IDA
Appraisal mission, is responsible within the MDR for questions relating to
agricultural education and training.



1.05    The Project was designed with a view  to helping to implement the
educational reform adopted by the Government in 1975, the purpose of which
was to solve problems arising in the areas of management, access, efficiency
and quality.  The measures adopted in the context of the reform  comprise:
the Introduction of two national languages in primary education, curricula
geared towards more practical training with emphasis on natural science and
agriculture,  the extension of teacher pre-service and in-service training
programmes,   technical  training  and  basic  education  for  adults  and
marginalized groups, and finally, more prudent management of the education
system.
1.06    With the rapid expansion  of the education  system, the share of
education in the country's recurrent budget increased from 24 per cent in
1974 to 27 per cent in 1978, and fell to 17 per cent in 1980. The unit costs
(to Government) of education are low because of high student:teacher ratios,
low salaries paid to teachers and contributions from parents and village
communities which largely finance the building of primary schools and
supplies of teaching material in rural areas.
ProJect Generation
1.07    The Project constituted the first intervention by the Bank Group in
the education sector in Togo. In response to IDA interest in sending a sector
study mission in 1974, the Government, which was interested in a project that
would consolidate a reform of the system, requested a delay so as to permit
it time to decide on the reform. Following the reform decision of early 1975,
Unesco sent a project identification mission in June 1975, followed by a
Unesco preparatory mission in December 1977. The sector study to assess the
reform in depth and to review  the options did not take place.  The Project
was then appraised by an IDA mission which visited Togo in October/November
1978.   Project Preparation  facilities were withdrawn prior to the Credit
Agreement which was signed on 15 September, 1980. The total cost of the
Project was estimated at US$20.0 million.
Description of the ProJect
ObJectives
1.08    In Its final form, the Project addressed the country's educational
needs and reflected the content and the approaches specified in the Reform
plan.  It was also well adapted  to the country's development objectives
stratpgy.
1.09    As set forth in the Appraisal report, the Project was aimed at
helping the Government to: (a) improve the quality of primary education;  (b)
train skilled personnel to ensure the development of the agricultural sector:
and (c) strengthen institutions responsible for primary education and the
training of agricultural staff   The idea was to widen access to education,
particularly in rural areas, and to consolidate the management of the system
as a whole.
1.10    The support given to primary education was justified by the intrinsic
importance of that particular level, the quality of which conditioned that of
the other levels.  The increase in student numbers required an increase in



- 3 -
instructors constituted an obstacle to the development of the rural sector to
which the Government attached considerable lmportance.  Consequently, the
Project was designed to support agricultural education and the training of
staff required in the rural sector.  Technical assistance, involving expert
services and fellowships; was included to contribute to attaining these
various objectives.
Prolect ComDonents
1.11    The Project was to be implemented over a period of three and a half
years  (January  1981-June  1984),  and  Included  the  following  specific
components:
(a)     Primary Education
(1)    Construction  and  equipping  of two  primary  teachers colleges
(ENIs). each with 360 places, including 240 for pre-service
teacher trainees and 120 for existing teachers undergoing in-
service training;
(11)    construction and equipping of physical facilities, expert services,
fellowships for further training and operational funds to enable
the Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher' Training
(Direction de la formation permanente et de l'action et de la
recherche pedagogiques - DIFOP) to carry out upgrading activities
for primary school teachers, training for school inspectors, peda-
gogical advisers and secondary school teachers as well as
curriculum development.
(b)     TralninE of Agricultural Personnel and Agricultural Teachers
The construction  and equipping of physical facilities, required to
extend the capacity of the Agricultural Vocational Training Centre
(Centre de formation professionnelle agricole - CFPA) In Tov6 (which
was to become the National Institute of Agricultural Training -
Institut national de formation agricole - INFA) from 290 to 430
places, expert services and fellowships for in-service training so as
to provide training for agricultural personnel, teachers of agriculture
for secondary schools and agricultural advisers for primary schools.
(c)     Preearation of Projects
Expert services, fellowships and operating funds required to prepare
projects for external financing.
(d)     Project Management
Equipment, expert services. fellowships for in-service training and
operating funds required for the Project Unit.



-4-
Special Covenants of the Credit Agreement
1.12    Credit Effectiveness was conditional on: (a) the Borrower crediting a
bank account in the name of the Project Unit with the sum of CFAF21,000,000;
(b) the signing of the "Convention de Financement" between the Republic of France
and the Borrower; and (c) the signing of the Agreement relating to the Saudi
Grant (Annex 1). Disbursements against the INFA component were conditional to
the issue of a Government Decree establishing INFA.
Amendments to the Credit Agreement
1.13    The Credit Agreement  (see Fulfil-ient of Convenants in Annex 2) was
amended in order to enable initially unplanned expenditure to be met by the
Project. Authorization to meet the operating costs of DIFOP was conveyed by IDA
on March 14, 1983. Another amendment on December 16, 1983 authorized expenditure
to be met for fellowships for ENS students 1/ and teachers on in-service training
and for the salaries of substitute teachers. The Closing Date of the Credit was
first postponed to June 30, 1986, later to December 31, 1986, subsequently to
June 30, 1987, but in effect the Credit was finally closed January 25, 1988.
This was not made use of on account of the limited opportunities for
recruitment into the civil service.

CHAPTER [I
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01    The Credit Agreement, signed on 15 September 1980, came into effect
on 27 January 1981.  Project Implementation lasted 6.8 years instead of the
planned 3.8 years. The Closing Date was deferred on three occasions, mainly
in order to make adequate use of funds for financing initially unscheduled
items (additional in-service training and buildings).  At the time of the
completion mission,  all buildings scheduled at Appraisal or built in addition
had been delivered, furnished and equipped.  The main problems were:  (a)
the under-utilization of most of the educational facilities and accompanying
equipment; and (b) the diffic'alties encountered by users in maintaining the
facilities. The number of technical staff in project management who benefited
from training under the Project and.who are engaged in the implementation of
the Second Project Is small - several of the original staff have been trans-
ferred or promoted to other posts within the administration.
Prolect Administration
2.02     The Office for the  Implementation of Education Projects (Bureau
de l'execution des projets d'education  - BEPE) was established by minis-
terial decree on April 7, 1978.   It was superseded by the Directorate of
Implementation of Education Projects (Direction de l'execution des pro-
jets d'education - DEPE), established within the MENRS by ministerial
decree (No. 171/MENRS/METFP) on February 20, 1985. Herein afterward, the
project unit will  be  referred  to  as  DEPE.    (See  Comments from the
Borrower, Attachment I.)
Proiect Management
2.03    Implementation of the Project began in January 1979 (Annex 3). The
Project Director was assisted by an architect, a qualified technician in civil
engineering and  two accountants.   The Project also  benefited from  the
services of a specialist in school buildings over three years.
2.04    DEPE  satisfactorily  conducted  its  tasks  relating  to  civil works
included in the Project.  DEPE assumed total responsibility for the extension
of INFA in Tove (architectural designs, bidding documents and supervision of
site operations, as well as the preparation of lists and bidding documents for
furniture and equipment).  As regards the ENIs. DEPE undertook follow-up
activities and supervised the work of the firm  of architects responsible for
the designs.  However, DEPE had no control over the setting up of DIFOP
since the Fonds d'aide et de cooperation (FAC) was in charge of finan-ing
that component of the Project and the liaison between FAC and DEPE on this
was poor.  In the view  of the Government there was need for a more
generally collaborative relationship between Togo and FAC on this item. This
situation resulted, for example, in some significant gaps in the accounts of
the Project.  The accounting for the Project was correctly concerned with
checking disbursements according to items of expenditure in order to ensure



- 6 -
the judicious use of funds. More attention was needed to facilitating analysis
of the costs of each component and of unit costs.  Such analysis was not
possible owing to the Ilncomplete state of information supplied by some
financial sources, partiertarly by FAC.  More complete coordination by DEPE
of project Implementation. especially in the light of the variety of sources of
funding, would have obviated the complaint of heads of Project Institutions
that they were not kept informed of the maragement of their component.
2.05    There has been some staff turnover at DEPE.  At the time of the
completion mission, DEPE was being managed by its third Director and had
engaged the services of its second architect. The civil engineering technician
and the two accountants who benefited from the experience of implementing
the First Education Project and from the study tours are now assisting with
implementing the Second Education Project.  The accounts department has
been strengthened by addition of a third senior accountant. This has enabled
its work to be conducted more satisfactorily: staff specialize according to the
type of project and financing and the way its accounts are organized, in
order to provide a broader range of analysis.  The computerization of the
accouncs through the purchase of equipment and the financing of study tours
was an objective that has not been pursued.
2.06    The architectural plans for the two ENIs and DIFOP were entrusted
to two private fimrs selected locally by DEPE In January 1979.  Designs
relating to the extension of CFPA were undertaken directly by the School
Construction Unit, which acquired the services of a Unesco expert architect In
June  1979, i.e. three months later than  scheduled.   Given the limited
technical capacity  of the firm  of architects responsible for the designs
relating to DIFOP. FAC decided to employ a new firm and to revise the
architectural programme.  The subsequent architectural studies began after
considerable delay but the buildings were completed according to schedule
because of good performance by the architect and the building contractors.
2.07    The two ENIs at Kara and Notse were built according to identical
plans (Annex 4). The overall design involved a series of small buildings over
a fairly extensive area with the inevitable consequences in termis of increased
costs of transport and fencing. The design principle for most of the buildings
(premises grouped systematically around a central courtyard) is questionable
in so far as it increases certain forms of environmental nuisance (noise) and
reduces the possibility of satisfactory natural ventilation.  Furthermore, the
architects failed to differentiate among the various faCades according to their
exposure to sun or rain and used unnecessary space for the sole purpose of
maintaining the symmetry of the buildings. The dormitories have a larger
capacity (370 places instead of 360) than planned at Appraisal.
2.08    Modification of the architectural design for DIFOP did not lead to
substantial changes in the new rremises to be built as compared with the
Initial programme (Annex 5); activities were regrouped. specifications altered
and existing areas allocated differently from  the original programme.  The
overall aspect of the buildings is discreet and relatively compact. while the
outside areas are limited and easy to maintain. With the exception of certain
techniical teaching spaces where walls had to be demolished in order to install
machinery and where problems will be posed once again when equipment has
to be maintained or replaced, the speciallsed rooms are well adapted to the
activities for which they were intended.



2.09    The extension of CFPA  at Tove was undertaken on a site less
favourable than that of the existing buildings (Annex 6). Paths between the
buildings are very long and access to infirmary, dormitories and workshops is
sometimes difficult.  Th*  overall design of the buildings is simple and the
teaching premises for the most part are well exposed to light. The buildings
are not always adequately protected against the rain and the sun, and this
has caused rapid deterioration of the tutside wall surfaces. Roof ventilation
is not consistently adequate throughout the premises, making some rooms
uncomfortable and certain areas unsuitable - for example heat and
evaporation in the storage rooms for chemical products are excessive.
Construction
2.10    Invitations to tender for construction were Issued between January
and June 1981 after a preliminary selection of contractors made in July 1980.
Contracts were awarded in April 1981 (ENI at Kara and INFA at Tove) and
September 1981  (ENI at NotsO).   The process was in accordance  with
procedures acceptable to IDA for the various contracts. The DIFOP component
was, however, administered directly by FAC.
2.11    Construction began with some delay.  Five months passed between
the award of the contracts and their signature. The construction time was in
keeping with the Appraisal schedule, with the exception of the ENI at Kara,
where additional drainage and consolidation work was required.  For the two
ENIs, a second bid invitation was issued in May 1985 for the construction of
additional works which had not been planned during the Appraisal of the
Project - demonstration schools, traditional kitchens and space for a
generator.  this additional construction work was duly completed In 1987 at
Kara in March and at Notse in September. The Saudi Fund did not contribute
to the financing of this additional work but will finance the building of
related staff housing which has yet to be undertaken for each of the two
demonstration schools.
Maintenance of Premises
2.12    Maintenance of premises built under the Project varies from  one
institution to another.  There are no funds earmarked for that purpose but
the schools and institutes usually have sufficient staff for the daily
maintenance and cleaning of the premises. The mission noted the satisfactory
care  taken  to  maintain  the  areas  adjacent  to  various  institutions.
Maintenance problems are being encountered in lighting (inaccessibility of
some installations), plumbing (poor quality of the equipment installed) and
paint-work  (lack  of recurrent funds).   The  shortage  of funding  for
maintenance was underlined by Government officials.

Furniture and EauiDment
2.13    Lists of equi ment and  furniture  were  drawn  up  by  DEPE  In
collaboration with the future users.  International competitive bidding was
conducted in December 1981.  Four contracts were signed to supply  nine
batches  of  equipment  required.    Additional  international  bidding  was
conducted in 1982 and 1983 for the sun"ly of vehicles, farm machinery and
school textbooks. The last invitations t .ender were made in April and June
1986 for the supply of equipment and furniture for the demonstration schools
added during Project implementation.
2.14    Mention should be made of various problems regarding equipment:
(a)     some equipment Is unusable - for example, certain types of farm
machinery are unsuitable for local conditions;
(b)     some equipment is unused because of lack of qualified personnel for
their utilization - for example the language laboratories and audio-
visual equipment - or because of a change in the functioning of the
ENIs  where  no  pre-service  training  was  undertaken  with  the
consequence that some physics and che:mistry equipment is unused;
and
(c)     some equipment is under-utilized, as in the case of modern kitchens
installed in the ENIs, for reasons relating to the cost and
availability of the appropriate energy sources (electricity or gas).
Utilization of Premises
2.15    Problems concerning  the  utilization  of educational premises are
apparent in the ENIs.  The organization of specialized in-service training
sessions requiring the services of foreign specialists until such time as
permanent staff of the ENIs is recruited, has led organizers to confine most
of the classes and practicals to the lecture hall where all the teacher
trainers and trainees can be grouped together.  This practice has led to
considerable under-utilization of teaching spaces, whether specialized or not.
2.16    Demonstration classes are held in the lecture hall in spite of the
fact that (a) the ENIs have demonstration rooms and (b) the Project provided
a complete primary school on each of the two sites.  The mission could not
forecast the opening date for the demonstration schools since: (a) no teachers
have been appointed, and (b) there is no related housing.
2.17    The traditional kitchens, which were built at the users' request, had
not yet been put to use, since the staff felt that they should wait until the
premises had been officially completed.  Furthermore, the mission observed
that the users often had dif.iculty in making judicious use of what they had
at their disposal. requesting additional premises (for example, an air-
conditioned store room for books) when there were already several unoccupied
rooms in the schools with those facilities, which had originally been allocated
to other activities.

Technical Assistance (Annex 7)
2.18    The Project originally provided for appeoximately 14 man-years and
four man-months of specialist services in order to: (a) coordinate DIFOP
activities (three man-years);  (b) assist in the creation of INFA pedagogical
sections and improve the management of that institute (four man-years): and
(c) strengthen DEPE and prepare projects likely to berefit from external
financing (seven man-years).  The Project also provided for nine fellowships
(7.5 man-years) for primary education (DIFOP), 20 fellowships (12 man-years)
for rural education, two fellowships (15 man-months) for the preparation of
the Project and four fellowships (two man-months) for DEPE (Project Unit).
2.19    Technical assistance was originally to have been completely financed
by IDA and FAC.  Subsequently, the UNDP-Unesco projects for assistance to
INPA  and  DIFOP, which began in  1983 and  1984 respectively, comprised
technical assistance funds, including training fellowships for INFA instructors,
which duplicated those for which FAC was responsible.   FAC. which was
already heavily committed to DIFOP, left responsibility for financing the INFA
fellowships to the UNDP-Unesco project.
2.20    In respect of the seven man-years and four man-months of experts
services connected with DIFOP and INFA, technical assistance was fully and
satisfactorily  implemented.   In addition, the  UNDP-Unesco  projects  were
extended In July 1987 fcr three years (DIFOP) and two years (INFA)
respectively. As for FAC, it is more than likely that the experts on the spot
(five posts per annum at DIFOP and as many at INFA), will be kept on so as
long as Government requests their retention.   This additional technical
assistance would help to reinforce the results obtained at the end of the
Project.
2.21    Approximately 3.5 man-years of expert assistance were used within
DEPE. The services of an architect were used upon by DEPE for three years
in order to conduct architectural studies and to prepare the bidding document
concerning the extension of DIFOP and the follow-up to the activities of the
firm of consultants responsible for designs for the ENIs.  App,roximately half
a man-year was also used in the form of a short-term consultant mission for
a study of maintenance of school buildings and a study of the costs and
financing of education. These studies were connected with the implementation
of the Second Education  Project (Credit 1568-TO).   DEPE start assumed
responsibility for the preparation of lists and background for competitive
bidding concerning equipment and therefore did not make use of the expert
services under the P.oject.
2.22    The provision of fellowships and study trips - although delayed -
was successfully conducted both abroad and locally beyond the objectives of
the  Project, particularly  within  the  framework  of the  two  UNDP/Unesco
projects. New fellowships are planned in the two extended projects.

CHAPTER III
COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
Costs
3.01    A comparative table of costs estimated at the Appraisal and actual
costs per component expressed in CFAF and in US dollars by category of
expenditure is presented In Annex 8.  The total net-of-tax  cost of the
Project, Including provisions for contingencies, was estimated at Appraisal at
3,631.780.000 CFAF. or the equivalent of USS16,818,0001'.  The total actual
cost of the Project, as impiemented, Is calculated at 6,025.539,000 CFAF, or
the equivalent of USS16.276.0002/, which represents an increase of 71 per
cent in relation to Appraisal estimates established in CFAF and a decrease of
three per cent In relation  to the US dollar base3/.  The difference  is
attributable  to  the   fluctuation   of  exchange  rates  during   Project
Implementation. (Cf. exchange rates, page viii).
3.02    The table which follows (Table 3.1) summarizes estimated and actual
costs (in CFAF and in US dollars) by category of expenditure.
1/      1US3 = 210 CFAF at the time of Appraisal.
2/      USS1 = CFAF 370 on average over the duration e1f the Project.
3/      It was not possible to determine the real cost of operations financed
by FAC. The actual project cost was calculated on the basis of the
sum of the three FAC 'conventions' and an estimate of the cost of
technical assistance provided by FAC. It was not possible to
determine the cost of fellowships not financed by the Credit
Agreement.

TOTAL (Taxes Incl.) 4,200 20,000
3.03    With the exception of training-related expenditure, the scope of
which cannot be compared with the Appraisal estimates which dealt only with
the financing of pre-service training for substitute teachers, each category of
expenditure valued in US dollars fell below the estimates.  Expressed In
CFAF, the most significant increases In costs relate to training (+676 per
cent), construction (+59 per cent) and furniture (--22 per cent). The increase
in the overall construction cost is the result of: (a) an increase in
constructed surface areas of the order of 16 per cent for all components and
attributable mainly to the ENIs (+26 per cent); (b) delays in the starting-up
of construction and the introduction of additional constructloi. toward the end
or Project implementation:  and (e) unit costs per square metre in excess of
Appraisal estimates expressed In CFAP (cf. para. 3.04).  The difference In
costs of furniture varying from +18 per cent to +28 per cent can be
attributed mainly to a difference in unit costs; as far as the ENIs are
concerned, the excess of planned construction was not accompanied by a
similar increase in the volume of furniture).
Unit Costs
- 3.04     Unit costs per square metre of construction are as followsl/:
1/     At the average rate of 370 CFAF = I US$.



- 12 -
ENI at Kara          103,000 CFAF or      US$278
ENI at Notse         100.000 CFAF or      US$270
INFA at Tove         92,000 CFAF or      USS248
DIFOP at Lome        129,000 CFAF or      US$348
Differences observed among unit construction costs of the various facilities
are related to: (a) the remoteness of the locations of the Projects; and (b) a
difference in building standards for DIFOP. In relation to Appraisal estimates
established in US dollars, varying from $210 to 310 per m2 in 1980, the price
increase was minimal because of fluctuations in exchange rates.  Considered
In terms of changes In CFAF, the increase in unit construction costs may be
estimated at approximately 75 per cent over the period between March 1980
and December 1983 (completion of construction work except for the two
demonstration schools), that is to say, approximately 17 per cent per annum.
Cost per Student Place
3.05    The unit cost per student place (construction, furniture, equipment
and architects' fees) stands at 3,343,000 CFAF on average for the ENIs, on
the basis of their theoretical Intake capacity of 360 students per institution.
In relation to the surface areas, the student place in the ENIs corresponds to
27 m2 of overall construction (school. boarding facilities and staff housing)
With regard to the extension of existing or specific infrastructures; no
attempt was made to calculate unit costs per student place for DIFOP and
INFA.
TraininR and ODerating Costs
3.06    Financial support by the Project for in-service training activities
was agreed to by IDA in December 1983 and took the form of monthly or daily
allowances according to the category of the beneficiaries and the duration of
in-service  training.    The  ENIs  and  DIFOP  were  allocated  a  budget
corresponding to the activities which they had to conduct.  Expenditure on
upgrading activities which took place within tite Regional Inspectorates was
handled by DIFOP. The allowances were calculated according to the following
scale:
FCPA/month       FCFA/day
Training in the ENIs or at
DIFOP
School Principals                  45,000
Teachers                           45,000
Pedagogical advisers               45,000
Substitute teachers                40.000
Further training in the
Inspectorates
Inspectors                             -           3, 000
Pedagogical advisers                   -           2, 000
Teachers                               -           1, 000



- 13 -
These allowances were too generous and have been scaled down in the case of the
Second Education Project.   The breakdown by category of the whole of the
operating costs of training under the Project (1,535,310,500 CFAF) is as follows:
Training costs                              402
Salaries for substitute teachers and
part-time teachers                        47?
Other operating costs                       132
100o
Financing
3.07    Subsequent  to the  implementation of an advance  of funds  for the
preparation of the Project amounting to US$414,000 on January 30, 1979, the
Credit Agreement, signed on September 15, 1980, came into effect on January 27,
1981, that is to say, six weeks later than scheduled, pending the announcement
of the Judicial Ruling of the Supreme Court of Togo. Co-financing arrangements
provided by FAC came into effect on August 19, 1980 (first of the three FAC
"Conventions de financement") and those provided by the Saudi Government came
into effect in June 1979.
3.08    A summary table of the planned and implemented financing procedures of
the Project is provided in Annex 1. The IDA Credit covered 66 per cent of the
total cost of the Project approximately equal to the 65.4 per cent scheduled at
Appraisal.   Government financing covered 14.9 per cent of the Project cost,
instead of the 4.3 per cent scheduled at Appraisal. On the other hand, FAC and
Saudi financing fell from 30.3 per cent (Appraisal) to 19.1 per cent (actual).
Disbursements
3.09    At the request af the Government, IDA granted several extensions of the
Closing Date.   When extension to June 30, 1987 was approved,  submission of
requests for reimbursement were authorized until December 31, 1987 for
expenditure committed before June 30, 1987. Ultimately, the Credit was closed
on January 25, 1988.
A sum of US$10,813,748.49 was drawn from the Credit and the balance of
US$186,251.51 representing 1.7 per cent of the sum of the Credit of US$11
million, was cancelled on January 25, 1988. A comparison between estimated and
actual disbursements, by category of expenditure, is given in the table of Key
Project Data,  page  (v).   A comparison between the estimated  schedule of
disbursements and the actual implementation schedule is given in Annex 3.
3.10    In order to ensure as full a utilization of the Credit as possible, the
reimbursement percentages by category of expenditure were revised on March 14,
1983 and the Credit proceeds were reallocated on February 24, 1984.

CHAPTER IV
PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Overview
Obiectives
4.01    The Project, which was designed to help bring about educational reform,
comprised the following objectives: (a) for primary education, (i) the training
of additional teachers in response to an increase in student numbers; (ii) the
improvement of the standard of in-service training of teachers;  (iii) the
training of educational staff; (iv) the preparation of new curricula; and (v)
the preparation of teaching aids,  and  (b)  for agricultural education and
training, (i) the training of middle-level instructors in rural development and
the  in-service  training  of personnel;  (ii)  the  training of teachers  for
agricultural secondary schools; and (iii) the training of agric_ltural advisers
for primary  education.    The Project was  also supposed to assist  in the
preparation of new projects.
Implementation
4.02    In July 1983 during Project implementation,  the country, which was
beginning to face a difficult economic situation, decided to apply the austerity
measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund, thereby bringing about
a very m&rked-reduction, even cessation, of recruitment into the civil service.
It was for this reason that pre-service training in the ENIs, on the basis of
which the construction programme had been justified, was suspended after only
one year of training for substitute teachers. The new institutions are now used
exclusively for in-service training. The position at INFA in Tove is similar.
Of the five initial training programmes scheduled for that component of the
scheme,  only two have been put into effect.   The rest of the Institute's
activities is focused on in-service training.   The abolition of part of the
training initially planned has inevitably led to the under-utilization of
buildings.
4.03    DIFOP, which has also benefited from substantial support from the FAC,
as well as from the UNDP-Unesco project, has been able to attain the planned
objectives and even to exceed them.
Primary Teachers Colleges (Ecoles normales d'instituteurs - ENIs)
Pre-Service Primary Teachers Training
4.04    The activities of the ENIs, which were opened in early 1984, were
originally to have comprised: (a) pre-service training in a three year course
with annual output of 160 graduate teachers and (b) in-service training programs
of 3 months duration with an annual output of 720 retrained teachers.   Pre-
service training was aimed at students holding the "brevet" (diploma)
(successfully completed Grade 10) and was to last three years, including two
years of theory and practice and one year of practice teaching. As in the case
of other forms of training, it was DIFOP which prepared the curricula with the



- 15 -
help of INSEE. The programme was, however, disrupted as the result of the
budgetary restrictions which stopped the recruitment of new teachers.   In
parallel with the austerity measures, there was also a stagnation in student
numbers in the education system (cf. Annex 9).   A lack of motivation for
education, and rising poverty and the stagnation of teacher nrTmbers, particularly
in rural areas, may have been the cause of this situation. /
4.05    Pre-service training was restricted (1983-1984) to a single year of 245
teachers (122 at Notsd and 123 at Kara) through recruitment of baccalaurdat
holders ("bacheliers") for limited training of 12 months. The raising of the
standard of recruitment was designed to improve the quality of teaching and
increase the number of outlets for bacheliers. Trained primary teachers, as well
as those who were recruited through the competitive examination, were able to
replace, as planned, those teachers undergoing in-service training in the ENIs.
In-Service Training of Monitors and Assistant-Monitors (Annex 10)
4.06    Teacher upgrading, which represents the second purpose of the ENIs, began
in February 1984.   The operation was  aimed particularly  at monitors  and
assistant-monitors with approximately 160 trainees per session and per ENI, and
three sessions per year. The teachers trained in service through this operation
added to other in-service staff trained in teacher colleges, DIFOP and school
districts exceed (see Annexes 10 and 14) the Project objective of 720 teachers
per year. The upgrading of all practising monitors was achieved by December
1986. Most of the trainees had not received any prior training and the programme
comprised the extension of knowledge and the teaching of methodology and class
practice. On arrival, the trainees were given a knowledge test in order to
detect any short-comings. They were then put into sl'k or seven groups of 15 to
30 trainees, both male and female.21 Training lasted three months and comprised
three phases: subject teaching (three to four weeks), model lessons (a week and
a half) and alternate trial lessons and in-depth classes (eight weeks).  The
trainees we:e assessed both during and at the end of the course and a final test,
of the same standard as the knowledge test used at entry, was used in order to
measure the progress achieved.
4.07    End-of-course assessment is currently thought to be satisfactory with
regard .o the trainees' capacity to impart knowledge. However, performance in
class should be checked through frequent inspections and objective assessment
conducted by DIFOP, so that any feedback could be used in subsequent in-service
training operations. In that connection, the seminar held in February 1987 on
the "harmonization of strategies for in-service training for teachers", which
brought together instructors from DIFOP, those in primary education
and the heads of the ENIs, put forward a follow-up sLrategy for
inspectors and principals according to a scale of assessment drawn
1/  The Borrower notes that the participation of two teachers from two normal
schools should b2 mentioned. (See Comments from the Borrower, Attachment I)
2/ The teaching staff of the education system included 21 percent of women in
1986-1987.



- 16 -
up by the ENIs.   The Ministry decided, furthermore, to decentralise the 90
in-service advisers in the inspectorates_ /, in order to ensure more efficient
inspection procedures.  In order to facilit ite their travel, 36 scooters were
supplied by the Project for some of the staff concerned.   The others were
asked to use their own cars for which they would receive an allowance.
In-service training (orientation) of school princiDals
4.08    The task of encouraging practising teachers in the field cannot be
carried out by the existing inspectorates alone;  there are 32 of these, each
dealing with over 300 teachers.  It was, therefore, decided that the school
principals should take part in the supervision of teachers trained on an in-
service basis by undertaking follow-up action in the schools.  In order to
ensure that follow-up activities would be pursued with the same pedagogical
approach, further training for principals was necessary;  consequently, in-
service training sessions, not provided for at Appraisal, were organized for
them starting in March 1987 in accordance with a programme prepared by
DIFOP and INSE. The sessions, scheduled to end In December 1987 (see Annex
10), have involved 2,364 principals.  In other words, virtually all of the
nractising principals, were reached.  DIFOP has also provided summer courses
since 1983 as support for educational television (cf. paras. 4.16 and 4.17).
TUpgradlng of kindergarten teachers
4.09    An in-service training session in the ENIs was also organised in
October 1986 for a group of kindergarten teachers in order to train them for
teaching in elementary schools (cf. Annex 10). The course was considered to
be quite satisfactory according to an assessment conducted at the end of the
session, but systematic follow-up procedures will be needed In order to
consolidate what has been achieved.
[n-service training of Primary school teachers, assistants and trainee
assistants
4.10    The in-service training of primary school teachers, assistants and
trainee assistants will follow  that provided for monitors and will last for
three years, starting in January 1988 (cf. Annex  10).  Each course will
Involve ! 40 teachers by intake and by ENI and last three months.  By the
end of the third year, 4,680 teachers will have been trained tn service by
the two ENIs. Once this programme has been successfully _ompieted, virtually
all of the in-service teachers will have been trained, which will lead to an
improvement in teaching standards.
4.11    In  general  terms,  in-service  training   activities  have  been
satisfactorily conducted so far in the ENIs and have made a positive
contribution to improving the trainees' level of qualification.  There are,
however, a number of problems which have yet to be solved.  There is some
concern about a decline in the teacher trainers' skills - a perception that
their knowledge becomes more limited and their teaching less imaginative for
want of in-service training and/or participation in regular teaching seminars.
Another problem  has arisen with regard to the use of teaching aids.  The
ENIs have been provided with audio-visual rhaterial, as well as language
1/   Two to six sectors per inspectorate.



- 17 -
laboratories, but the teaching aids have not yet been used as the teaching
staff have not been trained in their operation.  Similarly, the demonstration
schools which have been ready since September 1987, have not as yet become
operational owing to the shortage ot staff and living accommodation (para.
2.17).  An official competitive examination for the recruitment of 10 to 12
primary school staff for the demonstration schools took place, as planned. In
May 1987 but the results were not announced at the time of the mission.  In
the meantime, it might have been possible to recruit the necessary staff from
among practising  teachers.  Improvement In the quality  of training  that
should result from the use of the demonstration schools called for a special
effort to be made along those lines.  Ministry officials expect thlat these
schools will be opened at the beginning of the 1988-89 academic year.
Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher Training, (DIFOP)
Overview
4.12    This institution, established by a Government decree dated 5 April
1979, has been provided  with equipment and  operating  funds.  It has,
furthermore, enjoyed more broadly based support from FAC for the renovation
and extension of buildings and the provision of equipment, technical
assistance expertise and fellowships. Further support was provided under the
UNDP-Unesco project tor the pre-service and in-service training of teachers
through educational television.  With these forms of assistance closely linked
to the Project, DIFOP has become a well-structured and equipped institution,
with adequate specialised personnel at its disposal.
4.13    The DIFOP organizational chart may be found at Annex 11.  In
addition to curriculum  development, which is conducted in conjunction with
INSE and represents its basic function, its activities also include In-service
training and upgrading, pre-service training and the development of teaching
material.   DIFOP endeavours  are directed  mainly  towards imoroving  the
general standard  of education  through: (a) pre-service  training  of ENI
teachers;  (b) distance training of teachers in order to prepare them  for
training courses In the ENIs,  and (c) the training of educational inspectors
and advisers in collaboration with the directorate of primary education.
Pre-service training for ENI staff
4.14    Prior to the opening of tihe ENIs in 1984. the training of trainers for
those institutions was conducted in accordance with a curriculum jointly
developed by DIFOP and INSE.  Training lasted  two years in these two
institut1.ons and alternated between theoretical study (INSE) and practical
work (DIFOP).  A competitive examination was Instituted for trainees for this
programme from among lower secondary cycle teachers who had already been
trained at the ENIs. Some 26 persons attended the course between 1978 and
1982 (cf. Annex 12). i.e. the majority of the 29 staff in the two ENIs (16 at
Notse and 13 at Kara).  The standard they achieved was considered by the
directors of the institutions to be satisfactory but ongoing training sessions
need to be organized for them in addition to those already provided by DIFOP
(para. 4.1 1).

Distance Training or Educational Television (Annex 13)
4.15    Distance training comprises correspondence courses, radio programmes
and the publication of tSe educational journal 'Le Lien'.  This activity has
been carried out essentially within the framework of the UNDP-Unesco project.
4.16    CorresDondence  courses  for  supervisors  and  practising  trainee
substitute teachers were devised by a 30-member committee composed of
DIFOP officials, inspectors and INSE and ENI teachers, and took the form of
individual dossiers classified according to four levels corresponding to the
academic standards of the 'trainees'.  Nine dossiers were prepared for each
level. Those for levels I to III have been completed and preparation of those
for level IV is under way.  Written work is done at home and sent for
correction to an ad hoc committee set up by the local inspector.   The
corrected homework is sent to the students together with model answers
prepared by DIFOP.  Since 1983-1984. 70.650 dossiers and 234,360 model
answers to homework have been produced and distributed to the students and
their supervisors.
4.17    Educational radio provides two 15-minute weekly programmes.  The
programme 'L'ecole et nous' Is aimed at the population as a whole and deals
with the general problems relating to school and the part to be played by the
various partners involved. The programme 'L'heure du maftre' Is designed for
teachers and school principals. It deals with Ideas that have been developed
in the correspondence courses and, more specifically, with French. pedagogical
psychology and the various general knowledge subjects.  Since 1983. 199
programmes have been produced in all.  These were produced by the DIFOP
audio-visual  department  with  additional  outside  assistance.    Students
following the course and their school principals have been asked to listen to
the programmes regularly and to discuss their content at pedagogical analysis
sessions in their schools and to convey their suggestions to DIFOP for
improving the content of the programmes.
4.18    The educational journal 'Le Lien' is designed especially for primary
school teachers and concentrates on developing the concepts of practical
teaching and general knowledge taught in the courses.  It has been increased
from three issues a year in 1984-1985 to six issues annually from 1985-1986
onwards.  The editorial committee of the magazine has produced an index of
the  titles  of articles  which  were  presumably  written  by  pedagogical
instructors, ENI teachers and DIFOP personnel. Some 40.500 copies have been
published  since  1984-1985.   Students are required  to  subscribe  to  the
magazine as an essential back-up to the courses.
4.19    In addition to the results of a follow-up to the courses, conducted
by the pedagogical supervisors, DIFOP undertook two surveys in 1985
involving 649 students and an assessment of approximately 400 students in
1986. In 1986 it also had national experts conduct a study of the impact of
the courses during the 1984-1985 academic year on 2,004 participants.  The
results of the surveys, assessments and studies were taken into account in
improving the content of the courses and in developing a more efficient
strategy for the supervision of the students.



- 19 -
4.20    The implementation  of these  various tasks  raises a number of
problems (which were noted in the context of the UNDP-Unesco project) which
reduce the effectiveness of what has become a sizeable institution with a
staff of 93 and numerous varied activities.  The solution to these problems
would require additional financial outlays to (a) Improve dispatching 9f
courses;  (b) accede to the wish expressed by students to be able to use
some of their working hours in order to work in groups; (c) provide, as an
incentive, a special financial allowance to the principals of schools in order
to compensate them for the task of supervising the students and to the
advisers who correct the students' work;  and (d) produce adequate teaching
material including teacher guidelines'/.  Such additional outlays would be
difficult to obtain. The DIFOP budget, which rose from three million CFAF In
1983 to 40 million (excluding salaries) In 1987, cannot cope with additional
expenses.
Pre-service and in-service trainine of pedagogical suvervisors (cf.
Annex 14)
4.21    Pre-service training on a two year programme, producing four to six
graduates per year to become primary school inspectors and pedagogical
advisers, has been provided since 1978 by DIFOP In collaboration with INSE.
This activity, indispensable for improved primary education, was pursued and
strengthened in accordance with Project objectives.  The curriculum  is both
theoretical and practical.  Practical training periods for the application  of
inspection techniques (evaluation, criticism, teacher counselling, written
appraisals of lessons, preparation of lessons and acquaintance with curricula),
and teaching methods with regard to discipline, amounting to seven weeks in
all, are held during the second year. Training also includes weekly seminars.
4.22    One-week summer refresher courses have been regularly organized at
the ENIs for head teachers and have focused on communication techniques and
group instruction through educational television.  Sixteen training courses
have been organized since 1984 for head teachers who were joined by other
staff:  32 primary school inspectors, 90 pedagogical advisers and 30 ENI
teachers.   An end-of-course  report was drawn  up  and  sent to  each
participant for further guidance.
4.23    Six seminars have also been organized since 1985 for inspectors,
pedagogical advisers, DIFOP officials and tNI teachers on the national
languages, teaching  methods and  curriculum  design  techniques.   At the
seminars, participants were required to give a brief talk and contribute
individually and collectively to workshops.  At the end of the seminars, a
report was prepared and sent to participants for further guidance.
4.24    In  order to  improve  the  standard  of mathematics  and  science
teaching, which is one of the objectives of the Second Project, week-long
specialized seminars were organized for teachers and their i&lstructors, as well
as the inspectors concerred.  Twenty-three seminars in all were organized in
1984 and 1985 out of funds for the First Education Project.

- 20 -
4.25    These various forms of training were supplemented by the systematic
training of in-service teacbers in sessions conducted by primary school
inspectorates lasting from  two to five days.  These 'journees pedagogiques'
have been organized in December and March of each year and have so far
focused on in-service training in French: reading. language and grammar.
The next phase will deal with vocabulary and writing. Such refresher courses
will also be devoted to the development of the sciences, in accordance with
the general guidelines of the Second Education Project.
Production of teachinR material
4.26    The DIFOP Production Division has been set the task of designing
and developing teaching aids. This is possible because of the equipment and
manpower it now has at its disposal. The transfer of the printing press from
the ENS at Atakpame and its staff to the DIFOP printing unit has now made
it possible to produce illustrated documents, such as the journal 'Le Lien' (cf.
Annex  15).   The  Audio-Visual Division  produces  films for educational
television.  The entirely re-equipped carpentry workshop Is responsible for
producing teaching aids from  wood.   DIFOP supports the reproduction  of
teaching aids by the schools themselves and it foresees the use of local
materials.
National Institute af Azricultural Training (INFA)
overview
4.27    The  Agricultural  Staff  Training  Centre  (CFPA)  at  Tove  was
reorganized (cf. Annex 16) under the Project and was renamed the Tove
National Institute of Agricultural Training (INFA) by a Government decree
issued In 1980.  The extension and consolidation of this institution was to
involve, as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report, the training of:
(a)     agricultural staff for the rural sector, and
(b)     teachers and agricultural supeivisors for secondary and primary
schools.
This objective was only partially achieved, as stated in paras. 4.32 to 4.36
below, on account of the suspension of recruitment into the civil service
which was to be practically the sole employer.  In the circumstances, the
training of higher level agricultural staff (ingenieurs) was not undertaken
while the training of middle level staff (Ingenieurs adjoints) was undertaken.
but with fewer trainees.  No steps were taken to train agricultural teachers
for the  agricultural secondary  schools  as  those  institutions  were  not
established.  The same applies to primary pedagogical advisers who were
replaced by primary school teachers.
4.28    Project support for INFA at Tove was augrnented by the UNDP-Unesco
project which involves technical assistance and equipment and by support
from FAC in the form of technical assistance.

Project Implementation
Curriculum Design
4.29    The agricultural education  expert of the  project conducted, as
planned, an updating of existing curricula for middle level agricultural staff
(grade B) and supervisors (grade C) and devised a new curriculum for higher
level agriculturai staff (grade A2). In this task, the following principles were
applied:
(a)     bringing students closer to the farming world:
(b)     devoting the greater part of practical work to apprenticeship; and
(c)     encouraging the teaching of methods of imparting knowledge.
The audio-visual unit established under the Project was responsible for
producing video cassettes and photographic slides on a variety of subjects in
keeping with the cot'rse curricula.
Instructor training
4.30    Since 1984, the 25 national INPA  instructors and the five FAC
'cooperants' have attended three annual seminars on pedagogical training
organized with the participation or (a) professors of the ENS at Atakpam6, (b)
senior rural development officials, and (c) bilateral aid consultants.  The
training, which has proved beneficial in pedagogical terms, was also
supplemented by upgrading attachments of up to nine months (Annex 7) for
eight instructors.
Farm Reorzanization
4.3.1    The farm, which comprises some 23 hectares of food crops and cash
crops, was reorganized and equipped in 1985 In accordance with a study
conducted by a Project consultant.  Initially devised as a self-sufficient
venture, it is supervised by a management committee and the INFA Council,
and would appear to be placing increasing emphasis on the pedagogical
aspect, thereby running the risk of under-utilization of equipment and lack of
independence In management.
Traininr activities (cf. Annex 17)
4.32    The training of higher level agricuitural staff (ingenleurs de travaux
agricoles) which was provided until 1982-1983 by the Higher Agricultural
School -Ecole Superieure Agronomique (ESA) - in Lome (University of Benin).
was transferred under the Project to INFA at Tov6 with a view to training 40
graduates per year.  Such training has, however,  never been conducted on
account of the austerity measures (para. 4.02).  Officials expect that this
course will be conducted at INFA in a few years' time when the financial
position has improved. In the meantime, it is reasonable to consider initially
the training of some 10 to 20 graduates each year. who would then have to
find themselves employment on the job market.  INFA has the teaching staff
and infrastructure required for such training, which will have to be geared
towards jobs in the private sector through an appropriate curriculum.  Using
the existing facilities for such training would also help to reduce unit costs.



- 22 -
4.33    The training of mliddle level agricultural staff has continued without
interruption  in cycles of tIree years comprising one year of common-core
training and two years m  *pccnlization  in one of four areas: agriculture,
cattle-breeding, rural plaiiniiLg, zind forestry.  A fifth option, 'co-operation
and co-operatives'. is to he introduced for those students being trained at
present.  From  1984 to 1<987, INFA produced 157 graduates at the rate of
approximately 40 per annum.  lhe procedure of annually recruiting students
has been abandoned during  the i1987-1988  academic year and replaced by
recruitment every three years.  There are 80 students currently undergoing
training in two groups of 40. At that rate, which is to be maintained for as
long as the country's budgetary position remains severely constrained, some
20 to 25 students will be urr t;Wd the diploma each year instead of 50.  The
content of the course  corrcsponds to the new  curriculum  which combines
practical work and traininig perlods with advanced training in communication
methods. This type of traitilng is particularly suitable for supervisory duties
which such officials are required to discharge in the context of rural
development.
4.34    The two-year traiiun la course for supervisors has been conducted, in
accordance with the objerc-ves, on the basis of 56  trainees per year.  As
most of the needs in that sector have already been met, such pre-service
training has been suspended in 1987 in order to make way for a twelve-
month refresher course for practising supervisory staff, which began in 1985
and Is to continue with groups of 150 officials each year until all 1,600 C
and D grade officials have be-en trained. The personnel in question possess
between five and twelve  ar.' practical experience -although  of varying
lavels- and  their professional qualifications are inadequate.   The course
Involves essential practscal techlnical training and virtually 50 per cent of
the time is devoted to acquiring commununication techniques that are vital for
such personnel, who comc  nr,to direct contact with local farmers.  Audio-
visual equipment provided !)idcr the Project will be used for that purpose.
4.35    A training course inte(nded to prepare persons to teach in speciallsed
agricultural secondary scnools, designed to admit 27 candidates selected
through a competitive e\armlnatlon held each year among middle level
agricultural staff was re: . organized.   The  Ministry  of Education, after
carefully examining available options and considering the manpower and
financial conditions,  deeided  to  abandon  the  construction  of the  five
agricultural secondary  schools  planned  under  the  Reform  of Education.
Agricultural training in junior high schools was nevertheless launched and
developed through co-operation with the USA Peace Corps in Lome. Teaching
is not provided by teacherb specialized in agricultural teaching but by science
teachers who have  had  training  for short periods.   The schools located
outside Lome have at their iisposal a plot of land, tools bought by the
Institution and various Inputs provided by the regional departments of the
Ministry for Rural Development.  This activity has been successful in many
institutions in exposing stnoents to agricultural and environmental problems
and their solutions.
4.36    It has also prj.-vcd i i !Iwsslble to train middle level agricultural staff
as agricultural advis'ors  o supervise agricultural classes in primary schools.
In view of the budget custrinLrt, the presence of a specialist of that kind
was deemed unnecessary at primiary level where no more than an introduction
to farming is envisaged   E : _II tinal curriculum  has not yet been defined but



- 23 -
there have been two hours of classes per week involving the school garden
and aid from a USA non-governmental organization'/. These activities have
developed to a certain extent but have, nevertheless, been limited In many
cases by a lack of mot.r atlon on the part of the teachers and by problems
related to the upkeep of the garden during the school holidays.
Problems and Conclusions
4.37    Owing to reductions made during the Project In the scope of training.
the rate of occupancy of INFA has remained below 50 per cent (cf. Annex 17)
and this entalis higher than planned unit costs. When the training of higher
level agricultural staff is launched again, the rate may rise to approximately
70 per cent. In addition to its specific task of training. INFA has become a
forum for meetings, seminars and study sessions on rural development.
Facilities should also be used for in-service training for technical staff of
the Ministry of Rural Development and for the training of farmers and rural
women In agriculture and other income generating activities.
4.38    Refresher courses are needed for national instructors at INFA whose
level of training is judged satisfactory, in addition to training provided by
the technical assistance under the Project.  There is an urgent need to
appoint national staff for the teaching of home economics which has been
taught since the beginning of the Project by FAC 'coop6rants'.  Monitors
should also prepare their own course material and ensure that It Is regularly
updated through personal efforts by reference to the wealth of documentation
available in the Institute's library and the research started. A programme of
applied research based on farm activities will be envisaged as a support to
training.
4.39    INFA  will have to adopt a more outgoing approach if it is to
maintain the quality of its teaching. In addition to meetings and seminars
which enable the teaching staff to pursue extra-curricular activities,
innovation could take the form of close co-operation with ESA through
exchanges of teachers. joint research programmes and the joint use of
equipment.   Both ministries responsible for the Project, the Ministry of
National Education and Scientific Research and the Ministry of Rural
Development, have agreed In principle to such co-operation, which may well
start in the near future.  Consideration Is currently being given to a draft
curriculum for the popularization of agriculturai training in co-operation with
local farmers.
4.40    Additional measures must be taken with regard to the management of
the farm.  Its management should be kept quite separate from that of the
Institute and should include commercial accounts in order to establish real
costs of production. Financial self-sufficiency must be a constant goal, since
it constitutes an incentive for rigorous management.

CHAPTER V
IDA PERFORMANCE
Project Generation
5.01    The project design was well conceived within the context of the
Reform  Plan.   The lack of a thorough  sector analysis as a basis for
determining IDA strategy may have been a mistake in the case of a first
project in the sector in a country.  This could have been undertaken by
Unesco (or by IDA, as originally planned by IDA), particularly to assess In
depth the feasibility of the Reform Plan.  The fundamental problem affecting
project implementation was an economic and financial one.  It Is not clear
that the appraisal mission could have foreseen the strong and persistent
decline in the financial situation of tne Government which occurred during
project implementation.   Some 42 staff-weeks in the field were used to
conceive and define the Project.  As the Credit available from IDA could not
cover the overall costs of the Project, sources of co-financing were sought by
the Government. FAC and the Saudi Development Fund were Interested in the
Project and decided to contribute to its financing.   Subsequently, UNDP
contributed to financing parallel activities.  Aid coordination efforts of IDA
were well performed at the generation stage.
ProJect ImDlementatlon
5.02    The Project was supervised In the field by 15 IDA missions at
intervals of two to thirteen months - six weeks on average between missions.
The missions spent one week in the field on average and, from September
1982 onwards, were devoted both to the supervision of the First Education
Project and to the identification, appraisal and eventually supervision of the
Second Education Project.  Architects took part in nine of the missions, a
general educator was present on six of them, an agricultural educator and an
economist took part In four, while two of the missions were undertaken by an
education planner. This balance was not unreasonable.
5.03    The supervision missions failed to identify and correct In a timely
manner shortcomings such as those relating to equipment (para. 2.14), the
training of teacher trainers for handling a!.dio-visual material (para. 4.11)
and the over-generous scale of allowances provided to trainees (para. 3.06).
In  addition,  the  missions  did  not succeed  in  establishing  sufficient
collaboration between DEPE and the representatives of other external
financial sources. particularly with FAC. concerning DIFOP (para. 2.04).  IDA
alsol needed to have encouraged the inexperienced staff of DEPE to effect a
better co-ordination among the national officials participating in certain
components of the Project, in particular DIFOP and INFA with a view to
improved implementation of these components.  Some technical assistance or
guidelines on the maintenance of project accounts so as to facilitate the
retrieval of data on unit costs and costs per component would have been
helpful to the project implementation unit but was not provided by IDA..



- 25 -
6.04    IDA displayed an appropriately flexible attitude by accepting that
the Project should meet the overall costs of in-service training operations
and DIFOP operating costs and by authorising the necessary funding.  By
extending the Closing Date or the Credit Account IDA ensured that the total
sum of the Credit was used and contriblited to reducing the costs attributable
to the Second Education Project which has been affected by the consequences
of a more unfavourable economic situation - the change in the exchange rate
between the US dollar and the CFAF.
5.05    In order to facilitate the preparation of a national draft completion
report on the Project. It would have been desirable that IDA provide to DEPE
precise Bank guidelines as to the objectives and content of a project
completion report.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS
6.01    The purpose of the Project was to help the Government to:
(a)     improve the standr.rd of primary education;
(b)     train  skilled  labour for further development of the agricultural
sector, and
(c)     strengthen those Institutions responsible for primary education and
the agricultural staff training.
8.02    Primary Education. As a result of the recruitment freeze in the civil
service during Project implementation.  pre-service teacher training planned
at Appraisal was not undertaken.  Instead, In-service training on a larger
scale than that provided for at Appraisal was carried out under the Project.
However, taking into account the low academic level of trainees at entry the
Improvement expected from this In-service training could not attain the level
Forresponding to that of teachers trained on the pre-service programme.
8.03    Substantial use has been made of distance training for teachers at
DIFOP with FAC and UNDP supplying technical assistance and equipment as
needed and sufficient operating funds, with which it has also been possible to
implement new curricula and develop teaching aids. Furthermore, pre-service
trainiig was provided for inspectors and pedagogical advisers, and supervision
of in-service training courses was undertaken by regional inspectorates.
Recently attention has been devoted by DIFOP to assessing In-service
teachers and pedagogical supervisors as part of training follow-up activities.
These various Intervening agencies have enabled valuable work to be
conducted in this institution which has produced convincing results.
6.04    Agricultural Training.  Only part of the pre-service training course
took place at INFA at Tove and, as In the ENIs. in-service training courses
to raise the standard of qualification of agricultural staff were instituted.
INFA now has modern, well-adapted equipment, a farm which could become
self-suffcient and a staff whose standards have been improved through
refresher courses abroad and/or locally and who should be in a position to
take over from  the technical assistance expatriate staff.  It would appear
that the appropriate conditions exist for providing training activities of a
high standard.
6.05    As regards Project financing, co-funding has secured more substantial
resources which  have  helped  in  achieving  Project objectives.   However
problems were all the more difficult to solve as it was the first Education
Project to be implemented in the country.  Increased coordination of the
donors might have ensured a more continuous dialogue among the various
sources of funding and better control by DEPE of Project implementation.



- 27 -
6.06    Significant fluctuations in the exchange j:are between the US dollar and
the CFAF had a favourable effect on the Project ii, so ar as they made possible
the financing of in-service training which wouJld have been severely jeopardized
in the difficult financial circumstances whijch the country had to face.  The
allowances fixed for trainees proved generous (varying from 40,000 CFAF per
month for newly recruited contractual substitul:e teachers to an allowance of
45,000 CFAF per month in addition to the basic, salary of 53,000 CFAF for primary
school teachers undergoing in-service training,).   These allowances have beer
scaled down for in-service training operations currently financed under the
Second Education Project (Credit 1568-TO).
Lessons Learned
6.07    In hindsight it is clear (i) that tho Roform Plan and the cost and
financing of the education and training system!i (\w,,hother reformed or not) required
thorough scrutiny; (ii) that more importance should have been accorded to sector
analysis as a basis for determining a lending strategy, especially since this
was the first education sector operation in the country; (iii) greater caution
with decondary level agricul*ural education 30(l 1iaining in which the capacity
of the labour market (including tLe Governmeni o;lc market) to absorb the outputs
has been often overestimated, should have been exercised especially in the light
of experience in other countries.
