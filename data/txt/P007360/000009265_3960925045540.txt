PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
;
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on Honduras
Eighth Highway Project, for which s loan for US$28.0 million was approved
by the Executive Directors on August 26, 1980. The loan was closed in June
1987 and an unused balance of US$4.6 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office and is based upon information obtained from the LAC
Information Center, the Project Appraisal Rep_rt, staff supervision
reports, consultant's reports and a PCR prepared by the Borrower.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was
read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project
was not audited by OED staff. The draft report was sent to the
Borrower for comments; their replies are shown as annexes to the report.

31HTH M1CUWAY PILWECT IRWICT (LOAN 1901-MO)
,Introduction                     HIGHLIGHTS
Tbe glghth lighvay Project had as Its maln objectives the
improvemnt of access roads to and from rural areas and the continu&tion of
the lnstitutional lprovenuts undertaken under previous projects to
strengthen highway ed.dnistratlon and mintenoncs. To achieve Its objectives,
the project Included: (1) constructlon of about 350 km of feeder roads in
selected agricultural valleys; (11) improvement of about 115 km of secondary
roads; (111) purchase of maintenance and vorkshop equipuent and spare parts;
(lv) technical assistance for lmplementing a maintenance management system;
and (v) technical assistande for training the personnel of the General
Directorate of -aintenance (para 1.01).
Objectives
The project experlenced 0o1y moderate probletm durlng Its
Implementation, except for the Lmprov&ment of the Tellc-San Francisco de la
Paz road, which experienced delays due to the finsncial weakness of the
contractor. Because of delays In this component, the loan closing date was
extended from June 30, 1985 to June 30, 1986 (par& 1.03). SECOPT was always
prompt to identify and endeavor to take remedial actions to ensure a tlmely
execution of the project, especially in relation to the GovernMent's slow
procurement procedures (par& 1.08).
Implementation Experience
The institution-building component of the project resulted in
substantial progress In SECOPT's carabilities for scheduling and controlling
maintenance activities. The technical assistance consultants, during the
course of their assignment, refined and Implemented at the natlonal level the
maintenance management system developed under the previous bank-financed
project. However, gains under the project still need to be consolidated. The
system developed by the consultants needs further adjustments to reflect
changing conditions, a process that will require additlonal technical
assistance in specific flelds. Notwithstanding SECOPT assurances that efforts
in these areas will continue, there Is a risk that gains made under the
project might be eroded because of staff changes and lack of funds for
appropriate training of replacement personnel. The bank ls not financing a
follow-on project (para 1.06).
Results
The Project Completlon Report offers the following conclusions:
(a) The relative success of the ELghth Highway Project presents an
opportunity for ldentifying the two main variables In the formula
for positive results: tocal authoritles with a comitment toward
project objectives and lnstitutlons like the Bank with the will to
estabtlsh a long-term relationship with a borrower (para 3.UZ). The
level of efficIency ln project loplementatlon, supervlslon, and
financial control can be attributed, to some extent, to the 22 years
of uninterrupted bank associatlon with the hlghway subsector of
Honduras (para 3.03); and



v 
(b) The persistence and gradual ilprovement Inherent In the successful
lntitution bullding process that took place In the highway
subeector lo Hooduras, together with the risks attached to the
sustainabillty of the g"ino under the project suggest the following
lesson: Development l usually the *eoult of marginal changes that
become evident only after cootla0ue efforta over relative.y long
periods. While it Is true that sometlmes a substantlal leap forward
might be feasible, the bank should not encourage this type of
approach unless there is a reaonable certainty of the ability of
the Borrower to absorb the Inputs, and of the Bank to continue its
Involvemnt until those changes become fully e-bedded In the
institution. If that Is not the cae, the Bank and the Borrower
should refrain from considering substantial lnvestments in technical
assis:ance designed in theory to produce a quantum leap, but
unlikely to produce results in the framework of only one or two
projocts. As an alternative, less grandiose but long-term, gradual,
and continuous efforts for improving the existing system should be
considered.

UIGNTH HIGHWAY PROJECT PRWOCT (LOAN 1901-HO)
I. PROJECT OLJECTIVES, DESCRIPTION AND JJULEMENTATION
A.   ObJectives and Description of Project Components
1.01      The project, the couponents of which were Included in the Bank
financed National Transport Plan, supported the followlng main objectives:
(a) to facilitate the access to and from rural areas through better
secondary and feeder roads; (b) to protect past Investments In the highway
network through the improvement of maintenance operations; and (c) to
continue ;he Institutional improvements undertaken under previous pi  ects
to strengthen highway administration and maintenance. To reach thosa
objectives, the project, as described In the Appraisal Report, Included:
(a) construction of about 350 km of feeder roads to be built within
selected agricultural valleys;
(b) Improvement of about 115 km of secondary roads;
(c) purchase of maintenance and workshop equipment, including spare
parts;
(d)  technical assistance for implementing a maintenancA management
system for scheduling and controlling the maintenance activities;
and
(e) technical assistance for training DUN staff.
'        B.   Project Implementation
(l) The Feeder Roads Program
1.U2      Construction of about 350 km of feeder roads In the Agricultural
Valleys of Guoyape, Jamastran, La Masica, Yoro, Siria and Talanga was
satisfactorily completed In late 1985. Works were carried out by local
contractors ond SECOPT was responsible for the technlcal and financial
management of the Program. Works were well organized and implemented at a
total cost of US$7.39 millon, 23X below appraisal estimates.
(11)  Improvement of Secondary Roads
1.03      Of the three secondary roads included for improvements under the
project, two (Rio Dulce-El Porvenir, 48 km; and Danli-Santa Maria, 43 km)



- 2 -
were completod wittin schedule In 19i4. The thlrd (Telice-San Francisco de
la Pa) experienced substantial delays almost from the start, due to the
contractor's tiancial weakaes.  finally, the contract was resc1nded in
1965, and the small amount of works renallnng were carrled out under the
*se procodures used for the constructlon of feeder rods: smll contracts
wlib leel cotractore and rented equipment. Works were finally completed
in November 1MC4. The lelay experienced by this project component required
the exteslon of the loan cloeing date from June 30, 1983 to June 30, 1986.
(111) Maintenace Prosra
(a) lro-srexent of eguiuent and spare marts
1.04      The project Included US$9.911/ milllon for the procurement nf
mal2tenance equipment. However, the need for equlpment to support the road
maintenance program was re-evaluated durlng project executlon and, as a
result, only US$5.72 was spent under this project category.
1.05      The purchase of spare parts for equipment rehabilltation and
workshops experienced conslderable delays, largely due to the Government's
ltngthy and cumbersome procedures. Procurement of spare parts for a total
of US$3.83 million was finally completed ln late 1985.
(b) Technlcal Assistance
1.06      The project included technical assistance for the Implementation
of a road malntenance management system for scheduling and controlling
SECOPT's annual program of auintenance activities. The Government retained
the same US consultant firm that assisted In developing the system under the
Seventh HiShway Project. During the course of their assignment, which was
completed in October 1984, the consultants refined and lmplemented the
system In all the maintenance districts. However, gains under the project
still need to be consolidated. The malntenance management system developed
by the consultants needs further adjustments to reflect existing
conditions. Additlonal technical assLstance in specific flelds such as
plannlng of saintenance activities In light of budgetary constraints, field
data collection to assess real productivity and costs of labor and equipment
and equipment monagement will be necessary to this end. Notwithstanding
SECUPT assurances that efforts in these flelds will continue, there is a
considerable rlsk that the galns made under the project might be eroded
because of staff changes and lack of funds for appropriate training. The
bank Is not financing a follow-on project. 2/
1.07      The same US consultant firm In charge of Implementing the
malntenance management system provided technical assistance for training
through both the Nechanical Training Production Unit (MPTU) and the Mobile
Road Training Production Unit (RTPU). Accomplishments ln training were
below original expectations. In the case of the MTPU, the main reason was
the shortage of workshop space, hand and machine tools, and the delay in the
supply of spare parts. These problems were largely overcome, however, when
tbe technifal assistance was reaching its final stage. Therefore, the bank
agreed to finance the extension of the services of the mechanical expert for
about one year. The KtTPU, since Its Inception, encountered difficulties and
delays because the equipment necessary for Its operation was not provided on
17The Borrover points out that the project Included US$10.01 million for equipment.
2/Please refer to the Borrower's coment on this point (Annex 2). The mention of a
follow-on project In the report was Intended to stress the fact that a lack of a
follow-on project increased the risks of loosing some of the gains made in Insti-
tution building under the subject project.

time and the RTPU had to depend upon the equipment borrowed from the
mlatenance districts. While ia general the quallty of the training
performd was good, Its Impact depended upon the willlngnoss or
possibilities of the districts to land their equipmat.
(iv)  Geeral Rark
1.08      Although the project encountered moderate problms durlng ita
ieplmntation, SECOPT wv  In general prompt to Identify and endeavor to
take remedlal actiona. tn particular, several measures vere taken to spced
up the procurement protes.  Thee measures, motly related to the
relationship of SECOPT and the Natlonal ?rocuremnat Office, required
decisions outside of SCOwT's control and were Implemented at a slover pace
than necessary to avoid the delays In procuremunt.
1.09      Table 1 presents a comparison of appralial estlmted and actual
project costs. As shown In the table, mot project components were
lsplemnted at costs below appraltal estimates, largely because of on
original overestimtion of costs. In the case of spare parts for equipment
rehabilitation and workshop equipment, the higher-than-expected cost was due
to purchaes In excess of those originally eavLsaged.
1:. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A.   Secondary Roads Improvement
2.01      The secondary roads improved under the project were justified at
the time of the appraisal on the basls of vehicle operating costs savings as
a result of upgrading their standards. The economic reevaluation was based
upon the same methodology than that used at appraisal. Table 2 presents a
summarized comparlson of the appralsal expected and actual traffic and costs
used in the analysis and the resulting economic returns. Tables 3 through
10 show the cost and benefit streams of each subproject as well as the
vehicle operating costs used In the economic reevaluation.
2.02      The ex-post evaluation confirms the economic mvrits of the
subprojects, Ilthough with economic returns below those orlginally
estlmated. The lower-than-expected returns can be mostly attrlbuted to a
decrease in the economic activity In Honduras, which in turm resulted in a
traffic growth below that estimated at appraisal. Traffic counts corried
out In 19b6 show AITs ranging from 102 to 362 below the appraisal forecast
for the same year. In the case of the tio. Dulce-E1 Porvenlr and the
Danli-Santa Maria subprojects, the reduction la benefits due to the ower
traffic was partially offset by a lower-than-appraisal estimatedjV ieal cost
of the works.
./The Borrower In its comments points out that we are dealing with final costs
and not estimated costs. However, the word "estimated" Iv this paragraph
refers to those costs estimated at the time of project appraisal.



D.   Fooder Roads ProEra.
2.03      At the tim of the appralsal, only a small part of the subprojects
to be Included aoder the foeder road lmprovement program were subject to an
economle evaluation. The romaining roads were to be defined In agreowent
with the Dank, using the methodology for economic evaluation developed for
the first group of roads. lach year, the Governmcnt presented to the Bank
the list of foeder roads to be constructed In the following year, Including
their final engieerlng and economic justification.
2.04      The ldentifleatlon of faedtr roads propoaed for Bank financing was
based upon a screenlng and ranking system that took Into account field data
for populatlon, road density and agricultural production and considers
econouic, distributlve and socio-polltical factors. Those roads passing the
screening test were subject to an economic *valuation In which the
quantifled benefits were; (i) producer surplus from Increased agricultural
production; (ll) cost savings to non-agricultural goods traffic; and
(Iii) tle savings for passerger traffic.
2.05      The economlc reevaluation was carrled out for a representative
road In each of the five agricultural valleys In which the feeder roads
program vas actually lplemented. These roads were not part cf the group
studied at appraisal. The ex-post economic analysis used basically the samq
methocoltoy developed at appraisal. However, for the purpose of this
report, only those benefits derived from an Increase In agricultural
prod"tct1on were considered. Notwithstanding this conservative estimation of
the benefits, the sample of roads studied confirmed the economic vlabillty
of the feeder roads program with economic rates of return ranging from 192
to 752.  Tables 11 through 13 give details of the economic analysis.
III. CONCLUSIONS
3.01      The project was successful In reaching its objectives of Improving
access to and from rural areas and of continulng the Institutional
Improvements undertaken under previous projects to strengthen highway
administration and maintenance. Most of the project components were
loplemented within the orlginal schedule and at a cost below appraisal
estimates.
3.02      The relative success of the Eighth Highway Project, especially
when compared wlth slLlar projects in the region, offers an opportunity for
Identifying the two main variables of the formula for positivQ results:
local authorities with a com_itsent toward project objectives and
institutlons lie the Bank with the willingness to establish a long-term
continuous relationship with a borrower.
3.03      Throughout the Bank's 22 years of uninterrupted association with
the Hlighway Sector of Honduras, a substantial amount of technical and
professional know-how has been transferred. While this contrlbution towards
the enhancement of human capital has not all reaianed In the public sector,



-5-
it has helped to increase the degree of professiondlils in the country. me
level of efficiency in project implementation, supervision and financial
control to sow estent can be attributed to this telationship.
3.04      Regarding the technical assistance lnoluded under the project, in
particular the implementation and operation of the road maintenance
management systes, substantial progress was made in strengthening the
planning and programing of maintenance activities. However, fiven the hith
staff turnover rate. the sustainability of the gains  under  the project i- 11
require a continuous Government effort (which is being done) to train new staff at
headquarters and to Improve the field data collection fed Into the system.
After the departure of the consultants, however, these efforts seem to have
wetkened.
3.05      The persistence and gradual improvement inherent in the successful
institution building process discussed in para 3.03 above, together with the
substantial risk attached to the sustainability of the gains under the road
maintenance component of this project provide an important lesson:
Development is usually the result of marginal changes that become evident
only after continuous efforts over relatively long periods. While it is
true that sometimes a substantial leap forward might be feasible, the Bank
should not encourage this type of approach unless there Is a reasonable
certainty of the ability of the Bank to continue its involvement until those
changes become fully embedded in the Institution. If that ls not the case,
the Bank and the Borrower should ruirain from considering substantial
investments in technical assistances designed in theory to produce a quantum
leap, but unlikely to produce results in the framework of only one or two
projects. As an alternative, less grandiose but long-term, gradual, and
continuous efforts for improving the existing system should be considered.
3.06      Another lesson to be learned from the project relates to the need
to realistically address, during project preparation, the optimal timing of
each of the components of the technical assistance. In the case of the
Eighth Highway Project, the arrival In Honduras of the Mechanical Expert
before the completion of the procurement of spare parts and tools necessary
to carry out his job, introduced the need to extend his services. This
additional expenditure could have been avoided through better timing of
*        project components.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HONDURAS
EIGHTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1901-HO)
IORROWER'S COMKENTS - UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION
Tegucigalpa, D.C. (12-4-87)
MR. GRANAM DONALSDON
CHIEF, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMAN RESOURCES
IT IS WITH PLEASURE THAT WE ATTEND TO YOUR REQUEST BY LETTER OF
NOVEMBER 6 OF THIS YEAR REGARDING THE COMPLETION REPORT OF THE EIGHTH
HIGHWAY PROJECT. FIRST, I WISH TO ESTABLISH THAT,OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE
EXPRESSION THE BANK DOES NOT PLAN TO FINANCE IN THE SHORT RUN A
COMPLEMENTARY PROJECT* REFERS SPECIFICALLY TO THE CONSULTING SERVICES TO
THIS SECRETARIAT.   IT IS OPPORTUNE TO REAFIRM TO YOU OUR INTEREST IN THE
EXECUTION OF NEW CIVIL WORK PROJECTS WITH THE FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION OF
THAT INSTITUTION.
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT OF THE EIGHTH LOAN, REPRESENTS
ONLY 7 PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL AMOUNT OF THE PROJECT AND ON THIS CONCEPT WE
OBSERVE THE CRITIC+AL COMENT OF THE REPORT. IN THIS SENSE, THE SECRETARIAT
OF COMMNICATIONS FEELS SATISFACTION FOR THE GOOD REAL RESULTS OBTAINED IN
THE REST OF THE PROJECT COMPONENTS.
FINALLY, WE REMIND YOU TO MODIFY: IN PAGE 1. PARAGRAPH 1.04 THE
VALUE OF US$10.01 MILLION FOR US$19.91 MILLION FOR ACQUISITION OF EQUIPMENT
AND SPARE PARTS FOR THE MAINTENANCE DIRECTORATE, AND IN PAGE 4, PARAGRAPH
2.02 IN THE LAST SENTENCE DELETE THE WORD *ESTIMATE BECAUSE THEY ARE FINAL
COSTS.
SINCERELY,
JUAN FERMA.NDO LOPEZ
MINISTER - SECOPT
