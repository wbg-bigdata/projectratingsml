APPRAISAL OF
FERTILIZER SECTOR LOAN
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Since 1979 Yugoslavia, like many other middle-income countries, has
experienced serious economic turmoil 1/. Severe domestic inflation continued
to threaten the economy, rising from 22% in 1979 to 40% in 1982 and reaching a
new high of about 55% in 1983. Industrial and agricultural production have
declined. Industrial output, which recorded a growth rate of 8.2% in 1979,
fell to 4.1% in 1980 and 1981 and was estimated at only 0.4% in 1982.
Agricultural performance is reviewed in paragraphs 2.03-2.06. Merchandise
exports recorded a drop of 5.6% in 1982. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at
a rate of 2.2% in 1980, compared to 4.2% in 1979. It is estimated that GDP
grew by only 0.8% in 1982. The international debt, in convertible currency,
reached $19.0 billion. Principal repayments on medium and long-term debt, due
in 1982, were estimated at $1.9 billion. In addition, short-term debts also
equaled this amount by the end of 1982. The deteriorating economic situation
caused the Government to introduce a series of stabilization measures; 2/
investment and imports have been sharply curtailed through restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies. Fixed investment, which grew at an average rate
of 9.5% between 1975 and 1979, declined by 6.0% per year in 1979-82.
Merchandise imports were cut by about 10% in 1980 and a further 12.3% in
1981. The volume of merchandise imports fell by a further 10.6% in 1982. Any
shortfall in the export targets is compensated by a reduction in imports;
trade movements are now being monitored on a monthly basis and any divergences
from the targets have to be made good in the following month.
1.02     Yugoslavia's stabilization efforts have been complicated by adverse
developments in the international capital markets. An increase in
international interest rates since 1979 has caused interest repayments to rise
from $0.8 billion in 1979 to $2.0 billion in 1982. The overall economic
situation has eroded the confidence of the international financial community
and thus the country's access to international commercial bank credit has been
significantly reduced. Durin,g 1982, medium and long-term credits to

Perspectives." - IBRD, Report No. 3954-YU and "Structural Adjustment Loan"
IBRD, Report No. P-3606-YU.
2/  A high-level body of Yugoslav policy-makers and academics, known as the
"Commission on Economic Stabilization", was formed in the second half of
1981 to prepare a comprethensive blueprint for reform in a wide variety of
subject areas.  The Commission issued a series of working papers over the
course of 1982 and the final report is issued. The term "stabilization"
is used rather broadly in Yugoslavia to denote an overall policy of
balanced development, rather than just the achievement of internal and
external macro-economic balance.



-2-
Yugoslavia declined to about $2.0 billion, cormpared with $4.2 billion in
1980. Short-term capital outflows placed further pressure on the balance of
payments. The Government, in the second half of 1982, experienced mounting
external liquidity difficulties. By the beginning of 1983, total foreign
exchange reserves were $1.7 billion, or one month's imports from the
convertible areas. External resources remained approximately unchanged in the
first half of 1983. Imports have, consequently, been further tightened. To
ease the foreign exchange problems, the Goverament requested the assistance of
the Bank and other donors. In response, the Bank, in June 1983, approved a
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) of $275 million to assist the country in its
foreign exchange problems and in its attempt to overcome structural
deficiencies in economic management.
1.03     The lack of availability of foreign exchange and tightening of
imports seriously affected the Yugoslav fertilizer industry, which relies
heavily on imported raw materials. Of the total production value of
fertilizer, imports represent about 40%; of this 60% are from the convertible
currency areas. In 1982, due to foreign exchange constraints, the planned
target of 2.8 million tons of fertilizer production was not achieved; only
about 2.6 million tons were actually produced. Similarly in 1983, a
production of 3.1 million tons of fertilizer was planned; this was
subsequently revised downward to 2.8 million tons; in fact, in the end, only
about 2.6 million tons were produced, or the same as in 1982. The lack of
adequate fertilizer has adversely affected agricultural production, in
particular grain, resulting in a decline of agricultural exports as well as
necessitating grain imports, thereby further exacerbating the balance of
payments problems. Inadequate domestic availability of fertilizer, coupled
with the imbalanced distribution of fertilizer in the domestic market, has
contributed significantly to the poor performance of the agricultural sector
(para 2.03). At the same time, the fertilizer industry, in particular ammonia
plants, due to outdated technology (high energy consumption) is not fully
competitive and appears to need modernization/rehabilitation. However, before
such a plan of action could be developed, detailed energy audits and technical
studies would be required to determine technicalL and economic viability and to
place the industry on a sound footing.
1.04     In view of this, the Government requested the Bank to provide
financial assistance to the fertilizer sub-sector. The Bank, recognizing the
critical importance of fertilizer for the revival of agriculture and, in turn,
the economy as a whole, sent a Review Mission in October 1982, followed by a
pre-appraisal mission in January 1983. A comprehensive Project Brief
examining the sub-sector's structural issues was prepared and recommended a
future course of action. This appraisal report is based on the findings of an
appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. S. Bbatia (Mission Leader), R. Heath,
H. Aomatsu and F. Anderson (Consultant) which visited Yugoslavia from May
8-27, 1983. Mr. J. Ingram (Programs) and Ms. N. Lichtenstein (Legal) also
participated. However due to policy considerations, a longer deliberation
period than usual was required in the country, resulting in follow-up missions
and a delay in loan negotiation.



-3-
1.05     The proposed Sector Loan (SL), to be made under the Special Action
Program for Yugoslavia, would provide the foreign exchange for imports of raw
materials and spare parts to iincrease the domestic availability of fertilizer
for 1984 (Fall) and 1985 (Spring and Fall). 1/ The SL would address policy
and institutional issues of domestic distribution, and assist the Government
in the long-term modernization and rehabilitation of the domestic fertilizer
industry, through the financing of technical studies. This would thus form an
integral part of the Government's on-going Fertilizer Development Plan
(1981-1985). The SL would be the first of its type in Yugoslavia dealing with
a critical sub-sector nationwide and attempting to overcome the structural
problems of the sector, both from the long and short-term points of view. The
SL, by increasing domestic fertilizer availability, would assist the
Government in its major objective of raising grain production and thereby
assist the balance of payments situation and on-going stabilization efforts.
II. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Role and Performance
2.01     The Agricultural Sector, in spite of its declining share of
Yugoslavia's social product ia the post-War period, remains critical in
overall economic development. It contributes about 12% of social product and
employs about 30% of the country's active population, primarily in rural areas
where few alternative gainful employment opportunities exist. This section of
the rural population, with a per capita income of under $850 per annum, is in
the relative poverty target group. Agriculture contributes income for one
third of the total population. In addition, agricultural exports constitute
an important source of foreign exchange for the country (contributing about
12% of total exports). In 1983, it was planned that agricultural exports
would contribute about $1.0 billion; this target was not achieved due to the
general decline in international prices for agricultural products. Moreover,
about 2/3 of Yugoslavia's agricultural exports took place under barter deals.
However, the country has a large agricultural reserve base and favorable
climatic conditions, providing essential ingredients for a rapid growth of the
sector, with a significant potential to contribute in overall economic
development.
2.02     Agricultural production is undertaken by three groups - the Social
Sector, 2/ the Cooperatives 21 and the Non-Contracting Individual (NCI)
farmers. The Social Sector consists of Agrokombinats which own their land and
operate on a large scale (an average of 800-1,200 ha) with modern,
capital-intensive facilities and well-trained staff. However, the Social
Sector, in general, is neither noted for its dynamic commercial organization
nor its efficiency. Agrokombinats, in addition to cultivating their own land,
provide credit, inputs and other assistance to those individual farmers who
enter into contracts with them for the sale of their products. The
Cooperatives, known as "zadrugas", are basically associations of individual

production of wheat and mlaize. The fertilizer for these two crops is
applied in Spring and Fall. The Spring application generally takes place
mid-February to mid-March and the Fall application end-October to
mid-December.

farmers and are managed by elected officials. Members, in fact, have very
little say in the management of the Cooperatives (para 2.08). While retaining
the rights to their land, members receive credit, agricultural inputs and
technical assistance. In return, farmers must sign an agreement to sell their
produce to the Cooperatives which market it to the Social Sector and to other
Government enterprises (flour mills, etc.). Variations exist in the types of
association contracts. Some farmers have long-term contracts, while others
may have short-term contracts covering the production and marketing of only
one or more crops. The major feature of all these contracts (with
Agrokombinats or Cooperatives) is that repayment of credit, inputs, etc.
should be made in agricultural produce, in order to control the marketable
surplus (para 3.12). NCI farmers are those who are in no way associated with
either the Social or Cooperative Sectors in the production or marketing of
their produce. The distribution of total arable land between these three
groups and their contribution in agricultural production are discussed in
paras 2.08 to 2.12.
2.03     A review of the agricultural sector performance in Five-Year Plan
periods, commencing in 1961, indicates that the agricultural sector failed to
achieve its planned target growth rates, although these were realistic.

Agricultural production grew slower than the demand for food products,
resulting in increased imports, particularly of wheat, oil crops, protein
nutrients, etc. The major reason for this is the Government's over-reliance
on a Social Sector suffering from poor management and often inappropriate
investment choices, while ignoring the potential of the Individual Sector.
This attitude influenced the Government's policy for both investment and input
supply, favoring the Social Sector. The causes of the Plan's failures have
been examined in detail by a group of Yugoslav experts, which was commissioned
to analyze the long-term program for agricultural sector development, as a
part of the Economic Stabilization Program. Their report (hereafter referred
to as "the Yugoslav Agricultural Stabilization Report") states that
"appropriate economic and social preconditions were not created" and that the
agrarian policy was not responsive. 1/

1976-80
2.04     In the last Plan period, 1976-80, agriculture grew by 2% per annum,
against a planned growth of 4%. Crop production was virtually stagnant; a
growth rate of only 0.4% was recorded, compared to a projected 5%. More
important, the performance disparity between the Social and Individual sectors
was clearly evident, particularly taking into consideration the fact that the
individual farmers own a substantial share of the total arable land (para
2.08).

Agricultural exports declined and their share in total export earnings dropped
from 13% in 1976 to 10.6% in 1980. At the same time, agricultural imports
increased from 0.6 million tons in 1977 to about 1.4 million tons in 1980,
with wheat and animal feed accounting for 90% of imports. This further
accentuated the balance of payment problems.
1981-85
2.05     The 1981-85 Plan for the agricultural sector pursues fundamentally
the same objectives as the preceding Plan. Specifically, emphasis is placed
on increasing primary production to meet domestic demand, thus reducing
imports, particularly of wheat, and expanding agricultural exports to ease the
critical balance of payments situation. Intensive cultivation of currently
unused and abandoned lands through land reclamation work and Social Sector
purchase is emphasized. Agricultural output is planned to grow at an annual
rate of 4.5% (Social and Individual sectors at 6% and 4% respectively).
Agricultural exports are projected to grow at an annual rate of 10% and
imports to fall to 5%. To achieve these objectives, the Plan provides for
investment equal to 9.6% of total production investment in the Social Sector.
Overall, the Plan, assessed against past performance, and with minimal change
in the policy framework, represents a relatively optimistic view of
agricultural production possibilities. 1/

approach including targets; will be reflected in the Gray Cover version.



-6-
2.06     The 1981 agricultural performance was dismal - production increased
by only 1% over 1980, inclement weather being cited as the major cause. A
healthy recovery was recorded in 1982 - total agricultural production
increased by about 6% over 1981; however a shortfall in basic food items,
particularly wheat, continued. Exports did not show any improvement. In
1983, preliminary estimates indicate that grain production fell short of the
planned targets; the country has already announced 1.4 million tons of
agricultural imports, wheat being the major item.  In the meantime, due to
economic problems and the stabilization program (para 1.01), the targets for
the 1984-85 period are being revised downward. The above Plan performance
review indicates that the sector is constrained by structural deficiencies
which preclude the realization of its potential. Without basic corrections,
sector performance will continue to pose problems.
B. Structural Issues
2.07     The Bank, together with the Government of Yugoslavia, is undertaking
a comprehensive review of the agricultural sector. The results are expected
to be available by the middle of 1984. The only factors which have been
examined here are those which directly affect the fertilizer sub-sector and
grain production - the main areas of concern of the proposed Loan. With this
in mind, the major issues are examined below.
Production Organization/Policies
2.08     The Government's stated policy is to integrate all individual farmers
into the socialized production system 1/ in order to organize agricultural
production more efficiently. However such integration has not progressed as
planned. At the end of 1982, of total arable land, the Social Sector occupied
about 19% 2/, the Cooperatives about 36% 2/ arLd the NCI farmers about 45%. A
detailed breakdown by Republics and Provinces is given in Annex 1. The
Federal Chamber of Economy (FCE) and the National Association of Cooperatives
estimate that out of 2.6 million farm families in Yugoslavia, about 1.1 to 1.2
million families (45%) are still classified as NCI farmers. The distribution
of land owned by such farmers, in different Republics and Provinces, varies.
For example, in the Socialist Republics (SR) of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia,
Montenegro and the Socialist Autonomous Province (SAP) of Kosovo, the NCI
farmers own between 50-80% of total arable land, while in Slovenia and
Vojvodina, this percentage is only 10% and 15%, respectively (Annex 1).  The
land distribution pattern for the country as a whole has remained basically

the development of farmers' Cooperatives and associating, taking into
account various forms of cooperative collaboration of farmers' personal
work with the Social Sector." - Long-Term Programme of Agro-industrial
Production, Report of the Commission of Federal Social Advisors for
Economic Stabilization Problems; Belgrade, 1983, p. 6, para 3.2.

Cooperative Sectors also include those individual farmers who have chosen
to associate themselves by means of production and/or marketing contracts.

unchanged for the past decade. The Yugoslavia Agricultural Stabilization
Report, examining the causes for the slow integration, concludes that the
progress in socialization of individual farmers is "stagnant", due to the lack
of appropriate economic incentives to the individual farmers, as well as an
inept and inert management of Cooperatives. 1/
Input Distribution
2.09     At present, the Government relies for agricultural input distribution
(fertilizer, credit, etc.) on Agrokombinats, Cooperatives and to a minor
extent on the Trading Agencies. This leads to a discriminatory policy
favoring the Social and Cooperative sectors particularly in times of input
shortage. Agrokombinats, in spite of giving the impression that they are
oriented towards the social and economic betterment of the total farming
population, act basically like a private monopoly. Their input distribution
actions are primarily guided by their interests as producers. In view of
this, other producers are simply considered as their competitors and
Agrokombinats/Cooperatives have naturally very little interest in assisting
those who will not contribute to their goals. Thus, there is an inherent
conceptual problem with the present distribution policy.
210     This is clearly evident in the case of fertilizer distribution and
consumption. Between 1977-1981, of the total domestic fertilizer
distribution, about 35% was consumed by the Social Sector, 60% by Cooperatives
and the residual (5%) by NCI farmers (para 3.06). As of the beginning of
1983, due to fertilizer shortages, there has been a practice of not making
fertilizer available to those farmers who are not associated with the Social
or Cooperative Sectors (para 3.10). This distribution/consumption pattern has
very little relationship either with the actual land ownership as shown in
para 2.08 , or with contribution to total grain prodiction. The Social and
Cooperative Sectors together produce about 60% of total wheat and 40% of total
maize production. The remainder, a substantial percentage, is contributed by
NCI farmers.
2.11     Similarly, no formal credit and very little technical guidance is
available to the NCI farmer. His association with the Social or Cooperative
Sectors alone renders him eligible for credit consideration. There are
modern, well-equipped and well-staffed agricultural research institutes in
each Republic/Province; however, since these are financed by Agrokombinats and
Cooperatives, attention is paid mainly to Social Sector needs. For example,
at present in Yugoslavia, only the Social Sector's soils are analyzed on a
regular and scientific basis. An overall review/modification of the
production organization and policies, input delivery and technical assistance
system is an appropriate focus of future projects (proposed Montenegro
Regional Development Project) and of the proposed SAL II.
1/ "... the self-management r;ights provided by the Constitution and
Associated Labor Act were not used in order to support their economic and
social interest for higher production results and farmers cooperative
development. On the contrary, those rights were often and vehemently
usurped." - Long-Term Programme of Agro-industrial Production, Report of
the Commission of Federal Social Advisors for Economic Stabilization
Problems; Belgrade, 1983, p.7.



-8-
2.12     Thus the Government's present policy, which effectively excludes NCI
farmers from formal access to credit and inputs is, in fact, hindering
realization of the full potential of agricultural production. In no way does
it appear to contribute to the Government's critical on-going stabilization
program. In view of this, at least in the short run, the agricultural input
distribution policy, particularly for fertilizer, should be re-oriented to
meet present economic needs (para 7.05). This assessment is clearly
recognized by the Yugoslav Agricultural Stabilization Report which concludes
that:
"Even to unassociated farmers, it is necessary to create economic
conditions to produce more, acquire higher incomes, produce more for
the market and to be stimulated by the economic policy to associate
with the aim to be more rational in business doing, market approach
and inclusion into the mechanism of self-management system." 1/
III. FERTILIZER SUB-SECTOR
A.  Plan Performance
Planning/Organizations
3.01     For each Five-Year Plan period a comprehensive, detailed Fertilizer
Production/Consumption Plan is prepared; such Plans are broken down by
Republics and Provinces, by sectors (Social and Individual), by crops and by
Spring and Fall applications. The 1983-85 Consumption Plan (excerpted from
the 1981-85 Plan) is presented in Annex 2. Detailed Plan preparation is
undertaken by the FCE, in close cooperation and association with the
Republican/Provincial Committee for Agriculture, the Association of
Cooperatives and Agrohemija (a business community representing 11 fertilizer
companies in Yugoslavia). Plans are reviewed every year, again in detail, and
are adjusted in light of needs and circumstances. The FCE, established under
the new Constitution and Associated Labor Act, has counterparts at the
Republican, Provincial and regional levels. The Republican Chambers of
Economy have offices at Regional and Commune levels which, in association with
the fertilizer users, namely the Social Sector (Agrokombinats) and
Cooperatives, assess fertilizer needs and prepare a Plan for their region. In
theory, in preparing such a Plan, the requirements of all agricultural users,
including NCI farmers, should be taken into account. However in reality, due
to the lack of active communication between Planners and NCI farmers, the
latter's needs are not adequately reflected.
3.02     Regional plans are forwarded to the Republican Chamber of Economy,
where they are reviewed by the Republican authorities and agencies - the
Committee for Agriculture, the Secretariat for Markets and General Economics,
the Association of Cooperatives and the Trading Organizations responsible for
fertilizer distribution for the Republic. After the plan has been approved by
the Republican authorities, it is forwarded to the FCE in Belgrade, where the

Commission of Federal Social Advisors for Economic Stabilization Problems,
Belgrade, 1983, p. 31.

plans are collated. The plans are reviewed and finalized at the Federal level
by the Federal authorities and agencies - the Committee for Agriculture, the
Secretariat for Markets and General Economics, the National Association of
Cooperatives and Agrohemija.
Monitoring
3.03     Once a fertilizer plan has been finalized, its implementation is
monitored very closely. The Regional Chamber of Economy is primarily
responsible for following and monitoring its implementation. A weekly report
is prepared by them, outlining the achievement of the planned targets
(percentage of fertilizer received and its distribution by farm location and
application by crops, etc.) and this is sent to the Republican Chamber of
Economy which collates the information and prepares a monthly report for the
Republic/Province as a whole. Copies of such reports are forwarded to the
Republican and Federal authorities. Inspectors from the Committee of
Agriculture and the Secretariat for Marketing and General Economics visit the
Regional offices and ensure that correct reporting is undertaken by the
Regional Chamber of Economy. In short, the present arrangements for the
monitoring of plan implementation are comprehensive and satisfactory.
Fertilizer Plan Performance
3.04     The current 1981-85 Fertilizer Production Plan has, in its first two
years, failed to achieve its planned targets, mainly due to foreign exchange
constraints in importing raw materials for fertilizer production. For
example, in 1982 the production target was 2.8 million tons. In fact, only
2.6 million tons were produced. Similarly in 1983, only about 2.6 million
tons of fertilizer were produced against a Plan target of 3.1 million tons.
3.05     According to the Plan, in 1984 and 1985, domestic fertilizer
production is expected to be about 3.8 million tons and 4.0 million tons
respectively. Detailed breakdowns, by types of fertilizer, are given below:
Fertilizer Production

Total Production                       3,847          4,041
Source: Agrohemija, Belgrade, 1983.
However, it should be noted thiat, as mentioned earlier, due to the
Stabilization Program, all plans, at present, are being reviewed and
adjusted. It is now planned that in 1984 and 1985, domestic fertilizer
production will increase by 15% annually over the actual 1983 figure
(2.6 million tons), i.e. 3.0 mtillion tons in 1984 and 3.45 million tons in
1985. This appears realistic and is also in line with the country's
absorptive capacity (para 5.04).



-10-
B. Consumption
3.06     Between 1977-81, domestic consumption recorded an annual increase of
about 3% per year. Of total fertilizer consumption, it should be noted that
85% is consumed by the SR of Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the SAP of
Vojvodina, the major grain producers in the country. More important is that
while overall fertilizer consumption in the Social and Cooperative Sectors
increased, the quantities available for the NCI farmers, in the country as a
whole, in fact declined from 243,000 tons in 1977 to 93,000 tons in 1981. In
1982, a very insignificant quantity (about 50,000 tons) of fertilizer was made
available to them.

This has resulted from the shortage of fertilizer available in the country as
well as from the complete control of domestic fertilizer marketing and
distribution by the Social Sector (paras 3.11 to 3.14). The Social Sector has
first call and is under few economic constraints in fertilizer application.
As a result it has passed the peak of the response curve, while NCI farmers
lag far behind, resulting in significant yield differentials. A detailed
breakdown is given in Annex 3 and summarized below:

3.07     It is generally agreed in Yugoslavia that additional application of
fertilizer in the Social Sector would not result in increased production of
grain. In fact present application rates are sufficient to produce even
higher yields than are attained at present. For example in the Social Sector
in Croatia and Vojvodina, about 260 kg of fertilizer per ha (in active
nutrients) is applied for maize, providing a yield of 6.5-6.9 tons/ha. With
the same chernozem soil conditions that exist in these areas, a similar
fertilizer application in the U.S. would provide a maize yield of 7.5
tons/ha. In short, it appears that fertility is not the limiting factor in
crop yields in the Social Sector.l/ Rather, restraint in the use of
fertilizer in the Social Sector would be more appropriate and economic.
3.08     Although the Cooperative Sector consumes about 60% of the total
fertilizer available for the domestic market, its application rates are below
the Social Sector. This is also reflected in present yields. Additional
fertilizer would provide some small increase in yields.
3.09     The largest potential increase from additional fertilizer application
would be from the NCI farmers, since their present fertilizer application
rates are significantly lower. It should be noted that hybrid maize and wheat
varieties are now available to the NCI farmers on a cash basis through
research institutes at the local level and, therefore, the constraint on

years has to be found in the neglect of crop rotation system." Long-Term

yields does not appear the result of seed quality, but rather of soil
fertility. Both scientists and planners in Yugoslavia, based on past
experience, believe that if adequate fertilizer were available, the NCI
farmers could double present yields in crops presently suffering from nutrient
deficiencies. Thus, the critical role of increased fertilizer use by the NCI
farmers requires special recognition at the policy level during the present
period of economic stabilization since this represents a low-cost,
quick-yielding means of increasing output - the major objective of the
Stabilization Program.
3.10     Government officials have indicated that, due to the shortage of
fertilizer in the country, it has been necessary to suspend the past practice
of providing residual fertilizer to NCI farmers (para 3.14); fertilizer is
generally made available only to the Social and Cooperative Sectors and to the
individual farmers who are associated with those sectors. However, failure to
provide fertilizer to the NCI farmers will have serious implications on grain
production (para 7.05) and, in turn, on the Stabilization Program (para 7.06).
C. Marketing/Distribution
3.11     Fertilizer distribution is completely controlled by the Social Sector
- the major channels being Agrokombinats and Trading Agencies, with the former
playing the dominant role. Fertilizer plants market their production, at a
Government fixed price (paras 4.17 and 4.18), directly to Agrokombinats, which
usually have some financial interest in these plants. The Agrokombinats act
as wholesalers for a specified geographical area. In the contracts between
the Agrokombinats and the fertilizer plants, quantity, types and delivery time
are specified. Agrokombinats are responsible for transportation from these
plants. Most of the fertilizer is transported in bulk form and is shipped
directly to the Cooperatives or Agrokombinat farms, where it is either applied
directly to the fields or bagged and sold to contractual farmers.
Agrokombinats charge a 2% margin for Cooperatives and contractual farmers.
Cooperatives, in turn, distribute it to their members, at a margin of 4%,
through their village shops, which market agricultural inputs, implements and
fertilizer. Total marketing and distribution costs, including transportation,
at present constitute about 17% of the retail price, which is reasonable.
3.12     Those farmers who enter into contracts receive fertilizer from the
Cooperative village shops or from Agrokombinats' organizations dealing with
contractual farmers. Farmers generally receive fertilizer on credit and are
obliged to repay in the form of agricultural produce. Before obtaining the
fertilizer, the farmers sign a printed form which frequently states only the
quantity of fertilizer or other inputs received. Often, no mention is made of
the value of the inputs received or the detailed terms and conditions of
repayment. Thus the farmers are not aware of the prices of the fertilizer or
the amount to be repaid to the Social/Cooperative Sectors. This type of
ambiguity tends to cause confusion, can lead to unfair terms and act as a



-13-
deterrent to farmers to enter into such contracts. 1J The existing printed
forms, if more comprehensively filled out, could resolve this issue and the
additional information would prove beneficial to both the Social and
Cooperative Sectors as well as to the individual farmers. The Federal
Government has indicated its willingness, within the limits of its authority,
to enforce this.
3.13     There are 29 major Trading Agencies spanning the country and involved
in the distribution and marketing of agricultural inputs. These agencies
operate more than 1,700 retail shops, most with their own storage facilities,
located in communes (on average 5-6 villages constitute a single commune).
Annex 4 lists the names and the geographical coverage of Trading Agencies and
the number of retail shops owned by each of them. Until 1982, these Trading
Agencies acted as wholesalers and retailers in the domestic marketing of
fertilizer, i.e. the Trading Agencies procured a portion of fertilizer from
the plants and channeled it in a wholesale capacity to Agrokombinats and
Cooperatives, which, in turn, distributed it to their members, after having
met their own requirements. A certain quantity of the total handled by the
Trading Agencies was sold on a cash basis, without obligation, to individual
(generally NCI) farmers by retail shops. For such cash sales, triplicate
receipts were prepared - one for the customer, one for the shop's records and
one was forwarded to the Trading Agency's headquarters. Based on such
receipts, monitoring could be readily undertaken to determine the fertilizer
quantity sold to NCI farmers with no new mechanism or system required (para
6.14). In addition, based on the Mission's examination, it appears that the
distribution cost of fertilizer through the Trading Agencies' retail shops is
somewhat lower than the prices charged by Agrokombinats and Cooperatives to
their members, since the latter organizations must cover the distribution cost
to villages, whereas the Trading Agencies, located in Communes, are not faced
with such delivery costs. Farmers transport fertilizer purchased at retail
shops by their own means (generally tractors).
3.14     However, as of 1982, sales of fertilizer through retail shops ceased
(para 3.10). The Trading Agencies have continued to act as wholesalers only -
distributing fertilizer to the! Agrokombinats and Cooperatives. The retail
shops market other agricultural inputs and small tools to farmers, excluding
fertilizer. Thus a comprehensive marketing infrastructure and system does
exist in Yugoslavia to handle fertilizer marketing to all segments of
agricultural producers, includling NCI farmers. However, to meet the needs of
the latter, a policy change and an increase in domestic fertilizer
availability are reouired (para 7.02).

IV. FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A. Industrial Sector
4.01     The industrial sector of Yugoslavia has been the leading sector in
the country's economic growth, and has played an important role in capital
formation of the economy as well as in foreign trade. While Yugoslavia's
Gross Material Product (GMP) grew at an annual rate of 5.8% between 1970 and
1980, the industrial sector grew at an annual rate of 7.3% during the same
period. In 1980, industry accounted for 39% of GMP, about 40% of fixed assets
investment, over 90% of merchandise trade, and one third of the labor force.
After decades of rapid growth, the industrial sector is well diversified, and
produces a wide range of capital, intermediate and consumer goods. The
country, utilizing sizable domestic energy and mineral resou-ces, has also
developed a number of important basic processing and extractive industries.
The industrial sector is to play a central role in the process of external
adjustment called for in the 1981-85 Plan. The strategy of import
substitution of the last Plan continues to be pursued, with increased emphasis
on import-substitution in capital goods. The Plan, however, puts a much
stronger stress on export-orientation. There is also to be an emphasis on
rationalization and greater efficiency of investment planning, implementation,
and completion of on-going projects. Energy, basic metals, minerals and basic
chemicals (including fertilizer), capital goods and exports have been
designated as priority activities for industrial investment.
B. Fertilizer Producers
4.02     There are 11 fertilizer producing enterprises located in five
Republics and two Autonomous Provinces. Production plants/units are organized
into a Basic Organization of Associated Labor (BOAL).l/ Several BOALs
together constitute a Work Organization (WO). In turn, they are part of a
Composite Organization of Associated Labor (COAL) which also deals in other
economic activities (oil refinery, petrochemicals and metal refining). The
locations of fertilizer producing enterprises are shown in the Map (IBRD
No. 17368). Many of these facilities were constructed 15-20 years ago.
Details of installed capacity, technology used, etc. are given in Annex 5,
Tables l(a) and (b) and are summarized in the following Table on page 15.
l/ Decision-making at all levels is governed by the principle of workers'
self-management, involving a unique set of institutions and instruments of
economic policy. The current system has evolved over the years with major
changes introduced through the Constitution of 1974.

4.03     As can be seen from the Table, HIP Pancevo and INA Petrochemija are
the two major nitrogenous fertilizer producers, accounting for 94% of the
total ammonia production capacity of Yugoslavia. IHP Prahavo and Zorka Sabac
are the major phosphatic fertilizer producers, accounting for 67% of the total
phosphoric acid production capacity of the country. When the planned new
phosphoric acid and related MAP and NPK facilities of INA Petrochemija are
completed, INA will become another major phosphatic fertilizer producer,
accounting for 25% of the future total capacity of the country.
C. Fertilizer Production and Capacity
4.04     Historically, Yugoslav nitrogen production has relied substantially
on imports of ammonia, nitrogen solutions (ammonium nitrate plus ammonia), and
ammonium sulphate for further processing into calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
and NPK fertilizers to supplement local nitrogen production. Details of
nitrogenous fertilizer production, imports and exports of intermediaries and
finished products are given in Annex 5, Table 2. In brief, between 1975-82,
despite yearly fluctuations, the production of nitrogen (active nutrient)
recorded an increase. During the same period, Yugoslavia imported about 28%
of primary nitrogen requirements, principally a[mmonia (57% of the total),
nitrogen solutions (ammonia plus ammonium nitraste in water) and ammonium
sulphate. In many instances, in the same year Yugoslavia has both imported
and exported finished nitrogenous fertilizer products, such as urea and CAN.
However, on balance, during the period under review, the country has been a
net importer of urea (25% of urea production) and a net exporter of NPK (16%
of NPK production).
4.05     Of the total existing capacity of 608,000 tons of nitrogen of
finished products (CAN, urea, and NPK/MAP), approximately 177,000 tons of
nitrogen production is based on imported intermediaries. The facilities under
construction would more than double current domestic ammonia production
capacity from 457,000 tons to 1,080,000 tons of nitrogen and finished
nitrogenous fertilizer production capacity from 609,000 tons to 1,186,000 tons
by 1987. This would still leave a deficit of some 105,000 tons of primary
nitrogen, to be obtained through imports in order to operate the processing
facilities at designed throughput. It is also estimated that while CAN, at
present accounts for about 44% of nitrogenous materials 11, its share will
decline to 32% by 1987 and urea will become the major (38%) nitrogenous
finished fertilizer and NPK fertilizers will form about 30%.
4.06     Present primary phosphates production capacity is 546,000 tpy
P205 2/ against a finished NPK processing capacity of 314,000 tons tpy
P205. With the completion of the facilities under construction at INA and
Subotica, and the reconstruction of a phosphoric acid plant at Prahavo by
1985, primary phosphate production capacity would increase to
1/ At present, nitrogen in NPK accounts for about 41% with the remaining 15%
accounted for by urea.
2/ Includes straight phosphate fertilizers.



- 17 -
856,000 tpy P205 against a finished processing capacity of 519,000 tpy
P205. The apparent imbalance between primary and finished phosphate
production capacities is due to exports of both SSP (to the USSR) and TSP, the
operation of NPK facilities at considerably higher than nominal capacity, and
the non-fertilizer uses of phosphoric acid. Although SSP was formerly
important for direct application, its use, since the early 1960's, has
declined and has generally been replaced by NPK blends, which also provide for
all potash applications. Details of phosphatic fertilizer production and net
exports are given in Annex 5. Table 3.
D. Capacity Utilization
4.07     Capacity utilization for ammonia and nitrogen processing plants,
compare favorably with international industry standards. Capacity utilization
at INA and Azotara Lukovac is better than the industry's average of 90%. The
capacity utilization at Pancevo since 1971 has averaged 83%.  The major
reasons for the relatively marginal performance have been process design
faults and mechanical problems with the centrifugal compressors that limit
their reliability and performance. Similar problems with the same plant
design have been common in the industry. Capacity utilization for the
phosphoric acid industry has ranged, since 1970, from a low of 30% to a high
of 88% as against an expected industry norm of 90%. Capacity utilization over
the period 1970-81 has averaged approximately 75%. The major reason for this
low figure has been problems at the Trepca Mitrovica plant stemming from the
selection of an unproven process and lack of financial resources to rectify
process design defects that became apparent during initial operation. The
recent poor start-up performance of the Tito Veles plant in Macedonia has been
due to the relative inexperience of this new company and shortages of foreign
exchange for the commissioning phase of operation during 1980, 1981 and 1982.
Plant operation and maintenance is generally of a high standard, particularly
in the larger companies, and, except as noted, the technology used is
appropriate.
E. Raw Materials
4.08     All of Yugoslavia's ammonia plants, including those under
construction, with the exception of Lukovac and Obilic, are based on natural
gas, the most efficient and economic raw material for nitrogenous fertilizer
production. The original ammonia plants (HIP and INA) were based on nearby
domestic gas fields but, due to nationally increased gas consumption, which
now exceeds domestic sources, the increased gas requirements arising from the
expansion plants of HIP and INA will be supplied by gas from the USSR.
Domestic natural gas has been sold to ammonia producers at prices
substantially lower (50-80%) than those for imported gas, which are
essentially at international fuel oil price parity costs. However, under SAL,
the Government has agreed to increase domestic gas prices to world market
price levels over the next several years.
4.09     The impetus for development of the phosphatic fertilizer industry has
been the availability of sulphuric acid (required for SSP and phosphoric acid
production) as a by-product from smelting of local ores (sulphide of copper,
zinc and lead). Iron pyrites, a by-product of non-ferrous metals operations,
is also used to produce sulphuric acid. As a result, phosphate fertilizers
are produced close to smelters, located at Bor in Serbia, Trepca in Kosovo and



- 18 -
Titov Velas in Macedonia. The one exception is the new INA plant in Croatia,
which is based on imported sulphur. There are no commercial phosphate rock or
potash deposits in Yugoslavia; all requirements are imported.
F. Structure of the i[ndustry
4.10     Fertilizer producers are structured strongly along regional lines
with the development of capacity initiated by the needs of the
Republic/Province in which the enterprise is located. The producers within
each region have strong links with Agrokombinats or Cooperatives through
long-term agreements under which most of the fertilizer for domestic
consumption is sold. As a result, Agrokombinats often provide long-term
financing for capacity expansion, necessary foreign exchange, and on occasion,
even payments to offset losses of the fertilizer enterprises. Due to
marketing agreements with Agrokombinats, the fertilizer producers do not have
their own sales, marketing and distribution setup; and do not provide even
rudimentary extension services.
4.11     The regional basis for capacity development has worked quite well for
regions with access to regional raw materials (Croatia, Vojvodina, and Serbia
for natural gas; Serbia and Vojvodina for sulphuric acid). However, in other
areas the desire for regional self-sufficiency has tended to distort
development; i.e. construction of small uneconomically sized phosphoric acid
units in Kosovo and Macedonia, high cost coal-gasification based ammonia
production in Kosovo, and the recent construction of imported sulphur-based
phosphoric acid capacity by INA in Croatia. The promotion of national rather
than regional priorities is one of the major functions of Agrohemija, the
Business Community of Fertilizer Producers. However, while Agrohemija carries
out useful work in investigating technical problems, coordinating imports and
exports, and as a channel for communication with Federal authorities in
particular on pricing, it has not succeeded in breaking down interregional
barriers.
4.12     Under the present fertilizer investment planning system, each
fertilizer enterprise first initiates its own investment plan, which after
approval by the workers and the Republican/Provincial authorities is presented
to Agrohemija. At Agrohemija, investment plans of the various fertilizer
enterprises are reviewed by member enterprises to reach general agreement on
total investment size and new capacity and product mix. The draft plan is
then presented to the FCE as well as to the Republican/Provincial Chamber of
Economy. The FCE examines the plan to determine its overall suitability with
Yugoslavia's macro development plan, fertilizer demand/supply perspectives,
financial viability of the projects, foreign exchange, energy and raw
materials availability, and other relevant factors. The staff of the Federal
Committee for Agriculture, the Federal Secretariat for Finance, and the
Federal Committee for Industry and Energy are also involved in the evaluation
of the plan to provide needed information and overall coordination. In
practice, investment plans with strong regional backing (including financing)
invariably pass the various screening levels.
G. Production Economics
4.13     The economic viability of three of the four existing ammonia plants
(accounting for 94% of ammonia production capacity) and the INA plant under
construction has been reviewed. The existing plants have very high energy



-19-
consumption and this has adversely affected their economics (Annex 5,
Table 4). As compared to the present imported ammonia cost of about $175 per
ton CIF (expected to rise to $255 per ton by 1990, in 1983 prices), the direct
economic production costs of ammonia in the three existing plants range from
$246 to $283 per ton (excluding depreciation, interest and capital charges)
with a weighted average of $262 per ton. The new ammonia plant of INA will
have an economic direct production cost of about $198 per ton, indicating that
even this plant can be marginally economic only in the long term, and is
unlikely to generate any meani.ngful return on the original investment.
4.14     The reason for this is that the existing ammonia plants, constructed
between 1960-70 when energy costs were low, were designed on the basis of
minimizing initial investment cost, even though this implied relatively high
energy consumption during operation. For example, modern plants consume about
7.3 million kilocalories (kcaL) per metric ton of ammonia produced, whereas
Yugoslav plants consume about 10.9-12.4 million kcal per ton of ammonia. The
impact of high energy consumption on production costs is substantial, since
typically about 85% of the production costs are for energy (natural gas,
electricity and steam). Although at present uneconomic, there is a strong
likelihood that many of the existing ammonia plants could be economically
rehabilitated, if energy conservation investments were to be implemented.
However the extent to which these investments would be able to reduce energy
consumption and render the plants economically viable could only be determined
on the basis of energy audits and detailed engineering studies for each plant
(para 6.08).
4.15     The economic viability of the downstream ammonia processing units
(urea and CAN) has been reviewed (Annex 5, Table 5), and their economic direct
production costs are well below economic benefits. Hence, the financing of
imports of ammonia and ammonia-related intermediaries for production of urea
and CAN is justified on economic grounds.
4.16     In the phosphatic fertilizer industry, the traditional source of
sulphuric acid for the production of phosphoric acid has been the domestic
smelting industry and local pyrites. These sources of sulphuric acid have
given Yugoslavia a competitive advantage in the production of phosphate
fertilizers, compared to other countries which may need to import both
phosphate rock and sulphur. The economic viability of existing phosphoric
acid production, based on domestic pyrites, has been reviewed (Annex 5,
Table 6). The economic production costs of $285 per ton of P205 compares
favorably with a cost of $318 per ton of P205 for imported phosphoric
acid. Hence the financing of imports of phosphate rock for the existing
phosphoric acid production is economically justified. However, in the case of
the new INA phosphoric acid plant (Kutina), scheduled to commence production
in 1984, the economics are less favorable due to the high cost of imported
sulphur required in the production of phosphoric acid (Annex 5, Table 7). The
Bank has explained the issues involved and recommended to the Governmnent that
interim measures should be taken to improve the economics of the new INA
plant. It was confirmed by the Government during negotiations that for
phosphate rock financing under the loan, before a purchase order is placed for
the procurement of rock and sulphur, the sub-borrower would also obtain
quotations for the supply of phosphoric acid, in order to ascertain if at that
time, the processing of raw materials is more economic than importing the
phosphoric acid. only if processing the raw materials is more economic would
the sub-borrower place the purchase order for the phosphate rock; other
questions, if any, would be examined and resolved under the proposed technical
and energy studies (para 6.08).

H. Prices
4.17     Efforts are being made to bring domestic prices of finished
fertilizer in line with world market prices . Until 1982, prices were kept
intentionally low to stimulate demand, with an adverse effect on the financial
results of the fertilizer plants (para 4.24). In 1980, the Federal Government
abolished the price subsidy for the domestic market and prices were raised.
In January 1983, domestic sale prices of urea, CAN and NPK were raised by 53%,
bringing them to world market levels. Details are given in Annex 5, Table 8.
Recent price increases, however, do not appear to have had any adverse effect
on the domestic demand. The Republican/Provincial authorities do provide a
small indirect subsidy to the fertilizer producers in the form of lower water
and electricity charges and land rent, etc. This practice, in the present
circumstances, is acceptable.
4.18      The Federal Secretariat for Markets and General Economics, in close
collaboration with Agrohemija and the fertilizer producers and users, is
responsible for price determination. Periodic reviews are made, taking into
consideration the world market situation and the domestic production cost.
The Secretariat has indicated that domestic fertilizer prices will shortly be
raised by another 50% to ease the financial position of the fertilizer
plants. The price determination review mechanism is satisfactory. However,
in the future, it should be ensured that the country does not revert to the
system of subsidizing fertilizer for the domestic market (para 5.04).
I. Foreign Exchange Requirements/Allocation
4.19     The shortage of foreign exchange for imports of raw materials has
been a major constraint to increased production. In 1982, to produce about
2.6 million tons of fertilizer, the total foreign exchange requirement was
about $229 million, of which 60% was from convertible areas and 40% from
GOMECON countries (Annex 6). Essentially all phosphate rock and catalysts are
from hard currency areas, while potash is generally imported through clearing
arrangements. Although major suppliers of nitrogen intermediaries are from
Eastern Europe, the greater part of the cost has to be paid in convertible
currencies. The total foreign exchange requirements for imports of spare
parts were about $25 million, of which about 80% was from convertible currency
areas.
4.20     Until 1982, the major source of foreign exchange for the fertilizer
industry was from exports of finished fertilizer.  Between 1977-79, about 11%
of the total domestic production was exported to earn foreign exchange
essential for the import of raw materials. In 1980, when the foreign exchange
crisis first reached serious proportions, exports rose to about 20% of total
fertilizer production (para 3.06, Table 3). Fertilizer exports either reduced
the quantity available for the domestic market, or if exports were reduced to
increase domestic fertilizer availability, the industry failed to obtain the
necessary foreign exchange to import raw materials, resulting in reduced
fertilizer production. Both alternatives adversely affected agricultural
production. The Federal Government has recognized the need to rationalize the
allocation of foreign exchange for the fertilizer industry in order to
increase domestic production and, in turn, the availability for domestic
consumption.



-21-
4.21      Two measures have been taken in this regard.  First, under the
Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy for priority items 1/, the Government has
allocated for 1984, US$100 million for the import of raw materials for
fertilizer producers, compared to US$70 million in 1983 (an increase of more
than 42%). The Government has indicated that increased amounts under this
policy will be allocated for fertilizer raw material imports in 1985 and
onward, if the present foreign exchange constraint continues. Second, in
January 1983, a Social Compact was agreed among the Federal Executive Council,
FCE and the Republican/Provincial Executive Councils and Chambers of Economy,
under which 20% of the foreign exchange proceeds from agricultural exports,
excluding meat and fish, is automatically allocated to the "Fertilizer Import
Fund" for the purchase of raw materials by the fertilizer industry. This Fund
is administered at the national level by Beogradska Banka, but in 1983, it did
not operate effectively. It was introduced only in late April, the
administrative mechanism was not fully developed or understood and, as
explained earlier, 2/3 of the total agricultural exports in 1983 were under
barter deals. All these factors adversely affected the "Import Fund" and only
about $30 million was made available for the import of raw materials for the
fertilizer industry. Government officials have indicated, however, that in
1984, the Fund is expected to operate more efficiently and will provide about
$50 million to meet the fertilizer industry's imports. In addition, since
January 1983, the fertilizer industry has been permitted to retain up to 75%
(instead of the previous 30%) of export earnings from finished fertilizer.
4.22      The mechanisms to ensure foreign exchange availability described
above will continue through 1984; there is no certainty of their continuation
after that time. In view of this, it was agreed during negotiations that a
Self-Management Agreement (SMA), among VB, Agrohemija, the Fertilizer
Producers and the Agrokombinats (AIKs), would be executed whereby foreign
exchange would be made available to VB to convert Dinar repayments by
sub-borrowers into foreign exchange which would be onlent for new sub-loans.
Execution of such an agreement (SMA) would be a condition of effectiveness for
the SL (para 8.04 (ii)). The major source of foreign exchange contribution
would be the AIKs, which are currently exporting agricultural products
estimated to be about $1.3 billion per annum. This agreed mechanism is a
satisfactory vehicle for ensuring the Borrower adequate amounts of foreign
exchange for recycling sub-loans.  All these measures provide strong evidence
that the Government is giving very high priority to increasing domestic
fertilizer production. Government officials have indicated that under the
proposed Loan, the Borrower would continue to have access to foreign exchange
for recycling or rollover of fertilizer sub-loans from the sources mentioned
above (para 6.07). However, the total demand for foreign exchange in the
economy at present is such that it cannot yet be taken for granted that the
fertilizer industry will receive all of its foreign exchange requirements.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Borrower would (a)
deposit in a special account all amounts in Dinars received from the
Fertilizer Producers in repayments of the sub-loans; (b) convert such Dinars
into foreign exchange providecl to the Borrower, through the mechanisms
outlined above; and (c) use the foreign exchange for the provision of
additional sub-loans under the project until June 30, 1989 (para 8.02 (i)).
Assurances were also obtained that the Guarantor would take all measures
necessary to ensure that the Borrower is able to carry out this obligation
(para 8.01 (i)).

J. Financial Situation of the Industry
4.23     Basic Banks are the main financial institutions providing short and
long-term funds to the fertilizer enterprises. In addition, the fertilizer
enterprises, like other industries in Yugoslavia, have access to various other
funds particularly when they incur losses. These include reserves of other
BOALs with which they are linked by a self-management agreement (SMA),
"solidarity contributions" from Agrokombinats (para 4.10), and pooled reserves
of the Commune and the Republic or Province. Additionally, rescheduling of
bank loans, write-off of debts, tax exemptions, contribution obligations to
socio-political communities, and deferred payment for purchase of goods are
also, upon occasion, available to the fertilizer enterprises.
4.24     In recent years, the financial condition of the fertilizer industry
has not been very favorable. In both 1981 and 1982, eight out of eleven
fertilizer enterprises incurred losses 1/ amounting, on average, to 11% of
their total revenues. In addition, their liquidity position, in general, does
not appear very sound. Several factors lie behind this situation. First, in
recent years, domestic fertilizer prices have been kept artificially low by
the Government in order to promote fertilizer use and increase agricultural
production (para 4.17). Second, as stated in para 4.14, energy consumption
for fertilizer production in Yugoslavia is relatively high, compared with
current international standards, resulting in high production costs. And
third, capacity utilization of some of the fertilizer enterprises has been
relatively low due to the design defects or start-up problems (para 4.07).
While the energy efficiency improvements need to be examined more in detail in
the proposed energy conservation studies under the SL (para 6.08), other
loss-causing factors are expected to be lessened in the near future. For
example, planned domestic price increases would increase sales revenues of the
enterprises immediately. Also, improvements in the foreign exchange
allocation system and the availability of foreign exchange to the fertilizer
enterprises would facilitate imports of spare/replacement parts (and raw
materials) to improve capacity utilization, and would expedite start-up of new
plants. These measures are, thus, expected to improve the overall financial
position of the fertilizer industry.
V. THE SECTOR LOAN (SL)
A. Need for the SL
5.01     The foregoing demonstrates the urgent need for the development of a
comprehensive integrated program to revitalize the fertilizer sub-sector. To
this end there is an economically justified need to increase fertilizer
availability immediately for the domestic market (para 7.05). This would
1/ In the Yugoslavian accounting system, loss is defined as total revenues
minus production costs, minus other general overhead expenses (including
financial charges and tax payments), minus individual incomes (equivalent
to labor costs), minus contribution to funds. Although the "funds"
portion includes what is equivalent to retained earnings in the Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, when loss is incurred, the funds portion
is generally nil.

assist the country to achieve its primary objective of increasing grain
production, wheat and maize, the two major crops, in which the country must
attain self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time in order to achieve the
objectives of the Stabilization Program. At the same time, the modification
of the distribution policy to ensure the optimum utilization of the fertilizer
is required. In addition, there is an urgent need to restructure and
modernize the fertilizer indusitry to place it on a sound technical and
economic footing.
B. Objective/Concept
5.02     The SL would assist the Government in increasing the domestic
availability of finished fertilizer for 1984 (Fall) and 1985 (Spring and
Fall). The incremental fertilizer produced as a result of the Loan would be
mainly used for wheat and maize production. The SL would address policy and
institutional issues concerning domestic distribution, by making incremental
fertilizer accessible to NCI fairmers, as well as assisting the Government in
modernizing and rehabilitating the industry in the long run, through the
financing of technical studies to define a program for improving production
economics. The SL would thus expand and enhance the Government's on-going
Fertilizer Production/Consumption Program.
5.03     Taking into consideration the unfilled potential domestic demand, the
technical capacity and the economics of domestic production, the urgency of
the increased fertilizer application and the improvements envisaged in the
foreign exchange allocation mechanism (para 4.21), as well as the domestic
distribution system (para 7.02), a realistic growth rate of 15% per year for
domestic fertilizer consumption for 1984 and 1985 has been estimated jointly
by the Government and the Bank. The incremental consumption has been
calculated against the actual domestic production of 2.6 million tons of
fertilizer in 1983. The SL wouald provide the foreign exchange to import raw
materials and spare parts for the production of the incremental consumption
requirements for 1984 and 1985 - a total of 850,000 tons. Of the total
incremental production, 680,000 tons, equivalent to 80% of the incremental
fertilizer production, would be sold through the retail shops of the
participating Trading Agencies on a cash basis to individual (primarily NCI)
farmers, the production group where the increased application of fertilizer
would yield the optimum results in the immediate future. This percentage
(80%) has been derived, taking into consideration the relevant fertilizer
needs of the Social Sector, the Cooperatives and the NCI farmers, the crop
response in these three production groups, and their individual economic
returns (para 7.05). It was agreed during negotiations that VB, Agrohemija
and Fertilizer Producers would enter a Self-Management Agreement (SMA), in
accordance with which the Fertilizer Producers would make available to the
Trading Agencies for sale on a cash basis through their retail shops to
individual farmers (NCI). It was also agreed that the execution of the SMA
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para 8.04 (i)). The quantities of
fertilizer which would be channelled through this system are: about 240,000
tons of fertilizer in the fall of 1984 and about 440,000 tons of fertilizer in
1985 (para 8.04 (i)). In addition, although the SL would be for a two-year
period, the Second Tranche (June 1985) would only be released after a
satisfactory review of the SL implementation for 1984 (para 6.16). The
proposed concept appears an appropriate mechanism to assist the country in
addressing both short and long-term fertilizer sub-sector problems and, in
turn, the on-going economic stabilization efforts.



-24-
C. Statement of Policy
5.04     As stated earlier, in view of the stabilization measures and the
overall economic position of the country, both the fertilizer production and
consumption targets for the remaining years (1984-85) of the current Five-Year
Plan are being revised. The domestic fertilizer production targets of
3.0 million tons in 1984 and 3.45 million tons in 1985; and the fertilizer
consumption targets of 3.0 million tons in 1984, 3.4 million tons in 1985,
3.7 million tons in 1986, 4.0 million tons in 1987, 4.3 million tons in 1988
and 4.6 million tons in 1989, were agreed to with the Guarantor during
negotiations. This agreement on the fertilizer consumption targets for
1984-1989 would ensure that fertilizer is not exported until the fertilizer
requirements of the domestic market are met. In addition, assurances were
obtained from the Guarantor that the present fertilizer pricing system for the
domestic market, which does not allow for Federal subsidy, would be maintained
and the Guarantor would take all necessary steps to facilitate the achievement
of both production and consumption targets (para 8.01 (ii)).
D. SL Description
5.05     The SL would be implemented over a two-year period (Fall 1984 through
Fall 1985) and would finance the following:
(i) Raw Materials: The SL would finance the foreign exchange to
cover the cost of the raw materials to be imported from the
convertible currency areas for the incremental production.
Imported raw materials would mainly consist of phosphate rock for
phosphate production, intermediat,es such as MAP, DAP, ammonia and
ammonia solution for NPK production. It is estimated that the
raw materials, financed under the SL, would enable the country to
produce an incremental 0.85 million tons of finished fertilizer
(para 7.01).
(ii) Spare Parts:  The total spare parts requirements are estimated at
about $25 million; of this 80% would be from the convertible
currency area.  The SL would finance about $21 million for
critical spare parts and essentiaL catalysts for Fall 1984
through 1985. Major items would be corrosion-resistant materials
for sulphuric and phosphatic acid plants, stainless steel piping
and catalysts for ammonia production.
(iii) Technical Study: About $1.85 million would be provided under the
SL to cover the cost of technical and energy studies of
fertilizer plants. It is estimated that about 190 man-months
would be required to complete the studies. Of the total
estimated man-months, about 60% would be provided by foreign
consultants and the remainder by local consultants. Such a
study, including production cost analysis, would cover all
fertilizer plants, in order to assess their operating and energy
efficiency. The examination should identify all potential
sources of sulphuric acid and other major inputs, both local and
foreign, to determine the most economic sources of supply. It
should also identify measures and investments that might be
required to reduce costs and quantify savings that would thereby
be achieved. The economic and financial viability of these
measures and investments should also be adequately assessed (para
6.08).



-25-
E. Implementation Time Frame
5.06       The SL implementation would be immediate, since it would mainly
consist of procurement of raw materials and spare parts for the domestic
fertilizer industry (11 plants). There would be no major issues of design;
technical specifications are well-established. The industry has had long
experience in importing such raw materials/spare parts annually. Both the
industry and the Government have been pressing for the quick finalization of
the proposed SL in order to avoid delays in their ongoing production/
distribution schedule.
F. SL Cost
5.07       In view of the critical foreign exchange constraint, the proposed
SL is designed to cover the foreign exchange requirements from the convertible
area only (Annex 6). Without such foreign exchange assistance, the planned
increased production would not be feasible. Hence, in this context, the cost
represents the convertible foreign exchange requirements for the incremental
domestic production. The cost of consultants is based on an estimated
requirement of 190 man-months comprising 110 man-months provided by foreign
consultants at a total cost of $12,000 per man month and 80 man months
provided by local consultants at a total cost of $5,000 per man month. Cost
estimates are based on March 1984 prices. Price contingencies for raw
materials have been calculated on the basis of annual projected international
inflation rates for fertilizer raw materials of 9.8% in 1984 and the same in
1985; price contingencies for spare parts and consultant services have been
calculated on the basis of projected international inflation rates of 3.3% in
1984 and 8.0% in 1985. The front end fee on the Bank's loan would amount to
$224,439 and would be capitalized. The details are summarized below (Annex 6):
Cost Estimates
($ ?000J)

Total                        41,244         48,756            90,000
G. Financing
5.08     The proposed Bank loan would provide $90.0 million to cover the
foreign exchange cost of the incremental production. Vojvodjanska Banka (VB),
the proposed Borrower, during its appraisal of the sub-borrowers, would ensure
that they had sufficient resources to utilize the Bank funds efficiently (para
6.05). The Bank loan would be for 15 years, including three years of grace at
standard variable interest rate.



-26-
H. Production/Import Schedule
5.09     As stated earlier, the incremental quantity of fertilizer financed
under the Loan would be used only for two crops - wheat and maize. The
fertilizer for these two crops is generally applied in Spring and Fall. The
Spring application normally takes place in mid-February to mid-March and the
Fall application, from end-October to mid-December. The latter application is
the more critical one.
5.10     In order to meet the above application schedule, the fertilizer
plants must place orders for imported raw materials 3-4 months in advance,
i.e. for Spring application by November at the latest and for Fall, by
August. Shipping arrangements are satisfactorily developed and the
transportation network for delivery of imported raw materials is adequate and
well established. Thus no infrastructural constraints appear to exist for
handling imported raw materials; however all legal and administrative
arrangements must be made to ensure that the import schedule specified above
is met.
I. Procurement
5.11     International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be used for raw
materials and spare parts, except for (i) those items of a value equivalent to
less than $100,000 per contract, which would be procured following evaluation
and comparison of bids from at least three qualified suppliers eligible under
the Bank's Guidelines, and (ii) for proprietary spare parts agreed with the
Bank which may be procured through direct negotiations with suppliers. The
aggregate of such contracts would not exceed the equivalent of $8.0 million.
Consultants' services to be financed under the SL would be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Consultants
would be employed in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Local consultants may form joint ventures with foreign companies
to carry out the energy audit studies (para 6.08). The proceeds of the SL
would thus be used only to finance imported raw materials, spare parts and
services to be supplied from sources eligible under the Bank's Guidelines.
5.12     Procurement of all fertilizer raw materials would be coordinated by
Agrohemija in accordance with existing practices, so that the benefits of bulk
purchases would be achieved for the same materials required by more than one
fertilizer company. Procurement of spare parts would be made via the
purchasing department of the relevant fertilizer companies under the
supervision of VB to ensure that Bank procurement Guidelines were adhered to
(para 6.02).
J. Disbursement
5.13     Allocation and disbursement of the SL proceeds would be as follows:



-27-
Allocation of Bank Loan Proceeds
($ million)
1.  Raw materials for fertilizer         61.0             100% of foreign
production                                           expenditures.
2.  Spare parts for fertilizer           21.0             100% of foreign
production facilities                                 expenditures
3.  Consultants                           0.8 1/          100% of expenditures
4.  Unallocated                           7.0
5.  Front-end fee                         0.2
Total                         90.0
The SL is expected to be disbursed over two Bank fiscal years (FY85-FY86),
starting in the first quarter of FY85. Disbursement would be against full
documentation. The detailed disbursement schedule is given in Annex 7; since
items to be financed by the Loan are all quick disbursing (para 5.06), the
disbursement profile does not conform to the typical disbursement profile.
The First Tranche would cover the period June/July 1984 to May/June 1985 and
would amount to about $50.0 million. The Second Tranche, consisting of about
$40.0 million, would only be released after a satisfactory review by the Bank
in May, 1985 of the SL implementation and would cover the period July to
December, 1985 (para 6.16).
VI. SL IMPLEMENTATION
A. Borrower
6.01     Vojvodjanska Banka - Udruzena Banka (VB) has been proposed by the
Government as the Borrower under the SL, as a result of its involvement in the
implementation of the First, Second and Third Agricultural Credit Projects, 2/
financed by the Bank. It is conversant with the Bank's requirements in
appraising and supervising sub-borrowers, has a nucleus of trained staff to
undertake these functions and has gained some degree of experience in
implementing nationwide projects of this nature.
1/ It was agreed during negotiations that the total cost of the technical and
energy audits of fertilizer plants could be as high as US$1.85 million,
and in that event, loan proceeds would be re-allocated from other loan
categories to finance the shortfall.
2/ First Agricultural Credit Project, Loan 1129-YU, Second Agricultural
Credit Project, Loan 1477-YU and Third Agricultural Credit Project, Loan
1801-YU. Of these, the First Agricultural Credit Project has recently
been completed and a Project Completion Report prepared.



-28-
6.02     VB, an apex Bank, consists of sixteen basic banks and has
headquarters in Novi Sad in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.
The apex Bank is divided into five Departments: Foreign Operations, Project
Operations (IBRD), Local Operations, Other Operations and Economic Analysis.
As of May 1983, staff at headquarters totaled 335. The Foreign Operations
Department (FOD) would be directly responsible for implementation of the
proposed SL; appraisal and supervision of sub-borrowers would be undertaken by
this Department. The Project Operations Department, which has had
responsibility for the implementation of the Bank-financed Agricultural Credit
Projects, would assist FOD in procurement-related matters, since the former
has already gained experience in procurement. FOD has been selected for Loan
implementation in view of the nature of the proposed SL, which is concerned
entirely with foreign exchange operations. FOD has a staff of 142, of which
53 are professional; of these, eight are responsible for project appraisal.
One additional Project Appraisal Officer would be recruited by FOD to handle
the proposed SL matters. It was agreed during negotiations that a competent
Project Appraisal Officer would join the FOD of VB, latest by September 1,
1984.
6.03     The financial position of VB is already being closely monitored by
the Bank in connection with on-going projects. A consolidated balance sheet
and income statement, as of December 1982, are presented in Annex 8. In
brief, the financial position appears satisfactory. Total assets recorded
increases of 29% and 34% between 1980/81 and 1981/82, respectively. More
important, cash and other liquid assets increased from Din 7.98 billion in
1980 to Din 12.29 billion in 1981 and to Din 15.71 billion in 1982. VB's net
income between 1980 and 1981 increased by 46% (Annex 8).
6.04     The proposed Loan proceeds would be channeled to VB, which would
on-lend to sub-borrowers (eleven fertilizer companies) in accordance with
lending procedures and terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, as
outlined in para 6.05.
B. On-Lending Procedures
6.05     The sub-borrowers would submit Loan applications simultaneously to
their local banks and to VB. In order to avoid duplication of work and speed
up sub-loan approval, VB (FOD) would itself appraise each sub-borrower and
prepare an appraisal report. At present loan processing usually takes about
2-3 months, although in exceptional cases this can be completed in 30 days.
The VB (FOD) already follows a set procedure in making loans in foreign
currency. However, in addition to this, in appraising the sub-borrowers under
the proposed SL, the VB would ensure that:
a)   the management, organizational and production facilities were
satisfactory for implementation of timely production of fertilizer;
b)   sub-borrowers would generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt
service, local claims and appropriate investment levels;
c)   documents and clearances necessary for foreign exchange lending were
obtained by the sub-borrowers, the basic banks and Republican/
Provincial authorities and/or Federal authorities concerned.



-29-
d)   the sub-borrowers wouLd agree to have the Yugoslav Social Accounting
Service (SDK) prepare and audit the most recent income statement,
statement of changes in financial position, and balance sheet, in
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
and submit them to VB at the end of each fiscal year.
6.06     The SMA to be signed between VB, Agrohemija and the Fertilizer
Producers would ensure that the Fertilizer Producers would make available the
agreed auantities (para 5.03) of fertilizer in 1984 and 1985 to the Trading
Agencies (Annex 4) for sale through their retail shops to individual farmers
on a cash basis. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that VB would
follow the above criteria in appraising sub-borrowers (para 8.02 (i)). Based
on these criteria, FOD would prepare an appraisal report which would be
approved by the Business Managing Board of VB. Such reports would be made
available to the Bank upon request.
C. On-Lending Terms and Conditions
6.07     Sub-borrowers would receive the funds in foreign exchange, but
repayment would be made to VB by them in Dinars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time of repayment. VB would then convert the Dinars into
dollars from the sources described in paras 4.21 and 4.22 or from others made
available to VB by the Guarantor. Thus the foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the sub-borrowers. The duration of sub-loans for raw materials and
spare parts should not exceed 12 months; the duration of sub-loans for
technical studies would be fouir years, with one year grace period. The VB
would on-lend to sub-borrowers for raw materials, spare parts and technical
studies at the same rate as that charged by the Bank, plus a spread of at
least 1.0% to cover its administrative costs. This is considered an
acceptable rate of interest given that the sub-borrowers would, in addition,
bear the foreign exchange risk, thereby bringing the real cost of funds to a
level comparable to the international cost of capital. The VB twould recycle
the foreign exchange, after excluding the annual repayment of interest and
principal to the Bank, to the fertilizer industry for the purposes of the Loan
until June 30, 1989. Assurances regarding the on-lending terms and recycling
of funds were obtained during negotiations (para 4.22, para 8.01 (i) and para
8.02 (ii)).
D.  Technical and Energy Studies
6.08     The terms of reference (Annex 9) for the technical and energy studies
were discussed with Agrohemija and the representatives of the 11 fertilizer
plants. These were finalized during negotiations. An assurance was obtained
from Agrohemija that it would employ consultants in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for tnese studies, and from VB, that it would require the
Fertilizer Producer receiving sub-loans to finance such a study of its plant
to ensure that the study, in accordance with the agreed terms of reference,
would be completed by March 31, 1986 and the results of the studies would be
reviewed with the Bank (paras 8.02 (iii) and 8.03 (i)). The organization
within Agrohemija for carrying out the studies is discussed in para 6.10. The
cost of about $1.85 million for these studies would be passed on to the 11
fertilizer plants by the VB in consultation with Agrohemija. An agreement
would be reached between VB, Agrohemija and the 11 fertilizer plants
concerning the financing of the study. Execution of such an agreement would
be a condition of effectiveness for the SL (para 8.04 (i)). The detailed
mechanism for on-lending this lportion of funds (about $1.85 million) was
finalized during negotiations with VB and Agrohemija (para 8.02 (iii)).



-30-
6.09     Based on the findings of the technical and energy studies, a plan of
action would be prepared by December 31, 1986 outlining the investment and
other measures required to rehabilitate and restructure the fertilizer
production units in order to place them on a sound economic footing. If the
Government then so requested, the Bank would be prepared to consider the
possibility of financing the modernization/rehabilitation efforts.
E. Organization
Agrohemija
6.10     Although VB would be responsible overall for the SL implementation,
Agrohemija and the participating Trading Agencies would play a very critical
role in implementation. Agrohemija would be responsible for the selection of
consultants and coordination of technical studies, monitoring of fertilizer
production and distribution and assisting VB in the supervision of procurement
of raw materials and spare parts. A Project Implementation Working Group
would be established in Agrohemija. This would consist of two or three
engineers, an economist and necessary support staff. The staff for the Group
would be seconded from the large fertilizer enterprises. The terms of
reference and the scope of work for such a Group are presented in Annex 9 and
were discussed and finalized during negotiations. Such an Implementation
Working Group would be maintained by Agrohemija. The establishment and
staffing of such an Implementation Group would be a condition for Loan
effectiveness. Assurances regarding the Implementation Group were obtained
during negotiations (paras 8.03 (ii) and 8.04 (Iiii)).
Trading Agencies
6.11     The participating Trading Agencies (Annex 4) would play an important
role in the implementation of the SL, in particular in marketing the
incremental fertilizer production to individual (mainly NCI) farmers on a cash
basis (para 7.02). The Trading Agencies would obtain fertilizer for sale at
federally regulated prices from the Fertilizer Producers, through SMA
(para 5.03). In general, many of the Trading Agencies are very large, are
organized as COALs and deal in various economic trading activities (industrial
products, agricultural commodities/inputs, etc.). There are separate Work
organizations (WO) for domestic and foreign trading. Retail shops (to be used
under the SL) are organized as BOALs under the WO responsible for domestic
trading. The Trading Agencies are staffed by experienced commercial
personnel. The headquarters of Trading Agencies (WO) would oversee fertilizer
sales through their retail shops and would be in a position to provide sales
figures to Agrohemija, which would be responsible for overall monitoring
(paras 6.13-6.15).
Implementation Committee
6.12     At the Federal level, a Loan Implementation Committee would be
established. The establishment of the Committee was agreed upon during
negotiations. The Committee would consist of representatives of the Federal
Committee for Agriculture, the Federal Secretariat for Finance, the Federal



-31-
Secretariat for Markets and General Economics, the FCE, Agrohemija and VB.
The Committee would be chaired by the Deputy President of the Federal
Committee for Agriculture and VB would serve as a Secretariat. The Committee
would oversee and coordinate different aspects of loan implementation.
Assurances were obtained fromi the Guarantor that the Committee would be
maintained (para 8.01 (iii)).
F. Monitoring/Reporting
6.13      Agrohemija would be responsible for monitoring and reporting the
progress made in achieving the planned production and distribution targets and
reporting progress on the technical studies. Production reports would be
broken down by type of fertilizer and between Fall and Spring seasons. Since,
in fact, Agrohemija already produces such reports, this would merely be a
continuation of the present system. Agrohemija, on a quarterly basis, would
monitor progress in completing the technical and energy studies. The form for
such monitoring and reporting is presented in Annex 10 and was finalized
during negotiations.
6.14      In monitoring fertilizer distribution, Agrohemija, in close
cooperation with participating Trading Agencies and FCE, would prepare a
report outlining the progress made in achieving the planned distribution and
marketing targets, broken down by Social and Cooperative Sectors and
individual farmers on cash basis through Trading Agencies (NCI farmers) and by
Fall and Spring seasons and by Republics and Provinces. Agrohemija, in
association with the Republican and Provincial authorities, already receives
such information, and thus, with minor modifications, the present reporting
system could be continued under the Loan. Annex 10 outlines the forms to be
used by Agrohemija in preparing the distribution reports. Details of these
forms were finalized during negotiations.
6.15      Agrohemija would submit the progress reports to VB, which, in turn,
after careful review, would forward them to the Bank. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Agrohemija would complete the agreed forms
and submit the information to VB which, in turn, would forward it to the Bank
within 30 days after the end of the period (paras 8.01 (iv), 8.02 (iv) and
8.03 (iii)). It was agreed that the progress reports monitoring fertilizer
production and distribution would be submitted to the Bank for periods ending
December 31, 1984, April 30, 1985, June 30, 1985 and subsequently at 6 month
intervals until December 31, 1989. However, the progress reports on the
general execution of the project and on the technical and energy studies would
be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The SMA referred to in para
5.03 would also ensure that the Fertilizer Producers include in their
contracts with the Trading Agencies that the Agencies provide Agrohemija
periodic reports on the quantity of fertilizer sold through their retail shops
on a cash basis to NCI farmers (para 8.04 (i)).
G. Second Tranche
6.16      In view of the complex issues involved (production, distribution and
marketing), to ensure the full impact of the SL, the Loan would be tranched
into two parts. It would be a condition of disbursement that the Second
Tranche ($40.0 million) would only be released if there were progress
satisfactory to the Bank, on the basis of an exchange of views between the
Bank and the Guarantor, to take place in May 1985. Such a review would cover:



-32-
(a) the total quantity of fertilizer made available for the domestic market in
1984 (target of about 1.50 million tons of fertilizer for the fall of 1984
application and about 1.70 million tons of fertilizer for the spring of 1985
application were agreed during negotiations); (b) about 240,000 tons of
finished fertilizer to be made available to the Trading Agencies for sale to
individual (primarily NCI) farmers on a cash basis for Fall 1984 application
and about 200,000 tons for Spring 1985 application; and (c) the progress in
carrying out the technical and energy studies. Assurances that the review and
disbursement of the Second Tranche would take place as above were obtained at
negotiations (paras 8.01 (v) and 8.05 (i)).
H. Accounts and Audits
6.17     VB would maintain a separate account for sub-loan disbursement and
other expenditures under the Loan. The VB would have its accounts and
financial statements (balance sheets, statement of income and expenditures and
related statements) for each fiscal year audited in accordance with
appropriate aucLiting procedures consistently applied by the Yugoslav Social
Accounting Service (SDK), an independent auditing organization, acceptable to
the Bank. The VB would furnish to the Bank, as soon as available, but in any
case not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, certified
copies of its financial statements, audited as above and the report of SDK.
Assurances were obtained from VB during negotiations that these accounting and
auditing requirements would be followed (para 8.02 (v)).
I. Completion Report
6.18     Shortly after the SL completion, and in any case not later than six
months after the closing date, VB would prepare and furnish to the Bank a
report on the execution of the SL, its cost and the benefits derived and to be
derived from it. The report would examine and evaluate the performance of the
Bank, the VB, Agrohemija, the Trading Agencies and the consultants and assess
the impact and viability of the modified domestic distribution/marketing
system. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that VB would submit
such a report on schedule and in a format acceptable to the Bank (para 8.02
(Vi)).
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND BENEFITS
A. Incremental Fertilizer Production
7.01     The proposed SL, by providing foreign ,exchange for imports of
necessary raw materials, would assist the country in increasing the
availability of fertilizer for the domestic marlket. It is estimated that this
would result in a total incremental production of 0.85 million tons of
fertilizer for domestic consumption. The composition would be as follows:



-33-
Table 6
Estimated Incremental Fertilizer Production
(in '000 tons)
1984            1985           Total
NPK                              175             290             465
CAN                               80             125             205
Urea                              65             115             180
320            530             850
The incremental fertilizer availability, in turn, should permit the country to
increase grain production by about 1.3 million tons, mainly of wheat and maize
(para 7.05), in the shortest possible time - an important objective of the
Government and the Stabilization Program. However, as explained in para 3.09,
the achievement of this goal is dependent upon the optimum utilization of the
incremental fertilizer.
B. Marketing Arrangements
7.02      As explained in para 3.11, at present domestic distribution is
undertaken by Agrokombinats, Cooperatives and Trading Agencies. The
incremental fertilizer production financed under the SL would also be
distributed through these three channels. However, a total of 680,000 tons,
equivalent to 80% of the incremental fertilizer production in 1984 and 1985,
would be made available for sale, on a cash basis, to individual (NCI) farmers
through the retail shops of t he participating Trading Agencies. Based on
discussions, it appears that NCI farmers do not need credit for purchase of
inputs such as fertilizer, seed, etc. About 170,000 tons, equivalent to 20%
of the incremental fertilizer production, would be provided to the Cooperative
Sector for application. A yearly breakdown of the incremental fertilizer by
sectors, Republics and Provinces is given in Annex 11, Table 2 and is
summarized below:
Cooperative                 NCI
Year               Sector                  Farmers               Total
-----------------in tons-----
1984                80,000                240,000              320,000
1985                90,000                440,000              530,000
1L70,000              680,000               850,000
The above distribution allocation has been determined on the basis of soil and
crop needs and would ensure the optimum utilization of fertilizer. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Guarantor would take all steps
necessary to facilitate the availability to NCI farmers of the above targets
and that it would ensure that: the above distribution mechanism for NCI farmers
would be followed (para 8.01 (vi)). During negotiations, an understanding was
also reached with the Guarantor that the future (1986 onward) domestic
distribution system would be determined, in accordance with the
recommendations of the scientific and research services in Yugoslavia and on
the basis of soil fertility nieeds for different crops, in order to optimize
fertilizer utilization.



-34-
C. Distribution Analyses
Assumptions
7.03     It is assumed that the incremental fertilizer would be applied only
for grain crops (wheat and maize) by both Cooperatives and NCI farmers. Based
on this and taking into consideration the agricultural practices, soil
conditions and the 1982 fertilizer application rates, it is estimated that
incremental fertilizer, if distributed as proposed in para 7.02, would assist
in increasing grain yields as follows:
Without Project        With Project
(1982)               (1985)            Incremental

Rate for wheat (kg/ha)  625          240       807       540        182       300
Wheat Yield
(kg/ha)                4,300      3,000      4,600    3,600         300      600
The projected yield increases, in the Yugoslav context, are considered
realistic and feasible.
7.04     The incremental fertilizer and grain production have been valued in
1983 at the import parity prices since both these items are internationally
traded and Yugoslavia is a net importer. An import parity price
(international prices adjusted for transportation, baggage handling) of
$190/ton for fertilizer (weighted average of NPK, CAN and urea) and $165/ton
for grain (weighted average of wheat and maize) has been derived, based on the
World Bank Commodities and Export Projects Division forecast.
Distribution Alternatives/Impact
7.05     The economic impact of four alternative distribution patterns for the
incremental fertilizer has been assessed. Details are given in Annex 11 and
summarized below:

(B) 100% to Cooperatives          451.0               74.4       162.0          -87.6
(C) 80% to NCI Farmers
and 20% to Cooperatives   1,257.0               207.5        162.0           45.5
(D) 50% to NCI Farmers
and 50% to Cooperatives   1,000.0               165.0        162.0             3.0



-35-
From the above calculations it clearly emerges that the optimum economic
utilization of the incremental fertilizer would only result if at least 80%
were to be made accessible to NCI farmers and 20% to the Cooperative Sector,
as proposed under the SL. This, as explained earlier, is due to the fact that
NCI farmers at present apply the lowest level of fertilizer and thus have the
maximum economic potential to increase grain production in the shortest
possible time. If the increm,ental fertilizer were to be distributed in
accordance with the present system (i.e. mainly to Cooperatives), there would
be incremental grain production of 0.45 million tons, compared to 1.26 million
tons under the proposed modified distribution system. This difference would
amount to 0.81 million tons of grain production foregone ($134.0 million). In
addicion to its total economic viability, the proposed incremental fertilizer
distribution pattern would be economic from the point of view of each sector
separately. However, if the incremental fertilizer were distributed 50% to
the Cooperative Sector and 50% to NCI farmers, although in total this would
remain just marginally viable, on a sector basis, the Cooperative Sector would
not be economic, as shown below:

In view of the strong economic justification and the needs of the country, the
proposed distribution system should be adopted.  In its absence, the proposed
SL could not be economically justified.
D. Import Substitution
7.06     As shown above, the Loan would assist in increasing grain
production. of the estimatecd total incremental grain production of about
1.26 million tons, wheat would constitute about 80% (1.0 million tons) and
maize the remainder. The increased wheat production, in particular, would
assist the country in reducing wheat imports which, in the past three years,
have averaged about 0.8 million tons annually. The expected additional maize
production would enable exports to be increased. Both of these items together
would benefit the country's i-oreign exchange resources by about $208.0 million.



-36-
E. NCI Farmers' Income
7.07     The major beneficiaries of the SL would be the NCI farmers, the
fertilizer producers and, in turn, the economy as a whole. It is estimated
that with the increased availability of fertilizer, NCI farmers would be able
to increase their grain production and thus their incomes. Even with a modest
increase in their present fertilizer application, as shown below, their
incomes would increase by about Din 4,000/ha or about Din 12,000 ($100) per
farm family, since, on average, each independent farm family owns about 4 ha,
of which about 3 ha are under grain production.
Incremental
Kg/ha          Din
Fertilizer application        300         3,300.0
Yield                         600         7,200.0
Benefit                                   3,900.0
The present value of net benefits discounted at 16% and 20% would be Din 3,660
and Din 3,000 respectively. Both these returns are fully satisfactory. It is
estimated that about 1.1-1.2 million NCI farm families would benefit under the
proposed Loan since these are presently withoult access to much needed
fertilizer.
F. Risks
7.08     There are several major areas of risk inherent in this type of Loan:
Foreign Exchange: Although the Bank would assist the country over a
two-year period in meeting foreign exchange requirements for
increased domestic availability of fertilizer, unless the necessary
foreign exchange were to continue to be made available to the
fertilizer industry thereafter, the situation could again revert to
the present. However, as stated in para 5.04, the Guarantor would
take all steps necessary to facilitate the achievement of revised
production targets for the years 1984-85 and the consumption targets
for 1984-1989 and the recycling mechanism described in para 4.22
would be set up whereby the Borrower would continue to have access to
foreign exchange for fertilizer sub-loans until June 30, 1989 (para
8.01 (i) and (ii)). Such an arrangement would reduce this risk.
However some element of risk would necessarily remain.
Distribution: Even if the Government did agree to modify fertilizer
distribution arrangements, as proposed under the Loan, there would be
no guarantee that these arrangements would be continued in the
post-Loan period. It is to be hoped that the success of the proposed
marketing arrangement would serve to convince the Government of the
economic advantages of continuing the system. However, the
continuation of an effective distribution system for agricultural
inputs would be one of the major concerns of the proposed SAL II. In
addition, an understanding was reached with the Guarantor during
negotiations that the future (1986 onward) domestic fertilizer
distribution system would be based on soil fertility needs for
different crops in order to optimize the fertilizer utilization.



-37-
NCI Farmers: It is possible that the individual (NCI) farmers may
not purchase fertilizer on a cash basis to the extent anticipated.
However, based on discussions and statistical information, this risk
is of minor importance since these farmers are well aware of the
economic benefits of fertilizer application. In the past, farmers
have not applied fertilizer because of lack of access to it rather
than lack of demand.
Rehabilitation: The restructuring of the fertilizer industry, as a
result of the technical and energy studies of fertilizer plants under
the proposed Loan, could have social implications. For example,
uneconomic units would have to be closed down. However the
fertilizer industry is capital-intensive and the unemployment
consequences of any shutdowns would be minimal. There is also
growing evidence that the Government has begun to recognize the
importance of rationalizing fertilizer production as a part of its
structural adjustment: process. The Government's decision to borrow
funds, under the proposed Loan, to finance such a study, is an
indication of their serious interest.
Weather Conditions: The benefits of the increased fertilizer
application are very much dependent upon suitable weather
conditions. The short time period involved in the SL and the urgent
need to increase grain production immediately render weather
conditions of special concern. However there is obviously no policy
precaution that can be taken in this regard.
In spite of the risks involved, the proposed SL is timely and economically
justified.
V:[II. RECOMMENDATIONS
Assurances
8.01     During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Guarantor that:
(i) It would take all measures necessary to ensure that the Borrower
would be able to implement the subloan recycling mechanism until
June 30, 1989 (para 4.22).
(ii) All necessary stelps would be taken to facilitate the achievement
of agreed production for 1984-85 and consumption targets for
1984-1989 and the present fertilizer pricing system for the
domestic market would be maintained (para 5.04).
(iii)  The Implementation Committee would be established and maintained
(para 6.12).
(iv) It would take all necessary action to enable Agrohemija to
properly complete the monitoring forms (as agreed) and submit the
information to VB (para 6.15).
(v) The Guarantor would exchange views with the Bank on the progress
achieved regarding actions on which release of the Second Tranche
is conditioned (para 6.16).



-38-
(vi)  It would take all measures necessary to facilitate the
availability of a total of 680,000 tons of fertilizer and it would
ensure that this fertilizer would be made available for sale, on a
cash basis, to individual (NCI) farmers through the retail shops
of participating Trading Agencies. A yearly breakdown would be as
follows: 240,000 tons in 1984 and 440,000 tons in 1985 (para
7.02).
8.02     During negotiations assurances from the Borrower (VB) were obtained
that:
(i) The criteria for the appraisal of sub-borrowers, as agreed during
negotiations, would be followed (para 6.06).
(ii)  The Borrower would deposit in a special account Dinars received
from sub-borrowers in repayment of sub-loans and convert these
Dinars into foreign exchange for recycling to Fertilizer Producers
in accordance with mechanisms described in para 4.22 and the
sub-borrowers would pay interest at the same rate as that charged
by the Bank, plus a spread of at least 1.0% to cover VB's
administrative costs and would bear the foreign exchange risk
(para 6.07).
(iii) The on-lending mechanism for financing of the technical and energy
studies as agreed would be followed. The sub-borrowers concerned
would be required to ensure that the technical and energy studies
would be completed by March 31, 1986, according to the terms of
reference finalized during negotiations (para 6.08).
(iv)  Periodic progress reports on the execution of the project and
quarterly reports on technical and energy studies would be
submitted to the Bank for review within 30 days after the end of
the reporting period (para 6.15).
(v) The specified accounting and auditing procedures would be followed
and the reports would be submitted to the Bank as required
(para 6.17).
(vi)  A SL Completion Report would be submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the Closing Date of the Loan (para 6.18).
8.03     Assurances were obtained from Agrohemija that:
(i) Consultants for the technical and energy studies would be employed
in accordance with Bank Guidelines and the results of their
studies would be reviewed with the Bank (paras 6.08 and 6.09).
(ii)  A Project Implementation Working Group, to oversee the
implementation of the technical and energy studies and the staff
required to complete the monitoring forms as agreed during
negotiations, would be maintained (para 6.10).
(iii) The progress reports, according to the format as agreed during
negotiations, would be submitted to the Borrower (para 6.15).



-39-
8.04     Conditions for Loan Effectiveness
(i) Execution of an agreement between VB, Agrohemija and the eleven
Fertilizer Producers concerning the implementation of technical
studies (para 6.08), availability of fertilizer to the Trading
Agencies (para 5.03) and the preparation of periodic reports on
the quantity of fertilizer sale through retail shops (para 6.15).
(ii) Execution of a Self-Management Agreement between VB, Agrohemija,
the Fertilizer Producers and the Agricultural Agrokombinats,
ensuring that the Borrower would have access to adequate amounts
of foreign exchange (para 4.22).
(iii) A Project Implementation Working Group would be established and
staffed in Agrohemija on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (para 6.10).
8.05     Conditions of Disbursement
(i) The Second Tranche ($40.0 million) would only be released if there
were progress satisfactory to the Bank in the SL implementation
(para 6.16).
8.06     Subject to these Agreements, the SL is suitable for a Bank loan of
$90.0 million equivalent with a term of 15 years, including a three year grace
period.

Technical and Energy Audits of Fertilizer Plants
Draft Terms of Reference for Study
I. BACKGROUND
1.       At present, Yugoslavia has a large number of fertilizer plants,
operated by eleven companies, which were built during the period from 1954 to
1981.
The main units are the following:
i)    Four ammoniia plants with total capacity of 457,100 tpy N;
ii)    Two urea plants with total capacity of 91,000 tpy N;
iii)    Five nitric acid plants with total capacity of 190,400 tpy N;
iv)    Six calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) plants with total capacity of
268,000 tpy N;
v)    Thirteen NPK/MAP plants with total capacity of 249,600 tpy N;
vi)    Six phosphoric acid plants with total capacity of 400,000 tpy
P205, and related sulphuric acid plants;
vii)    Four SSP plants with capacity of 70,000 tpy P205;
viii)    Three TSP plants with total capacity of 130,000 tpy P205.
2.       In addition, the following plants are under construction:
i)    Two ammonia plants with total capacity of 624,000 tpy N;
ii)    Two urea plants with total capacity of 366,000 tpy N;
iii)    Two nitric acid plants with total capacity of 80,000 tpy N;
iv)    Two CAN plants with total capacity of 111,000 tpy n:
v)    Two phosphoric acid plants with capacity of 265,000 tpy P205
(one is a rehabilitation project);
vi)    Two NPK plants with a total capacity of 100,000 tpy N.
3.       Under normal capacity utilization, these plants will require the
import of nitrogen and phosphate raw materials and intermediates. The major
energy intensive areas of fertilizer production are in the production of
ammonia, the primary nitrogen source for all nitrogenous fertilizers. Two
existing ammonia plants were built in 1962 to 1970, at a time when the cost of
energy was low and plant design was based on minimizing investment cost and
accepting relatively high energy consumption. These ammonia plants consume
from 10.9 to 12.4 million kilocalories per ton of ammonia, compared to
consumptions in plants of more recent origin of 7.3 million kilocalories per
ton of ammonia. New plants being constructed today, using ICI technology,
consumes as low as 6.4 million kilocalories per ton of ammonia. The two new
ammonia plants to come in operation in 1983-1984 will have energy consumption
of about 8.8 million kilocalories per ton of ammonia. Although energy costs
d



-61-
ANNEX 9
Page 2
play a smaller role in the other plants, nevertheless, the same trend has been
observed in lower energy consumption in modern plants. Regarding the
phosphate fertilizer industry, the traditional source of sulphuric acid for
the production of phosphoric acid has been from the domestic smelting industry
and from local and imported pyrites. This source of sulphuric acid has given
Yugoslavia a competitive advantage in the production of phosphate fertilizers,
compared to other countries that may need to import both phosphate rock and
sulphur. However, additional production may require imports of sulphur, which
would affect adversely the viability of phosphoric acid production.
4.       Given the high international energy costs (for fuel oil about US$20
per million kilocalory), the Government of Yugoslavia is considering a program
to reduce fertilizer production costs and improve efficiency, specially
through energy conservation measures and more economic supply of sulphuric
acid. The first phase of this program will involve the execution of studies
by specialized technical consultants, in accordance with the objectives and
scope of work described below.
II. OBJECTIVES
5.       In order to enable the fertilizer producers to formulate a program
and assign priorities for economically justified investments and to plan for
the phase out of production units that cannot be made economic, the consultant
will.
i)   Carry out a production cost analysis including technical and
energy audits in all fertilizer plants, in order to assess their
operating and energy efficiencies;
ii)   Identify all potential sources of sulphur, sulphuric acid and
other major inputs (both local and foreign) to find out the most
economic sources of supply;
iii)   Identify the measures and investments that may be required to
reduce costs, and quantify the savings that may be achieved by
these investments and measures;
iv)   Assess the technical, financial and economic viability of the
identified investments as well as the viability of the production
unit after its rehabilitation;
v)   On the basis of the above analysis, group the plants into four
categories, i.e. plants that are economically viable and for
which no significant improvements can be made, plants that are
economically viable, but for which significant improvements can
be made by economic investments, plants that are currently
uneconomic, but which can be made viable by economically
justified investments, and plants that are currently uneconomic
and cannot be made viable by justified investments.
6.       The scope of work listed below is of a general nature, in order to
make it applicable to all plants. For each one of the plants to be studied,
specific plant-oriented scope of work will need to be prepared and agreed upon
with the plant management, by the Agrohemija project implementation group.

III. SCOPE OF WORK
7.       The consultant will review the proposed scope of work for each plant
with the management of that plant and with the Agrohemija project group and
agree on the detailed study program for the production units within the plant,
and the necessary review stages during the execution of the work.
8.       The consultant will carry out a comparison of present unit
performance with the design performance and with modern plants, in order to
determine whether current operations are economically viable and establish
those areas in the plant where significant disparities exist in terms of raw
material usage, energy consumed and use of other inputs. In addition the
consultant will study other aspects of the plant that give rise to high
production costs, such aspects may include; inadequate transport and storage
facilities for inputs (ammonia, nitrogen solutions, etc.), areas requiring
rehabilitation, equipment reliability, and design defects.
9.       On the basis of the above, the consultant will identify those factors
affecting production costs, in addition to energy consumption, that require
detailed study. The consultant will also study potential sources of raw
materials, including sulfuric acid and pyrites, to determine the most economic
sources of supply.
10.      The consultant will carry out a detailed energy audit in order to
establish the major areas of inefficient energy use. Such areas would
include: fired heaters, steam raising equipment, power generation, major
rotating equipment and drives, process equipment, waste heat recovery
equipment, utility supplies, etc.
11.      On the basis of the energy audits and other studies, the consultant
will identify potential energy and other cost saving measures and
investments. An illustrative list of such measures and investments is as
follows:
a)  Improved operating and maintenance practices
-  elimination of leakages
-  improved control of combustion processes
-  better insulation
-  cleaning of heat exchanger surfaces
- operation at optimal process conditions (flow, temperature and
pressure)
-  improved storage conditions
b)  Energy savings investments
- improved burner systems and combustion instrumentation
- combustion air preheaters
-  lower cost fuel
- replacement of fired heaters
- improved boiler water treatment facilities
-  desulphurization of burner fuel gas



-63-
ANNEX 9
Page 4
- waste heat recovery facilities, including economizers, steam
super heaters, and process preheaters
-  integration oi steam systems, including substitution of
turbine/electric motor drives
- steam/electricity cogeneration
-  process condensate collection systems
- replacement of obsolete compressors/turbines
- improvements of turbine condensors and vacuum systems
- power recovery from high pressure process streams
- variable speedi control for large process drives
- purge gas recovery units
-  selective oxidation units
-  improved cataLysts or use of larger catalyst volumes
- replacement of process equipment
- feed gas saturator for primary reformer
- electric condfensers to improve power factors
-  use of multipLe stage evaporators
c) Other investmentis
- transportation equipment
- increased storage capacity
- replacement of unreliable/high maintenance equipment
- correction of process design defects
12.      The consultant will carry out a preliminary analysis to generate
approximate investment costs iand savings in energy/operating costs. The
result of this analysis shall be reviewed with the plant management to
determine their technical acceptability, operational viability, and the
economic merits of the investiments.
13.      The consultant should establish the effect on the plant economics of
the proposed investments and establish whether the plant will become
economically viable as a result of the investments, and whether the economic
return thus generated justifies the proposed investments.
14.      On plants where new investments are clearly not justified and the
operation remains uneconomic, the consultant shall quantify the economic
penalties to the country of continued operations of the plant. The consultant
shall also recommend measures or other investments that may have to be
incurred if the uneconomic unit were to be closed down, i.e. storage,
transport and handling facilities for imported intermediaries.
15.      In plants in which new investments are justified, the consultant will
agree with the plant management on a short list of investments that the
preliminary analysis showed to be of economic priority. On these investments
the consultant will carry out further studies, including sufficient basic
design, to generate investment costs and savings estimates to an accuracy of
+ 15%, and suitable for subsequent investment decisions.
16.      The consultant will also prepare preliminary implementation schedule
and recommend suitable implementation arrangements.

Proposed System for Implementation of Fertilizer Industry Studies
Implementation Organization
1.       The Executive Board of Agrohemija would establish under the control
of the Board and within Agrohemija, a small group of professionals with the
necessary support staff to organize and supervise the implementation of the
studies.
2.       The group may consist of two or more engineers, an economist and a
secretary. The engineers and economist should be experienced in carrying out
feasibility studies and should be familiar with the production processes used
by the fertilizer industry. The staff for the group could possibly be
seconded, on a temporary basis, from some of the larger fertilizer enterprises.
Implementation
3.       The group would initially organize the basis for the study by:
a) Drawing up, in close consultation with each enterprise, the
detailed scope of work of the study to be carried out at each
enterprise covering those areas that constitute the major cost
components.
b) Agree with the enterprise the facilities and staff that the
enterprise will make available during the course of the studies.
c) Agree with the enterprises the review and supervisory procedures
to be used to monitor and control the studies.
d) Establish common standards and methodologies with all the
enterprises for carrying out the studies, e.g. prices and price
projections for energy, raw materials and finished products,
review procedures, methods for economic analyses, etc.
e) Agree with the enterprises on a timetable for carrying out the
studies at each plant.
4.       Resulting from the work described in pare 3, the group would prepare
the total scope of work and timetable covering all the studies, and based on
this invite proposals from qualified international engineering/consulting
companies to carry out the studies. The invitation to submit proposals would
specifically encourage the formation of joint ventures between international
companies and qualified Yugoslav engineering/consulting companies to submit
proposals.
5.       Based on evaluation criteria agreed with the various enterprises, the
group would evaluate the proposals and submit its recommendations to the
Executive Board regarding the ranking of the various proposals to enable the
Board to select the company to be awarded the contract to carry out the
studies.



-65-
ANNEX 9
Page 6
6.       During the carrying out of the studies the group would coordinate the
work of the consultants with the enterprises, monitor the work to ensure
compliance with the contract and timetable, maintenance of common standards,
and that the quality of work is acceptable. The group would report progress
of the studies to the Executive Board on a regular basis.
Analyses of Results
7.       The group would participate with each enterprise in the analysis of
the results of the study of that enterprise, and in the discussion of the
results of this analysis between each enterprise and the consultants. The
group would then assist each enterprise in drawing up the proposed plan of
action to implement those recommendations that are considered economically
attractive and technically viable.
Plan of Action
8.       The consolidated plan of action for the total industry resulting from
para 7 could form the basis fcor discussions with the World Bank for a possible
loan to implement the agreed recommendations of the studies.
