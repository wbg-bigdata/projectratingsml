FIRST lIGGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2337-MAS)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.          This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First
Highway Project in Mauritius, for which Loan 2337-MAS in the amount of
US$15.2 million was approved on July 26, 1983. The Loan was closed on
June 30, 1989, two years behind schedule. It was disbursed to the
amount of US$1J.072 million and US$2.128 million were canceled. The
last disbursement was made on November 8, 1989.
2.          The Project was completed below estimated costs at
appraisal. The Loan Closing Date was extended for two years to allow
for total execution of the Project. This delay was mainly due to
Government's slow decision-making process and contractor's slow
mobilization and lack of proper site management, and some unforeseen
utility works in the execution of the main component of the Project, the
strengthening and improvement of main roads.
3.          This PCR (Parts I and III) has been prepared by the
Infrastructure Operations Division, Eastern Africa Department. It is
based, inter-alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement,
supervision reports, co,respondence between the Bank and the Borrower,
and internal Bank memoranda. The Borrower was requested to provide Part
II of this report and project related information, however, no response
has been received.

FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2337-MAS)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
1.          The Project was designed to protect the capital investment
in selected main roads and improve the capacity of the Ministry of Works
(MOW) to plan investments, prepare and monitor projects, carry out road
maintenance operations and enforce traffic regulations. To achieve
these objectives the Project included:
(i) strengthening and improNement of main road sections
totilling about 75 km;
(ii)  improvement to MOW's main workshop;
(iii) construction of a vehicle inspection center;
(iv)  establishment and equipping of mechanized patching
units;
(v) assistance for vehicle weight control; and
(vi)  consultant services.
2.          The Project was successfully completed below the estimated
cost at appraisal (para. 6.01) and with Economic Rates of Return (ERR)
exceeding the appraisal estimates (para. 7.01). The Loan Closing Date
was extended for two years to allow for total execution of the Project.
The delay was mainly due to Government's slow decision-making process
and the contractor's slow mobilization and lack of proper site
management and some unforeseen utility works in the execution of the
main component of the Project, the strengthening and improvement of 75
km of main roads. These works were satisfactorily completed and their
quality was good (para. 5.03).
3.          Local contractors satisfactorily completed the improvement
of MOW's workshop and construction of a vehicle inspection center
(paras. 5.05 and 5.06). Local suppliers satisfactorily delivered, on
time and at contracted reasonable prices, road equipment and weigh-
bridges (paras. 5.07 and 5.08). Consultants performed reasonably well
except that their services were unsatisfactory during the bid evaluation
stage and the detailed engineering and bidding documents they prepared
had to be improved upon by Bank staff.



-    1   --
4.           Good performance of the Borrower and the Bank contributed to
the achievement of the Project objectives. Both institutions
collaborated in design and supervision of all components of the Project.
Collaboration succeeded in (i) focusing Government's attention on road
maintenance operations for which adequate financing has been provided
ever since; (ii) establislment in MOW of a Unit which is properly
planning road investments; and (iii) establishment and implementation of
traffic regulations.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I  PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.  Project Identity
Project Name:      First Highway Project
Loan No.           2337-MAS
RVP Unit           Eastern Africa Department
Infrastructure Operations Division
Country            Mauritius
Sector             Transport
Subsector   :      Highways
2. Background
2.01        Mauritius, a small middle-income country, is a 2,400 sq km
island located in the Indian Ocean about 2,400 km from the African
mainland. Its transport system comprises about 1,800 km of roads of
which about 90% are paved, one deep-water port at Port Louis and an
international airport at Plaisance. There are no railways, pipeline,
coastal shipping or inland waterways. As the port and airport are for
external travel only, roads constitute the only means of internal
travel.
2.02        With the exception of motorways (27 km), most of Mauritius'
roads originated as agricultural tracks which were progressively
improved but without proper design and construction. As a result,
pavements are of varying quality, structurally weak, lack drainage and
can no longer adequately handle the heavy traffic flows which vary from
about 1,000 vehicles per day (vpd) to 10,000 vpd. Many roads are
confined between agricultural fields (sugarcane), with insufficient room
for adequate shoulders, and roadside drainage systems. At appraisal,
routine road maintenance operations carried out by the Ministry of Works
(MOW), could no longer arrest road deterioration due to the heavy volume
of traffic. This had caused a backlog of road maintenance, and high
accidents rates. This network thus needed improvement, strengthening
and adequate maintenance to provide an acceptable level of service to
the road users. The First Highway Project was designed to improve these
conditions, concentrating on 75 km of the most travelled main road
sections. The Second Highway Project has been designed and is under
execution; it continues and expands these activities with a four-year
program of road improvement, strengthening and maintenance.

2.03        The First Highway Proiect constitutes the Bank's second
investment in the transport sector. In 1974 and 1976, the Bank financed
the extension and modernization of the port of Port Louis with loans of
US$10.0 million (Ln. 976-MAS) and US$3.6 trillion (1339-T-MAS). The
Project was co-financed by U.K. bilateral aid (US$3.0 million), and UNDP
(US$514,000). This Project financed the construction of three berths,
two transit sheds, a container handling and storage area, a workshop
block, an administration building, port entrance dredging, procurement
of cargo handling equipment and technical assistance. The Project,
which was completed with a four-year delay in March 1983, improved the
capacit) of the port and the management of its operations.l/
3. Project Oblectives and Description
Project Objectives
3.01        The objectives of the Froject were to: (i) protect the
capital investment in selected main roads and to increase their service
life; (ii) improve the capacity of the Ministry of Works (MOW) for
planning road investments, project preparation and monitoring of
execution of works; (iii) help improve MOW's technical Department's
capacity for road maintenance; and (iv) assist in enforcing vehicle
weight and traffic safety regulations.
Project Description
3.02        The Project consisted of:
(i) strengthening and improvement of main road sections,
totalling about 75 km ;
(ii) improvement to MOW's main workshop;
(iii) construction of a vehicle inspection center;
(iv) establishment and equipping of mechanized patching units;
(v) assistance for vehicle weight control; and
(vi) consultant services.
4.  Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        The Project was identified in January 1978, it was prepased
from mid-1978 to mid-1982, and was appraised in December 1982. TO `,
delay was due to Government's slow decision-making process. The Project
was designed to alleviate traffic jams on the main road network, protect
the country's capital investment on these roads, properly carry out road
maintenance operations and provide safety to the road users. The

feasibility studies and detailed engineering for strengthening and
improvement of main roads were carried out by consultants under a
Project Preparation Facility (Advance No. P043-'.AS) financed by the
Bank. The design for the improvement to MOW's main workshop and
construction of a vehicle inspection center were based on architectural
plans satisfac_orily prepared by MOW's Technical Department. The
Project was to be financed by a Bank Loan of US$15.2 million covering
total foreign costs, and a Government contribution of US$8.96 covering
local costs including taxes estimated at US$3.16 million. (Qven the
fact that existing road conditions were becoming a major constraint to
the country's economic growth, the Project concept and design were
considered timely and appropriate.
4.02        Under the Project, the responsibility for the implementation
of civil works, road maintenance, traffic management, procurement and
supervision of consultants was assigned to the Technical Department of
MOW. The actual civil works for road strengthening, improvement of the
workshop and construction of a vehicle inspection center were to be
carried out by contractors; consultants were to supervise road
strengthening and improvement works.
4.03        The scope of the Project and institutional arrangements for
implementation as envisaged during appraisal were reasonable.
Implementation difficulties as alluded to below were largely due to
Government's slow decision-making process.
5. Prolect Implementation and Results
5.01        Project implementation was slow in starting.  Although the
Loan Agreement was signed on September 29, 1983, the Loan became
effective only on October 26, 1984, about ten months behind schedule.
The delay was due to Government difficulties in obtaining access to the
land required for the Project, which was a condition of effectiveness.
Compared to the original implementation schedule (Table 3) there were
considerable delays, varying from about two years to five years in
starting the implementation of all components of the Project. This was
generally a result of the Government's and MOW's Technical Department's
slow decision-making process.
(i) Strengthening and Improvement of Main Roads (75 km Annex A)
5.02        The bids were received on April 3, 1985, and the contract
was awarded to the lowest evaluated contractor on November 29, 1985.
This eight-month delay was due to protracted dialogue between the
Government and the Bank. Contrary to the procurement arrangement
prescribed in the bid documents, Government, on the recommendations of
consultants wanted to award the contract for two lots to a bidder other
than the lowest evaluated bidder for the three lots. However, the
Bank's position prevailed and the contract was awarded to the lowest
evaluated bidder.



5.03        Construction started on January 29, 1986 for an execution
period of 19 months. Works were finally completed on December 14, 1988
r a total execution period of about 36 months. The delay was due to
the contractor's slow mobilization and lack of proper site management,
and additional unforseen works. These additional works included: (i)
utility works consisting of displacement and replacement of water mains
and house connections, telecommunication and electric cables,
construction of utility ducts and laying of house sewer lines for future
development. Materials and supplies for these works were provided by
the Central Water Authority (CWA) and the Telecommunication Department
under a separate contract with the contractor, while civil works were
carried out under the road contract; (ii) improvement and lengthening of
footpaths and drains; aiid (iii) strengthening of pavements, as the
existing pavements were found weaker than at design stage.
5.04        Despite these additional works, the final cost of this
component was US$18.83 million equivalent or about 13% lower than the
appraisal estimate of US$21.67 million including contingencies. These
savings were the result of the low initial bid resulting from the ICB
process (para 5.02).
(ii) Improvement to MOW's Main Workshop
5.05        The improvement to MOW's main workshop at Plaine Lauzun, as
appraised, consisted of construction of a spare parts store, sheds for
mechanical work and painting, an oxtension to the service station and
constructic of a messroom-cum-office block. To these were added
extensive site and services works at the execution stage. The execution
of this component was completed about four and half years later than
scheduled (Table 3). Although satisfactory architectural drawings
existed at appraisal, MOW's Technical Department was very slow in
preparing bidding documents and the contract. Following local
competitive bidding, bids were received on July 15, 1987, the contract
awarded to a local firm, the lowest evaluated bidder, on November 23,
1987. Construction started on February 1, 1988 and was successfully
completed in June 1989. The final cost was 19% less than estimated at
appraisal: US$430,000 compared to US$530,000 including contingencies.
(iii) Construction of a Vehicle Inspection Center
5.06        To increase MOW's capacity for vehicle inspection to handle
the larger fleet, it was anticipated, at appraisal, that a new
inspection center would be built at Phoenix. At the execution stage,
this site could not be secured since it had been used for industrial
development. A new site was acquired in mid 1987. Due to the change
and acquisition of site and the slow pace of preparation of bidding
documents by MOW's Technical Department, the execution of this component
was completed about five years later than anticipated at appraisal
(Table 3). Following local competitive bidding, bids were received in
January 1989, the contract awarded to a local contractor, the lowest
evaluated bidder, in February 1989 and works were satisfactorily
completed in November 1989. Due to time delays and extensive works for
the impro-ement of the new site, this component's final cost was about



- 5 -
twice the appraisal estimate: US$.70,000 comnared to US$440,000
including contingencies.
(iv) Establishment and Equipping of Mecnanical Patchin&g Units
5.07        The Project was designed to increase MOW's capacity to carry
out force account routine road maintenance operations by setting up
mechanized brigades equipped with patching equipment. The execution of
this component was complet-d about five years later than planned
(Table 3) because: (i) MOW had to review Its overall needs for road
maintenance equipment In light of che findings of a road maintenance
study carried out by consultants under bilateral assistance; and (ii)
slow preparation of bidding documents and award of contracts. After the
review of the maintenance study MOW settled on procuring two truck-
mounted and four tractor-towed patching units, and six mobile-breaker
rollers compared to 10 towed patching units and 10 pedestrian controlled
double drum vibrating rollers envisaged at appraisal. Following local
competitive bidding, bids for two separate lots were received in
November 1988, contracts were awarded to two local suppliers, the lowest
evaluated bidders, in March 1989, and the equipment was delivered in
August 1989. This equipment's final cost was about twice the original
estimates: US$530,000 compared to US$270,000 including contingencies due
to delays and upgrade in the quality of equipment compared with the
appraisal estimates. With this equipment, six patching units were
established and became functional b/ end 1989.
(v) Assistance for Vehicle Weight Control
5.08        To prevent premature road deterioration and protect the
capital investment made in the network, the Project provided for setting
up maximum vehicle weight and axle-load regulations and their
enforcement, and procurement of three portable weigh-bridges to assist
in this effort. On April 11, 1985, about three months later than
expected, Government set up maximum vehicle and axle-load regulations by
an amendment to its Road Traffic Regulations. These provided for an
acceptable maximum axle-load of 10 tons, and maximal vehicle weight of
24 tons, up from 22 tons enacted in the original regulations. In the
first quarter of 1987, MOW and the traffic police started enforcing the
new regulations using a portable weigh-bridge procured by Government in
February 1985 under the Urban Rehabilitation Project financed by the
Saudi Fund. Following local competitive bidding, bids for the
procurement of the three portable weigh-bridges and a calibration unit
were received in October 1987, the contract was awarded to a local
supplier, the lowest evaluated bidder, in March 1988, and the equipment
was delivered in August 1988. The final cost of the component was
US$50,000 close to the estimated cost of US$60,000 (Table 4). This
component was completed about four years later than planned. This delay
was due to slow administrative procedures and MOW's initiative to test
the implementation of the new regulations before carrying them out on a
national scale.



- 6-
(vi) Consultant Services
5.09        A consulting firm was retained for feasibility studies,
detailed engineering, and preparation of bidding documents for the
strengthening and improvement of 75 km of main roads. The detailed
engineering and bidding documents were satisfactory after extensive
comments provided by the Bank. The engineering services were financed
by a Bank PPF (PO43MAS) of US$246,000 of which US$201,985.81 was
utilized to complete these tasks (Table 4). The same consulting firm
was retained for bid evaluation, contract award and supervision of
work.. In recommending contract award other than to the lowest
evaluated bidder, consultants disregarded the evaluation criteria
prescribed in the bidding documents and this led to an eight month delay
in award of contract (para. 5.02). The contract was finally awarded to
the lowest evaluated bidder. Consultant services thus were
unsatisfactory during the bid evaluation stage. Consultants, however,
satisfactorily carried out their work in the supervision stage by, inter
alia, adapting and improving the design during Project execution. The
final cost of their services was about twice the appraisal estimates,
US$1.61 million compared to US$0.84 million including contingencies
(Table 4), due to about a 100% increase of the period of execution (para
5.03).
6. Project Costs and Financing
6.01        The actual costs of the Project (Table 4) was US$22.61
million with a foreign component of US$ 14.4 million (63%) and local
component of US$8.47 million (37%) compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$24.16 million with a foreign component of US$15.2 million (63%) and a
local component of US$8.96 million (37%). The savings of US$1.55
million were due to the low price of works for the strengthening and
improvement of main roads (para 5.04).
6.02        The Bank made a loan a US$15.2 million to the Government of
Mauritius to finance the entire foreign cost of the Project as designed.
However, due to savings made during Project execution and the
Government's desire to limit its foreign debts, only US$13,072,400.76
were utilized for total completion of the Project. The disbursements
(Table 5) followed the pace of Project execution, and closing date was
extended from June 30, 1987 to June 30, 1989 for this purpose. The last
disbursement was made on November 8, 1989. The undisbursed balance of
US$2,127,599.24 was canceled on November 8, 1989.
7. Economic Re-evaluation
7.01        The Project produced the expected bener ts with Economic
Rates of Return (ERR) exceeding those at appraisal. The overall ERR for
the civil works is about 48% as compared to 40% at appraisal. More
about the economic impact of the Project is in Part III Annex A. The
main benefits derived from the project are: (a) elimination of costly
repairs and overlays otherwise necessary to keep the roads usable; and
(b) savings in vehicle operating costs. Additional benefits will result



- 7 -
from improved road safety but because they are difficult to quantifv
they were not included in the re-calculation of the ERRs.
7.02        The major direct beneficiaries of the reduced transport
costs and improved road safety will be passenger car owners and truck
and bus owners/operators. Since the road transporc industry is highly
competitive, it is expected that a high proportion of these benefits
will be passed on to transport users -- urban/rural population and to
the consumers of goods being transported in the roads' zones.
7.03        The Proiect also achieved its main institutional objectives
regarding improved maintenance organization, introduction of vehicle
weight c)ntrol, improved safty and environmental impact (vehicle
inspection). The follow-up Project (Loan 3121-MAS) extended
implementation of these institutional objectives.
8. Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
8.01        The consultants who carried out the design and preparation
of bidding documents far the strengthening and improvement of 75 km of
main roads, performed reasonably well. However, their services were
unsatisfactory during bid evaluation stage and the detailed engineering
and bidding documents were improved by the Bank to make the final
documents acceptable (para 5.09). The same consultants satisfactorily
carried out the supervision of works; they adapted and improved the
design during Project execution.
8.02        The contractor carried out the strengthening and improvement
works on the 75 km of main roads with delays caused in Project execution
by his slow mobilization and lack of proper site management (5.03). Two
local contractors satisfactorily completed the improvement of MOW's
workshop and construction of a vehicle inspection center.
8.03        Local suppliers satisfactorily delivered on time and at
contracted prices, road equipment and weigh-bridges.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.01        The Borrower is credited for a timely assessment of the
conditions of the country's road network. This led to the appropriate
Project concept and design to prevent these conditions from becoming a
major constraint to the country's economic growth. The Government
complied with loan covenants (Table 6), and, more importantly, provided
adequate financing for road maintenance operations and established and
started implementing maximum axle-load regulations. MOW staff
satisfactorily prepared architectural plant for improvement of the
workshop and construction of a vehicle inspection center, and properly
supervised the execution of the Project.
9.02        The Government could have been more diligent in fulfilling
the condition of loan effectiveness, and in the preparation of bidding
documents, evaluation of bids and awards of contracts for the execution
of civil works and procurement of equipment. The slow decision making



-8-
process caused an overall three and half-year delay in the
implementation of the Project.
10. Bank's Performance
10.01       The Bank's Project concept and design were timely and
appropriate given the fact that prevailing road conditions were beconming
a major constraint to the country's economic growth. Supervision
missions were timely and their suggestions resulted in a better
execution of the Project. More importantly, the Bank's extensive
comments improved the design and execution of the civil works components
of the Project. The Bank helped to focus Gc- rnment's attention on road
maintenance operations and protection of cl i 1 Investment made on the
road network, resulting in adequate funding    -ad maintenance
operations, improved road conditions and ez   ;ishment and
implementation of maximum axle-load regula,
10.02 Lessons
(i)   design and execution of road projects in Mauritius
should include extensive utility works. The design
and implementation of the Second Highway Project have
benefitted from this knowledge. This new Project
integrates road and utility works; and
(ii)    on procurement issue, an understanding should be
reached between the Bank and the Government at the
beginning of each Project, that bidding documents and
prequalification of bidders are binding and not to be
modified by the Government at the evaluation stage.
This could avoid protracted debates at the execution
stage. The Bank and Government have reached such an
understanding at the beginning of the Second Highway
Project.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
On April 11, 1990, the Borrower was requested to complete Part II
of the PCR by mid-May 1990. However, up to February 21, 1991, no
response was received.

1/    Due to traffic congestion (reduced savings in roes) lower; the
roads should be expanded to a four lane devided highway.
2/    Actual traffic on these roads in 1989 was much higher then
expected.
The economic re-evaluation was carried out by comparing
"with" and "without" the Project cases. In the "without" the Project
case, it was assumed that the roads will remain usable provided costly
overlays in the form of single and/or double grouting are laid at five
to seven year intervals depending on the road condition and traffic
volume. It was assumed further that, even with such treatment, the
condition of the roads which are already of low standards would continue
to deteriorate over time. In the "With" the Project case it was assumed
that significant improvements to the roads (pavement strengthening,
improvement of geometrics, widening/reconstruction of shoulders and
imorovement of roadside drains) would be made not only to eliminate the

need for costly overlays but also to protect the capital investments in
roads and to reduce VOCs over the estimated 20-year life of the works.
The economic re-evaluation was carried out in 1988 prices
with exchange rate of US$1=MR 13.5. The civil works were completed by
the end of 1988. The average annual daily traffic on the Project roads
in 1989/90 was higher than anticipated at appraisal and ranged between
1,500 - 8,590 vpd; the exception is the Pn,rt Louis-St. Jean Road with
about 18,000 vpd. The actual traffic is 'aigher than estimated at
appraisal. After such a traffic growth in tlke re-calculation of the
ERRs a moderate growth rate of 2% per year was assumed. The overall ERR
for the project is about 48% as compared to 40% in the SAR. The ERR is
somewhat higher than anticipated mainly due to the traffic which
developed beyond the traffic forecast made at appraisal.
