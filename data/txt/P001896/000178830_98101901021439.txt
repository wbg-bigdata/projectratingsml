MAURITIUS
HIGHWAYS PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
t
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Mauritius (see Map IBRD 16945) lies in the Indian Ocean about 900
km east of Madagascar and about 2,400 km from the African coast. In
addition to the main island, Mauritius, there are a few smaller islands
scattered in the Indian Ocean, most important of which is Rodrigues. The
main island is about 2,000 km2 just over half of which is arable land; the
rest is made up of rocks and mountainous slopes too steep for cultivation.
With the exception of a few rocky areas, mostly along the sea coast, the
terrain does not pose too much difficulty for land transport. However, the
country is subject to cyclones between December and March which sometimes
cause severe damage to the infrastructure and the whole economy.
1.02      The population of 940,000 on the main island (1981), with the
highest density in Africa of about 470 inhabitants per km2 grew at 1.6% per
annum over the period 1977-81. In addition, about 32,000 people live in
Rodrigues and other small islands. Due to the high density and close
proximity of urban areas to one another, distinction between urban and
rural areas is difficult to make. This is also reflected in the traffic
patterns on the island.
1.03      Mauritius has basically a monostructural economy with about 90%
of the arable land under sugarcane crop; sugar accounts for over 70% of
export earnings. The economy is therefore extremely sensitive to
fluctuation in both sugar production and its world market price. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was about US$1,350 in 1981, placing
Mauritius in the middle income group of developing countries. In the
period 1976-79, GDF in constant prices grew at a high rate of 6.5% per
year. Thereafter, however, the country's economic situation started to
deteriorate markedly, partly due to two successive bad sugarcane crops
(1980/81 and 1981/82) and partly due to expansionary financial policy and
the resulting imbalance created in the economy.  Disastrous cyclones in
1980 aggravated the situation further and caused the Government to take
austerity measures -- curbing new capital investments and giving emphasis
to preserving past investments and completion of projects already started.

B. The Transport System
1.04      The transport system in Mauritius is simple; it comprises 1,787
km of roads, of which 90% are bituminized, one deep-water port at Port
Louis and an international airport at Plaisance. There are no railways,
pipeline, coastal shipping or inland waterways. As the port and the
airport are for external communications only, the road transport is the
only means of internal communications. Roads, however, with a few
exceptions, have very low geometric design standards, but the accessibility
is good. Transport communication with the other sparsely populated islands
is irregular except with the island of Rodrigues to which Air Mauritius
provides a regular service with a small aircraft.
Highways
1.05      Details of the highway subsector are given in subchapter C.
Port
1.06      Port Louis, the country's only deep-water port, has five berths,
two of which are for container traffic. It also has separate terminals for
sugar export and for import of fuel. Under a Bank-financed project (Para.
1.46), the port capacity has been significantly increased and is expected
to be adequate to meet the country's needs in the foreseeable future!/- In
addition, a food grain facility at the port is being built with African
Development Bank (ADB) and BADEA assistance. Average waiting time for ships
of 30 days in 1978 has been completely eliminated and the port operations
have become more efficient. The preparation of a master plan for future
land use in the port areas which is proposed to be financed by FAC (France)
is expected to start in 1983.
1.07      Traffic volume in the port is heavily influenced by sugar
production and its export which on an average is about 700,000 tons per
annum, compared to a total port traffic of 1.7 million tons in 1981/82. In
the period 1977/78-1981/82, traffic in the port declined on an average by
5% per year (Annex I, Table 1) due to the difficult economic situation in
the country and consequent reductions in external trade. Container
traffic, however, has been gradually increasing reaching about 192,000 tons
in 1981/82 or 11% of the total port traffic.  Cargo handling in the port is               t
done efficiently by a private company (Consolidated Cargo Services
Mauritius, Ltd.) under the auspice of Mauritius Marine Authority (MMA).
Government is, however, considering creating a cargo handling corporation
and the Bank has been in dialogue with the Government on this subject;
the dialogue will be continued. The management of the port, is generally
satisfactory; all its staff, except one pilot, is local. MMA has
administrative and financial autonomy under the Prime Minister's Office.
1/   The port facilities for general cargo and for containerized cargo were
used at 60% capacity in 1981/82.

Its financial position has been good and net revenue increased from Rs 11.9
million in FY80 to Rs 16 million in FY82 (US$1.45 million equivalent).
Civil Aviation
1.08      In view of Mauritius' long distance to the African mainland and
to the rest of the world, air transport has particular importance for
international communication. Mauritius is well served by air transport
services extended by 12 airlines providing 25 scheduled flights per week to
and from Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. In addition to the
international airport at Plaisance, capable of accommodating Boeing 747
aircraft, there is a small airport on Rodrigues island served by Air
Mauritius (AM) three times per week. The Civil Aviation Department (CAD)
under the Prime Minister's Office is responsible for the planning,
development and operation of air transport on the islands. In addition, CAD
is in charge of establishing landing fees, airport passenger charges and
other airport related taxes.
1.09      Passenger traffic at the Plaisance international airport has been
growing steadily at an annual rate of 3%, reaching about 338,000 passengers
and 7,250 tons of freight in 1981 (Annex I, Table 2). In the same year,
the airport in Rodrigues handled only 6,400 passengers and 15 tons of
freight. With the growth of tourism, the traffic at Plaisance airport is
expected to grow further, requiring improvements and modernization of
airport facilities (Para. 1.44).
1.10      AM has mixed ownership with a Government share of 51%, the
balance being made up by British Airways, Air France and Air India. AM
operates three aircrafts: Boeing 707-B (to Rome, London, Johannesburg);
Boeing 737 (to Nairobi, Bombay, Moroni) and a Twin Otter (to Reunion and
Rodrigues). Due to improved efficiency of operations (increased capacity
utilization, opening of new profitable routes, and cutting down on
operating costs) a profit of about Rs 28 million (about US$2.5 million
equivalent) was achieved in FY82, after 2 years of small losses. The
number of passengers carried by AM increased in FY82 to 108,000 or by 36%
from the previous year, while passenger/km increased by 55%. Local
staffing is being improved; in 1982 there were 10 Mauritian pilots and 4
expatriates.
C.   The Highway Subsector
1) The Network
1.11      The road network consists of 1,787 km of classified roads.
Except for 176 km of rural roads which have a gravel surface, all roads are
bituminized. The roads are classified into four categories: motorways,
main roads, urban roads and rural roads with the following lengths (Table
1.1):



- 4 -
Table 1.1
Road Network
Category                           Length
Motorways                             26
Main Roads                           837
Urban Roads                          578
Rural Roads                          346
Total         1,787
1.12      The motorways comprise the Port Louis-Phoenix link ( 15 km) and
the Port Louis-Pamplemousses (Calebasses) link ( 11 km) which serve to
relieve traffic congestion in and around Port Louis. The main roads
constitute principal links of the country's road network and connect
district headquarters and main population centers with one another and with
Port Louis, the Capital City. The Urban roads are defined as those roads
other than motorways and main roads lying within the boundaries of
proclaimed municipalities, and the rural roads as being roads other than
motorways and main roads lying outside municipal areas. The latter form
the tertiary network serving local polulation centers and agricultural
areas. The road link between Port Louis and Mahebourg forms the principal
route connecting the towns of Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill, Quatre Bornes, Vacoas
Phoenix, and Curepipe to the Plaisance Airport. The density of the road
network (0.9 km per km2) is highest in the region; accessibility is
good and almost every village on the island is served by an all-weather
road.
1.13      With the exception of motorways, most of Mauritius' roads
originated as agricultural tracks which were progressively improved but
without proper studies for their layout or design. Due to the progressive
improvements done, the road pavements are heterogenous and structurally
weak, and are in need of strengthening. There is also lack of adequate
drainage along most roads. Many roads are confined between agricultural
(sugarcane) fields, with not enough room to provide adequate shoulders and
side-drains. The road reserve, about 1.5 m on either side of the pavement,
meant for depositing materials, etc. for road maintenance is often
encroached by farmers with their plantings. Under the Road Ordinance
(1966), Government has the authority to prescribe improvement lines for
road widening, however, due to the strong lobby of sugarcane industry in
the country land acquisition is expensive, difficult and time consuming.

(2)   Road Use
Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
1.14      The motor vehicle fleet in 1981 totalled about 52,000 vehicles,
of which 2,200 were owned by the Government. The relative size of the
fleet is one of the highest in Africa -- about 23 inhabitants per vehicle
(excluding motorcycles). Over the period 1976-81, the annual average
growth of the fleet was about 5%, however, due to the prevailing economic
situation in the country, there had been stagnation in the size of the
fleet during 1979-81. lhe highest growth recorded was for vans and
pick-ups (9.7%). Most of the fleet is made up of light vehicles (84%),
while trucks make up 8.5% and buses 3% (Table 1.2).

1.15      Since 1976/1977, systematic traffic counts have been carried out
on the main road network by the Traffic Section of the Technical Division
(TD) under the Ministry of Works (MOW) using automatic counters. The
traffic volumes on the main roads are high -- exceeding 300 vehicles per
day (vpd); some road sections, particularly in urban locations, carry
several thousand vehicles per day.

Fuel Consumption and Price
1.16      The consumption of gasoline has been declining since 1979 due to
difficulties in the economy which called for import restrictions. In the
period 1977-81, the average annual decline in consumption was about 6%
(Annex I, Table 3).  The consumption of diesel fuel, however, increased in
the same period at a moderate annual rate of 2%, due mostly to a steady
growth of bus passenger transport.
1.17     The fuel pricing policy of the Government is reasonable; there are
no subsidies. The retail price 2/ of gasoline (super) is US$0.68 per
liter or US$2.58 per US gallon and of diesel fuel, US$0.41 per liter or
US$1.55 per US gallon (Table 1.3). The import duties on fuel, about 40%
for gasoline and 10% for diesel fuel, are the major source of Government
revenues from road users (Para. 1.33).

Road Transport Industry
1.18      Passenger transport is generally regulated, while freight
transport is deregulated. The former is handled by 4-5 major transporters
with a total fleet of about 800 buses and by over 200 owner-operators with
about 450 buses. The bussing fleet is generally in good condition with
about 75% being 4 years old or less. The National Transport Authority
(NTA), under the MOW, regulates the industry and provides passenger public
carriers with licenses and route allocations.  NTA also regulates tariffs.
The latest tariff became effective in January 1982. The passenger rates
are Re 075 for the first mile and Re 0.25 for each subsequent mile; the
rate is made up on commercial basis and covers costs. Due to surplus
capacity of the bus fleet there is fierce competition among the carriers
and some -- usually smaller ones -- occasionally go out of business.
1.19      One of the major carriers in passenger transport is the National
Transport Corporation (NTC), the only parastatal company, created in
1980. NTC has a fleet of about 240 buses, covering about 20% of the
passenger transport on the main island. So far, its operations have been
satisfactory. On its routes NTC has achieved a good load factor of 78%,
and in less than three years made a profit of about Rs 1.2 million (about
US$0.11 million equivalent). NTC reports to a Board of Directors composed
of various ministries and local authorities.
1.20      Freight transport is carried fully by private operators.  With
about 3,500 trucks in use, the capacity is slightly higher than the
demand. There are no restrictions for entry into the industry and no
official tariffs. The transport rates are negotiable; the rates for the
main client -- the sugar industry -- are regulated by contract; actual
rates applied range between Rs 1.0-2.0 per ton/mile, depending on haul,
load, vehicle size, commodity type. While the passenger carriers are
organized in three unions, freight transporters have no union.
1.21      The Government is undertaking a Public Transport Study under the
Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project (Loan 1926-MAS) with
co-financing by the Saudi Fund. The study which is expected to commence in
the second half of 1983 will review passenger and freight transport
regulations and will make recommendations for improving public transport
management, routing, pricing policies, etc. The Terms of Reference for the
study have been reviewed by the Bank. At negotiations Government agreed to
exchange views with the Bank on the study's findings and to take follow up
action satisfactory to the Bank (Para. 4.01 (i)).



- 8 -
1.22      Road traffic regulations are enforced by police traffic units.
The road traffic accident rate has been on the decline since 1980 (Annex I,
Table 4), but is still relatively high taking into account the size of the
population. Vehicle technical inspection -- fitness certificate -- is
issued by NTA and is obtained on the basis of an inspection by the vehicle
examination center. For new commercial vehicles the certificate is issued
for one year in the first instance and for three months to one year
thereafter, depending on the state of the vehicle.  For new private cars,
there is one vehicle inspection in the first year, none for the following
six years and annually thereafter.
1.23      Under the Road Traffic Ordinance (1962), the Government is
empowered to prescribe maximum laden weight and maximum axle-load of
vehicles. According to the current regulations, no vehicle with a gross
vehicle weight in excess of 22 tons is allowed to ply on public roads,
except with the special permission of the Commissioner of Police and the
Permanent Secretary of the MOW. However, no limit has been fixed for the
axle-load. The Government is now considering increasing the maximum gross
vehicle weight limit from 22 tons to 35 tons and to make regulations fixing
the maximum axle-load of vehicles; the maximum load for a single axle is
proposed to be 10 tons which is appropriate. During negotiations, it was
agreed with Government that it will, by December 31, 1984, make and enforce
adequate regulations for vehicle weight, axle-load and dimensions
limitations in the country (Para. 4.01 (ii)).
3) Administration, Staffing & Training
1.24      The TD of the MOW is responsible for construction, improvement
and maintenance of motorways and main roads, and also for construction and
maintenance of buildings. Rural roads are administered by the three
district councils, while the upkeep and maintenance of urban roads is the
responsibility of the five municipal councils. Local authorities rely
mostly on Central Government for funds. Due to the lack of adequate funds,
their standards of performance are low and they cannot afford to employ the
range of staff required to perform their functions. Government is
currently considering reorganization of the district and municipal
councils. While the Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project includes,
inter alia, strengthening of the institutions responsible for urban
planning, development and maintenance, the proposed Technical Assistance
Project related to the SAL will include a study on the needs and
organization of rural road maintenance.
1.25      The TD comprises eight sections: Roads, Buildings, Materials
Laboratory, Traffic, Mechanical, Sewerage, Quantity Surveying and
Architecture. Each of these sections, except Quantity Surveying and
Architecture, are headed by Principal Engineers; the Quantity Surveying and
Architecture Sections are headed by a Quantity Surveyor and Principal



- 9 -
Architect respectively; they all report to the Chief Engineer. The
organization structure of the TD is shown in Chart I.
1.26      The TD has a well equipped materials testing laboratory located
at its headquarters in Phoenix. About 70% of the workload in the
laboratory relates to design and investigation work for roads. The TD
extends its laboratory facilities to private firms; it assisted consultants
in carrying out geotechnical investigations for strengthening and
improvement of the project roads.  The Materials Laboratory is staffed by a
Principal Engineer, a material testing officer, 5 material testing
assistants, 7 laboratory attendants, and a number of other staff.
1.27      The Mechanical Engineering Section is responsible for the repair
and maintenance of vehicles and plant of various Government
ministries/departments. It is staffed by a Principal Engineer, 2
mechanical engineers, 2 mechanical officers, a workshop supervisor and a
number of support staff, and has a work force of about 105 tradesmen
(mechanics, electricians, fitters, blacksmiths, etc.). Besides, there are
some 75 apprentice tradesmen. The MOW's main mechanical workshop in Port
Louis handles all major overhauls and repairs for vehicles and plant, while
five mechanical outposts (at Mahebourg, vacoas, Centre de Flacq, Rose-Hill
and Terre Rouge) take care of light repairs and routine servicing. About
60% of the overall workload in the workshop relates to TD's vehicles and
plant. The workshop has adequate equipment and tools, but it lacks
facilities for storage of spare parts, sheds for repair and servicing of
vehicles and plant, etc. The project will help in providing these
facilities (Para. 2.10).
1.28      Finance Section of the MOW maintains TD's accounts of all capital
and recurrent expenditures on works. The Finance Section which is headed
by a Principal Finance Officer is properly organized and adequately
staffed; it has a separate unit for internal checks and control. The MOW's
accounts are audited on a regular basis, four times a year, by Government
auditors under the supervision of the Director of Audit who reports to the
Parliament. The accounting and auditing procedures followed are found to
be generally satisfactory.
1.29      The TD is well organized, and is adequately staffed; it currently
has 19 engineers, 5 architects, and 3 quantity surveyors of which 2 are
expatriates employed under the Indian Aid Program; most of the TD's
engineers were trained abroad. A few staff received their training at the
University of Mauritius (MU). MU offers courses in civil, mechanical and
electrical engineering; the first batch of four civil engineers graduated
from the university in 1980-81. The yearly intake of students in each of
the engineering faculties currently is around 10. The Industrial Trade



- 10 -
Training Center (ITTC) at Beau-Bassin, established in 1969 with UNDP/ILO
assistance, and the ITTC at Piton, established in 1979 with assistance
provided under the Bank's First Education Project (Loan 1033-MAS), provide
vocational training to about 480 students each year. The courses conducted
at the ITTCs include: mechanical engineering, welding and metal
fabrication, masonry and concrete work, etc. In addition, the Lyce6
Polytechnic set up in 1982 with the assistance of French Government
provides courses in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering for about
112 students annually. Besides, there are facilities within the TD for
on-the-job training of staff.  The training facilities in the country are
adequate for the TD's needs.
4) Planning
1.30      The MOW is responsible for planning motorway and main road
development and improvement. Planning of urban and rural roads is the
responsibility of the muncipal and district councils. The ongoing Urban
Rehabilitation and Development Project provides for strengthening the
institutions responsible for urban planning, development, and maintenance
(Para. 1.24). In the case of rural roads not much planning beyond
programming of periodic and routine maintenance is required.
1.31      Although the MOW has the requisite staff (transport engineer,
economist, statisticians, etc.), there does not exist a well-defined
planning unit for systematic planning of road investments, project
preparation and monitoring of execution of works. During preparation of
the proposed project, the Bank recommended and the Government agreed to
establish a planning unit in the MOW. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the Government will by December 31, 1983, establish in the MOW a
planning unit with such organization, functions and staff as shall be
satisfactory to the Government and the Bank (Para. 4.01 (iii)).
5) Financing
1.32      Road maintenance is financed by the Government's recurrent budget
while road construction is mostly financed from foreign sources (Annex II);
in the period 1977/78-1981/82, only Rs 23.35 million, or 19% of total road
construction costs was financed by the Government's capital budget -- less
than Rs 5 million per year. For the 1982/83-1986/87 Public Sector
Investment Program (PSIP) the Government's share in road construction is
anticipated to increase to Rs 120.4 million, or 28% of all investments
earmarked for the roads subsector.
1.33       The Government expenditures on main road construction and
maintenance are about Rs 12-13 million annually; in addition, an amount of
about Rs 2-4 million is estimated to be spent on urban and rural roads.
Revenues from road users considerably exceed the Government expenditures on



roads; in the five-year period FY 1977-81 the Government's total revenues
from road users (import duties on fuel, motor vehicles, spare parts and
tires, road tax, licenses, etc.) averaged about Rs 196 million (Table 1.4).
Hence, the revenues from road users can not only cover the anticipated
increase in Government share in new road construction but will also provide
for the needed additional funds for road maintenance (Para. 1.38).

6) Engineering & Construction
1.34      The TD of the MOW carries out minor road and bridge design using
its own staff, while all economic feasibility and detailed engineering
studit3s are done by foreign consultants. As is the case with studies for
the proiect roads, foreign consultants sometimes form joint ventures with
local firms. For new roads, such as motorways, design standards based
mainly or those developed by the UK Department of the Environment or the
French Ministry of Equipment have been followed with certain modifications
to suit local conditions. These are adequate.
1.35      Major construction works are put to contract after competitive
bidding and are supervised by consultants. Until 1978, the TD maintained a
roster of contracting firms eligible to bid for works up to a particular
value depending upon capability and financial status. This has not been
updated since. At present, however, contracts are let out following
suitable prequalification and competitive bidding which is satisfactory.
The Development Works Corporation (DWC), a parastatal organization
established in 1970 under the Ministry of Employment also undertakes a
variety of civil engineering works both in urban and rural areas. The
proposed Technical Assistance Project related to the SAL will include,
inter alia, assistance for restructuring the DWC which will be given
financial autonomy by July 1984. While there are a large number of private
firms in the country who can handle building contracts, there are only a
few firms capable of undertaking large road works. However, there is no
scope for a larger number of firms as the construction industry is
currently faced with the problem of discontunity of work.
7) Maintenance
1.36      The TD's road maintenance organization is sound.  Road
maintenance in each of the nine districts is carried out under the
supervision of an inspector of works (Roads) assisted by an assistant
inspector of works, work overseers/supervisors and other staff. The
inspectors of works are responsible to a chief/senior inspector, normally
in charge of two districts, under the overall control of an engineer
(civil) who reports to the Principal Engineer (Roads). Routine maintenance
is done by force account with the help of road gangs (6-8 men), each
covering an average of 5 km of road, while road resurfacing (single/double
grouted macadam) is carried out by special gangs using equipment.  The TD
has sufficient equipment including those recently provided under the Indian
Line of Credit and with the assistance from the African Development Fund
(AfDF). But, it still needs equipment for patching operations (Para.
1.37). Because of the lack of adequate funds the TD is unable to purchase
materials such as bitumen, fuel, spare parts, etc.; the quantity and
quality of road maintenance is less than satisfactory. Most paved roads
have not been resealed for some ten years or more. The more heavily
trafficked roads show pronounced deterioration in the form of surface
deformation, potholes and cracks over long lengths. The situation has been
partially alleviated by the resurfacing work done on certain roads under
the Cyclone Reconstruction Program financed by the AfDF in 1980.



- 13 -
1.37      Due to the structurally weak pavements and indequate drainage
(Para. 1.13) widespread damage is caused to roads during rains and the TD
is unable to carry out patching operations effectively with the help of
routine maintenance gangs. It therefore plans to establish mechanized
patching units in order to help speed-up the operations and cut wastes.
The project will help finance some equipment for the purpose (Para. 2.12).
1.38      There has been a decline in the funds allocated to the TD for
road maintenance and present allocations are far below requirements.  Table
1.5 shows the funds requested and those allocated for road maintenance
during the period FY 1979-83.
Table 1.5
Allocation for Road Maintenance FY 1979-83
(KS million)
1979       1980      1981      1982      1983
Funds requested        10.40      10.40    10.40       6.92     9.00
Funds allocated        10.40       6.75     9.21       8.09     7.00
Based on data by the TD, the estimated requirement of recurrent funds for
routine and periodic maintenance of roads administered by the TD is Rs 15
million (US$1.36 million equivalent) in 1983 prices. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government that annual budgetary allocation
for road maintenance to the TD for FY 1984-86 will be at least Rs 15
million (US$1.36 million equivalent) in 1983 prices, and that not later
than four months before the beginning of each fiscal year the Government
shall, until the completion of the project, review with the Bank the
budgetary requirements and the proposed budgetary allocation for road
maintenance (Para. 4.01 (iv)).
D. Transport Sector Management, Policy, and Issues
1.39      Transport sector management is adequate for the needs of the
transport infrastructure. Limited capital investment needs of the sector
do not require close coordination of developments in different transport
modes. The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD) makes an
overview of the development in the transport sector (Para. 1.40). However,
responsibility for the management of the sector is divided among various
ministries/departments. MOW is responsible for development and maintenance
of motorways and main roads while the upkeep of rural and urban roads is
the responsibility of the local authorities; NTA is in charge of road
transport industry; MMA handles ports' operations, while CAD is responsible
for planning, development, and operation of air transport; both MMA and CAD
report directly to the Prime Minister's Office.



- 14 -
1.40      At present there is no integerated economic plan for the country
and none for the transport sector. The MEPD is in charge of planning
capital investments in the country, including ones for the transport sector
and finalizes proposals for the transport sector initially made by the
CAD and MMA (for port and maritime transport) and MOW (for roads and road
transport industry). Planning in the port and civil aviation subsectors
appears satisfactory while the one in MOW needs improvement (Para. 1.31).
1.41      Government transport sector policy in recent years has been
influenced significantly by the deterioration of the economic situation and
financial austerity program in the country. This has led the Government to
pursue a pragmatic approach in investing in projects of importance for the
country's economy, particularly export earnings (the port extension and
modernization project, construction of roads leading to the port and post
cyclone road rehabilitation).
1.42      The transport sector strategy of the new Government, which came
into power in July, 1982, has not yet been established. however, the
indications are that its general approach is to assign priority to the
completion of ongoing projects and to rehabilitation/improvement of
existing infrastructure.   Total actual investments in the sector for the
1977/78-1981/82 period were Rs 272.5 million (US$29.3 million equivalent).
The share of transport investments in total public investments was about
9%, which appears to be low considering the strengthening and improvement
needs of the main road network. In the PSIP (1982/83-1986/87) the share of
transport investments is, however, increased to 12.6% with total envisaged
investments in the five-year period of Rs 934.7 million (about US$85
million equivalent). The earmarked investments would amount to 46% for
roads, 42% for civil aviation and 12% for the port (Annex II).
1.43      The program for the sector is generally reasonable with the
emphasis on the improvement of the Plaisance international airport and the
strengthening and improvement of main roads. Since the port was recently
modernized and extended, no major port project is envisaged in the
investment program. The transport projects in the PSlP are listed in Table
1.6. They generally make sense; the strengthening and improvement of main
roads is included in the proposed project.

1.44      As regards the international airport, the Government was
originally considering building a new airport in the northeast. However,
it has finally adopted the alternative supported by the Bank -- to improve
the existing international airport. The project is planned to be
implemented in two phases: (i) resurfacing of the runway, building a new
control tower and installation of additional navigational aids; financial
arrangements are almost completed; a long-term credit under soft terms by
Caisse Central (France) has been secured; and (ii) construction of a new
terminal building (expected to be financed by People's Republic of China),
a new taxiway, short road access to the new terminal and a new parking lot;
the second phase is expected to start in 1985.
1.45      There are no major outstanding issues in the sector.  The public
transport needs improvement and it will be addressed in the study to be
carried out in 1983 under the Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project
(Para 1.21). The planning in the roads subsector is expected to improve
with the creation of the Planning Unit. The Bank's assistance is geared to
helping the Government overcome constraints in economic development by
rehabilitating and improving the existing transport infrastructure. The
Bank-financed port project (Para. 1.46) has made an important contribution
by expanding the port capacity and modernizing its operations. In regard
to the airport project, the Government has secured external financing for
the first phase which is to be implemented during the period 1983-85.
Under these circumstances, the Bank should now concentrate on assisting the
Government with improvement of the country's road network. The proposed
project will help improve part of the country's main paved road network
which carries high traffic volumes and is in urgent need of pavement
strengthening.
E. Previous Bank Group Involvenent in the Sector
1.46      In the transport sector the Bank has so far financed extension
and modernization of the port of Port Louis with a loan of US$10 million
in 1974 (Ln 976-MAS). The loan financed the construction of two new
berths, two transit sheds, a workshop, an administration building, port
entrance dredging, procurement of cargo handling equipment, and technical
assistance. The project was later reassessed to reflect price increases
caused by initial delays in implementation and a subsequent agreement to
construct a third berth. In 1976 a Third Window Loan of US$3.6 million
(1339-T-MAS) was approved for the revised project.  The port project was
cofinanced by U.K. bilateral aid (US$3.0 million equivalent), and by UNDP
(US$514,000) providing for the technical assistance to the port authority.
1.47      The project was successfully completed in January 1983.  Its main
objectives were met although the port capacities are presently under-
utilized as a consequence of the fall in the economic activities and
reduction in imports. Also some remedial work has been necessary to check
settlement of the land behind the main berths which is expected to be
completed by October 1983. The technical assistance included in the
project was effective and the management of the port operations has
improved.

- 18 -
(i) Strengthening and Improvement of Main Roads
2.03      Consultants BCEOM-Limbada, Melvin & Partners (BCEOM-LMP) carried
out a feasibility study for strengthening and improvement of 10 roads
identified by a Bank mission in April 1981,based on data by the TD. The
study, financed under a Project Preparation Facility (Advance No P043MAS),
started in early July 1982 and was completed in mid-December 1982. Of the
several roads studied, the four presented below totalling about 75 km, out
of 140 km, were found to be economically feasible.
2.04      Port Louis-Mahebourg (Plaisance Airport) Road: is a principal
route connecting Port Louis, the capital city, with the Plaisance
international airport in the southeast (See Map). The Road is a major
inter-urban artery serving the towns of Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill, Quatre
Bornes, Vacoas Phoenix and Curepipe, and is one of the most heavily
trafficked roads in Mauritius. The road traverses mostly rolling terrain,
with grades varying between 2-5 percent. Apart from the Saint Jean to
Phoenix section , which forms part of the motorway between Port Louis and
Phoenix, and the Curepipe to Nouvelle France section, the road has poor
riding quality and shows deterioration in the form of surface deformation
and cracks; the vertical alignment of the road is poor affording reduced
visibility; the sidewalks and drainage channels in built-up areas suffer
from poor design and maintenance; the pavement thickness is inadequate and
is in need of strengthening.
2.05      Port Louis-The Mount Road: forms part of a main artery linking
Port Louis with Centre de Flacq in the east. The road traverses slightly
rolling terrain, and serves areas of sugarcane plantation. The horizontal
and vertical alignment of the road is generally satisfactory. However, the
road shows signs of distress and is in need of strengthening and
improvement.
2.06      Plaine Des Papayes Road: lies in the northwest of Mauritius, and
passes through the villages of Morcellement Saint Andr6, Plaine des Papayes
and Fond du Sac. The road generally runs at the adjoining ground level and
suffers from lack of drainage, and has sharp curves at places; the riding
quality of the road is poor and its surface rutted and cracked. The road
is in need of strengthening and improvement.
2.07      Quartier Militaire-Bel Air Road: forms part of the arterial
system connecting Port Louis with Bel Air, an important rural center in the
east, and serves areas of rich sugarcane plantation. The road traverses
hilly terrain and has poor geometrics affording reduced visibility at
curves. The riding quality of the road is poor and the road shows signs of
distress; the pavement thickness is inadequate and is in need of
strengthening.



- 19 -
2.08      In considering pavement strengthening/improvement alternatives,
the consultants identified two possible solutions, one for a service life
of 10 years and the other for a service life of 20 years. Based on
technical and economic evaluation, the consultants concluded and the
Government and the Bank agreed that the preferred solution was for a
service life of 20 years.  The proposed road strengthening and improvement
works consist of bituminous/granular overlays of varying thicknesses,
improvement of geometrics, widening/reconstruction of shoulders and
improvement of roadside drains.  In addition, sidewalks along roads in
built-up areas will be improved or reconstructed. Suitable construction
materials are available within reasonable distances; not much land
acquisition is involved since shoulders and roadside drains would be
located within the road reserve (Para 1.13). During negotiations, it was
agreed with Government that it will be a condition of Loan effectiveness
that all legal and administrative steps required to ensure access to the
road reserve and other land required for the project have been taken
(Para. 4.02).
2.09      The design standards adopted for the roads (Table 2.1) are based mainly on
those developed by the French Ministry of Equipment and are appropriate.

(ii)  }provement to MOW's Main Workshop
2.10      The MOW's main workshop lacks adequate facilities for storage of
spare parts, sheds for repair and servicing of vehicles and plant, etc.
(Para. 1.27). The project includes construction of a spare parts store,
sheds for mechanics, painter and panel beater, and an extension to
servicing station. It also includes construction of a messroom-cum-office
block. All these will be located within the existing workshop compound.
The architectural plans for the buildings have already been prepared by the
MOW and are satisfactory.
(iii) Construction of Vehicle
Inspection Center
2.11      The existing vehicle inspection center is incapable of handling
large size buses and trucks and the large volume of vehicles in the
country. The project includes construction of a new vehicle inspection
center at Phoenix. The architectural plans for the building have already
been prepared by the MOW and are satisfactory.
(iv) Establishment and Equipping of Mechanized Patching Units
2.12      Due to the widespread damage caused to roads during rains, the TD
is unable to carry out patching operations effectively with the routine
maintenance gangs (Para. 1.37). It will establish mechanized patching
units (average 2 per district) to help carry out this task. The project
includes equipment for 10, out of the 18 units required; the remaining
would be purchased by the TD from assistance provided by AfDF under the
Cyclone Reconstruction Program. The equipment to be purchased is shown in
Annex III (Table 1).
(v) Assistance for Vehicle Weight Control
2.13      Until now, there is no regulation for axle-load limitation and
control in the country. Government is currently making regulations fixing,
inter alia, maximum axle-load of vehicles (Para. 1.23). To help enforce
vehicle weight and axle-load regulations, the project will finance 3
portable weigh-bridges to be operated by the MOW.
(vi) Consultant Services
(a) Project Preparation
2.14      A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$246,000 was used for
Consultants feasibility study and detailed engineering for strengthening
and improvement of the project roads. Included in the project is provision
for refinancing an advance of US$246,000 from the PPF.



- 21 -
2.15      Consultants will be engaged to supervise strengthening and
improvement of the project roads under terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. The consultant services will be required over a 26-month period
beginning January 1984.
C. Cost Estimates
2.16      The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
US$24.1 million. Excluding taxes and duties, the total cost is US$21.0
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.2 million or 72% of
project costs excluding taxes. A breakdown of costs is shown below (Table

2.17      The base costs are estimated as of end-March 1983 and have been
derived as follows:
(a) Strengthening and Improvement of Roads: based on
unit costs and detailed design quantities
developed by consultants taking into consideration
current prices of materials, labor and equipment,
as well as prices on similar works carried out in
Mauritius recently.
(b) Imporvement to  MOW's Main Workshop; and
Construction of Vehicle Inspection Center: based
on plinth area rates arrived at by MOW taking into
consideration similar works carried out in
Mauritius recently, and have been found to be
reasonable.
(c) Road Patching Equipment and Portable
Weigh-Bridges: based on MOW estimates which reflect
c.i.f. prices in March 1983, and have been found
to be reasonable.
(d) Consultant Services: (i) feasibility study and
detailed engineering of project roads under PPF is
based on Government's Contract with consultants;
(ii) the supervision of strengthening and
improvement of project roads will require about 75
man-months of consultant services over a 26-month
period. The average man-month costs including
salaries, social costs, international travel,
subsistence allowance, the firm's overhead and
profit, and other miscellaneous items are
estimated at US$9,000.
D. Financing
2.18      The total project cost of US$21.0 million, net of taxes and
duties, will be financed by a Bank loan of US$15.2 million including the
Front-end Fee. The Government will contribute US$5.8 million which will
C      cover local costs of the project excluding taxes.
E. Implementation and Procurement
2.19      Project implementation will be the responsibility of the TD of
the MOW. Consultants will be engaged for supervision of the strengthening
and improvement of roads.



- 24 -
2.20      The road works estimated to cost US$14.6 million equivalent,
excluding taxes and contingencies, will be procured under unit price
contracts through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank "Guidelines for Procurement". The project roads will be divided into
three contracts: 1) Port Louis-Mahebourg (Plaisance Airport) Road, 31.1 km;
(US$6.8 million); 2) Port Louis-The Mount and Plaine Des Papayes Roads,
21.1 km; (US$4.1 million); and 3) Quartier Militaire-Bel Air Road, 22.9
km; (US$3.7 million). Contractors will be invited to bid for one or more
contracts. The construction of spare parts store, sheds,
messroom-cum-office block, etc. at the MOW's main workshop and vehicle
inspection center (Paras. 2.10 and 2.11), estimated to cost US$0.70 million
equivalent, excluding taxes and contingencies, is unlikely to attract
international competitive bidding. These will be built by local
contractors after competitive bidding in accordance with Government
procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank. All contracts for works
would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation.
The road patching equipment and portable weigh-bridges (Paras. 2.12 and
2.13), estimated to cost USO.27 million equivalent, excluding taxes and
contingencies, would not attract international competitive bidding and will
be procured after calling competitive quotations from established suppliers
within the country and abroad in accordance with normal Government
procedures which are satisfactory. The consultants for construction
supervision will be employed in accordance with the Bank "Guidelines for
the use of consultants". These were agreed with Government during
negotiations (Paras. 4.01 (v), (vi), (vii)).
2.21      The road strengthening and improvement will take 24 months
beginning January 1984 with an estimated 40% of works to be carried out in
1984 and the remaining 60% in 1985; the construction of spare parts store,
sheds, messroom-cum-office block, etc. at the MOW's main workshop, and the
vehicle inspection center will take 12 months and the works will be carried
out in 1984. The procurement of road patching equipment and portable
weigh-bridges will be completed by about mid-1984. The project is
scheduled to begin at the end of 1983 and be completed by end-June 1986.
An implementation schedule shown in Chart II was agreed with Government
during negotiations (Para. 4.01 (viii)).
F. Disbursements
2.22      Loan funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for strengthening and
improvement of roads, if procured from abroad; 60%
of expenditures, excluding land acquisition, if
procured locally;
(b)  65% of expenditures for improvement to MOW's main
workshop;
(c)  65% of expenditures, excluding land acquisition, for
construction of vehicle inspection center;



- 25 -
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for procurement of road
patching equipment and portable weigh-bridge, if
procured from abroad; 80% of expenditures if
procured locally; and
(e) 100% of foreign expeniditure and 80% of local
expenditures for consultant services.
2.23      An estimated disbursement schedule is set out in Table 2.3.
Since this is the Bank's first highway project in Mauritius, there is no
disbursement profile. The disbursement estimates are based on the project
implementation schedule (Chart II) and the typical disbursement profile for
the highway subsector in the Eastern Africa Region, as well as in one of
the other countries of the Region namely, Swaziland. The disbursement
schedule is shorter than the typical profile for the Region, but compares
well with that for Swaziland where the resource situation is similar.

G, Accounting, Auditing & Reporting Requirements
2.24      Project accounts will be maintained by Finance Section of the MOW
with separate accounts for each component and will be available for
inspection by the Bank supervision missions. The MOW's accounts are
audited regularly by Government auditors under the supervision of the
Director of Audit who submits his report to the Parliament. During
negotiations, it was agreed with Government that all project accounts will
be audited by the Director of Audit according to generally accepted
accounting procedures and that the Government will submit certified copies
of such accounts and an annual audit report to the Bank not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year (Para. 4.01 (ix)).
2.25      During negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed on
progress reporting requirements (Annex IV), which include indices for
measuring implementation progress, and submission of a project completion
report in a form satisfactory to the Bank not later than six months after
the closing date of the Loan account (Para. 4.01 (x)).
H. Environmental Aspects
2.26      The project is not likely to have any adverse effect on the
environment. The project roads would follow the existing alignments, and
no disturbance to land use should occur. In fact, improved drainage along
the roads will benefit adjacent areas.

III. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
3.01      The major thrust of Mauritius' Public Sector Investment Program
(1982/83-1986/87) is to preserve past and existing investments in the
economy. For the road subsector this translates into the rehabilitation
and maintenance of existing roads. Hence, the single largest planned
investment in the road subsector (about 50% of planned investments) is the
proposed strengthening and improvement of main roads in the country. The
roads included under the proposed project, about 75 km in total, are among
the most important in the country's economy and carry heavy traffic
volumes. Due to the poor design and construction standards and lack of
drainage, costly repairs and overlays would have to be carried out on these
roads to keep them usable. The proposed road works are expected to yield
an overall economic rate of return (ERR) of about 40%.
3.02      For other project components, making about 15% of the total
project costs, no ERR has been calculated.   It is expected that the
benefits arising from improvement to the MOW's main workshop and
procurement of road patching equipment will produce sizeable benefits,
although difficult to quantify, to road maintenance operations on the
heavily trafficked road network. The construction of a new vehicle
inspection center and procurement of portable weigh-bridges will be
beneficial to road safety and to the life and state of the road network.
Areas of Influence of the Project Roads
3.03     Four roads, about 75 km in total, are included for strengthening
and improvement: (i) Port Louis-Mahebourg (Plaisance Airport); (ii) Port
Louis-The Mount; (iii) Plaine des Papayes; and (iv) Quartier Militaire-Bel
Air. The main traffic on all of them is the transport of sugarcane to
sugar factories and thereafter transport of sugar to the port for export.
The first road is the major trunk road in the country, linking the northern
and southeastern parts of the island and connecting the capital with the
only international airport. The other two main roads provide access
between the capital and the economically active northern part of the
island, where a number of agro-industrial and textile enterprises and
tourist resorts are located. The last one, Quartier Militaire-Bel Air
Road, provides communication between the central and eastern parts of the
island, where a number of tourist hotels are situated; the road also goes
through a fruit production zone and serves a textile factory.



- 28 -
3.04      The selected roads directly serve heavily populated areas; total
population in the immediate zone of the four roads is estimated at about
445,000 or about 47% of the total population on the island. The roads also
serve eight out of 21 sugar factories directly and another five factories
in the wider vicinity. Average annual total sugar transport on the four
roads is estimated at about 350,000 tons, or about one-half of the total
sugar production on the island. In addition, food crop production is also
significant around the southern part of the Port Louis-Mahebourg road and
in the vicinity of the two roads in the north.
B. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
3.05      The main benefits to be derived from the project will be: (a)
elimination of costly repairs and overlays otherwise necessary to keep the
roads usable (Para. 3.07); (b) savings in vehicle operating costs (Para.
3.10), and (c) time savings on two heavily trafficked urban roads.
Additional benefits will result from improved road safety but because they
are difficult to quantify they have not been included in calculation of the
ERRs.
3.06      The major direct beneficiaries of the reduced transport costs and
improved road safety will be passenger car owners and truck and bus owners/
operators. Since the road transport industry is highly competitive, it is
expected that a high proportion of these benefits will be passed on to
transport users -- urban/rural population and to the consumers of goods
being transported in the roads' zones. The Government will also benefit
from savings from deferred, costly road reconstruction.
C. Economic Analysis
3.07     The economic analysis was carried out by comparing "with" and
"without" the project cases.  In the "without" the project case, it is
assumed that the roads will remain usable provided costly overlays in the
form of single and/or double grouting are laid at five to seven year
intervals depending on the road condition and traffic volume. It has been
assumed further that, even with such treatment, the condition of the roads
which are already of low standards will continue to deteriorate overtime.
"With" the project case it is assumed that significant improvements to the
roads (pavement strengthening, improvement of geometrics, widening/
reconstruction of shoulders and improvement of roadside drains) will be
made not only to eliminate the need for costly overlays but also to protect
the capital investments in roads and to reduce VOCs over the estimated
20-year life of the works.                                                                   A
Traffic and Vehicle Operating Costs
3.08      Traffic counts on the project roads have systematically been
carried out since 1977. The traffic volumes are generally very high. In
1982, average annual daily traffic (AADT) on the Port Louis-Mahebourg road
varied between 2,300-9,750 vehicles, of which 20-30% were heavy vehicles.
On the Port Louis-The Mount Road the traffic was 3,430 vpd with 35% heavy
vehicles. The Plaine des Papayes road handled 1,320 vpd with 20% heavy



- 29 -

3.09      Since no generated/induced traffic is anticipated to develop on
the project roads (the roads have been paved for decades), the expected
traffic growth is limited to the existing normal traffic only. The growth
after 1986 was estimated on the basis of the past traffic development on
the roads, vehicle fleet growth, fuel consumption and population growth.
The moderate growth rates forecasted in the economic analysis are also
influenced by an expected limited future growth of the economy, and sugar
industry in particular. Passenger transport (cars and buses) are expected
to grow at 3% per annum, pickups and medium trucks at 4%, and heavy trucks
and trailers at 2% and 1%, respectively over the economic life of the
roadworks. The sensitivity analysis has taken even more conservative
assumptions (Annex V): 2% growth for pickups and medium trucks and only 1%
growth per year for other vehicles.
3.10      Vehicle operating costs (VOC) on the project roads have been
estimated separately for each road, and for every year, taking into account
the condition of road surface, the expected deterioration from climate and
traffic, as well as the maintenance operation carried out on the roads.
VOCs were calculated by consultants using Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM). Six typical vehicle groups were selected (cars,
vans, medium trucks, heavy trucks, trailers and buses) and unit VOC savings
based on "with" and "without" the project scenarios range in average
20-30%. During the estimated economic life, VOCs are, however, expected to
increase gradually -- at a higher pace for the "without" the project case.
Savings in VOC were calculated for normal traffic only.

Economic Return
3.11      The economic analysis was carried out in late 1982 prices, net of
taxes and duties. The major assumptions and inputs in the 20-Year
cost/benefit analysis are presented in Annex V. The costs included in the
economic evaluation comprise: (i) cost of civil works (strengthening and
improvement) in 1984-85; (ii) 10% physical contingencies; (iii) cost of
construction supervision; (iv) cost of routine and periodic maintenance on
the project roads. The benefits considered in the economic analysis
include: (i) saving in VOCs for the normal traffic growing at modest rates
(Para. 3.09); (ii) savings in avoiding costly repair and overlays (Para.
3.07); and time saving benefits (considered .in sensitivity analysis only).
3.12      The cost/benefit analysis based upon the assumptions explained in
Paras. 3.07-3.10 shows that the proposed civil works are economically well
justified. The combined ERR for all the project roads is estimated at
about 40%; ERR for individual roads range from 14-87% (Table 3.2) and
exceed the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Mauritius estimated at
about 10%.

D.  Sensitivity and Risks
3.13      Some variables determining the estimated ERRs could change in the
course of project implementation due to presently unforeseen development,
e.g. cost of civil works may increase, savings on VOCs may be lower than
anticipated, and the traffic growth could be slower than envisaged. A
sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out on these critical factors
(Annex V). With a cost increase of 20%, ERRs for the project roads will
range between 11% and 73%; if a flat reduction of saving in VOCs by 20% is
combined with cost increase of 10%, ERRs would then dip to a 9-64% range.
Assuming slower traffic growth, the EERs will be between 13% and 84%.

3.14      There are no major risks associated with the project.  However,
some delays might occur in taking actual possession of land along the roads
already part of the road reserve. Little additional land is likely to be
needed. The project timetable takes into account the time that may be
needed for the Government to take possession of this land.  To ensure that
any such delays are kept to a minimum and do not hinder project
implementation, a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan will be
that all legal and administartive steps to ensure access to the road
reserve and other land required for the project have been taken (Para.
2.08). The project will be the Bank's first involvement in the Mauritius
highway subsector, and hence, more frequent supervision by the Bank would
be required in the early stages of project implementation.

IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on the
following items:
(i)  agree to exchange views with the Bank on the study's
findings and take follow up action satisfactory to
the Bank (Para. 1.21);
(ii)  adequate regulations for vehicle weight, axle-load and
dimensions limitations satisfactory to the Bank will be made
and enforced by December 31, 1984 (Para.1.23);
(iii)  a planning unit with such organization, functions and staff
as shall be satisfactory to the Government and the Bank will
be established in the MOW by December 31, 1983 (Para. 1.31);
(iv)  annual budgetary allocation for road maintenance to the TD
for FY 1984-86 will be at least Rs 15 million (US$ 1.36
million equivalent) in 1983 prices, and that not later than
four months before the beginning of each fiscal year the
Government shall, until the completion of the project,
review with the Bank the budgetary requirements and the
proposed budgetary allocation for road maintenance (Para.
1.38);
(v)  road works will be procured under unit price contracts
through international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank "Guidelines for Procurement" (Para. 2.20);
(vi)  road patching equipment and portable weigh-bridges will be
procured after calling competitive quotations from
established suppliers within the country and abroad (Para.
2.20);
(vii)  consultants for construction supervision will be employed in
accordance with the Bank "Guidelines for the use of
Consultants" (Para. 2.20);
(viii)  a project implementation schedule (Para. 2.21).
(ix)  project accounts will be audited by the Director of Audit,
and certified copies of such accounts and an annual audit
report will be submitted to the Bank not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year (Para. 2.24); and
(x) progress reporting requirements and the submission of a
project completion report (Para. 2.25).



- 33 -
4.02      It will be a condition of Loan effectiveness that all legal and
administrative steps required to ensure access to the road reserve and
other land required for the project have been taken (Para. 2.08).
4.03      With the agreements and under the conditions indicated above, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$15.2 million to the Government of
Mauritius on standard terms.

1/  Econoraic analysis was done in late 1982 prices, net of taxes and duties; H.D.M. model
was applied.
2/  Costs include 10% physical contingencies and estimated costs for works supervision.
3/ The benefits include savings in VOC and the difference in road maintenance costs
"With" atd "wiLhout" the project; no deferred reconstruction costs were considered as
benefits to the project.
4/  Growth of normal traffic only; the results of traffic growth alternatives are
presented in Para. 3.09.
5/ VOC are presented per specific vehicle types in a range -- dependirng on specific road
conditions; the estimates are for 1986 -- first year when the benefits are expected to
accrue; VOC are, however, expected to increase gradually in both cases and that was
taken into account in calculating ERRs.
6/ ERRs were calculated for a 20-year economic life; the overall ERR for the project
roads is estimated at 40.5%; if the costs are increased by 20% and benefits decreased
by 20%, ERR drops to 27%.
71 Sensitivity analysis was also carried out taking into account shadow price of labor; a
factor of 0.5 was applied to the market price of local labor; no marked change in ERRs
was recorded, however, since shadow pricing reduced simultaneously in a similar way
both benefits (road maintenance cost savings and VOC savings) and construction costs.
Time saving benefits were applied to two rods in urban areas only; passenger time
value was based on average basic wages and salaries (Rs 2-5 per hour); in aggregate
these benefits made only a marginal impact on ERRs.
