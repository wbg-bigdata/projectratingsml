                            SCHEDULE 3
                          Special Account
1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:
      (a)   the term "eligible Category" means the Category
(2) (excluding Sub-grants) set forth in the table in
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit
Agreement;
      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means
expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods
and services required for Part B of the Project and to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from
time to time to the eligible Category in accordance with
the provisions of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit
Agreement, provided, however, that notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 1 to the
Project Agreement, payments for expenditures to be
financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Sub-loans may
be made out of the Special Account before the Bank shall
have authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in
respect thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall
qualify as eligible expenditures only if the Bank shall
subsequently authorize such withdrawals; and
      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an
amount equivalent to $6,000,000 to be withdrawn from the
Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule.
3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to
Page  11
it that the Special Account has been duly opened,
withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special
                   Account, the Borrower shall furnish to
                   the Bank requests for deposits into the
                   Special Account at such intervals as the
                   Bank shall specify.
            (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such
                   request, the Borrower shall furnish to
                   the Bank the documents and other
                   evidence required pursuant to paragraph
                   4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                   payments in respect of which
                   replenishment is requested. On the basis
                   of each such request, the Bank shall, on
                   behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
                   the Loan Account and deposit into the
                   Special Account such amount as the
                   Borrower shall have requested and as
                   shall have been shown by said documents
                   and other evidence to have been paid out
                   of the Special Account for eligible
                   expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the eligible Category, and in the
equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.02 of the Loan Agreement
and Article V of the General Conditions applicable
thereto; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Category for the Project, less
the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account
of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Category for the Project shall follow
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
Page  12
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request;
or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank
shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to
the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Loan Agreement, including the General Conditions
applicable thereto.
