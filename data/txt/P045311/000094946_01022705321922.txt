3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Local Initiatives (Microfinance) Project (LIP) was designed in the immediate post-conflict
context of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) under the overall framework of the Priority
Reconstruction and Economic Recovery Program. Combined with other investments (public
works, employment counseling and retraining) the project was aimed at assisting people make the
transition away from unemployment and dependency on humanitarian assistance to active
employment and income generation.
The project development objectives were to:
(i) address the urgent need to assist economically-disadvantaged and war-affected groups in
Bosnia and Herzegovina restart economic activities and make the transition from
dependency on humanitarian assistance to active employment by disbursing 7-10,000
microcredits (up to DM10,000 each) for income generating activities based on self-
employment and microenterprises (defined as less than 5 employees - mainly family
businesses);
(ii) jump-start the process of establishing financially viable microcredit institutions by
contracting NGO microcredit service providers and providing them with technical support
and incentives to develop high-performing operations; and
(iii) support improvement of the business environment for self-employment and micro/small
business development, as well as the environment for non-bank microfinance institutions
(MFIs).
The project objectives have been assessed as clear, realistic and responsive to the Borrowers'
needs.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Following the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review of the project carried out in May 1998,
the development objectives were modified as follows:
(i) to provide access to credit to the economically-disadvantaged and war-affected, specifically
low-income microentrepreneurs who have no access to credit from the commercial banking
sector;
(ii) to facilitate the development of independent, financially viable microfinance institutions that
will continue to provide credit to low income entrepreneurs over the long-term; and
2



(iii) to create an appropriate legal and regulatory environment for the provision of credit and
savings services to low income entrepreneurs.
This reflected a strategic decision to shift the focus of the project from disbursing large numbers
of loans to target clients to building sustainable institutions. Providing low income entrepreneurs
with access to credit remained the primary objective of the project. However, during the second
phase of the project (June 1998 - June 2000), activities were focused on the second objective,
namely the development of financially viable microfinance institutions in order to ensure
provision of financial services to microentrepreneurs over the long-term.
In 1996, the LIP provided financing to 17 NGO Microcredit Service Providers selected after a
competitive selection process. In 1998, after the Mid-term Review, it was agreed that more
institution-building needed to be done if the fledgling NGO MFIs financed under the project were
to grow and become sustainable. The LIDs therefore carried out a performance assessment of all
partner institutions in 1998 against key outreach, institutional and financial indicators. Based on
the results of this assessment, it was decided to continue to finance only eight organizations - five
in the Federation: AMK-Posusje, BOSPO-Tuzla, LOK-Sarajevo, MCI/SEA-Tuzla, SUNRISE-
Sarajevo; and three in Republika Srpska: BENEFIT-Lukavica, MICROFIN-Banja Luka and
SINERGIJA-Banja Luka. In addition to these, existing financing (DEM750,000) remained
invested in World Vision (RS). The above-mentioned modification of the project objectives
provided the framework to focus resources on the best performing institutions to maximize
sustainable results. This proved to be a successful strategy that had extremely good results, with
all eight organizations financed during phase II demonstrating significant improvements in
institutional capacity and high levels of performance.
Terminating the funding of the remaining eight organizations led to a welcome consolidation
within the microfinance sector. Microcredit service providers who did not meet the performance
standards were required to repay their original loan capital. In order to survive, these institutions
sought out partnerships with the organizations that continued to have access to project financing.
Today, these eight organizations have all been taken over or merged with larger, strong
microfinance institutions.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Obiective 1: Provide access to credit to the economically-disadvantaged and war-affected,
specifically low-income microentrepreneurs who have no access to credit from the
commercial banking sector.
The first objective to disburse 10,000 loans to low-income, war-affected clients has been
exceeded fivefold. As of June 30, 2000, 50,261 loans have been disbursed for a total value of
KM148 million (US$67 million equivalent). These loans have been disbursed to low-income
entrepreneurs throughout the country. Forty nine percent of the borrowers are women, many of
them widowed during the war and now have to earn a living for their families. An estimated
21 percent are internally-displaced persons who were forced to leave their homes during the
ethnic cleansing, and 5 percent are returnees (see Table 1 below for more details).
As of June 30, 2000 the number of active clients was 19,361, with total loans outstanding worth
KM38.6 million (US$17.5 million equivalent). A typical client business is family-run and
employs from 1 to 5 people. About 72 percent of clients live in towns and 28 percent in villages.
About three-quarters of these clients operate in the trade and services sectors, while the remainder
have agricultural or small-scale production businesses.
Typically, these clients borrow less than KM2,500 (US$1,200) as their first loan. They then have
access to larger, repeat loans if they repay on time and in full. As of June 30, 2000, the overall
average loan size disbursed was KM2,952 (US$1,450).
Repayment rates are extremely high. LIP partner institutions measure loan delinquency using
Portfolio at Risk ratio (PAR), which compares the unpaid balance of loans with late payments
with the unpaid balance on all loans. Average PAR (for payments more than 30 days overdue) is
less than one percent (0.66 percent). This is better than the performance of sustainable MFIs
worldwide which averages a PAR of 1.7 percent.
The LIP has had significant impact on job creation. The informal sector and registered small
businesses are probably the largest employers in BH, with 21 percent of the labor force estimated
to be engaged in the informal sector alone. These are the businesses targeted by the LIP.
Although, each individual business is small - a typical microcredit client employs 1-3 people -
the scale of the LIP has meant large numbers ofjobs have been supported. Overall, it is estimated
that the LIP has helped create 24,114 new jobs and safeguard 40,740 existing jobs, at a rate ofone
job per US$1,000 lent.

Most importantly, access to business credit has had a positive impact on people's lives. An
independent Client Survey commissioned by the LIDs in 1999 found that 79 percent of borrowers
considered that the loan had significantly improved their economic situation; the remainder said it
helped maintain their current situation. On average, borrowers claimed a 26 percent increase in
monthly household income after loan disbursement - from KM351 to KM444. Forty percent of
borrowers claimed that the loan had helped increase business production from between 10 percent
and 30 percent. Ten percent claimed more than a 50 percent increase in production. And nearly
one third of borrowers (27 percent) stated that the loan had helped increase the number of people
they could employ.
Equally important as the economic impact is the social impact. For many borrowers, the
provision of credit targeted towards people such as themselves, without assets or big businesses,
is a sign that someone trusts and believes in them. Some MFIs have used microcredit as a tool to
bring together people divided by the war. One example is that of BOSPO, which lends to low-
income women in the Tuzla region. BOSPO practices a solidarity group lending methodology.
In these groups, BOSPO has brought together displaced women from Srebrenica with resident
women from the town of Tuzla. This has helped overcome the social barriers and resentment
often present between urban residents and those displaced from rural areas. Sharing business
experience and entering into a mutual guarantee arrangement has built bridges between these two
groups and helped relieve displaced women's feelings of isolation and social exclusion. Another
example is provided by Mercy Corps International/Scottish European Aid who have been at the
forefront of trying to reestablish relations and economic ties between those of different ethnic
groups. Working on the front line area in northeast BH they have facilitated the rebuilding of
business relations between entrepreneurs of Serb and Bosniak origin.

Obiective 2: Facilitate the development of independent, financially-viable microfinance
institutions that will continue to provide credit to low income entrepreneurs over the long-
term.
The second objective of "jump-starting the 5-10 year process of establishing financially-viable
microfinance institutions" has also been surpassed. Thanks to the LIP partner institutions'
dedication and the project's focus on institution building, the partner institutions have developed
into strong, sustainable microfinance institutions very rapidly.
Performance-based financing has helped set high standards and provided incentives for
institutional improvements. The LIP originally provided financing to 17 "microcredit service
providers" selected after a competitive process (35 institutions - 27 local NGOs, 7 international
NGOs and 2 local commercial banks - originally applied to be partner institutions in 1996, out of
which 17 were selected: 12 in the Federation and 5 in Republika Srpska). After a mid-term
review (MTR) in 1998, it was found that more institution-building needed to be done if the
fledgling NGO MFIs financed by the LIDs were to grow and become sustainable. Hence, the
LIDs carried out a performance assessment of all partner institutions against key outreach,
institutional and financial indicators. Based on the results of this assessment, it was decided to
continue to finance only eight MFIs - five in the Federation (AMK-Posusje, Bospo-Tuzla, LOK-
Sarajevo, MC/SEA-Tuzla, Sunrise-Sarajevo), and three in Republika Srpska (Benefit-Lukavica,
Microfin-Banja Luka and Sinergija-Banja Luka). In addition, existing financing remained
invested in World Vision (RS).
The loan fund capital was recovered from the remaining eight organizations. Contracts with
these organizations were not renewed and they were obliged to stop loan disbursement, collect all
outstanding loans and return the loan capital to LIDs for reallocation to better performing
institutions. This loan capital was fully repaid over a one-year time frame.
This disinvestment had surprisingly positive results, essentially "forcing" consolidation of the
sector. Those MFIs who no longer had access to LIP financing were committed to remaining
operational in the microfinance sector. Their lack of capital made it necessary for them to seek
out stronger MFIs with whom to partner and continue operations. Hence, over the last year, there
has been major consolidation within the microfmance sector, particularly among those institutions
financed under the LIP. LOK merged with NBRM-Modrica, Business Center-Travnik and Plavi
Most-Bihac; Sunrise with LORI-Orasje and World Vision with Vrelo-Mostar, while ALDI-
Gorazde has partnered with Oxfam-lJK. Only one organization (Pliva-Sipovo) closed down
operations when capital funds were redeemed.
Those nine MFIs with continued access to financing have generally performed extremely well,
proving that taking an institutional approach in project implementation was a right decision.
Performance is measured by contractually agreed performance standards to which financing is
linked (see Annex 8 attached). Just three years after start-up, seven MFIs became operationally
sustainable, meaning that they are able to cover their operating expenses from their own operating
income. Four of these institutions were financially sustainable, meaning that they can cover all
expenses, including the cost of maintaining the value of their capital, and adjustments that fully
account for any subsidies and appropriate write-offs for non-recoverable loans. Stated another
way, these four institutions are now profitable and have a positive adjusted return on assets
ranging from 1.62-3.08 percent. Given that these MFIs operate as non-profit organizations, all
net profits are reinvested into the microcredit operations. See table 2 below for key indicators of
LIP partner MFIs.

These financial results are impressive after just three full years of operation, and make BH MFIs
high performers among MFIs worldwide. Worldwide, high-performing MFIs have an average
operational sustainability of 109 percent, financial sustainability of 92 percent and adjusted return
on assets of 4.8 percent.
Financial sustainability is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The LIP's focus on
sustainability is driven by a desire to provide services to a large number of clients over the long-
term. The MFIs have scaled up their operations rapidly. Today, LID-financed MFIs have
between 1,000-4,000 clients each and are witnessing growth rates of over 100 percent per year.
Obiective 3: Create an appropriate legal environment for the provision of credit and
savings services to low-income entrepreneurs
The third objective of developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for microfinance
institutions is well advanced. During 1998-1999, a proposal for a legal and regulatory framework
was developed by a working group composed of both Entity Ministries of Finance, the Banking
Agencies, the LIDs, MFI representatives, the World Bank and a USAID consultant. This
framework proposed the creation of four categories of financial institutions - based on
governance structure and type of services provided:
* Microcredit Organization - a basic form of non-profit, "credit only" institution;
* Finance Company - a form of privately-owned "credit only" lending institution, whose
lending is not necessarily limited to microenterprises;
* Savings and Credit Association - a member-owned and governed lending institution that
would also be permitted to mobilize capital from its members in the form of savings; and
* Microfinance Institution - a form of specialized microfinance bank that would be authorized
to accept deposits from the general public.
7



The first step in implementing this policy framework was to develop a Law on Microcredit
Organizations, such that existing credit-only MFIs - formed as citizens' associations or
humanitarian organizations - could register and operate with clear legal authority. Drafting and
review of the law took place in 1999 and early 2000. In the Federation, the Microcredit
Organization Law was passed and became effective on July 8, 2000. In Republika Srpska, a
largely identical law has been approved by the Government and is awaiting approval by the
Entity Parliament. The law is simple and provides for registration of specialized credit-only, non-
government, non-profit institutions with minimal regulation and no formal government
supervision. The LIP continues to stress the longer-range importance of providing a range of
appropriate MFI legal forms. In addition to MCOs, this also includes types of MFIs with the
power to raise equity and collect deposits provided for by the other legal forms proposed above.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: Microcredit Programs (90% of project cost)
The Local Initiatives Project has been cost effective. Impressive results have been achieved at
relatively low cost. Out of the US$21.75 million total project financing, US$15.55 million or
71.5 percent was invested in loan funds. These loan funds have revolved over 5 times resulting in
total loan disbursements of KM148 million (approx. US$67 million equivalent).
Partner MFIs received financial support for their start-up fixed and operating costs for the first
three years of operations. This support declined from 100 percent of operating costs in year 1 to
25 percent in year 2 to 0 percent in year 3. Operational cost support, referred to as "management
fees", totaled US$4 million or 18.4 percent of total financing. The nine MFIs currently financed
received an average of US$320,000 each in operating subsidy. Today, all MFIs cover their own
operating costs from their own operating income and are not dependent on injections of outside
funding to continue running.
Component 2: Microfinance Capacity Building (4.3% of project cost)
The LIP provided very high quality technical assistance and training to partner MFIs at relatively
low cost. A total of US$0.93 million or 4.3 percent of total project financing was spent on
technical assistance and training. Technical assistance costs were kept low by relying on
carefully selected individual consultants and using short-term consultants for well-focused
assignments rather than hiring long-term technical advisors or consulting firms. During 1999, as
partner MFIs were becoming increasingly capable of identifying their own training needs, the
technical assistance was fully demand driven and tailored to address both common and specific
areas of interest for MFIs operations. MFIs also paid for a portion of the TA costs. In addition
to individual consulting to MFIs, the following training courses were organized during project
implementation:
-  Principles of Microfinance (August 1996);
-  Micro-credit Lending Methodologies (February 1997);
-  Loan officer training (June 1997);
-  Portfolio management - static model (October 1997);
-  Loan officer training - follow up (December 1997);
-  Portfolio management - dynamic model (February 1998);
-  Financial management seminar (March 1998);
-  Staff management training course (July 1999); and
8



-  Accounting and Financial Management, Intemal Controls and Extemal Audits
(September, October 1999).
Four study tours were also organized for MFIs from BH to visit MFIs regarded as some of the
most successful worldwide in the following countries: Egypt (December 1997); Bolivia (April
1998); Bangladesh (April 1999) and Poland (December 1999).
Management and delivery of TA under the project has been regarded as best practice by the SEEP
Network. A paper summarizing this experience was delivered to the SEEP Technical Assistance
Working Group, entitled" Technical Assistance to MFIs in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the
Local Initiatives Project" by Ann Duval, Lead LIP Technical Advisor, September 1999.
Component 3: Project Management (5.7% of project cost)
This component supported the establishment of project implementation units (PIUs) in both
Entities. These PIUs, called Local Initiatives Departments (LIDs), were establshed as separate
units of govemment-created Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs). In the Federation,
the LID was entirely independent of the other ETF units managing public works and vocational
training/employment services programs; whereas in RS, the unit operated under common
management and shared financial management and support services.
Both LIDs performed their functions as microfinance apex institutions in a highly professional
manner, focusing on the following main roles: (i) provide and monitor financing to the partner
Microcredit Organizations; (ii) monitor the development of partner organizations and facilitate
provision of adequate technical assistance; and (iii) improve the legal framework for the
microfinance industry in BH.
The Federation LID had a total of 8-10 staff during the course of implementation (Director,
Finance Manager, 1-2 Monitoring Officers, Research and Development Officer, MIS Specialist,
Accountant and 2-3 support staff). The RS LID had around 7 staff involved (2 full time technical
staff with part-time support from an additional 5 RS ETF management and support staff). Both
LIDs demonstrated strong management capacity and ability to carry out operations in a cost
effective manner (operating cost were kept low at 5.6 percent of total project cost).
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
NA
4.4 Financial rate of return:
NA
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project took an institutional approach and the achievements in this area are judged to be
highly satisfactory. The project has been recognized as the main generator of microfinance
activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, introducing the principles of financial services to low
income people based on international best practice. Today, nearly all LIP partner institutions
have reached operational sustainability and are expected to continue provision of services to
target borrowers on a sustainable basis over the longer-term.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Not applicable.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Although this did not affect the LID's performance and overall achievement of project objectives,
Boards of Trustees (particularly in the Federation) did not function properly. The Board of
Trustees was composed of Government ministry representatives, Employment Institutes and
Chambers of Commerce. High government turnover in the Federation led to irregular meetings
and lack of government involvement and support for the project. In the follow-up operation, it is
recommended that the institutional setup be reexamined to ensure a better functioning and more
representative Board.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Both Entity project implementing agencies demonstrated high levels of commitment and
professionalism. This led to smooth implementation performance and the successful achievement
of project objectives.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The project was implemented at a lower cost than originally planned, in spite of the fact that
projected cofinancing has been exceeded by US$4.06 million. The goal was that LIDs'
operational costs would amount to a maximum of 8.3 percent; however, actual cost of project
management amounted to 5.7 percent of project financing. High caliber technical assistance
(microfinance capacity building) was also provided at a lower cost than planned. It was initially
projected that 7.7 percent of project resources will be spent under this component, but the actual
cost of training services provided amounted to 4.3 percent of project financing.
Significant cofmancing and parallel financing (provided by UNHCR) were raised for the project.
A total of US$15.06 million was raised from six bilateral donors (Governments of Italy,
Netherlands, Japan, Austria and Switzerland) and UNHCR, which is 37 percent more than
originally projected and 69 percent of the total project costs. Funding from these grants has
significantly contributed to achieving and even exceeding project objectives. It has been
proposed that these donor grants be on-granted to partner MFIs in order to build up their capital
bases and enable them to increase their leverage to raise commercial funding.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The project is given an overall rating of Highly Likely for sustainability, based on already
achieved levels of sustainability by both MFIs and LIDs (by charging 3 - 5 percent cost of funds,
the LIDs are also fully sustainable) and an assumption that a follow-on operation will build on the
achievements of this project. During the recent project identification mission, it was
recommended that a follow-up project will focus on the following:
* market-driven, performance-based financing of MFIs, and
* further development of the legal and regulatory framework for MFIs, to enable them to
expand their sources of capital and the types of services they can provide to
microentrepreneurs.
I0



6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The planned follow-up operation will support the further scaling-up and sustainability of
microfinance institutions in BH. It is expected to mainstream microfinance provision as part of a
strong financial sector that offers services to all citizens.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in preparing the project is rated Satisfactory. As for other projects
launched under the Priority Reconstruction Program for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the main
driving forces behind the Bank's preparation effort were speed and simplicity. Project
identification to effectiveness took 12 months. However, the pilot project financed by the Dutch
grant, aimed to test out the lending mechanisms which would be applicable for a full scale
project, was effective only 2 months after identification. Appraisal took place in July/August
1996. The project was approved by the Board on December 13, 1996 and became effective on
March 11, 1997. In all stages of project preparation and implementation, the team composition
included Bank staff and experienced consultants with extensive experience in microfinance best
practices plus a Team Leader and Project Officer with awareness of the political and social
context.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision is judged as Highly Satisfactory (the project team received an award for excellence in
supervision). Throughout project implementation there was an intensive supervision by the field-
based Team Leader with the support of a local Project Officer, occasionally supplemented by the
involvement of microfinance consultants. The field-based supervision allowed for daily contact
with the PIUs and partner MFIs which has proven to be critical support, especially during the first
two years of project implementation. Supervision missions were carried out regularly with
continuity of staff on both the Bank and PIUs side. Close working relationships, based on mutual
trust and respect, were established between the Bank and the PIU staff as well as with the
management of partner MFIs. The Bank team was viewed as responsive to the project needs and
open to approving modifications that would help achieve better overall results.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, the Bank's performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory. The Bank team supported the
design and implementation of an effective operation which fully met its objectives. Furthermore,
the Bank was highly instrumental in raising cofinancing for the project.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation is considered to be Satisfactory. The Ministries
of Finance in both Entities have initiated creation of an appropriate institutional structure (LIDs
within ETFs) for project implementation. Despite initial skepticism towards the very idea of
microfinance (financial services to low income clientele), the government preparation team was
very much involved and provided a major contribution to the project design.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Govemment's implementation performance is rated as Satisfactory. Political interference
into decision making, particularly in terms of regional allocation of funds, was avoided due to
II



efforts made by both PIUs which were constantly explaining the economic logic of the project
and its importance to long-term development of microfinance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the two Entity LIDs is assessed as Highly Satisfactory. Both agencies had
very effective management, well trained and professional technical staff and support staff.
However, certain weaknesses within the ETFs setup (role of the Board of Trustees, lack of
participation of other stakeholders etc) should be addressed in the follow-up operation, giving the
implementation agency a clear mandate but also more flexibility in business decision making.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The LIP was focused on provision of financial services to low-income entrepreneurs who do not
have access to loans provided by the commercial banking sector and on developing appropriate
institutional structures for provision of these services over the long-term. The following are the
most important lessons learned during project implementation:
NGOs as implementing partners
A decision to implement the project by contracting NGOs as microcredit service providers has
proven to be an appropriate one in the particular context of post-conflict BH. Although other
legal entities (commercial banks, private agencies) were also eligible to apply and participate in a
competitive selection process, NGOs demonstrated a better understanding of the needs of target
borrowers and had other comparative advantages (outreach, reputation in communities,
commnitment to microcredit, etc.) that led the project team to sign contracts with NGOs as
providers of microcredit services to low-income entrepreneurs (initially 17 NGOs were
contracted while 8 contracts were renewed after the MTR) Typically for microfinance, NGOs
proved to be the most appropriate service providers due to their field presence and ability to reach
out towards clients who do not have access to commercial banks. However, financial and
business skills and management capacity varies across the NGOs. Ultimately, those NGO
microcredit organizations that have the best possibility of surviving long-term are those that
combine a clear client-driven vision and strategic goals with strong business management
capacity.
Institutional approach
The first project objective of disbursing 7,000 - 10,000 loans to low-income entrepreneurs was
exceeded after only 18 months of project implementation. However, it was agreed that such a
result will not have a substantial impact if it is not followed by creation of institutions that would
be able to provide these services over the longer-term and on a sustainable basis. Therefore,
particularly during the second half of the project, necessary investments were made (technical
assistance and training) to strengthen the capacity of partner MFIs in all aspects of microcredit
operations. Demand-driven and well tailored technical assistance largely contributed to highly
satisfactory performance of partner organizations, all of whom have reached operational
sustainability.
Performance-basedfinancing
Project financing was provided based on the performance of each partner MFI against mutually-
agreed performance standards related to institutional and financial performance. Furthermore,
project financing was tailored "as if' MFIs were borrowing from commercial sources (with cost
of capital of 3-5 percent per annum) and reporting requirements were established similar to other
12



financial institutions. This approach has provided incentives to MFIs to strengthen their
institutional and financial performance to meet the standards and develop appropriate internal
policies and procedures that have helped them maintain impressively high quality portfolios.
Participatory approach
All the key policy decisions related to the Local Initiatives Project were made after consultations
with all stakeholders (governments, MFIs, banks, donors etc.) which resulted in better
understanding of the principles of microfinance. Consequently, MFIs were given an opportunity
to work in an environment that was supportive despite the initial skepticism of government
officials.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Borrowers' report is attached as Annex 9.
(b) Cofinanciers:
In July 2000, the project team met with key cofinanciers (Austrian, Dutch, Italians, Swiss,
UNHCR) to discuss the achievements of the project. All cofinanciers have expressed high levels
of satisfaction with the project results and their cooperation with the World Bank and LIDs
during project implementation. It is expected that at least two of the cofinanciers to LIP will
cofinance LIP II which is a further indication of their support.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
The main partners for project implementation were NGO MFIs. Their feedback on project
implementation was constantly sought by the World Bank as part of supervision. These NGOs
appreciate the willingness of the Bank and the Entity Governments to work with them as equal
partners and have generally provided very positive comments on the project design and their
implementation experience.

Annex 9. Borrower Contribution to the ICR
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Local Initiatives Project
Implementation Completion Report (Borrower's)
Introduction
The Local Initiatives (Microfinance) Project was designed in 1996 as part of the World
Bank's program to support the post-conflict reconstruction and economic recovery of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (hereinafter referred as "the BIH").
In 1996, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a country shattered by four years of war with mass
unemployment and population displacement. The unemployment rate was around 60 percent and
had very serious economic and social implications on a post-war economy. About 1.5 million
people were both intemally and extemally displaced and represented about one third of the
prewar population.
Employment and Training Foundations (hereinafter referred as "the ETF") of the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereinafter referred as "the Federation") and Republika
Srpska (hereinafter referred as "RS") (Federation and RS - collectively referred as "Entities")
were established by Entity Governments during 1996, as institutions with administrative,
technical and financial autonomy and capacity to execute different, employment related projects
designed and supported by the World Bank.
Within ETFs, Local Initiatives Departments (hereinafter referred as "the LlDs") have been set
up to manage the day-to-day implementation of the Local Initiatives Project (hereinafter referred
as "the LIP"). The LIDs role was threefold:
>  To channel loan fund and operating cost support to selected partner "microcredit service
providers";
>  To organize training and individual consulting to support the institutional capacity-building
of these service providers as sustainable microfmance institutions; and
>  To monitor the institutional and financial performance of the partner institutions.
Primary Project Objectives
The Local Initiatives Project, as originally designed, had three objectives:
>  To address the urgent need to assist economically disadvantaged and war-affected people
make the ti ansition from dependence on humanitarian assistance to active employment. This
was to be achieved by disbursing 7-10,000 loans up to a maximum of 10,000 DEM each for
income-generating activities based on self-employment and microenterprise development.
In terms of this objective, 50,261 loans was disbursed, in total value of 148,374,538 DEM,
averaging 2,952 DEM per loan. As of June 30,2000, portfolio outstanding was 38,606,642
DEM and number of active clients was 19,361.

institutions. This was to be achieved by contracting selected organizations - which met
specified eligibility criteria - to disburse these loans. These organizations were to be
provided with financial and technical support and incentives to develop high-performing
microfinance operations.
With respect to this objective, as of June 30, 2000, seven MFIs are fully operationally
sustainable with qualified staff, accounting and loan tracking systems in place.
> To support improvement of the business environment for self-employment and micro and
small businesses, as well as the legal and regulatory environment for non-bank microfinance
institutions.
Third objective was achieved through the adoption of the Law on Microcredit organizations
in Federation of BH and draft law prepared to be adopted in Republika Srpska.
Summary Project Implementation
Implementation of the project has been carried out in accordance with the principles
established in the basic project documents (Technical Annex) and following the operational
procedures that have been laid out in the project's Operational Manual (promotional activities,
appraisal, approval and supervision).
The major partners in the project's implementation were NGOs contracted under the
Agency Agreements as agents to the LIDs. The LIP originally provided financing to 17
"microcredit service providers" selected after a competitive process.
In accordance with the recommendation of the World Bank mid-term review (MTR) of
the LIP LIDs carried out, at the end of 1998, a performance assessment of all partner institutions
against key outreach, institutional and financial indicators. Based on the results of this
assessment, it was decided to continue to finance only eight MFIs - five in the Federation: AMK-
Posusje, Bospo-Tuzla, LOK-Sarajevo, MC/SEA-Tuzla, Sunrise Sarajevo and three in Republika
Srpska: Benefit-Lukavica, Microfin-Banja Luka and Sinergija-Banja Luka. In addition, existing
financing remained invested in World Vision (RS).
The agency relation between the LIDs and the MFIs was also changed and it became
more business relation providing the MFIs with the revolving loan fund, promoting MFIs from
LID's agent status into more independent financial institutions.
Significant technical assistance has been provided to the MFIs under the project. This
has included training seminars, individual consulting, study tours and dissemination of
information on key microfinance topics to all MFIs in BiH. The technical assistance was
organized and provided in close cooperation with the experienced international microfinance
consultants.
The LIDs, as institutions established by entity governments for the purpose of project
implementation, have played one of the key roles in the overall microfinance sector development
in BIH. Acting as wholesale (apex) institutions LIDs successfully channeled donor financing to
the selected MFIs, organized and financed provision of the technical assistance, worked actively
on the development of the legal framework and monitored and supervised performance of the
MFIs. At the same time LIDs significantly increased its capacities.
27



Entity governments contributed significantly through its participation in project
management (Board of Trustees and Executive Committees), and was particularly involved in the
development of legal and regulatory framework, taking part in various working groups related to
this matter.
The World Bank has been a major donor and leader in the microfinance sector in BiH.
The World Bank has played the key role during an initial phase of the project, its design and
particularly fundraising. During project implementation, the World Bank continued to play an
important role and it has provided overall support to the ETFs/LIDs in both Entities. Overall
cooperation with the World Bank could be assessed as excellent.
Assessment of the project objectives, design, implementation and operation
experience
Because of the postwar time, extremely high unemployment and huge number of displaced
persons in BIH in 1996, the project's objectives aiming to support employment and assist
economic recovery of the country have been reasonable and well chosen. It was of the highest
importance to have a simple, well designed project, with which implementation could start
immediately and even more important, first results could be achieved in a short period of time.
This project had all above mentioned characteristics.
It was very important to provide micro and small loans to the people of BIH and enable
them to start new or restart prewar economic activities, and make the transition from dependence
on humanitarian assistance to active employment. Provision of small loans through specialized
microfinance institutions has proven to be an important tool in assisting some of Bosnia's most
war-affected and low income people develop income-generating activities and microenterprises to
increase incomes and improve livelihoods. The recent Impact study confirms overall satisfaction
of the clients with the services provided by the MFIs.
The second project's objective to jump-start the 5-10 year process of establishing
financially viable microfinance institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina is closely connected to the
first one. The provision of the high quality and adequate technical assistance and LID's partner
institution's dedication on institution building the partner institutions have developed into strong,
sustainable microfinance institutions that serve and shall serve large number of clients. All of
partner institutions made transition from being LID's agents at the beginning of the project to be
more independent financially viable MFIs.
Development of favorable legal framework for both microentrepreneurs and microfinance
institutions is (was) one of the key factors for the development of the microfinance sector in BIll.
Legal framework for microfinance institutions did not exist at all. A number of meetings of all
stakeholders (expatria and local legal counsels, MFIs, representatives of the responsible Entity
Ministries, representatives of Entity Banking Agencies, World Bank representatives, LIDs)
resulted in the development the "Law on microcredit organizations". The Law is adopted in the
Federation of BIH and is in the parliamentary procedure in the RS. This Law shall enable MFIs
to register and operate with clear legal authority.
Project design was simple as same as the implementation arrangements. The key decision
was to select NGOs as a partners in the project implementation. The establishment of the LIDs
and their responsibility for the overall project implementation made the implementation simpler
and efficient. Although microcredit programs worldwide are in most of the cases based upon the
28



donor funding and very simple implementing arrangements (direct donor-MFI relation) this
project has proven that it was possible to achieve excellent results having World Bank financial
support and Government involvement.
It is especially important to emphasize that the whole project perfectly fits in the proposed
Economic Development Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of both entities, because the
strategies are based on private sector led growth. Furthermore, not less important Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy explicitly relies on microfinance sector development as one of the poverty
reduction tools.
The overall operation experience was very positive. Some problems were caused by small
initial allocations and long replenishment procedures at the same time. This mostly affected
MFIs and their cash flow projections and final borrowers of course. These issues have to be
reconsidered in case of the follow up operation.
Lessons learned
The World Bank Local Initiatives Project in BIH was one of the first microcredit
programs in the ECA region. In most of the cases ex socialist countries with planned economies
faced transitional challenges and high unemployment. Situation in BIH was even worse because
of four-year war and huge number of displaced persons. The existing NGOs have been engaged
in different housing, shelter and psychosocial projects. Financial services used to be provided
through the state owned commercial banks. The project significantly contributed to the
development of strong, financially viable NGO sector, capable to provide financial services for
those in need. Bearing in mind the weaknesses of the existing banking sector, the only window of
opportunity for low-income people was NGO sector, offering adequate financial services.
The decision to implement the LIP through the NGOs was hard, brave and risky at the
same time. Competitive selection of the service providers based on the clear and transparent
criteria together with the provision of the loan fund and management fee financing established, in
1996, good base for the future development of the microfinance in BIH.
The technical assistance program designed with the participation of the MFIs, to make
sure it was responsive to the MFIs individual institutional needs, was of the vital importance for
the institutional building of the service providers and overall success of the project.
This project has absolutely proved that it was possible to implement very efficient and
effective microcredit project in cooperation with the NGOs. Hence this is the most important
lesson learned during the life of the LIP.
The institutional development of MFIs (as NGOs) provides solid basis for future
operations and transition into more sophisticated forms of financial institutions.
Future operation
The end of the LIP in BIH is not the end of the development of the microfinance in the
country. The World Bank-financed Local Initiatives Project (LIP) is the largest microfinance
program in BiH. Work done under the LIP established excellent base for the future development
of the microfinance sector in BIH and potentially in the whole Balkan region.
29



The microfinance sector is important for the economic development of BiH. The
unemployment rate in BIH today is lower than in 1996 but still high (around 33%). The demand
for the financial services is very high, too. The commercial banks typically do not provide
financial services to the low income and micro-small entrepreneurs as of various reasons (risky
loans, collateral requirements, expensive procedure, etc.). Without access to finance -
microfinance - such businesses cannot develop. Micro and small entrepreneurs also want access
to other financial services such as savings, leasing and insurance, as well as longer-term and
larger loans and specialized loans for agriculture and start-ups.
Two major factors shall influence the development and growth of the microfinance sector
in future: additional financing and improvement of the legal framework.
The demand for financing from micro and small enterprises is likely to increase as the
economy continues its transition. The microfinance sector "requires" a long-term and stabile
financing in order to be able to meet the demand and offer range of the financial services to the
potential clients. If demand cannot be met, it could lead to a lack of credibility among clients and
then delinquency - which would jeopardize the future of the MFIs. Financing has become a
major risk factor for MFIs at this stage of their development.
Further development of the legal and regulatory framework is of the vital importance for
the entire microfinance sector in BIH, too. It is necessary to complete the legal and regulatory
framework originally proposed under the LIP, for finance companies, savings and credit
associations and microfinance banks. This shall enable the MFIs to increase the range of services
offered to its clients, introducing more sophisticated products, and make them capable of raising
additional financing through the equity investments, savings or commercial loans.
