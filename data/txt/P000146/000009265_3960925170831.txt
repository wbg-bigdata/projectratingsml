PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
BOTSWANA
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2333-BT)
PREFACE
This is a report on the completion of the Third Water Supply
Project in Botswana, for which a loan of US $22.0 million equivalent (Loan
2333-BT) was approved in July 1983. The borrower was the Water Utilities
Corporation (WUC) with the Government of Botswana acting as guarantor. WUC
was responsible for implementing the project. The loan was closed 6 months
late in December 1986. There was a cancellation of US $ 3.3 million on the
project in 1985 and US $456,000 in 1987 due to reduced foreign exchange
requirements resulting from movements in the rate of exchange between the
U.S. Dollar and the Pula.
2.       The report was drafted by WUC and reviewed by the Infrastructure
Operations Division (AF6IN) of the Southern Africa Department. Following
AF6IN's review, the report was passed back to WUC for additional comments
which have been reflected in the final PCR.
3.       At the time of the draft PCR preparation in late 1987, the project
had been substantially completed and had been in operation for about 21
months. Loan closure was delayed to enable WUC to seek reimbursement of
tetention monies due to contractors who were required to complete some
remedial work found to be necessary during the maintenance period, and which
had been extended for this purpose.
4.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments. The
comments received have been attached to the Report as Annex 15.

BOTSWANA
THIRD WATER SUP?'LY PROJECT (LOAN 2333-BT)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
In March 1988, the Gaborone Reservoir was filled to capacity and
spilled for 12 days. By doing so it had ensured that the rapidly increasing
treated water demand could be met in a severa drought situation with no
further inflow into the reservoir until late 1991. The principal objectives
of the project (para 2.07) have therefore been achieved and the urban
expansion of Gaborone is proceeding as planned. Previous water loans and
credits have contributed to the preparation and development of the follow-on
projects (Paras 1.03 to 1.06).
The financial results have beer affected by the serious drought
situation which has persisted in Botswana for several years, necessitating
water restrictions in 1983/84 and 1984/85.



BOTSWANA
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - LOAN 2333-BT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
The Sector
1.01     Most of Botswana is desert and 90% of the population is concentrated
in a relatively narrow strip along the eastern border. Although there are
substantial supplies of gcod quality water in the Okavango and Chobe Rivers
in the sparsely populated north, and lesser quantities in the border rivers
of the east, the country is generally water deficient. Of the population of
over one million in 1985 about 220,000, or 22% were concentrated in six
principal towns, substantially all of whom had secess to public water
supplies. In rural areas water supply schemes were completed to 145 major
and medium sized villages thus raising the percentage of rural population
served from less than 5 at independence in 1966 to ahout 68 In 1985.
1.02     The Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) was created in 1970 as an
autonomous parastatal authority to operate the water supply facilities of
the Shashe Infrastructure Project, and within a short time the Corporation
was also required to take over water supplies to the Gaborone-Lobatse area
from the Government-owncd Gaborone Water and Electricity Unit. Since then it
has taken over the water SUpply facilities of Francistowr ir 1979, previously
run by the Municipality, and responsibility for water supplies to Jwaneng
from the Lebswana mine in 1984. All other public water supplies are provided
by District Councils and the Department of Water Affairs (DWA). The WUC,
which is required by its statute to operate on sound commercial lines, has
thus assumed responsibility for public water suppli-S to all major townships
in Botswana, with the exception of the diamond mining enclave town of Orapa,
where security proble-s are an issue.
Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.03     The Bank's association with the water sector began with a  US$3
million credit in 1971 (Credit 233-BT) for expansion of supplies to Gaborone-
Lobatse and establishment of the WUC. Two other loans for the Shashe
Infrastructure Project (Loan 776-1 ST in 1971 ard Loan 776-2 BT 1974)
included finance for major water supply components to serve the Bamangwato
Concessions Ltd. (BCL) mining project and the township of Selebi-Phikwe. An
additional credit (Credit 471-BT) in 1974 and a loan (Loan 1584-BT) in 1978
for urban development in Francistown and Selebi-Phikwe also included water
supply elements.



-2-
1.04     The Second Urban Project, Loan 1584-BT of 1978, included a water
supply component for the expansion of the primary water supply system in
Francistown including equipment improvements for existing boreholes, and the
provision of water standpipes in both Francistown and Selebi Phikwe to serve
the urban poor. The project also contained a covenant that the Government
should complete its intended transfer of responsibility for water operations
in Francistown, from the Town Council to WUC, by April 1, 1979.  This war
accomplished.
1.05     The Second Water Supply Project(Loan 1763-BT of January 9, 1980) for
US$4.4 million was made to Government for on-lending to WUC at the same
interest rate as the Bank loan (7.9Z), but with repayment over 25 years
instead of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years in each case. The
project was in two parts. Part A of the project was designed to complement
the earlier loans and credits for urban development by providing an ample
long term water supply of high quality to augment and largely replace the
existing ?oor quality and inadequate borehole supplies of Francistown. Part B
of the project included consultant aservices for s,Le investigation and design
work in connection with a proposal to raise the height of the Gaborone Dam by
8 meters.
1.06     The Third Water Supply Project (Loan 2333-BT of July 7, 1983) for
US$ 22.0 million, which is the subject of this Report, was made directly to
WUC with the guarantee of the Government. The Bank loan was for a period of
17 years including a grace period of 4 years with the interest being variable
in accordance with the Bank's procedures. The project was in three parts.
Part A of the project was for the raising of the Gaborone Dam by 8 metres.
Part B was for the extension of mains and treatment works in and around
Gaborone township as well as construction of service reservoirs and pumping
stations. Part C was for the financing cf studies And preliminary design work
on future dam sites.  The lcan also included f'nancing of studies fo;
manpower development and training.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     In recognition of the rapidly increasing water demands in the
eastern part of the country, the Government in the mid-1970's commissioned a
numbe: of studies with the assistance of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the African Development Fund (AfDF). Their purpose was to
investigate the feasibility of developing supplies from (a) the principal
streams of northeastern Botswana; (b) the Okavango Delta; (c) eleven sand
rivers of eastern Botswana; and (d) boreholes. Other studies were carried
Raising Preliminary Investigation Final Report in January 1982.

2.02     Following these studies and a further supplementary report which
showed that the Gaborone Dam Raising was the least cost alternative and in
the light of the drought situation and the urgent need for additional water
resources, in 1982 the Government requested the Bank's assistance in
financing a project to which they gave the highest priority.
Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.03     The need to augment Gaborone's water supply was foreseen during the
appraisal of the Bank-financed Second Water Supply Project in 1979 (Loan
1763-BT), and as a result funding was included for engineering investigations
and a preliminary design to increase the capacity of the existing Gaborone
Reservoir.
2.04     An appraisal mission visited Botswana to appraise the Third Water
Supply Project in November 1982. In addition to financial and technical
personnel, the appraisal mission included a legal representative to assess
the status and adequacy of the assurances received by the Government of
Botswana with respect particularly to the upstream riparian rights. This
issue had been of especial concern to the Bank, and had postponed appraisal
by several months while a satisfactory solution was sought.
2.05     Negotiations took place in April 1983.  Assurances were received
from the Government that:
a)     any proposed changes to existing water legislation uould be
made available to the Bank for review and comment;
b)     adequate funding would be provided for the secondary and
tertiary distribution systems and;
c)     any land acquisition costs in connection with the raising of
Gaborone Dam, in excess of Pula 200,000, would be reimbursed
to WUC.
Other assurances received from WUC covered the retention of the
services of a panel of experts, appointment of consultants acceptable to the
Bank for design and supervision of construction and appointment of
consultants to assist with the manpower development study, and financial
aspecrs of the Loan Aareement.
2.06     The loan was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on July 8,
1983, and became effective from September 16, 1983.
The Proiect's Role in the Long Term Plan
2.07     The Project is located in Gaborone which is the administrative,
major commercial and education centre of Botswana and the seat of Government.
In 1978 the Cabinet decided that Gaborone should be developed towards the
west and an urban development plan was prepared for Gaborone West which was
the basis for the design of the required extensions to the water supply
facilities.



-4-
2.08     The principal objectives of the project were to augment and secure
the water supply to Gaborone through the raising of the existing dam by 8
metres to meet the city's water demands up to about 1988, and to expand
Gaborone's existing water treatment and supply system to cater for the
increased water availability, thereby enabling the Gaborvne West development
to proceed. The project also provided for the site investigations and
preliminary designs of two dams on the Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba Rivers to            2
further augment the water supply to Gaborone beyond 1988.
2.09     The Department of Town and Regional Planning of the Mi.nistry of
Local Government and Lands of the Government conducted population growth
studies for Gaborone and projected that the annual percentage increase would
be 81 from 1982 to 1990. Gaborone's and Lobatse's future water demands were
projected up to 1991 based upon unit water demands for house connection and
public standpipe users, projected population growth and demands by
industrial, commercial and institutional water consumers. In the event, the
actual population expansion up tc 1987 has been closer to 12% annua 2y and
following recovery from the period of water restrictions imposed f.om March
1983 to December 1984 due to the drought, water demand is continuing to rise.

2.12     Under the project, consultancy services were also required for a
manpower development study and training support.
Dam Safety
2.13     In view of the size, complexity, and required speed of construction
the Bank requested WUC to appoint a panel of experts to review the design and
safety aspects of the dam. A panel of three experts was appointed and
submitted their report in early January 1983 which WUC, its consultants, and
the Bank reviewed and accepted. The panel's recommendations were
incorporated into the contract for the dam raising. During negotiations, WUC
agreed to retain the services of the panel of experts to review the
construction of the dam, and to make satisfactory arrangements for periodic
safety inspections of the dam and other works after completion of the
project. This was undertaken.
Covenants
2.14     The principal covenants in the GuaraL.tee Agreement were that the
Government wculd:
(a)    make available to the Bank, a copy of the reports on the
review of existing water legislation covering domestic and
international water regulation, for review and comment prior
to the introduction of legislative changes.
(b)    ensure adequate funding for the secondary and tertiary
systems in a timely manner.
(c\    reimburse WUC for any land acquisition costs connected with
the raising of Gaborone Dam, in excess of Pula 200,000.

III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COSTS
Loan Effectiveness and Pruiect Start-Up
3.01     An mentioned in Para 2.03, the Bank agreed to accelerated project
processing and to advance contracting for the Gaborone Dam Raising Works.
Design work and preparation of the bidding documents by the
consultants proceeded in parallel with the Bank's processing of the loan
application.
During appraisal, Government requested retroactive financing of
about US$1.7 million equivalent to about 32 of total project cost and 82 of
the Bank's loan of US$22.0 million. The retroactive finance was to cover the
cost of:
(i)    engineering consultant fees for:
(a)    the preparation of preliminary engineering, bid documents,
evaluation and award of contracts for both the raising of the
Goborone Dam and the associated expansion of the treatment
plant and the main supply system; initial supervision of
construction of the Gaborone Dam Raising prior to loan
approval, and cost of the panel of experts, totalling about
US$0.7 million;
(b)    preliminary engineering of Kolobeng and Metsemotlh3ba Dams of
about US$0.3 million; and
(ii)   the site and soil investigations contract for Kolobeng and
Metsemotlhaba Dams of about US$0.7 million;
The Bank agreed, and WUC provided the initial funding until the loan
became retroactive with effect from 8th July 1983, thus ensuring that no
delays were experienced due to loan effectiveness. The start of the
construction phase proceeded without delays.
Revisions
3.02     There were a number of revisions to the extent and scope of the
contracts, the major ones of which are discussed hereafter. A schedule of
the variation orders issued for all the contracts is included in Annex 1 to
this report.
Part A - Gaborone Dam Raising
3.03     Significant additional works were required by the panel of experts
after completion of the detailed design. The main changes incorporated in
the works by Variation No.1 included:



-9-
(i)    replacement of the original double fuse section in the west
embankment by a single fuse 150 m in length contained by
rockfill and gabion zones. Additional anchorage of the
gabions in both the horizontal and vertical direction to be
provided by means at 20 mm diameter steel bars.
(ii)   a requirement that the earthworks in the new embankment be
brought up to existing dam crest level prior to commencement
of excavation in the crest.
(iii)  a drainage trench 3 m to 4 m in depth backfilled with filter
and drainage materials: to be excavated in alluvial ground at
the downstream toe of the new main embankment between
approrimately chainages +25 and +1,025.
(iv)   a requirement for both lengths of embankment to be protected
by the provision of a precast concrete wave wall located on
the upstream side of the crest at the top of the rip-rap
slope. The total length of the wall was some 3:200 m.
The only significant changes to the design after construction commenced were
due to ground conditions and rock in the foundations being different from
those anticipated. During excavation for the fuse foundation a dolerite
dyke was uncovered crossing the toe. The depth of the fuse toe excavation
was limited and the contractor was instructed to construct a concrete plinth
across the dyke on which to place the gabions. Weathering of the rock
beneath spillway blocks Nos. 1 to 11 necessitated additional foundation
excavations and mass concrete backfill.
Part B - Primary Assets
3.04     The main changes incorporated in the treatment plant, pumping plant
and associated equipment by variation orders were:
(i)    the addition of pumping plant to serve Tlokweng Village.
This was funded by the Government of Botswana;
(ii)   modifications to the series/paraliel pumping of the raw water
pumpsets to improve output at low reservoir levels;
(iii)  revisions to the booster pumpstation suction pipework and
reservoir control equipment at the Town Storage Site; and
(iv)   the inclusion of compressors and associated aeration
equipment at Gaborone Dam.
The main changes incorporated in the civil engineering and building works by
variation orders were:
(i)    additional roads at the Treatment Works and Town Storage
Site; and
(ii)   repairs to the existing 22,000 m3 reservoir at the Treatment
Works Site.



- 10-
Part C - Future Dam Site Investigations
3.05     Additional boreholes were drilled into the flank of the Kolobeng
reservoir and between the reservoir and the foot of the escarpment. WUC
requested minor extensions to the investigations to consider higher top water
levels for both the Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba reservoirs.
Part D - Secondary Distribution Mains
3.06     The main change to the scope of this component was the addition of a
4,500 m long 250 mm diameter asbestos cement pipeline from the Goborone
Treatment Works to Tlokweng Village.
Implementation Schedule
3.07     The implementation schedule showing the planned and actual progress
and completion dates of the various components of the project is shown in
Annex 2 to this report.
Part A - Gaborone Dam Raising
3.08     The contract for the raising of Gaborone Dam was awarded on January
25, 1983 for contract completion by November 9, 1984. This accelerated
implementation schedule required completion in time to impound the 1984/85
rains. The contractor mobilized rapidly, although some delays were
experienced with the commissioning of the hard rock crushing plant. Very
variable and unforeseen foundation conditions and initial difficulties in
procuring and placing the specified size of rip-rap to the upstream dam
embankment face necessitated the contractor to mobilize significant
additional resources to maintain the tight construction programme. Schedules
of the construction plant used and staff employed on the project are shown in
Annexures 3 and 4 to this report.
In the event incorporation of the additional works outlined in para 3.03
above extended substantial completion of the dam works to January 3, 1985.
This did not affect the designed operation of the dam as the reservoir did
not fill above the original spillway level until January 1986.
Part B - Primary Assets
3.09    This was split into two parts:
(i)    Contract No. 4 for the Treatment Plant, Pumping Plant and
Associated Equipment was awarded on May 1, 1984 for staged
completion before February 24, 1986. Although no sifnificant
problems were experienced with the supply of the equipment,
poor progress by the civil works contractor delayed access to
the various buildings eventually delaying completion of this
contract by eight months. An extension of time was granted
to November 7, 1986. Since commissioning, the contractor has
replaced, at no cost to WUC, the pump/motor couplings on the
Town Booster pumpsets to reduce excessive vibration noticed
on these pumpsets and the non-return valves to all the
pumpsets.



- 11 -
(ii)   Contract 5 (jointly financed by CDC and OPEC) for the Civil
Engineering and Building Works was awarded on April 27, 1984.
The programmed contract completion date was February 3, 1986.
Poor contract management, with inadequate site supervision
and failure to mobilize sufficient resources during the early
stages of the contract resulted in completion being delayed
by some eight months. The further consequence was delay in
completion of Contract 4 and the necessity to extend the loan
Closing Date from June to December, 1986. Settlement of a
claim by the contractor in respect of Contract 5 works is
still awaited.
°art C - Future Dam Site Investigations
3.10    No major problems were experienced with the site investigations for
the proposed Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams. The additional borehole
drilling and investigations referred to in para 3.05 delayed completion of
the site investigations from April 1983 to July 1983. The final Site
Investigation Report was submitted in February 1984. The consultants were
requested to assess alternative ground and surface water sources, and
recommend a proposed programme for conjunctive uses of the sources, together
with economic and financial analysis of the potential dam sites. These
additional studies resulted in delays to the preparation of the Final Report
on the Site Investigations and Preliminary Engineering Studies for the
Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba Dams project which was submitted on June 21, 1985.
Scheme implementation was deferred pending evaluation of other sources.
Part D - Secondary Distribution Mains
3.11     The contract was awarded on April 5, 1984 and was completed on time
without any major problems on January 3, 1985. The pipeline from the
treatment works to Tlokweng Village was authorized by a variation order and
completed in July 1985.
3.12     The consultants produced monthly and quarterly progress reports on
both financial and technical progress. The report3 were uaeful in keeping
WUC and the Bank informed on progress of the project.
Procurement
3.13     There were no problems regarding procurement of consultancy
services. The consultants who had prepared the Goborone Dam Raising
Preliminary Investigation Final Report in Jaunuary 1982 were retained for the
design and supervision of the project.
Part A - Gaborone Dam Raising
3.14    The procedure followed was in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Prequalification questionnaires were despatched to 52 applicants of whom 26
firms, from 13 countries, applied for prequalification. 13 companies from 8
countries, satisfied the minimum requirements for prequalification and were
invited to tender. Bids were received from 5 internacional experienced
contractors.



- 12-
3.15     Part B  -  Primary Assets
(M)    Contract No.4 - Treatment Plant. Pumping Plant and Asoociated
Equipment: The procedure followed was in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. In response to the Tender Qualification
Notice, 76 firms expressed their interest in either tendering
to carry out the whole contract or to supply goods, services
and materials to the successful tenderer. 46' were considered
to meet the minimum requirements for prequalification and
additional considerations including capacity, experience and
appropriateness of technology and resources were then used to
invite 14 companies from 6 countries to submit tenders. Bids
were received from 8 companiems.
(ii)   Contract No.5 - Civil Engineering and Building Works:  In
response to the Prequalification Notice, 28 firms and the
Austrian Trade Delegation applied for the Prequalification
Questionnaire of whom 24 firms from 10 countries responded.
Tender documents were issued to 9 prequalified companies from
6 countries and bids were received from 6 of them.
Part C - Future Dam Site Investigations
3.16     A Tender Notice was circulated by insertion in seveial Southern
Africa publications. As a result of the advertising, tender documents were
requested by 8 contractors who were subsequently invited to tenders; 3 bids
were received.
Part D - Secondary Distribution Mains
3.17     Tender documents were issued to 8 companies having been selected by
WUC as suitably qualified on the basis of resources, expertise and capacity
to carry out the works. Bids were subsequently received from 5 of these
companies. Winning bids for the contracts and the consultancy assignment are
presented in Table 3.1 below.

Costs and Disbursements
3.18     The actual total project cost was Pula 50.40 million, excluding
associated works and interest payments during construction compared to the
appraisal project cost estimate of Pula 49.9 million. The cost of the
Gaborone West secondary distribution mains and the additional cost of land
acquisition, totalling Pula 2.6 million, which did not form part of the
appraisal project cost estimates were funded by the Government of Botswana.
A schedule of the appraisal cost estimates and actual expenditure for Parts
A, B, C and D is shown in Annex 5 to this report. During the construction
period from January 1983 to November 1986, the exchange rate varied from a
high of US$0.9346 to the Pula in October 1983 to a low of US$0.4484 to the
Pula in December 1985. Two official devaluations of the Pulia were decreed
during the project period; a devaluation of 5.07% on July 7, 1984 and a
devaluation of approximately 15% on January 9, 1985.



- 14 _
3.19     For the Gaborone Dam Raising contract, the actual expenditure
compared very favourably with the bid prices and the pre-tender estimate for
the project. The costs of the additional works described in para 3.03 were
absorbed in the physical contingencies. The contractor submitted five claims
for additional costs.  Two main claims were for the extension of
time/additional costs for dam works and for recovery of cost arising from the
devaluation o' the Pula. The total assessed amount due to the contractor in
respect of these claims was Pula 1,039,096.20 This amount together with
additional costs due for the variation of price of certain scheduled
materials was covered by the price contingencies. The contract was completed
within the original project cost estimate, excluding the additional cost for
land acquisition which was paid by the Government.  It was recognized at the
beginning of the contract that if the contractor was to meet the extremely
tight construction schedule, prompt payment of the local and foreign currency
elements of the Interim Payment Certificates would be very beneficial to the
timely completion of the project. During discussions between the
consultants, WUC and the Bank it was agreed that the Bank would make
disbursement of the foreign component direct to the contractor's nominated
account. The payments were closely monitored and the agreed budget payment
dates were usually met or bettered. A schedule of payments up to the
completion of the dam works is reproduced in Annex 6 to this report. The
prompt and regular payments to the contractor undoubtedly contributed to the
smooth running and timely compl.>tion of the project.
3.20     Part B of the project, comprising the Primary Assets, was completed
within the original project cost estimate. The total value of the Variation
Orders for Contract Nos. 4 a,-d 5 amounted to Pula 921,421. The contractor
fcr the t.eatment plant, pumping plant and associated equipment claimed for
additional costs incurred by delayed access resulting from late completion of
the civil works contract. These were assessed at Pula 53,622. A claim for
additional costs by the civil works contractor is currently being assessed.
3.21     The site investigations for Part C of the project were completed
within budget. There was an overall additional cost of Pula 95,000 on this
part of the project incurred in the preparation of the Final Report due to
the request for the consultants to undertake the Conjuctive Use Study and the
additional financial analysis (para 3.10).
Disbursement
3.22     A schedule comparing actual with estimated disbursements is given in
Annex 7 to this report. Disbursement was prompt and in the case of the
Gaborone Dam Raising contract was particularly beneficial to the completion
of the project. The revised closing date for the loan was June 1987 and the
final payment to contractors was July 1987.
Operations
3.23     The raised Gaborone Dam had been completed and ready for full
impoundment for 34 months as at December, 1987. Good inflow during the
1985/86 tnd i986/87 rains filled the reservoir to a maximum level 2.65 m
above the old spillway level, thereby increasing the available volume of



- 15 -
stored water by 60S. During the raising of the dam, a weekly upstream
deformation survey was undertaken to monitor possible movement of a preset
grid of beacons. This was continued by the consultants through to the end of
the maintenance period, after which time it was taken over by WUC. No
significant unforseen movements were recorded. Hydraulic and standpips
piezometers were installed during the construction period to monitor pore
pressures and water levels. These were observed at regular intervals by the
consultants through to the end of the maintenance period. No significant
irregularities were noted although difficulties were encountered with
blockages In the standpipe piezometers. These were progressively rectified
during the maintenance period. A blockage in the downstream toe drain &.; CH
+ 1,000 on the right bank was also removed and the drain refilled with filter
material. Installation of all downstream structures to monitor seepage was
completed in April 1986. As required by the Bank, WUC appointed a firm of
consultants as Inspecting Engineera to undertake safety inspections of
Gaborone Dam. The first inspection visit took place in March 1986 and will
continue thereafter at yearly intervals and include inspection of all WUC
dams.
3.24     The pumping plant, treatment plant and associated equipment were
commissioned progressively from December 1985 onwards as the civil works
contractor provided access for the plant contractor. The final Taking Over
Certificate - for the treatment plant - was effective from November 7, 1986.
A number of operational problems were identified and rectifieds
(a)    incorrect impellers in No. 4 raw water pumpsets;
(b)    vibration of Town Booster pumpsets; and
(c)    failure of non-return valves to all pumpsets.
3.25     Although the 250 mm diameter pipeline to Tlokweng Village was
completed by July 1985, it could not be put into full use due to the delayed
commissioning of the pipeline being laid within Tlokweng by the DWA.
Performance of (2nsultants. Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.26     Performance of  ne consultants was good with close 'hands-on"
control rnd coordination being undertaken by the Gaborone office throughout
the whole period of design, supervision, commissioning and maintenance. This
was in addition to the normal site offices for supervision of construction,
and continuity of senior staff was maintained throughout the whole pediod.
3.27     The performance of the contractor on the Gaborone Dam Raising
project was good. The contractor had extensive -:ixperience of working in
Africa and set up a well structured site team with sufficient plant and
expatriate staff. Additional resources were made available as and when
required and full support was provided by the parent organization. The
standard of workmanship was generally good.
3.28     The civil and building works contractor for the treatment plant,
service reservoirs and pipelines had many years of experience on larger civil
works projects in Botswana, but had difficulty adapting to the complexities



- 16 -
of water retaining structures on this contract. Poor contract management and
frequent staff changes, both at Head Office and site level, resulted in
considerable delays. Failure to mobilize sufficient resources during the
early stages of the contract was never overcome.  Nonetheless, the quality of
the finished work was generally of a very high standard.
3.29     Performances of the other contractors were generally good.  No
difficulties were encountered with the supply of materials during the
contract periods, but delays did occur when the contractor was procuring the
replacement non-return valves for Contract !o.4.
3.30     Relatiors betveen the Borrower and Beneficiary, the Consultants and
the Bank were at all times excellent. The Borrower and Beneficiary (WUC) is
a small, highly efficient, compact organization witli a dedicated staff
determined to maintain the highest possible standards.
IV OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Part A - Gaborone Dam RaisinR
4.01     The raising of Gaborone Dam by 8 m enabled the reservoir to fill
above the old spillway level during the 1985/86 rains and reach a maximum of
2.65 m above the old spillway level during the 1986/87 rains. As a result of
significant inflow in late 1987 and early 1988, the reservoir was filled to
its enlarged capacity, 140 millien cubic meters, and spilled for 12 days in
March 1988.  Thus supply to Gaborone-Lobatse until 1991 was assured with no
further inflow. The annual raw water demand projected in the appraisal
report is compared with the actual total demand from Gaborone dam in Table
4.1 below. 4.1.

Demand was suppressed by the water restrictions in 1983/84 and 1984/85 but is
now recovering rapidly. Continued monitoring of the piezometers and
downstream seepage stations indicates that the dam is performing as
indicated. The aeration system installed as part of Contract No. 4 has not
yet been put into operation. The aim is to reduce the surface temperature of
the water in the reservoir and hence reduce evaporation losses.
Part B - Primary Assets
4.02     The additional treatment, pumping and storage facilities provided
under Contract Nos. 4 and 5 are fully operational and are well able to meet
the project objectives of additional treated water at the required quality to
meet the increasing demands of the Gaborone West Development. The water
restrictions imposed during 1983 and 1984 severely suppressed treated water
demand in Gaborone but since these were lifted in December 1984, treated
water sales are increasing in line with the earlier projections. The annual
treated water output projected in the appraisal report is compared with the
actual output from the Gaborone Treatment Works in Table 4.2 below.

Comparison of the treated water output in Table 4.2 with the raw water
abstractton in Table 4.1 indicates that the actual yield of treated water at
96% since.- 1983 is slightly better than the projected yield of 95% for the
same pfriod.
Part D - Secondary Distribution Mains
4.03      The installation of the secondary distribution mains has enabled
the Ministry of Local Government and Lands to proceed with the development of
Gaborone West Phase II. WUC are proceeding with the installation of tertiary
pipelines to match the ongoing Cevelopment.

Market
4.04     Project implementation coincided with severe drought conditions and
it was necessary for the Water Utilities Corporation to impose restrictions
on the use of water, between April 1983 and December 1984, which period
coincided almost exactly with the construction of Part A - the Gaborone Dam
raising. The use of mains water for gardens, swimming pools and construction
purposes was prohibited and the provision of new cornections was suspended
*xcept where domestic supplies were required for public health pur3oses.

4.05     As a result of the restrictions on supply, sales in the Gaborone area
were approximately 50% below projected unrestrained levels. In Lobatse where
water supplies to Botswana Meat Commission dominate demand, sales were only 30%
below. The degree of customer awareness of the need to conserve water during
the drought was high and hence there was an excellent response to the
Corporation's declared objective of managing demand downwards to levels
consistent with the meager resources available.



-19 -
4.06     Although all restrictions had been removed by January 1985 full
recovery to predicted levels of sales has not yet taken place. Factors having
impact include escalation in the cost of water, installation of water re-use
systems in some industrial installations, retardation of the development program
and greater consumer awareness of water-saving measures.
4.07     Water tariffs in Gaborone were increased from al average of 32
Thebe/cubic metre in 1979/80 to 44 Thebe in 1982/83, 99 Thebe in 1984/85 and 162
Thebe in 1986/87. For 1987/88, tariffs are projected to yield an average of 189
Thebe/cubic metre. The rationale and structure of the tariff is given in paras
5.05 - 5.07 below. Nevertheless, it would appear that the magnitude of the
tariff increases has moderated the growth in demand.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCF
Financial Oblectives
5.01     The financial objectives as defined for the Corporation in the
financial covenants of the Project Agreement include:
1)     To set and maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to earn an
annual rate of return on revalued assets based on the Botswana
Consumer Price Index published by the Government of Botswana ot
8% or better and to satisfy section 19 of the Water Utilities
Act.
2)     To review the adequacy of its tariffs before December 31 in each
financial year based on projections and budgets in order to
maintain the 8% rate of return.
3)     To restrain the incurring of any debt without the approval of
the Bank and this approval to be restricted to transactions
which met the criteria of achieving a debt service coverage of
at least 1.5 on its present loans including the debt to be
incurred.
After consideration of the effects on the Corporation's financial performance of
the serious drought situation which persisted for several years, the Bank
revised the required rate of return. Achieved rates compared with revised
requirements are as follows:

Financial Results
5.02     The financial statements on a comparative basis between the appraisal
forecast and the actual results for the Gaborone-Lobatse undertaking up to the
year ending March 31, 1987 are shown in Annexes 8, 9 and 10. These provide the
Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Source and Application of Funds,
respectively.
Income Statements
5.03     For the year ended March 31, 1983, the Gaborone-Lobatse results were
better than forecast, as the result of a higher-than-forecast sales volume sold
at a slightly higher average tariff than had been forecast at appraisal. The
operating ratio was 56%, and the Undertaking earned 4.14%, on revalued assets
with an average tariff of P 0.495 or about 45 US cents per m3.
5.04     Since 1983, the sales and income results have been below forecast, the
result of severe drought in 1983 and 1984. This necessitated the imposition of
water restrictions from March 1983 to December 1984, resulting in a 452
reduction in water sales from fiscal year 1983 to fiscal years 1984 and 1985.
Although sales began to recover following the lifting of restrictions on
December 21, 1984, the effect of the restrictions on water-use practices,
together with the effect of substantial tariff increases, has restrained
recovery of physical sales - which even by 1987 had not quite recovered to 1983
levels. Thus, sales and income results for both 1986 and 1987 have been below
the appraisal forecast primarily for this reason.
5.05     Tariffs:  From 1983 to 1987, the increases in average tariff for the
Gaborone-Lobatse Undertaking have been significant, showing an uplift of 2241,
well ahead of inflation which over the period 1983-1987 has totalled
approximately 611 as stated in the consumer price index report issued by Central
Government Statistics Office.



- 21 -
5.06     The tariffs charged by WUC's various divisions are different for each
undertaking and conform to the appropriate Bank loan covenants which stipulate
the accounting locations and the rate of return to be achieved.

However the tariffs are in stepped bands, the lower band applying to essential
public health needs. This recognizes the limited affordability of the lower
income groups and is less than the cost of supply. The short-fall in income is
subsidised by the higher charges within the upper tariff bands.
Average tariffs for Gaborone have increased as follows:

5.07     The tariff in Gaborone within the bands has increased as follows from
1983 to 1988:

70+                    49              253                39.9
It is thus apparent that the effect of the water restrictions in 1984 and 1985
was to concentrate consumption on the lower tariff bands. As demand recovers,
increasingly more water is being consumed by larger users leading to a greater
increase in the average tariff achieved.
5.08     Cnwrating Costs:  Except for depreciation, operating costs are broadly
in line with those anticipated. The reduction in anticipated fixed assets flows
through to lower depreciation charges. Section 19 of the Water Utilities
Corporation Act requires the WUC to earn a reasonable return on the capital
employed, and in defining the term 'reasonable return' mentions that net income
should be sufficient among other things to make dividend payments to Government
in respect of its equity interest in WUC. The Government's interest in WUC
represented by irredeemable capital of Pula 96,000 in respect of the Gaborone-
Lobatse Undertaking and a similar equity interest in Francistown of P65,000 was
redeemed on 31 March, 1988.
Balance Sheet
5.09     The consumer receivables for the Gaborone-Lobatse division for the
period 1983-1987 are shown in the table below compared with those projected at
appraisal. The balance sheet (Annex 9) includes inter-divisional current
accounts and other small miscellaneous receivables.

- 23 -
The increase in 1986 and 1987 to 232 and 322, respectively, occurred during the
change-over from a manual system to a computerised system of billing, compounded
by a move to new premises in January 1986. Receivables were seriously affected
by the difficulty experienced in collecting Government Debts. A simplified
method of billing is being introduced and regular control meetings are taking
place with government finance officers, representing the main ministries. The
Government's Accountant-General has recently indicated his agreement to a system
whereby the WUC will receive one cheque covering all government expenditure on
urban water on a strict monthly basis.
5.10     Regular daily disconnections are being madw in all areas in respect of
outstanding debts. This has resulted in a significant reduction in these debts
to approximately 202 of sales in the six months ending in September, 1987.
5.11     Revaluation of assets has been based on the "urban all items" cost of
living index and comparison with the appraisal report is as follows:
Year                      Actual       Appraisal           Variance

1987                        9%             -
Inflation appears to be closely related to the appraisal figures but cognisance
should be taken of the fact that consumer price index is heavily weighted to
food products and household requirements and is not a truly representative
measure of WUC assets. It is also recognized that published inflation indices,
in common with most countries, relate to other considerations besides the
commercial, the mix of items and the weighting given is also a point of
assessment. Dur'ing 1984 and 1985 the stated rate of inflation is lower due to
the strengthening of the Pula against the Rand but subsequently affected by
devaluations of the Pula. From 1983 to 1986 the compounded inflation in the
appraisal report was 50.4% compared to the index rates of 47.4%.
Source and Application of Funds
5.12     Annex 10 gives details of the sources and application of funds compared
to the appraisal report. The appraisal report criteria of excluding cash
movements has been adopted for the sake of comparisons although this is at
variance with the internally measured changes in financiel position used by WUC.
1984 and 1985 figures for Operating Surplus of P 824,000 and P 1,989,000



- 24 -
respectively reflect the drought-related shortfalls in revenue referred to
elsewhere in this report (para 5.04) which necessitated the introduction of two
short term loans of P 1 million in 1984 and a further P 3 million in 1985. The
depreciation element of P 1,586,000 in 1986 compared to the appraisal total of P
2,700,000 is a result of less fixed assets being required than was anticipated.
5.13     The borrowings line contains the element of currency exchange
fluctuations which continue to have a profound effect on WUC's funding
performance.
5.14     In summary, WUC has met all its financial targets (as modified for the
drought) to date. Its accounts are well-kept ane have never been subject to
audit qualification. Year-end accounts were produced at the end of the year
1986-87 in record time and monthly accounts are now a regular feature of the
financial control system.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.15     The economic rate of return of the project is the discount rate at
which the present value of capital and operating costs is equal to the present
value of benefits attributable to the investments over the economic life of the
project. Capital and operating costs and the benefits associated with the
increase of system capacity have been included in the cost and benefit flows.
5.16     Incremental water volumes translated into revenues have been used as
the best option for income attributable to the investment. Further revenues
have been based on tariff increases already planned together with short-term
forecasts and long-term possibilities. On these bases the economic rate of
return (ERR) in terms of base year prices is 8.4:1/ compared with 8.3I forecast
in the appraisal report.
5.17     Details are shown in Annexes 11 and 12.  The ERR will continue to be
monitored and does not recognize the increased ERR which would have resulted if
the unquantifiable health, environtmental and social benefits could have been
included.
Covenants
5.18     The WUC has fulfilled the financial reporting requirements of the Loan
Covenants. Its accounts have been maintained on a divisional basis, and have
been audited by a reputable international firm of auditors. Half-yearly interim
accounts and five-year financial forecasts have also been provided on a regular
and timely basis. The requirements of the Bank covenant;s have been met in
respect of the rate of return and the amended rates of return for the drought
years together with a consistently applied debt coverage which, whilst not met
in 1985 in isolation, was adequately ettained in 1986 and 1987.
1/       During 1983 and 1984, severe drcught in Botswana necessitated sharp
restrictions on water use, adversely affecting WUC's revenues despite increases
in tariffs. The borrower's calculation of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for
the completed project (para 5.16) does not take account of the effects of the
drought on the benefits, but instead assumes the full physical yield that would
have prevailed without the drought. On this basis the ERR is 8.4X. Re-
calculation of the ERR taking account of the drought is 5.62. Details of the
re-caluculation are shown in Annex 11 of this report.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organization
6.01     A high degree of efficiency in WUC management was maintained throughout
the project period . There was one change in Chief Executive (September 1986)
and a number of minor organizational changes. The present organization, shown
in Annex 13, is being re-structured as shown in Annex 14 to establish 4
functional corporate departments in place of the previous geographical
divisions. The Operations Department has been subdivided into 4 operational
areas.
6.02     The present establishment comprising 379 posts designated as permanent
and pensionable has been amended to show 566 permanent posts, which are
currently filled by staff in both permanent and pensionable and industrial class
categories. A manpower budget of 703 is predicted for 1990-91, reflecting
increases in operational staff resulting from expanded operations and the
intended establishzent of a Development Section and a Consumer Services Unit.
Within the current establishment 21 posts are filled by expatriate staff on two-
year contracts which may be extended by one year or renewed for two years as the
need arises. There is however a high turnover - particularly within the
professional cadre, where only one of the present eleven staff in this category
was present in 1983 when construction started. There is one professional
Botswana in staff - she occupies the post of Principal Administrative officer.
Manpower Development and Training
6.03     At the time of appraisal, it was recognised that WUC was highly
dependent upon expatriate management, and although the lack of professional
Botswana staff had not resulted in pioblems thus far, there was a need to
emphasize training and development with a view to accomplishing localization
without a loss of performance and efficiency. A total of Pula 600,000 was
provided in the Project budget for e manpower development study and training.
Pula 21,000 was expended on the study conducted, with the Bank's approval, by a
local consultancy firm in 1984.
6.04     A principal obstacle to the localization of senior management positions
has been the lack of engineering and financial graduates who could be recruited
to commence professional training and eventually move into senior management.
In the last year or so of the project, greater progress has been made in
recruiting such graduates. There are now 4 graduate engineers and 5 Bachelor of
Commerce (accounting) graduates at various stages of development, and thus a
pipeline of potential Botswanan candidates has been created for the senior
technical and financial positio5s.
6.05     Following the manpower development study, funded under the project,
greater use has been made of the facilities available at Botswana Polytechnic
for the training of engineering technicians and craftsmen. Twenty-one students
have been sponsored for various courses by the Corporation, and it is from these
that future senior superintendents and higher technicians are expected to
emerge. Training of accountants and sub-accountant level staff has continued,
mainly at the Botswana Institute of Administration and Commerce. There continue
to be some losses in this sector, mainly because of the more favorable salary
scales available in the private sector.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Prolect Achievements
7.01     The project achieved all its planned objectives in terms of the
following:
a)     Increased the reliable yield from the primary raw water
supply source, Gaborone Dam.
b)     Increased the rated capacity of the Gaborone Treatment Works
by about 802.
c)     Improved systems stability and flexibility of the supply from
source.
d)     Increased systems reserve capacity in terms of pumping unit
standby plant and treated water storage within the
distribution system.
e)     Increased ability to meet demand growth rate in Gaborone and
thus enable the Government to continue with the large scale
development of Gaborone West.
Least Cost Alternative
7.02     The economic evaluation undertaken by the consultants, when
preparing the engineering studies in 1981, showed that the raising of
Gaborone Dam by 8m was the least cost solution for the provision of
additional raw water supplies to Gaborone. Since the actual cost of putting
the complete scheme into operation was within the original budget the project
still represents the least cost solution.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     In general, the Bank performance was good.  Of particular importance
and benefit was the Bank's cooperation in accelerating the administrative
processes at project commencement, and its willingness to provide retroactive
financing when, because of the urgency with which the project was needed,
Government had decided that the Corporation should proceed towards
implementation prior to foriuaal Bank approval. The Bank also facilitated in
obtaining OPEC financing in tile amount of US$2 million for the project.



27 -
Supervision
8.02     Active supervision of the project continued through the
implementation period with a total of six supervision missions from August
1983 through September 1985.
Working Relationships
8.03     Cooperation and formal exchange of information between UIC, the
various ministries in Government and the Bank were generally very good and
contributed to the speed with which the project was negotiated and
implemented. However, in the latter phase of implementation consultation
mong parties concerning the siting and design of the follow-on project which
was being funded from this locan could have been better. Relations between
Bank staff and the consultants were excellent.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     As of March 1988, the raised dam had been filled to capacity and
spilled for 12 days - there was thus sufficient water impounded to su?ply to
Gaborone-Lobatse until late 1991, based on forecast growth in demand over the
next 3 years.
9.02     As a result of the drought in 1983 and 1984 which reduced the demand
for water following completion of the dam, the dam's economic return
(discounted back to commencement) has been below forecast. However, the
annual financial rate of return on assets employed had recovered by 1987 to a
level in excess of that required under the loan covenants.
9.03     During the period of the project WUC has been very competently
managed under expatriate management. Localization appears to be gaining
momentum with all posts up to Waterworks Superintendent level filled by
citizens as of 1987. A number of employees are expected to obtain
professional qualifications in accountancy and engineering within the next
year or so - from whom it is expected that future Botswana senior managers
will be drawn. Nevertheless this area continues to require attention and
merit concern, as the number is inadequate.
9.04     In summary, the Project has met its physical goals (other than those
temporarily affected by the drought); some progress has been made in
management development, but the objectives were not clearly specified In
numerical terms in the appraisal report. The Government of Botswana and WUC
have fulfilled all the covenar,ts under the Guarantee and Loan agreements.

we query the basis on whil the incremental revenuo and tence
the 3M in Annex 11 have been calcluAtd. Voiwre sales in
the  lower  tariff  band  are  significantly  lss  than  the
existing bas of 5566.

St culd be argued that the increental yield from the project is
directed principally at danwnd in the higher tariff bend and that
the ctual tariff! used for the calculation of incrmentl reveniuo
should reflect this.

COHIWMTS FROM THE BANK TO THE BORROWER'S COMMENTS ON CALCULATION OF
INCREMENTAL REVENUE (ANNEX 12)
While initially there appears to be some validity to this query we
believe, upon further consideration, that our computation is sound and
should be retained for the following reasons:
(i)    In any work involving incremental economics and the
use of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) or internal rate of
return one must beaware of the 'fallacy of
zomposition' or its reverse. The water supply system
and its tariff structure are a unified whole, it being
primarily a management policy decision (and only
partly market - sensitive) to determine the bands
shown. The implication of attributing high tariff
sales to the new facility is to leave the residual of
low-tariff sales with the existing facility, thereby
rendering the existing facility uneconomic or less
economic than it was prior to the expansion - which is
clearly fallacious;
(ii)   For the reasons given in (i) above, it is more
appropriate to use the average incremental tariff as
we did. This is also consistent with the Appraisal
Report which used average tariff;
(iii) The data supplied at this time are not sufficient to
determine the incremental high-band volume (as we need
the 1983 comparative figures as the volume base), and
we do not know the mix of high band volumes between
the 30-50 m3/month volume and the over 50 m3/month
volume;
(iv)   The pattern of high-tariff volume growth in the years
shown has also shown more volatility due to the
drought conditions; and
(v)    It should be noted that in 1986, we used an average
actual tariff of P1.45/m3 (discounted for inflation to
P1.16/m3 in 1983 prices) as compared to an actual
tariff of P1.50/m3 for the 30-50 m3/month band in
1986. The actual average tariff P1.16/m3 in 1983
prices comipares with the Appraisal Report tariff of
P1.16/m3 in 1983 prices.
Finally, we wish to emphasize that as a result of the drought in 1983 and
1984 which reduced the demand for water following completion of the dam,
the dam's economic return (discounted back to commencement) has been below
forecast. However, the annual financial rate of return on assets employed
had recovered by 1987 to a level in excess of that required under
covenants.
