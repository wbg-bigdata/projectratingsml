1.1.2 Who should use this manual? 
The manual is written for several different groups: provincial project officers,
county-level project planners, project managers, and township facilitators. Given
differing modes and levels of involvement in PRCDP, we suggest that certain

                                                                                    6
                                                                  Introduction 
chapters and sections may be focused on by particular staff depending on their
involvement in the project.


PRCDP


Provincial and County-level project (management) officers need to understand
the project cycle of the entire PRCDP, and basic principles and quality
requirements of the participatory approach in the PRCDP. They should therefore
focus on Chapters 1, 3 and 4 and some of the `good practice' cases.

PRCDP
PRCDP


County and township project planners and implementers will need to refer to all
sections of the manual, particularly Chapters 1, 2 and 3, dealing with procedures
and methods of PPA and PP. They should read carefully the practical cases,
examples and guidelines included in the annex of Chapter 2 and 3. The indicators
and checklists on participation are a useful reference for project workers
throughout the participation process.


PPAPP


Project management and supervision should refer to the indicators and checklists
included in each chapter to assess the project performance.



1.1.3 How this manual has been written
This manual is the result of one year of discussion, learning, reflection and
practice on participation within PRCDP as part of the cooperation between PRCDP
and ITAD. It includes contributions from project staff, facilitators and
practitioners in the three Provinces. The principles, methods and indicators have
been developed through a series of workshops and trialled in places within the
project areas1. Practical cases and examples written by the facilitators provide
valuable sources for learning on participation within the PRCDP area2. The

 Guangxi has contributed a valuable document on this process. It is included in the
Annex        of        Chapter         3       (learning         system           in
Guangxi).3

1.2 Participation in PRCDP; PRCDP

1.2.1 Background 
Over the past few years, governmental, public sector and non-governmental
organizations have devoted considerable time and resources to the development
of poor areas and particularly the poorer sections of the community. At the same
time, government at all levels and social organizations have come to recognize
that reliance on top-down planning and decision-making is unlikely to result in
sustainable development and capacity building of local communities. Local
communities, local government organizations and NGOs are seen to play equally
important and decisive roles in poverty alleviation.







PRCDP aims to improve livelihoods and capacities for sustainable self-
development of the poorest groups in Provinces within the project. Effective
cooperation between the government, Project and target groups has become the
key condition for success of PRCDP. To achieve this, PRCDP is working to ensure
sustained and effective participation of poor groups, women, ethnic minorities
and marginalized groups throughout the whole project cycle: from poverty
analysis and development planning to implementing, monitoring, evaluating and
revising project activities.

Poverty alleviation projects in China are increasingly using participatory
approaches. However, there are wide differences in understanding of
participation with no guidelines or manuals covering areas such as poverty
assessment, limited relevant practical experience, and a shortage offacilitators.
As a result, the use and impact of genuinely participatory approaches throughout
the project cycle have been severely limited. The most serious problem has been
the failure of poor groups to participate effectively, particularly in decision-
making, which has directly impacted on the success of development projects.




                                                                               9

Box 2: Key elements of a participatory approach; 2:

· Legal and policy framework: Government willingness to devolve some degree of
  autonomy in decision-making to local communities: In PRCDP this means strengthening
  the role of townships during planning and implementation.

  PRCDP
  

· Rights to manage and use land and natural resources: Recognition of the customary
  rights of indigenous people to their ancestral lands and the utilization of natural
  resources: In PRCDP this links with the reasonable compensation policies for
  resettlement or requisition of land.

  
  PRCDP
  

· Effective, culturally appropriate communication based on mutual respect: effective
  communication between the project and the local community should use traditional
  means of communication as much as possible, including local dialects, minority
  languages, folk songs etc.

  
  

· Building on traditional strengths Building on traditional environmental knowledge and
  livelihoods systems in the development of new knowledge, technologies and economic
  activities, fully understanding local people's preferences and rationales (not only during
  PPA, PP, but also during technical and environmental feasibility assessments).

   
  
  
  
  




In an attempt to fill this gap, the three provinces in South-West China (Yunnan,
Sichuan and Guangxi) involved in PRCDP have pooled experiences of
participatory development, particularly Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA) and
Participatory Planning (PP) carried out during the first half of 2004, and past
experiences (such as Qinba Poverty Alleviation Project financed by the World

                                                                                          10

1.2.2 Progress on participation 
Although there is a growing base of experience in using participatory
methodologies in South-West China, most are PRA-type methods, and their use
has been limited to project planning and needs assessment. There is wide
recognition that participation can lead to better-targeted and more effective
poverty alleviation3, but limited experience of use of participation in community-
centred projects through all stages of the project cycle within the government
system.

Therefore, the challenge for the PRCDP is to implement a participatory approach
effectively throughout the project cycle using local facilitators (such as township
and county government staff) rather than outside experts, and also

During the project preparation phase, the three PRCDP Provinces have trialled
and implemented participatory poverty analysis and planning as part of their
feasibility studies in sample villages. In addition, participatory implementation
and PM&E has been tried out in pilot villages in Guangxi 4. Their experiences with
participatory methods have been incorporated in the manual to describe the
localised approach taken by PRCDP (Chapter 2).

1.3 Concept of Participation 

1.3.1 What is participation? 
Participation means different things to different people. In China there are a wide
range of interpretations from simply being there to empowerment - a process
through which primary stakeholders influence and share control of their
development initiatives, decisions and resources5.

""


Participation ranges from superficial or shallow to deep or meaningful, for
example participating in project decision-making. The following table (Box 3:
Spectrum of modes of participation; 3:)illustrates the
spectrum of modes of participation. Different stakeholders (such as villagers
within the local community) may be engaged in different levels of participation.

1.3.2 Who should participate?                
All stakeholders who are directly or indirectly affected by or can affect the project
should participate in the development process. These include:

PRCDPPRCDP

      ·   Provincial and county project offices (PMO)

          
      ·   Township working stations

          
      ·   People in the community within the project area, especially poor groups,
          poor households and women.

          
      ·   Indirectly affected groups, such as township people who may benefit from
          improved infrastructure and services, nongovernmental and private sector
          organisations.

          
Although different stakeholders have different levels of power, different interests
and different resources (such as money, time, land, etc.), all stakeholders need
to work collaboratively in development projects. This Manual focuses on ensuring
effective participation of poor groups and individuals in the PRCDP process.

1.3.3 Who are the project                        primary        stakeholders?
               
The approach taken by PRCDP is poor people-centred with the focus on
mountainous areas, minorities and other disadvantaged groups. Special attention
is given to including particularly poor natural villages and marginalised groups
(including the poorest households, women, ethnic minorities).

PRCDP



Many cultural, economic and political barriers effectively prevent the poor from
having any real stake in development activities. The poorest tend to be
particularly adversely affected, including women, unless policies are in place to
ensure the conditions and opportunities necessary for their successful
participation.



The poorest villages are usually located in isolated and remote locations which
lack access to infrastructure and communication. Their environment is
characterized by difficult ecological conditions which make them vulnerable to
natural disasters.



The poorest households are those with high dependency ratio, few assets,
living in remote areas and facing cultural isolation due to language barriers or
low levels of education. Within households, particular individuals are likely to
face discrimination due to physical disability, gender or age. The use of a
participatory approach to poverty assessment and village planning will increase
the capacity of the project to ensure that the poorest households and individuals
can benefit from the project as well as providing data to monitoring the impact
on equity in project areas. It will also provide the opportunity to include
villagers' own views on existing approaches and constraints to ensure that the
priorities and technical approaches to project activities support villagers'
preferences and build their existing capacity and capital.

Women have consistently been found to be the group most seriously affected by
problems of poverty. At the same time, women do not automatically benefit from
efforts to involve poor people in poverty alleviation projects. This is because
women's economic situation and development priorities are often assumed to be
the same as those of other poor groups, even though they play completely
different roles both in the community and at home to men or other poor groups.
In particular:





   ·   Local customs, beliefs and attitudes often limit women's participation in
       activities outside the home;

       
   ·   Women's economic and domestic workloads impose severe time burdens
       on them: thus they frequently have neither the opportunity nor the time
       to participate in community affairs;

       
       
   ·   Certain customs, policies and even the laws effectively limit women's
       access to credit, productive inputs, employment, education, information,
       medical care.

       
       
People from ethnic minorities are frequently losers in the development process,
despite being the poorest of the poor. As a result of historical and cultural
factors, ethnic minorities often live in remote locations away from the dominant
nationalities in the community. In addition, linguistic barriers make it especially
difficult for the outsider to communicate with ethnic minority groups, and to win
their trust. To ensure that ethnic minorities effectively participate in and benefit
from the project, PRCDP needs to incorporate the priorities of ethnic minorities
into all community development projects. It is also required to design the project
based on their particular situations and priorities in order to protect their
interests. This is a World Bank safeguard policy for ethnic minorities.

PRCDP


As a result, specific steps need to be taken to ensure provision of special
opportunities and channels for these groups to participate and benefit throughout
the project cycle. This manual describes specific mechanisms which can be used
to ensure participation of poor households, women and ethnic minorities,
including indicators for their participation.

    PRCDP

1.4.1 Objective and Rationale
It is a basic premise of PRCDP that the nature and causes of poverty differ from
place to place, between individuals and groups, between genders, between
ethnic minorities, etc. It is not possible to effectively address poverty by applying
a single solution in all locations. The different needs of different poverty groups
must be recognized and respected ­ the project should be tailored to address
different specific needs at the level of the very poorest (i.e. poor groups within
natural villages).

The participatory approach adopted by PRCDP aims to achieve a more effective
and sustainable poverty alleviation through the following objectives:

Objectives of Participation in PRCDP
PRCDP

  o   Poor communities are able to participate in decision-making and
      action related to need assessment, planning, implementation,
      monitoring and evaluation and are enabled to express their needs
      and priorities and achieve their objectives in terms of poverty
      reduction actively during the entire PRCDP project cycle:

      PRCDP
      
      
      The poor groups and communities including the marginalized, the
      disadvantaged and the socially excluded should find enough space to fully
      express their views under transparent and fair decision ­making process
      of PRCDP project cycle and have opportunities favouring resource
      allocation for human poverty reduction. The project process must reflect
      biases in decision-making in favour of poor groups and poor and remote
      villages/sub-villages.

      PRCDP
      
      
      /
  o   The needs of different poverty groups are identified and effectively
      addressed by project interventions:

      
      The poor and the marginalized groups find enough opportunities to
      determine indigenous poverty criteria based on which different social
      groups can be identified within the villages/sub-villages for appropriate
      pro-poor interventions under PRCDP. Poverty groups (households, sub-
      villages, women and small ethnic minorities) need to be identified and the
      indicators by which they are classified need to be described. PPA/PP
      outputs would reflect the need identification of the "poverty groups".

In order to succeed in working with the primary stakeholders throughout all
project stages and to ensure that the benefits of PRCDP reach the poor the
following principles should be taken into consideration.

need to produce their own Participatory Plans and all villages need to be engaged
in a participatory manner beyond the planning process, which means that

This simple project cycle with two stages in design8 (PPA and PP), an
implementation stage and an M&E stage is less sophisticated than the traditional
project cycle used for poverty alleviation initiatives, but the Participation Manual

project stages. In essence it is as follows:

1.4.3 A phased approach to PRCDP; PRCDP
The Participatory Approach will be implemented within three phases


   ·   PPA/PP during preparation phase, to inform the feasibility study and
       prepare for first year of implementation

       
       
   ·   During the first and second year: PPA/PP for all remaining villages directly
       targeted by PRCDP and start of participatory implementation and
       monitoring in villages which have already done their PPAs and PPs.

       PRCDP
       
       
   ·   Participatory implementation and monitoring in all remaining villages
       directly targeted by PRCDP

       PRCDP
The pilots undertaken in the Feasibilities Studies showed that the capacities for
implementing a participatory approach need to be built up over a time and that
the lessons from each case are useful for improving work on participation in the
next case. Therefore, each phase can be seen as a learning cycle, with the
opportunity to reflect and improve on the participation in the cycle between one
phase and the next





The advantage of this phased approach is that PMO and cadre staffs are able to
give better support to each village, because all villages will not be at the same
stage at the same time. This will reduce the administrative burden on each
Township and County. The costs of participatory planning and training in
participation are no longer front loaded at the start of PRCDP, but spread
throughout the project. The training pressure is thus less.


PRCD
P

There needs to be an agreed system for selecting the villages for each phase. It
is suggested that phasing occurs at the Township level, so that each Township
has a number of villages in each phase, and each phase thus consists of a
number of administrative villages in each Township. The villages for each phase
could be selected on the basis of the depth of poverty (eg the poorest villages

first), the type of investment needed (e.g. some sub-projects may require longer
than others), distance from the township, as a cluster, or because they were in
the Feasibility Study (e.g. take the FS villages as the first Phase), etc. It is up to
the PMOs to agree which villages will be in which phase, and explain why. The
output should be a phasing plan. This would not be a rolling plan; each annual

1.4.4 Principles for Rolling-Out              the    Participation      Approach;
      
   o   Each village will conduct its own PPA/PP based on the agreed principles
       and criteria (see Chapter 2) which will ensure an effective participation of
       the local community;

       PPA/PP
       
   o   PPA/PP shall be conducted within a phased approach, starting from pre-
       feasibility and continuing into the first two years of implementation;

       PPA/PP
       
   o   Rolling out PPA/PP will be part of the annual WB evaluation and county
       project evaluation and planning schedule, so that the PP outcomes can be
       incorporated into the county implementation plan of the next year;

       PPA/PPPP
       
   o   PPA/PP will serve as a starting point for adapting county-level planning
       and initiating village-level project implementation in a flexible way and
       according to local situations and needs;

       PPA/PP
       
   o   Considering the quality of the participatory approach will be the base for
       arranging the roll-out of PPA/PP. The counties will need to decide how
       many villages can be covered in each phase, considering capacities of

                                                                                   23

       local facilitators and previous experiences. Coverage of poor sub-villages
       and other marginalised groups within the villages must be adequate to
       ensure good quality of the PPA/PP process.

       PPA/PP
       
       PPA/PP
   o   Each village will have its own documentation of the PPA/PP process and
       outcomes. They will serve as a base for participatory implementation and
       monitoring at the community level.

       
       
   o   The contents of village plans will be adjusted as an outcome of the PPA/PP
       process and the county planning will be revised accordingly (within the
       limitations describe above).

       PPA/PP
       
   o   Roll-out of PPA/PP will be organized by county facilitators, but
       implemented by township and village facilitators along with the local
       community members.

1.4.5 Participation in the four stages of the PRCDP project cycle.
     PRCDP  
The approach taken by this manual is to describe and specify the participatory
approach within the four stages of the project cycle along with basic principles,
quality indicators, best practices and issues to be considered and addressed.





    For good quality participation within the different stages, the approaches
    taken needs to follow the principles laid down in the first column of the
    table included below.

       
       
    The quality indicators specify the requirements described above; they
    form the base for monitoring the participatory approach in PRCDP.


                                                                              24

 The best tools/practices/methods described in each chapter illustrate
 how the basic principles can be implemented with good quality; they are
 drawn from experiences within PRCDP.

2.1 Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA) (PPA)

2.1.1 Objective of PPA; PPA
PPA is an assessment by local people, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, of
their poverty situation and the strategies they can use to alleviate poverty. A PPA
exercise in local communities and groups is generally facilitated by outsiders. It
has as its aims:

PPA
PPA
      To learn about people's perspectives and understanding of poverty;

      
      To learn about people's indigenous knowledge;

      
      To motivate people to think about their problems and solutions to these
      problems;

      
      To understand people's situation and the `reality' of the lives of the poor;

      



2.1.2 Why it is important to do a PPA; PPA
The focus of PPA is on the poorest and marginalized groups often neglected in the
course of poverty analysis and poverty alleviation strategies, in particular women,
and other disadvantaged groups/households. Their learning and appraisal of the
poverty situation is subsequently used in participatory planning and
implementation, for example to improve targeting of key groups, such as the
poorest households in the community. Thus the PPA exercise can improve
understanding of poverty of different social groups and households within the
communities, and inform county-level PRCDP pro-poor project planning exercises
and poverty alleviation project activities.

                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation


It is important to learn about people's perspectives, especially those of poor women
and men. Justification of PPA includes that:


PPA


   o PPA contributes to analysis and understanding of poverty based on local
      people's perspectives.

      PPA
   o PPA empowers local people to assess their own problems of poverty and
      propose ways of alleviating them.

      PPA
   o PPA contributes towards gradual capacity building of stakeholders at
      different levels.

      PPA


PPA is a demand-driven approach, where local people describe their experiences of
poverty and processes at work and identify ways to alleviate the situation.

PPA""



   o PPA offers poor people opportunities to participate in poverty analysis and
      poverty alleviation, thereby creating scope          for   poverty   reduction
      programmes to be more effective and efficient.

      PPA
   o PPA helps open channels of communication between policy makers,
      practitioners and poor people in determining poverty reduction policies and
      strategies.

      PPA
      
   o PPA helps improve poverty-reduction strategies and establish the roles and
      status of the local people in this process.

      PPA
   o Carrying out PPA on a regular basis can provide a system of built-in
      accountability for the "higher level" decision-makers.

2.1.3 The principles of PPA; PPA
In PRCDP, as described in Chapter 1, the local community is the central body of the
PRCDP project process: similarly for the participatory poverty assessment (PPA).
This means that destitute households, women, ethnic minorities and the other
marginal groups should play an active role in the PPA process, and the perspectives
and wishes of the different groups should be fully articulated. PPA should follow
these basic principles:

PRCDPPRCDP

PR
CDPPPA
   ·   Minimize and avoid all the usual biases during the PPA process (such as
       investigating   the    road-side    households/groups     and   neglecting
       households/groups living in interior locations; investigating men but
       neglecting women; visiting communities only in the dry season, not rainy
       seasons, and so on) to ensure information on poverty in the community is as
       complete as possible;

       PPA/
       /
       
   ·   Understand the diversity of poverty situations: poverty situations
       amongst different social groups, gender groups, age-groups and other ethnic
       and non-ethnic groups etc. are often highly diversified;

       
       
   ·   Adopt a holistic approach towards understanding of poverty and provide
       sensitive facilitation to ensure that different dimensions of poverty emerge
       from all viewpoints, especially those of the poor groups themselves, to help
       us better understand and interpret "poverty '';

       
       ""
   ·   The communities themselves, in particular poor groups in the
       communities, should discuss and decide their own "poverty criteria of the
       community'', rather than merely copying national definitions;




                                                                                36
                         Methodological Approach to Using Participation

       ""
       
       
   ·   Organise information on the basis of poor natural villages rather than
       simply by administrative villages.

2.1.4 Key contents of PPA; PPA
Classifying poverty groups: All households in the community should be grouped
by the households themselves (especially the poor) into different groups to indicate
different situations of poverty. This grouping should be based on indigenous
categories developed by the community, such as destitute households, poor
households and ordinary households;





A Poverty Analysis: to identify specific indicators and root causes of poverty   in a
multi-dimensional way (rather than simply stating shortage of money);





Seasonal poverty analysis: to analyse different indicators of poverty according to
seasonal changes, such as food shortage.




Analysis of history of poverty: to show how the current poverty situation has
evolved (from the past to the present day).




Poverty vulnerability analysis: primarily to identify key factors which might
directly reduce or aggravate poverty;

""



Gender analysis of poverty: to understand intra- and inter- household poverty
situations of different groups, especially the poorest and disadvantaged groups
(rather than simply the poverty differences between men and women generally);

Community institutional analysis: to identify institutions in the community that
play key roles in poverty alleviation, particularly those which could play key roles
in PRCDP;

Poverty situation analysis of ethnic groups: to ensure that the poverty
alleviation needs of all disadvantaged groups in the community have been

2.1.5.3 PPA field work; PPA
PPA may take many steps and many different tools should be used in the field. In
the following, some suggestions on conducting a PPA are given .

PPAPPA


Step One: Social grouping of natural villages in administrative villages


Villagers and/or their representatives discuss and decide on their own criteria for
defining social groups and then group the natural villages of administrative villages
into different social groups with different poverty situations according to these
criteria such as poorest natural village, poor natural village and normal natural
village. Essentially, the poorest natural villages will be the key project villages of
PRCDP.

PRCDP



          case 1: Natural Village Grouping on Poverty in Gaowen Village, Hongshui
             Township, Rongshui County, Guangxi province;
             
          case 2: Poverty Grouping Process, , Changning County,
          Yunnan Province


Step Two: Poverty grouping at household level



Using the citeria for poverty grouping discussed and decided by all households and
farmers' reps (Step 1 above), all households in the natural village are given a score
so that they can be grouped into three/four groups e.g. poorest, poor and middle
level households and/or better offs.






          case 3: Poverty grouping at household level in Dongling village, Banlan
             Township, Rongan county, Guangxi province;
             2



                                                                                    40
                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation


Step 3: Poverty analysis


All poverty groups need to be investigated and analyzed but the main focus should
be on the poorest groups. The following activities could be carried out one by one
or in parallel if the facilitators and associated resources are available.



   o Analysis of poverty problems and solutions: Facilitators should organize
      and facilitate local villagers to arrive at their list of specific poverty problems
      (such as poor drinking water supply) and also come up with their own
      solutions;

      
      
      
   o Seasonal poverty analysis and trends: The purpose of this is to
      understand seasonal poverty and poverty trends such as "the lack of food in
      May every year"

      
      "5"
          case 4: Seasonal poverty and trend analysis in Jindai village, Tongle
            Township, Sanjiang County, Guangxi province:
            


   o Vulnerability analysis: All community participants need to analyze
      (through good facilitation) factorswhich make them more and less
      vulnerable, whether poverty is getting worse or better under particular
      conditions, and whether these conditions could be managed or controlled in
      any way.

      
      /
          case 5: Vulnerability analysis in Jindai village, Tongle Township, Sanjiang
          County, Guangxi Province; 
   o Community institutions analysis: Facilitate community people to identify
      any formal institutions (such as villagers' committee) and informal
      institutions (such as private shops) in the community which affect aspects of
      poverty and especially any potential there may be for improving their role
      in through PRCDP as an institution which benefits the poor, as well as any




                                                                                      41

       ideas for managing local institutions which are not favourable towards
       PRCDP;

       
       PRCDP
       /
       


Step Four: Household interviews


Based on the poverty grouping, some households, especially the poorest, will be
interviewed individually as a sample group of key informants. All topics which have
been analyzed in community/group meetings (Steps 1-3 above) could be covered
within the individual household interviews: they can then be used to validate the
results of group analysis.





Step Five: Community meetings or villagers' representatives meetings:


Community meetings should focus on the confirmation and validation of data
collected previously during the PPA process, using a scoring exercise in decision
making. The success of the community meetings depends on how representative
the participants are (if it is difficult for all villagers to participate in the meeting), as
well as on the facilitation skills available to coordinate the priorities and views of
individual/minority groups with those of the other people/groups.

PPA can be carried out in different ways according to particular situations rather
than copying a blueprint "PPA Model" from an existing PPA exercise. The objective
of PPA is to focus on learning about the poverty situation by both local villagers and

people from local communities, so that the PPA may be endorsed as a true picture
of poverty with a local perspective.. The following indicators should be used by the
project management to guide the PPA. This basic list should be used as a guide to
develop more specific indicators, including quantified targets, according to local

It is important that PPA leads to follow-up action. As an immediate outcome of the
PPA process the community itself might decide to implement some concrete actions
to address the issues they have identified.

PPAPPA


In PRCDP PPA will be the basis for planning community projects. Participatory
Planning (PP) will build on the outcomes of PPA, as described in the next chapter.

PRCDPPPAPPPPA


Also, the assessment of poverty during PPA can provide some baseline information
for M&E. Follow-up PPAs during later stages of project implementation will help to
assess changes in poverty.

It is important to document the PPA process and outcomes both for planning and
monitoring purposes. During the feasibility phase, Guangxi has compiled separate
PPA reports10. During the roll-out of PPA/PP within the three Project Provinces, the
documentation of the PPA process and outcomes will be included in the PP-

2.2.1 PP and its Rationale; PP
As one of the prerequisites for implementing PRCDP, participatory village
development planning (PP) is an important component of the entire project. The
basic purpose of PP is to enable the poor households, marginal groups and other
key stakeholders (poorest households, women and other disadvantaged groups)
who have been identified and whose poverty situations have been analysed during
the PPA, to develop a joint strategy to overcome poverty through community
development activities. Poor households and groups should be enabled to feel
strong ownership over the PRCDP through effective participation in decision-making
on project activities. At the same time, PP can provide a point of reference for
county-level project planning and designing, making county-level project planning
of PRCDP more relevant to the realities of poverty at county and communitylevels.
PP will also assist in ensuring that PRCDP attains its poverty alleviation targets
through well targeted projects which meet the needs of the main poverty target
groups              (poor           households            and              marginal
groups).PRCDPPP

Thus, the basic purpose of PP is;

PP
      to ensure project planning of PRCDP is suited to the actual conditions of
      particular communities, poor households and marginal groups;

      PRCDP
      to effectively enable participation of the project community and target
      groups of project, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, in decision-
      making over their own development and supportive services (such as
      technical services);




                                                                                47
                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation


       
       
       to develop and improve community capacity to bring about sustainable
       socio-economic development of the communities and their different groups,
       particularly the poor and disadvantaged, by directly involving them in PP
       (emerging from PPA);

       PPAPP
       
       to promote community-based socio-economic development processes within
       and outside PRCDP: to develop participatory county planning capacity of the
       local government, and contribute to better understanding of poor
       communities and community development.

2.2.2 PP Principles; PP
PP is a key component of the PRCDP project cycle rather than an independent
process and should therefore follow the participation principles:

PRCDPPP

   ·   PP needs to be based on the outcomes of PPA, which includes the
       identification of the poor and disadvantaged target groups, poverty
       problems, causes and solutions;

       PPPPA
       
   ·   PP needs to consider and protect the needs and interests of poor and
       disadvantaged social groups, particularly women;

       PP


   ·   PP needs to use poor natural villages instead of administrative villages as the
       basis for planning;

       PP


                                                                                   48
                       Methodological Approach to Using Participation

·   PP needs to involve technical personnel for specific technical services;

    PP
·   PP needs to have specific management mechanisms for conflict settlement
    and mediation;

    PP
·   PP needs to ensure social and technical approval and validation of data and
    information generated during PP;

    PP
·   The budget framework of PP must be transparent and clear from the
    beginning;

    PP
·   PP        needs         to        avoid        decision-making             biases;
    PP
·   Feasibility of county plan in PRCDP needs to be linked up with PP. To focus
    on poverty groups and disadvantaged groups, continue to promote the
    effective participation and involvement of key stakeholders in decision
    making related to specific project activities.

    PRCDPPP
    
    


The facilitators will play a key role in supporting a fair and transparent process
of decision-making within the community and safe-guarding the interests of
marginal groups. The main purpose of PP is to decide who will actually benefit
from the project, and it is very important to avoid biases in this process. (see

number of these are listed in the following box for reference12. The main purpose of
using PRA tools in this stage is to identify priorities, potential problems and
bottlenecks which will affect the project design, to discuss them with the
community and reach joint solutions.

PP can be implemented in many ways. The following are key steps which should be
adhered to and some suggested methods13. The numerous case studies which are
included in the annex of this chapter provide practical examples and guidance on
how theses steps could be implemented.

PP



Step1: Community Meeting

 
1:

Community meetings are essential for facilitating a fair and transparent PP process.
If it is not possible to hold plenary meetings, facilitators need to ensure that the
poverty groups (such as destitute households, women and other disadvantaged
groups) which have been identified during the PPA, are sufficiently represented and
that solutions for addressing their specific problems will be developed during the
PP.




13
   During the preparation phase, the PRCDP Provinces have developed their specific
approaches to PPA/PP which share some commonalities, but also differ on some aspects.
For guidance and information, please refer to the guidelines and training material developed
by         the         Provinces.          PRCDPPPA/PP

          in Jindai village, Tongle Township, Sanjiang County, Guangxi province

           5


Step 2: Prioritise problems and solutions

2:
 

During the PP, the community will prioritise the poverty problems and solutions of
different poor groups that have been identified during PPA. Based on that, the
community will develop objectives for village-level development projects. It is
important to inform communities about available resources and financial constraints
before going into the planning.





        case 11: Determining priorities on poverty and its solutions, Pinchang County,
          Sichuan Province; 

        case 9: Gender Sensitivity in Ranking; 


Step 3: Develop project activities

 3: 

The aim of this step is to develop the list of project activities based on the
prioritised solutions and the objectives, check that the selected activities will
address priority problems and that the remote natural villages, poor households
and marginal groups (women, ethnic minorities) will benefit.

Step 4: Assess feasibility of proposed activities

 4: 

The aim of this step is to validate the project activities in terms of technical,
environmental and commercial feasibility by involving technicians and other
relevant people, as well as balancing the budget with PRCDP funds availability for
carrying out project activities;


PRCDP

Step 5: Specify        planning    of   project    activities    and    management
arrangements

 5: 

To develop and finalize the plan for implementation of the project, including specific
management methods for resolving conflicts during the project process, and to
develop the corresponding project budget, based on the list of final project
activities and project partners. The whole process of deciding and allocating
activities and resources requires balancing different interest and mediating conflicts
within the community and between project stakeholders.





    case 13: Conflict management, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province;  
                                                                   :

       Community-based Public Projects;  
                                        : 



Step 6: Project management plan

 6: 

To work out the community-based project management plan, including the
management body or mechanism, the management team and management rules;
this includes the arrangements for maintaining equipment and structures built
under the project.






                                                                                      55

      /


Step 7: Finalise project proposal document

 7: 

Based on the outputs of the earlier process recognized by the community and all
the stakeholders, draw up the project proposal. After sharing and confirming with
all the stakeholders, submit to PRCDP project management organization for
approval, and make feasible modifications based on the outcomes of examination
and approval.


PRCDP


In order to ensure that PP outcomes are within the budgetary limitations of the
county plan, county and township facilitators should be involved in PP, especially in
handling and fine-tuning pro-poor priorities and preferences. In this way the
priorities of destitute groups should be accurately reflected in the county plan.

2.2.4.3 Outputs of PP; PP 

PP should focus on developing and finalizing specific feasible project activities and
associated budgets, including a management plan for implementation of the
project.

The PP clearly needs to document what has been identified as the main problems
and causes of poverty, how they will be addressed and who will benefit from the
project. The facilitators should use a checklist for checking whether all these
aspects have been sufficiently analysed and documented.

2.2.5 Quality indicators on PP; PP
As mentioned above, PP can be implemented in many ways and by many methods
depending on the particular situation in different communities and the nature of
poor groups, rather than following a specific `PP Model'. However, regardless of
what is included and how the PP process is carried out, it is essential to ensure
extensive and representative participation of different groups in the communities,
particularly in the decision making process concerning priorities and preferences,
village development objectives and specific poverty alleviation project activities.
The following indicators provide a guide in assessing and ensuring the basic quality
of participation of different groups in the community. They are the basis for more

2.2.7 Integrating Village-Level PP into County-Level Project Planning
      PP
       
In PRCDP, County plans are the foundation and precondition of village plans (PP),
covering possible financial conditions and requirements on the percentage of
different project types. Therefore, before implementing PP, the basic conditions for
county-level projects will normally be taken as the starting point:

PRCDPPP
PP

   ·   Based on the findings of PPA and financial resources of PRCDP and budget
       constraints, initially decide on the project funding structure of the
       community (capital structure);

       PRCDP
       
   ·   Conduct participatory village plan (PP) based on this capital structure;

       PP
   ·   Feed back the specific project outputs from PP into the draft county-level
       plan, and make necessary adjustments and modifications to the county-level
       project plan. At the same time, combine the county-level project plan and
       technical, environmental, economic and market feasibility studies of different
       village-level project plans; make necessary adjustments to the village-level
       project plan (PP), including the type, scale and capital requirements of
       project activities; and create a level of harmony between the aggregated PPs
       and the county-level project plan;

       PP
       
       PP
       PPPP
       
   ·   Feed back the integrated county plan, particularly the village-level project
       plans (PPs), and obtain approval of the community; and finally incorporate
       into the county-level project plan.

       PP

                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation



In this way, village-level project plans (PP) not only fully reflect the actual needs of
the community, but are also incorporated into the county-level project plan of the
government, and became development plans recognized by the local government.
At the same time, PP was taken as a representative "sample'', reflecting the actual
situation and needs of the community: in this way helping to modify and improve
the county-level project plan, and make it more appropriate to actual needs and
conditions. The following diagram indicates the links between the county plan and
participatory plan process:

To ensure that the PP is integrated with the county plan, there are basic guarantees
for PP in the county plan. The people participating in integrating the project should
pay particular attention to the following:

PPPP

   ·   The people participating in integrating the project should involve the county
       and township facilitators who participated in the PP process;

       PP
   ·   All the staff should be familiar with the PRCDP process, and be prepared to
       give priority to supporting the development needs of poverty groups;




                                                                                  63

   ·   Be sensitive to the poverty situation and development needs of poor groups,
       women and other disadvantaged groups;

       
   ·   Be sensitive towards the protection of ethnic cultures and the ecological
       environment;

       
   ·   During the process of integration, the priority should be on satisfying PP
       needs of the community, instead of taking the existing county plan as a
       basic precondition

       PP
       
Thus, during the process of integrating all the PP reports into the county plans, the
focus must be on incorporating the needs of the poor and marginal groups. All the
outputs of plan integration should be fed back to the various poor groups of the
communities through appropriate mechanisms such as community meetings, and
be accepted by them. County plans need to include adequate documentation on the
process of PPA/PP.

2.3 Participatory Implementation; 

2.3.1 Purpose of this Chapter; 
To develop a participatory approach for different types of sub-projects (where
participation is feasible) and to specify how implementation will take place
specifically at the community level.






2.3.2 Preparing for            Participatory       Project       Implementation
      
Before going into implementation, the communities need to do a detailed
implementation plan which includes management and supervision arrangements.
Also, they need to finalise the selection and design of project activities.



During PP, villagers come up with a variety of projects and related priorities. They
then need to take a decision on which projects to implement as a priority, within a
limited budget and within the range of choices provided by the county plan. The
selection and design of projects for implementation needs to ensure that poor
natural villages are benefited and that the needs of the poorest households are
taken into consideration (with special focus on direct ways to involve poorest and
disadvantaged households). The process of selection and micro-planning needs to
be transparent and fair, but the facilitators also need to make sure that the voices
and needs of poor groups are reflected in selected project activities.

PP




A major risk of participatory project implementation is that the active contributions
made by the communities, especially on infrastructure projects, will increase the
labour burden of farmers and in particular that of women and vulnerable
households. The participatory planning process needs to be facilitated in a
reasonable way that will reduce pressure on the community and significantly
provide a sound base for project implementation.




                                                                                  66

During that phase, the failicator does not only support the communication and
decision-making process, but he will also need to safeguard the interests of
minority groups and marginal villages and households throughout the process. And
he needs to ensure that the project is implemented in a sustainable way, which
means looking at possible impacts beyond the phase of actual implementation.The
following checklist should be used by the facilitators to reflect if the participation is
in place or not, and what aspects need more focus.

2.3.3 Basic Principles of          Participatory      Project    Implementation
      
Participation during implementation means that villagers are actively involved not
only in doing the actual works, but in all levels of management and activities during
the course of implementation.        The basic principles of participatory project
implementation are described below.




   o Transparency throughout the process, with the community aware of
      the course of implementation

      
All important aspects of the entire implementation process (including main
activities, budget and expenses) need to be transparent for the communities. In
addition, public awareness activities need to be carried out to reach even the
poorest of the poor households, either through displaying it on village notice boards
or having small group meetings in different localities including poor ones. In
addition, results should be announced publicly and exhibited in places which are
easily accessible to all villagers.







   o Administrative village needs to set up coordination structure
      
The administrative village needs to select a facilitator or a coordination group who
will coordinate the planning and implementation process between different natural
villages. The person(s) in charge should have demonstrated/acknowledged
coordination skills and pro-poor bias. The facilitator will have to balance group
interests (with fairness and transparency and ensure pro-poor related
interests/activities), coordinate issues which go beyond the natural villages, ensure
appropriate convergence of social and technical appraisal, facilitate communication
between different parts of the village and village groups and resolve conflicts as and
when required. Village Facilitators could be cadres from the villagers' committee or
other people. However, during the course of project implementation, the Facilitators
and the cadres from the villagers' committee should be mutually supportive not at
variance.






                                                                                   69
                         Methodological Approach to Using Participation








   o Project Implementation Group needs to be based where the project
      is (natural village)

      
The actual project implementation will be done by the project implementation
group. This needs to be based where the project is located, which means that if the
project is implemented in one or several natural villages, the project
implementation group would be organized locally rather than in the administrative
village. The project implementation group will be responsible for organizing physical
works, procurement and monitoring the work progress.







   o Facilitators and Project Implementation Group to be elected by
      village plenary meeting (or villagers' representative meeting)

      
Election of villagers or villagers' representatives are normally carried out through
village plenary meetings, which are an important forum to discuss and decide
matters of importance to all villagers. Such meetings need to be organized in a
transparent and fair manner, and ways found to enable the poor to express their
views and priorities. There should also be a forum to elect the village facilitators
and the members of the project implementation group with appropriate
representation of members from ethic minorities, women and the disadvantaged
groups. Community plenary meetings include administrative village level meetings
and natural village level meetings. If it is impossible to hold village plenary
meetings due to residents living far apart from each other, then managers elected
as villagers' representatives from all the natural villages should discuss and decide
community affairs. Among the villagers' representatives, there must be an
adequate percentage of poor households, ethnic minorities, women and other
groups.







                                                                                  70
                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation







Electing personnel for project implementation means that the existing (official)
structure of village administration is not automatically used for project
implementation, but that villagers jointly decide on who would be the best persons
to take over the specific tasks within the project, also considering the sufficient
representation of women and ethnic minorities in the implementation group.







2.3.4 Participation in Community-Based Projects; 
Community­based projects are targeted ato villages and implemented by villages.
In this type of project there are ample opportunities for community participation,
beyond the contribution of labour. This type of project should be implemented in a
way:



   -   That helps to build the communities capacities for collective action and self-
       help throughout the process of implementation, and
   -   
   -   That the specific interests needs of poor households and of minority groups
       are safeguarded.
   -   



2.3.4.1 Participation in Infrastructure Projects 
For the community, rural infrastructure is a type of non-monetary investment.
Therefore, it is an important issue for the community if the money is going to be
invested in the poor sections of the community, and their percentage share of the
investment. At the implementation stage, the investments made to a particular
village should be properly publicised. There should be participation of community
households in allocation of money within the village, including which poor sub-
villages (natural villages) are to be the focus of project investments. The basis for
infrastructure investments by households is the project target group, which is a
sensitive issue, and needs to be fully discussed and decided by the community.



                                                                                  71
                          Methodological Approach to Using Participation







For guidance on participatory implementation of infrastructure projects, facilitators
should refer to the practical examples from the field. The projects implemented by
the communities themselves best display the steps taken, how participation occurs
and issues and questions arising. The guidelines included in the annex provide a
relatively detailed description on participation in different projects.






    Practical Guideline 1: How to implement infrastructure projects in a
       participatory way 1: 

    Practical Guideline 2: How to implement community shopping2:
       



Community shopping: Even though community procurement is not a type of
project, it can be applied to either the self-help infrastructure projects implemented
by the communities or the productive loan projects: particularly price enquiries of
materials for community implemented projects, and agricultural inputs such as
breeding stocks, etc.

:




2.3.4.2 Financial Management in Community-Based Projects
Community finance is a component of the budget of the entire project county. The
community should be aware of the basic financial management requirements and
regulations, and be clear about project finance directly related to the community,
including the total sum of project money, the sums and limits on use of project
money for all the sub-projects, the time period money is available, and expenditure
procedures, etc. At the same time, the financial management of the community will
be supervised and audited by the county and township financial managerial
personnel, to ensure that the designated project money will be for this use only.




                                                                                   72
                         Methodological Approach to Using Participation






In addition to being informed of project budgets and expenditure, the community
should also participate in choosing and deciding on the projects that they
themselves will implement.



Projects implemented by the communities themselves refers to the project activities
approved for implementation by the communities after the PP of the community has
been integrated into the annual county plans, including the self-run projects of the
collective, and the productive projects with loans granted to individual households.
For loan projects, the community should participate in determining the households
to be given loans, and loan amounts. For community projects, participation of the
community includes selection of financial managerial staff, discussion on use of
funds and management method, and working out criteria of expenditures, etc.

The principles of participatory project implementation apply to different sectoral
projects and different stages of project implementation. However, the exact
operational steps for implementing different projects in different communities will
never be identical. Therefore, this manual does not provide a blueprint for project
implementation, but provides reference on the operational steps for principal
project types involved in the PRCDP, focusing on how to promote and embed
participation in each stage of the operation. However, for each project implemented
by a community, the steps will be different, the ways of working will be different,
and we would also encourage creative steps and methods. However, the methods
and steps adopted should not contradict these participatory implementation
principles.

2.3.4.3 Participation in Procurement 
Households should participate in different aspects of the procurement process,
particularly in those projects which are implemented by the communities
themselves.


While the county and township PMOs are making inquiries and inviting bids to
purchase large quantities of goods, there should be participation of representatives
from the community involved in the purchasing process. For the self-run projects of
the communities - mainly the self-operated construction projects - households'
participation includes decision-making on key issues such as selection of purchasers
and management of materials. The community representatives for procurement will
be responsible for selecting and deciding the quantities, varieties, quality and
purchasing locations and vendors. However, these need to be carried out with the
support of PMO staff and technicians.






    case 16: : Community Participation in Purchasing; 


2.3.4.4 Health and Education Projects 

Participation of the community in the health component is mainly in selection of
project focus groups and answering to needs of target groups. Facilities and
services established through the health component should be pro-poor and
responsive to the needs of different groups within the community (women,
children, and elderly people). They would also need to cater for the different health
situations and lifestyles in ethnic minority areas. The health component has taken a
participatory approach during the assessment phase which is a good start.
However, thinking about participatory implementation is still at an infant stage.
Participatory assessment of community health needs should be integrated into the
community planning process to provide a tangible basis for design of specific health
services.







                                                                                  74
                              Methodological Approach to Using Participation




The education component is somewhat similar to the health component. The
project implementing agency is the education bureau, the functional department,
while the participation of the community is mainly indicated in reflection of
community needs, and focusing on target groups. Design of education facilities is
based on evaluation of community needs, which should mainly be focused on poor
villages, primary schools and pre-school classes.

2.3.4.5 Technical training 

Taking a participatory approach to training in this project is not only households
passively accepting training and technical services, but also actively seeking
technologies, to guarantee that the technologies work in the project. It should also
include training to improve capacity of the community. The participation of the
community should include analysis of capacity and technical needs, choice of means
of training and technical extension, as well as empowerment and ability to work out
relevant measures, appropriate technologies to ensure project quality, etc. 14





Training in PRCD should be community based and supportive of group learning
processes. The idea of establishing "community learning centres" within the
education component is innovative, but probably needs time to be piloted and
scaled up. As a minimum requirement, selection of trainees should be transparent,
training activities field-based wherever possible and practical experimentation and
sharing of lessons should be part of the training process.



14
     Guidance on the training approach is included in the Annex of this Manual.

   ·   While providing training guidance, it is necessary to pay attention to the
       impact of training, and see if the farmers have really understood the
       technologies demonstrated, and know how to use them. In addition, such
       technologies should be directly beneficial to the corresponding project
       activities they are engaged in, not merely stressing the training process and
       activities.

       
       
       
   ·   Ensure the training content is tailored to local circumstances, not only local
       natural conditions, but also anticipated levels of acceptance of new
       technologies by local farmers, for example, their educational background,
       previous technical progressiveness, etc. In other words, the training should
       not only be suited to local conditions, but also to the people. In addition,
       training contents should be combined with local traditional practices, i.e.,
       project training should be integrated with experiences of local traditions, and
       based around farmers' existing experiences and practices, so that it will be
       easier for the farmers to accept.

       
       
       
       
       
Improvement of community members' skills is not only an objective of the project,
but also helps ensure other project objectives are achieved so that the project
becomes sustainable. Whilst providing households with training and technical
support, the technicians are not controlling by leading the contents and modes of
training, but starting from the households' needs and technical capacities, and
providing them with training and technologies which they need and which are easy
to accept. The training and technologies should be particularly focused towards
poor households and women: identify particular obstacles to their access to
technologies, and take special steps to ensure that the technologies reach the
project target groups, rather than ordinary households.

2.3.5 Participation in Projects Targeted to Individual Households
      
Projects Targeted to individual households provide less scope for community action
and communication. However, transparency and mutual learning are important
principles of responsible and community-oriented project implementation that
should be adhered to in those projects.
                                                      


2.3.5.1   Participation in Loan Management; 

The agricultural component accounts for half of the project's budget. The improved
household agriculture subcomponent provides only limited scope for community
participation at the implementation stage since households will decide themselves
on the crop or animal raising activities for which they will use project financial
support, and all of the loans are directly disbursed to individual households.
However there is substantial scope for community participation in:

          PPA
          


The agricultural component potentially covers 100% of households within each
project village. This means that the priorities and needs developed during PP could
be followed up by the loan components, ensuring that all poor and marginal groups
and households are covered adequately. At the same time, the project should give
sufficient flexibility to the community households, to ensure loans may have
diversified uses based on different circumstances.

Box 7: Selection of households crop, animal and micro-enterprise projects through community
information meetings: 7: 

In PRCDP design, households make individual choices about which productive activities they
will use project financial support for. Households however need to be well-informed about the
opportunities and risks related to each type of crop or animal raising activity. Community
meetings have proved useful in many projects to help households make informed choices.
Township facilitators are expected to organize these meetings and to bring relevant information
to households. The project will provide information in the form of technical and economic
information sheets.
PRCDP



In PRCDP design, some of the households have the option of applying for a larger amount of
financial support to develop services for other households in the community. Final decision-
making on what type of micro-enterprise to develop is left to the applicant household. However
community members have a role in helping identify which services would be most useful for the
development of the community. This would be usefully done during a community meeting. The
project implementation manual includes an initial list of potential good ideas of farmer-to-farmer
services.

Box 8: Community monitoring of enterprise contracts: 8: 

Agribusiness enterprises are increasingly active in the PRCDP project area. Communities have
an important role to play in facilitating the establishment of fair, transparent and sustainable
relationships between an enterprise and households. However this is very difficult to organize
and would require the creation of farmer associations or the designation of farmer
representatives. In practice, communities can have the following roles:
PRCDP


  Farmers, local government or an enterprise may propose the creation of a farmer association
  or the designation of farmer representatives, the community can have a supportive role and
  can monitor progress.

  They should also inform them about which enterprises have agreed to be PRCDP "project
  partners" and therefore to comply with the guidelines.

    o The loan management system should include monitoring of loans by the
       community. A process of information sharing needs to be set up which allows
       full participation of the village (project group) in the monitoring process and
       feedback of their suggestions and complaints to the township working
       station.

2.3.5.2 Role and Function of "Pilot" households ""
In PRCDP design, demonstrations and pilots aim to provide real opportunities for
participating households to learn from doing and observing.

PRCDP

When preparing demonstrations, organizers should pay attention to the following:



   ·   The purpose of demonstrations is not to inform less-advanced farmers about
       modern agriculture such as the use of modern agricultural inputs. The
       purpose of demonstrations is rather to help households adapt, with the help
       of their technician/facilitator, promising improved agricultural practice to the
       specific circumstances of their environment and their farming system.

   ·   
       
       

   ·   The topics of demonstration should therefore relate to sustainable mountain
       agriculture with low levels of external inputs. These are defined in the PRCDP
       guidelines for appropriate agricultural technology.




                                                                                    80

   ·   The selection of demonstration        households   and   groups   should   be
       participatory and transparent.

   ·   


Selection of demonstration households should be integrated into the
community planning process and, wherever possible, the principles of targeting
poor households and disadvantaged groups within the community should be
followed. The project needs to ensure that benefits and learning from
demonstration households are shared within the community (e.g. through small
technical groups who join the process of training and experimentation in selected
topics etc.).




/
   ·   The community representatives should discuss criteria for selection of
       demonstration households, how much support to give each household,
       responsibilities of the demonstration households, as well as how to share the
       technologies and experiences obtained from demonstration with other
       farmers, and the extent of sharing each demonstration household will be
       responsible for (how many households he/she should tutor);

       
       
       /
   ·   Then select households following these criteria;

       
   ·   Village and group cadres will enquire into the views of the preliminarily
       selected demonstration households, to ascertain whether the households
       volunteer to participate in the project. The households may also file project
       petitions when necessary.

       
       
   ·   While selecting the demonstration households, it is necessary to make sure
       that the selection process and method safeguards the independence of the
       electors (community reps). That is to say, the reps may independently

       express their opinion , which is basically consistent with the precaution for
       farmers to choose the projects.

       
       
       
The technicians should work together with the community, to ensure that the
services and training provided by the project work and to guarantee the quality of
project implementation. With ongoing support, the farmers will be able to monitor
quality issues during project implementation, and propose suggestions on
improvements. Such a learning-by-doing participatory training and technical service
process will not only guarantee project quality, but also ensure continuous
improvement of the communities' technical competence, and enhance their feeling
of ownership and confidence over the technical management of the project.

Exchange-visits in project villages; 
Exchange-visits are recognized to be an efficient means of learning in the rural sector. In
PCDP, exchange-visits can be organized to visit field demonstrations and/or overall
implementation of the agricultural component. When organizing exchange-visits, it is important
to pay attention to the following:
PRCDP
/

  Exchange-visits are useful for technicians, village cadre and households.        PRCDP can
  supports exchange-visits for households.
  PRCDP
  The purpose of exchange-visits is to visit other areas that are comparable to the area where
  the participants live. Exchange-visits for households should be to other project villages with
  comparable natural and human environments. Exchange-visits are not visits to model or
  better-off villages by less-advanced or poorer villages.
  


                                                                                             82

  In order to ensure that households actually acquire information from the exchange-visit, the
  organizers should take the time to organize two meetings with participating households, one
  before the exchange-visit, to explain the purpose of the visit, and one afterwards, to debrief
  about exchange-visit findings. The timing of exchange-visits should be carefully planned.
  Visits during the agricultural season are preferable so that visitors can actually see the crops

2.4.1 What is "M&E" "M&E"
Monitoring is an ongoing process of data collection that allows project managers
and the communities to examine positive and negative trends and readjust their
strategies accordingly. Monitoring focuses on observing the process of project
implementation, the related activities and outputs.

Evaluation refers to measuring the project outcomes or impacts of the project. A
project evaluation is done by the project management or funding agency to assess
whether the project has met its objectives.

 (Participatory)      Planning "Where do we want to go?"
  (PP)     answers         the
  questions:                     ""

                                 "How will we get there?"

                                 ""



 (Participatory)          M&E "How do we know if we are getting there?"
  (PM&E)     answers       the (monitoring)
  questions:
                                  ""

                                 ""



A basic premise of PM&E is the acknowledgement that different socio-economic
groups will have differing measurements of success and will be affected by a
project differently. To allow a more pro-poor focus in project planning, it is essential
to seek the views of the various groups within a community. It is therefore
essential that through community workshops the scope and design of the PM&E
system encompasses the full range of groups in the villages. This links closely to
the PPA and PP stages of the participatory project cycle: PPA will identify the
different social groups, PP will elucidate their needs and aspirations, and actively
seek out their different needs and objectives at the planning stage; PM&E will check
whether these objectives have been met.

2.4.2 Why communities                 should       be       involved       in     M&E
      M&E
        
The main purpose of giving project communities an active role in M&E is to enhance
the project's communication and learning for improved performance and long-term


                                                                                     87

sustainability. Within this general purpose, we need to distinguish between two
aspects of participation in M&E within PRCDP:

M&E
PRCDP"M&E"


       To support self-reflection by communities;

       

       To collect feedback from communities as part of the project M&E.

       "M&E"


Supporting self-reflection by project communities


Self-reflection will help to build the community's capacity to track the progress of
its own development. Data are collected about the progress of activities so that the
community can make its own decisions about




   o   What is working well;

       

   o   What is not working well; and

       

   o   How to proceed next.

       

Self-reflection means that villagers make their own assessments (without external
facilitation) against indicators they set themselves. The monitoring tools will be
designed with support from facilitators. Common tools include report cards, which
will produce a quantitative score on progress, various PRA tools used without
external facilitation (such as pie charts and proportional piling), and community
photography (using cheap/disposable cameras from villagers to record good and/or
poor progress).

Integrating feedback from communities into the PRCDP M&E system

PRCDPM&E
It is important that project beneficiaries are able to participate in the monitoring of
project progress and in the evaluation in order to understand whether the project
has actually met their needs and had positive impacts on the livelihood and poverty
indicators that they consider important.



Operational procedures will be different for different projects in different
communities and for a particular project's M&E. Therefore, this manual does not
intend to provide a fixed set of operation procedures for community-level M&E, but
to offer a guide on how to promote and embed participation into every step.
Although during the course of PM&E of each community, the steps and methods
may be different, the methods and steps adopted should not violate the
participation principles above.









2.4.3 Participatory and Conventional M&E 
Participatory M&E and conventional M&E have different focal and methodological
approaches. Within the PRCDP M&E system they should be combined for a better
understanding of different stakeholder groups' perspectives and views on this
project.

PM&E is especially useful for understanding the project benefits which will be seen in a different
way by different stakeholders. Indicators that have been developed by one stakeholder group
might not reflect the perceptions of others; also monitoring less tangible aspects of change, like
capacity building, will benefit from integrated monitoring at different levels and use of various
indicators, methods and data.

2.4.4 Principles of PM&E             ; PM&E
Participatory M&E is a process to improve the capacities of the households in the
community, and to strengthen the social capital within the community. The main
aspects and principles of PM&E are:


PM&E


Box 11: Principles of PM&E; 7: PM&E

Participation       Local people are active participants-not just sources of information.
                    They choose the indicators and analyse the data.

                   
                    ­ 

Discussion &        Project communities and PMOs should discuss, negotiate and agree
negotiation         what will be monitored and evaluated, how and when data will be
                    collected and analysed, what data mean and how findings will be
                    shared and action taken.

                   
                   
                   

Learning &          Participation and discussion should lead to collective learning. The
capacity            focus should be on building stakeholder capacity for analysis and
building            problem-solving.

                   
                   

Flexibility         Since the purpose of PM&E is improved learning for improved
                    results, leading to ongoing change, adaptation and better
                    implementation, flexibility is essential. Blueprint approaches to
                    evaluation, in which standard indicators that preset schedule are
                    imposed and held constant to measure change over time, will
                    basically do little to encourage achieving flexible results.

2.4.5 Main Contents of PM&E; PM&E
Regular feedback from communities on their projects will be important for the
PRCDP project management to keep track of the implementation process. The
PRCDP should establish linkages between community-based monitoring and the
computer-based monitoring system, especially on the following areas:

    PM&E            

Stakeholder workshops should be held during the design phase of the PM&E in each
location, to agree aims, indicators and roles and responsibilities. They will involve
villagers (representatives from different social groups), village leaders, and
township and county PMO and bureau staff as appropriate. This will be facilitated by
the PMOs. Further stakeholder workshops should be held periodically for joint
discussion of PM&E findings and of any actions needed as a result. Stakeholder
workshops should follow existing participatory principles ­ facilitators should
facilitate, not lead, providing maximum opportunities for villagers to be involved
and to express their views.

Box 12: Participants and Roles in PM&E; 8: PM&E
Villagers: Participate in monitoring project implementation process and project management,
make proposals and opinions about improving project schedule, and evaluate project effects,
equity of the project, and degree of care about the poverty households.


Staff of Implementation Management Group: Organize villager's meetings, promptly inform
the villagers and facilitator project progress and problems, publish such information as farmers'
input of labor, raise of funds, and use of money, and monitor construction quality.


Technicians: Mainly monitor the project from technical aspect, provide opinions and
suggestions, and accept the project.

Facilitator: Directly participate in monitoring, assist farmers in logging their monitoring results,
erecting platforms for different groups to share their opinions, organize sharing monitoring
results, jointly analyze and evaluate project progress, and jointly adjust project implementation
plan. Take note of the monitoring process, write monitoring reports, organize the evaluation and
acceptance process, and summarize experiences in evaluation and acceptance.





·   Selection of indicators and collection of monitoring information:
    Together with project communities, the townships can identify the areas which
    are critical for a successful project implementation and therefore need to be
    carefully monitored.

    
    
    


Monitoring of M&E indicators can be significantly improved if the community
participates actively in this process.

Feedback from communities on the implementation can provide very important
information on possible bottlenecks and problems which might require an
adjustment of the project design and schedule.

Regular sharing and exchange of information on the implementation process should
provide the base for improved planning and action in PRCDP. Facilitators and
technical staff directly involved in the project implementation will have an
important role in documenting the process and feeding back information to the
proejct management.

In-village monitoring of household financial support:

Many poverty reduction projects have put in place effective measures to ensure transparency in
the allocation and in-village monitoring of the financial support that households receive from the
project. These measures include:


    keeping a copy at the village committee office of financial support allocated.
    
    posting name lists of financial support allocated.
    
A computerized system will be put in place at township level to monitor household financial
support. Villages should regularly receive print-outs from the computerized system. They should
pay attention to the following:


    Monitoring requires two types of print-outs from the computerized system: annual allocations
    with amount per household, and record of allocations to individual households since the
    beginning of the project.
    
    
    For easier monitoring, the computer print-outs should be sorted by natural villages and by
    poor/non poor households.

Joint assessments involve project facilitators (from township and county) working in
collaboration with villagers to undertake M&E. There are two main types of tool used in joint
assessments:
M&E

 PRA-type tools: This includes the normal range of PRA tools. There is strong emphasis
       on using visual tools, such as diagramming, mapping, ranking, trend analysis, etc.
       PRA:
       PRA
       
       Beneficiary assessments: These assessments draw on two standard techniques:
       participant observation and focus-group discussion. Experienced facilitators can obtain
       villagers' views on different indicators, often using checklists to guide their interviewing.
       These tools produce qualitative data.
       :
       
       
       


Project evaluation needs to put special emphasis on assessing how different groups
are participating in the process.

2.4.6 How to Do PM&E with Communities: Practical Steps and Tools
            
Implementing community-level PM&E is not only an internal community activity,
but it also needs the active support from the facilitators. Therefore, before starting
the activities, preparation is needed in two areas:



   o Training of a cadre of facilitators
       
   o Community level workshops to agree the scope, design and responsibilities
       for the PM&E system



                                                                                                 97
                        Methodological Approach to Using Participation


      
Establishing a PM&E system can be seen as a sort of mini-project in its own right:
There needs to be planning of the system, implementation (use) of the system, and
review of the findings, leading to corrective actions: These are the recommended
main steps, a detailed guideline is included in the Annex.


 

    Practical Guideline 3: How to develop a system for community self-
      monitoring 3:


Step 1: Establish a work structure for PM&E

1PM&E

As a first step, the community needs to decide who should do what in PM&E and
determine responsibilities and staff.

PM&E

There are no full-time people available in the community to conduct M&E, and they
will mainly depend on the management staff of implementation group elected by
farmers to conduct monitoring. In addition to this group, all the farmers will
participate in monitoring,     reflecting their opinions and suggestions to the
implementation group via members of the implementation groups . Specific
responsibilities of the implementation group in monitoring include:



1. To regularly post circulars about contribution of labors, revenues and
   expenditures of the project money;
   
2. Under the assistance of the technicians and facilitators, to monitor the
   quality and progress of the project;
   
3. To call for villagers' meetings to discuss about problems and solutions
   during the course of project implementation.

  

As an important precondition, a decision needs to be made on how the target social
groups will be represented in meetings.Will they select their own representatives
for the purpose of PM&E, opt to use existing village or group leaders, or choose
some other method of representation?

                                                                                ­



                                                                               98

Step 2: Identify areas and issues which should be monitored

2

In the beginning, the community needs to develop a clear understanding on which
areas or issues they feel are important and which need to be monitored during
implementation and what kind of changes they expect to happen under this project.
For this, the community needs to refer to the initial PP documents.

                                                
                                                                                
PP

Communities can only be confident that their monitoring will give a true picture of
the progress they have made if they are able to compare the information that was
gathered in the initial PP workshop with the information that is gathered through
PM&E. Therefore, the facilitator should encourage the PM&E committee to keep
copies of all of the material (e.g. maps, diagrams, interview notes) that was
created during the initial PP workshop from the very beginning.

Step 3: Facilitate the development of indicators by the communities

3

The concept of "indicators" as such is abstract and not easily understood by
farmers. Therefore, the facilitators will need to be very sensitive in facilitating the
process of condensing the complex perceptions, values and views given by the
farmers into indicators which could be used to describe the project progress and
changes occurring through this project. The facilitators also need to pay attention
to indigenous means of expression, such as songs, to identify the areas and
dimensions of change that communities find important.

and outputs is comparatively straightforward and therefore easier.

Step 4: Plan ­ who, what, and how of PM&E

     4 - 
Communities should prepare their own PM&E plan, specifying the indicators they
want to monitor, the methods to collect this information as well as responsiblities
and deadlines. PM&E is a continuous process, and not a one-time event. During the
PM&E planning workshop, the facilitator and the community work together to come
up with a list of indicators which can be monitored on a regular basis by the
community members. The PM&E committee is responsible for ensuring that this
monitoring takes place.

The same participatory techniques used during the PPA/PP can be used for PM&E.
There is no set formula for which tools to use for PM&E. Each community project
will be different and will require different data to be collected. Below are examples
of how to use the tools:

them oral traditions or songs are powerful means for recording and reflecting important events.

2.4.7 Indicators for Assessing the Quality of PM&E; PM&E
The steps in designing and operating a PM&E system will basically be the same in
each project location. However, the combination of methods (e.g. how much
facilitated PRA compared to self-assessment) and selection of tools within each
method will differ from place to place. This is because there are different social
groups in each location, and different levels of objectives and therefore the
associated indicators will differ from place to place. Nonetheless, there are a certain
set of standards if the PM&E is to be done well and to be useful to all stakeholders.


PRA



PM&E aims at strengthening the community capacities for learning and action; it
also functions as a forum for sharing views and lessons within the community. For
assessing whether a PM&E system is working well and serving to these purposes,
the following indicators are recommended for use by the project management.

Gaowen village contains seven natural villages with 798 households. To identify the poorest natural
villages in Gaowen village, the villagers' representatives from those seven natural villages discussed
and decided the criteria for poverty grouping at natural village level, including ownership of shops,
motorbikes, cell phones, colour TVs, and houses. These became the basis for the villagers' reps to
prioritize the natural villages according to their situation of poverty:

case 2: Poverty Grouping Process,  Changning County, Yunnan Province
                                  ,


Ordering of households by poverty group is arrived at based on local people's perceptions and
judgements, using comprehensive indicators of production and living standards such as levels of
income, and sources of income. First, organize the villagers' reps, using different means of
communication suitable for the local people (such as popular customs, etc.), and integrate the
planning team with the villagers as a whole. Then give the villagers the cards and pens prepared
beforehand, and let the villagers write the names of all the householders in the entire village on the
card. The facilitators then, based on the conditions of the local households (capacity to output
priority results), write on a large sheet of paper words such as better-off HH, normal HH, poor HH,
and difficult HH, etc., making it easy for the farmers to understand, which will help maintain their
dignity and confidence. Then, let the villagers' reps divide the cards into several groups, and keep
dividing up and sorting, until they have finished. The order of the divided cards will be the sequence
of poverty of poor households in the villagers' groups under planning. Then record the sequence of
households which will form the basis for sampling in the next step.

case 3: Poverty grouping at household level in Dongling village, Banlan Township, Rongan
county, Guangxi province;  
                          2


First, we organized a village meeting and all villagers were invited, including a certain percentage of
women and old people and children. After explaining the content and purpose of PRCDP and
methodology of poverty grouping, we started the poverty grouping following these steps:



PRCDP

   Listing the households: inviting two local villagers to write down the list of households in the
   villages;

   2
   
   Preparing poverty household grouping table: each household was classified on the basis of three
   poverty groups: poorest, poor and normal to indicate relative poverty conditions;

   
   
   Poverty household grouping: all villagers l determined the poverty situation of all households one
   by one using corn seeds or beans as the visual medium;

   
   
   Calculation: The total number of corn seeds/beans of each household was its final score, and the
   households with the most corn seeds/beans were categorised as `better off', and so on for all
   the household types. Thus we got the poverty status of all the villagers in the sub-village
   generally accepted by all the villagers, and the households grouped by level of poverty.

case 4: Seasonal poverty and trend analysis in Jindai village, Tongle Township, Sanjiang
County, Guangxi province: 



First a community meeting was convened including village cadres, old people's associations, male and
female representatives of poor households (disadvantages groups). Attending were 8 people from
old people's associations (one person from each natural village), 17 womens' reps (a village women's
federation director, and two women from each natural village), and 41 male reps (5 village cadres, 1
leader of each group and 2 people from each natural village). Given the length of time needed to
analyze the topic, children were not specifically invited. However, when the meeting started, as
many as 81 children and local people attended voluntarily Project facilitators then encouraged the
villagers' reps to identify the factors affecting poverty over the different seasons and years and
to discuss these. The factors they proposed from their analysis were: poor crop yields, limited
income/cash generation, diseases, education, healthcare, high prices, borrowing, agricultural
expenses, transportation expenses, electricity bills, marriages, weddings and funerals, natural
disasters, and so on. Then, all participants were divided into two groups: men and women After
discussion in their separate groups, the men's and women's groups scored the specific poverty
indicators using local rice grains to represent "votes'', keeping in mind different years and different
seasons. The scores indicate degree of poverty.. From this, annual and seasonal changes in specific
poverty indicators and thus in the overall patterns of community poverty were identified and
represented on a diagram.
Our experience: Need to be careful of understanding features of (annual and seasonal) poverty of
different levels and genders/groups)

case 5: Vulnerability analysis in Jindai village, Tongle Township, Sanjiang County, Guangxi
Province; 


First, county and township facilitators visited all natural villages to observe local habitats,
ownership of resources (including economic forestlands, water resources, etc.), and understand the
local customs and practices. We organized local villagers and facilitated in-depth discussions on
"what do they understand about poverty, what do they think about the government's criteria of
poverty, and what factors are making poverty worse''. In this way, everybody gained a fairly
comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability of the community. and villagers were facilitated
to map these factors, thereby deepening this understanding. We normally conducted the entire
process in the form of making oil tea in a certain poverty household, since it is the most popular
form of gathering for the local people, which is highly participatory.









Our experience: Try to arrange the meeting in a traditional way which local villagers would
appreciate; use local language so that villagers can participate in the process easily, and express
their true feelings, which is very helpful for group activities such as poverty vulnerability analysis.




Suggestion: Since most women in Jingdai Village do not speak Mandarin, and cannot read or write,
and it is inappropriate to discuss sensitive issues like physical problems of women in an official
meeting of men and women mixed, it would be better to have some female facilitators at county and
township levels.

case 6: The selection of villagers' representatives for community meeting in Jindai village,
Tongle        Township,           Sanjiang         County,        Guangxi         province;




On 18 January 2004, the county and township project facilitators organized a villagers'
representatives' meeting in Jindai village, Tongle Township. To ensure selection of villagers'
representatives truly representative of different social groups, we adopted the following method:

2004118

       First, chose representatives from an old people's association, since this is a local civic
       organization, and its members have certain social experiences, and know the local history
       very well, they are fairly authoritative in the local community. The representative should be
       recommended by the Old People's Association.

       
       
       
       Secondly, confirm the leaders of the villagers' groups as delegates for the meetings, since
       they have been directly elected by the villagers, and are highly representative of the local
       people.

       
       
       Thirdly, select 2 men and 2 women separately from the poor households and poorest
       households as determined by participatory poverty grouping, and 1 man and 1 woman from
       the other disadvantaged groups (those living furthest away). These people will be chosen by
       random sampling from the corresponding groups.

       2
       1
       
Such a meeting basically represented the perspectives and priorities on poverty of community
members of different genders, ages, social and educational backgrounds.



Our experience: County and township facilitators should clarify the number of representatives for
all the natural villages, including the groups, gender requirement (percentages), educational level,
particularly ensuring a certain number of representatives for the poor households and poorest
households.





                                                                                                115
                                                                          Case studies



Suggestion: Since Jingdai Village has 8 natural villages, and each one is fairly far away from the
village centre (most are 4 km away), attending villagers' representative meetings will adversely
affect their productive and domestic activities. It is suggested to provide them with proper
subsidies while conducting project activities.

case 7: Community Meeting Practices of Jindai village, Tongle Township, Sanjiang County,
Guangxi province; 



In 2004, the county and township facilitators held two community meetings at Jingdai Village,
Tongle Township, which were both very fruitful. The major procedures are:

2004

       First, the community meetings were well prepared in advance: A. Facilitators informed
       villagers or representatives specifically about the meeting including the objectives/agenda,
       date and time by means of radio, publicity materials and door-to-door notice, to improve
       attendance. B. Be prepared about the arrangements for the meeting such as the procedures,
       specific content, specific roles of the participants, and the expected outputs and results,
       etc.

       
       
       
       
       Secondly, the community meeting should try to follow the plan and agenda. In Jindai, the
       chairman first explained the purpose and meaning of the meeting, then the township
       facilitators introduced content of the meaning, and the village facilitator provided a
       supplement explanation (if necessary). For example, the township facilitator introduce the
       poverty criteria the community came up with, and the village facilitator post the maps of
       poverty criteria on the wall, and give further explanation in dialect languages.

       
       
       
       
       Thirdly, meeting delegates are asked to express their opinions freely, and explain reasons
       for any disagreements. The opinions generally accepted will be adopted at the meeting, while
       disputed points will be discussed under facilitation, and decided whether to be accepted or
       not. If the opinion is not accepted, the reasons should be explained to the person who
       proposed them, and they should be asked to consider the issue from the perspective of the
       majority, so to avoid greater conflicts.

       
       
       
       



                                                                                               117
                                                                             Case studies

       Fourthly, all outputs agreed by the community meeting must be published (recorded and
       posted up on large pieces of paper).

       
       Finally, the facilitator should express gratitude to the people for their participation. Such
       community meetings, where both the process and the results are transparent, and in which
       local people have the right to know and to decide on what happens, will lay a good foundation
       for their active participation in subsequent activities.

       
       
       
Our experience: To hold community meetings, it is necessary to be well prepared beforehand, and
finalize the procedures and topics of the meeting. During the meeting, we should be attentive to
opinions of the people, and give them more chance to speak. The whole process should be fair and
just, and try not to hurt their dignity, and not to be biased towards certain opinions (or certain
people's opinions). Let the people explain their (different) comments, so that it is easier to reach a
consensus.





Suggestion: Since it is customarily considered to be bad for women to "seek the limelight" (express
opinions in public), the women attending community meetings often could only listen but not
expressing any opinions. It would be better to organize a meeting for women separately, so they can
express their opinions easily, and to promote their participation. In addition, it would be best to
record the meeting process by camera or video recorder.

case 8: The impact of PP on the local community: A song from Zhiwen Village, Guangxi;
PP
 


Zhiwen village is a key poor village in Gunba Dong People's Autonomous Township, Rongshui County,
Guangxi province, where the villagers' confidence in PRCDP's objective of poverty alleviation has
increased by participating in the PP process. The villagers sang a Dong ethnic folk song to express
their views on PP:

PP


       Everyone works together on the WB project, and keep walking on the road to shake off
       poverty.
       Spring comes and fruit trees are bearing new fruits.
       The news is spread amongst the Dong people's mountain villages, and everybody was
       overjoyed.
       The government sent working teams, and they toured all villages in all weathers, organized
       villagers for meetings, talking with people and asked about their poverty and sorrows,
       inspired the people to meditate on why our lives are tough.
       The causes of poverty are like a tree, with countless branches and leaves.
       All villagers, old and young, participated, and the causes gradually come out.
       All difficulties are ordered, and several of them are big headaches:
       Firstly, poor access to transportation, making it hard to walk on the road to be better off;
       Secondly, inducing drinking and irrigating water by bamboo pipes are weary.
       Thirdly, we cannot afford to send children to schools, and worry about ramshackle school
       houses. Fourthly, no capital for plantation or breeding, and ideas of doing business are all in
       vein.
       Fifthly, no technology for development and mindsets need to be broken.
       Sixthly, diseases can hardly be addressed, being short of both doctors and medicines.
       These few major problems are thoroughly analyzed, and prioritized.
       Today, WB comes to address our poverty, just like a good rain after a chronic drought.
       We appreciate hardworking of the experts and officials.
       It is a hard-earned good opportunity, and we all need to be concerted.
       Everyone works together on the WB project, and keep walking on the road to shake off
       poverty.

case 9: Gender Sensitivity in Ranking; 



Gaowen village includes the poor Miao minority community in Hongshui Township, Rongshui
County. The feudal ideology of "valuing men and belittling women" is still very strong there, and
women are mostly subordinate and customarily not have equal rights to participate in social
affairs or decision making within the family. To enhance the social status of women, particularly
their decision making power for poverty alleviation, they were identified as one of the key
target groups of PRCDP, and 35 women participants (the same number as men participants)
were grouped together to rank their own concerns on poverty and poverty alleviation
separately. During the village meeting different coloured seeds were used to determine the
priorities of the local community, (yellow corn seed for women and white corn seed for men) so
that women could address their own demands in project activities. The following table
illustrates the result and shows the differences between women and men on the specific
poverty alleviation activities:

""

It indicates that women prefer social infrastructure construction, health and education
activities, while men prefer infrastructure and integrated agricultural development.

The village PP project process involves villagers carrying out a full analysis of their poverty
situation and its causes; combining these with local conditions such as natural and human resources
resources; developing corresponding poverty alleviation strategies and specific activities, including
the order of priority for these strategies, and targeting these strategies and particular activities
towards disadvantaged groups, . Throughout the entire process, the community, especially the
destitute and poor households, are key decision-makers in verifying poverty and poverty alleviation
projects, for example deciding on project requirements by open ballot. Thus, all the project
activities in village-level PP not only correspond to specific causes of poverty, but are also directly
oriented at specific poverty target groups, instead of being a general poverty alleviation project.

The County project of PRCDP is first based on the 2001-2010 county development plans of all the
counties, focusing on the development objectives of the entire county, including those of the
government. In terms of target groups, more attention was given to general poverty, rather than
specific poverty targets such as disadvantaged groups. In general, the focus of county-level plans is
more vague. Given available staffin and skills levels, it is impossible to implement PP across the
entire county. To ensure the county projects are as practicable as possible, using the project list
obtained by PP, we consulted the relevant technical department of the county government about
their technical feasibility and finalized which activities from PP reports could be included in the
county PRCDP plan. The county PMO organized the county planning department drawing up the plan,
obtained approval of the county governments for village development activities arising from PP, and
made it a project plan generally accepted by the community and government department. At the
same time, we took some community needs from PP, particularly those generated by PPA, to verify
and improve county plans and to balance some obviously unreasonable project contents in the county
plans; making village-level PPs "samples" or pilots for county plans, so that county plans will be more
suited to actual needs. Finally, the county PMOs publicised the PRCDP county plans to the ordinary
people in the communities by convening villagers' meetings and posting bulletins, seeking feedback
from the communities, and coordinating and interpreting any conflicting views, so that the
communities and the county departments could reach agreement and officially finalize the county
plan reports of PRCDP.

case 11: Determining priorities on poverty and its solutions, Pinchang County, Sichuan
Province; 



On 25 November 2003, PMO staff went to Baishan village, Longgang Township and organized a
community meeting for determining community priorities on poverty and solutions. More than 315
villagers representing 382 householders in the community participated in the meeting and ranked
their poverty priorities by open scoring as follows:

20031125
382

1: lack of finance, scored 315 (140 from female and 175 from male);

140175315
2: poor communication, scored 276;

276
3: poor supply of drinking water, scored 271;

271
4: poor soil for agriculture, scored 204;

204
5: lack of breeding technology, scored 178;

6: poor irrigation facilities, scored 174;

174
7: lack of health care services, scored 150;

150
8: shortage of labour, scored 132.

132
In this way Poor Communication, Poor Supply of Drinking Water, Poor Soil for Farming, Poor
Irrigation Services, Adjusting Industrial Structure, Health and Education, and so on have been
determined as the principal problems of poverty to be addressed by the project based on the
priorities of the local community.

Experience: The basis of scoring on priorities, during this exercise was: firstly, a record of
speeches from the community meeting, and analysis of household investigation data; secondly,
analysis of secondary data; thirdly, analysis of community problems and table of prioritized needs
of the households. The key to facilitating the participants in the community lies in finding out the
major problems of the community based on views of the villagers.

case   12:    Needs     of   Poor    Households     and    Coordination    of    Common    Interests;



Background: One pilot project spot of PRCDP is Yandong Sub-village, Xiatang Village, Huanjiang
County, Guangxi. During participatory needs assessment, the households proposed three projects:
firstly, construct water-supply project; secondly, build conservation walls to preserve soil; thirdly,
training women on healthcare knowledge. However, since drinking water was the first priority for
the households, and needed a large sum of money, there was only a limited sum of money available
for building soil-conservation walls. But building these structures can not only prevent soil erosion,
conserve soil and improve fertility, thereby increasing grain yield; it also plays a role of protecting
ecological environment in karst areas. For these reasons, PRCDP also plan to finance the project. On
project beneficiaries, the township and county facilitators proposed that: according to project
requirements and principles, it is necessary to give priority to meeting the needs of poor
households. Since the water-supply project would benefit the entire sub-village, hopefully a focus
on poor households and prioritizing their needs could be captured in the soil-retaining wall project.
It was proposed that the soil-retaining wall project should only be targeted at poor households,
with a subsidy of 200 RMB/mu. Other households would not participate in this project.

Discussion Process: As soon as this plan was proposed, it was opposed by many households. Their
reasons included: first, even though the sub-village had identified some destitute households, the
entire sub-village was fairly poor. Although the destitute households were the worst off, the other
households were also poor households, and they should also be involved in the project. Secondly, it
would not help ecological protection much just to build soil-retaining walls for a few households. The
farmland of a number of households were located on steep slopes, which needed soil-retaining walls
more. After discussing with the farmers and township facilitators, the soil-retaining wall plan was
changed to give access to all households, but the area for each household should not exceed 2 mu,
to ensure the budget would not be exceeded. In addition, the subsidy for soil-conservation
structures was to be changed to an average of 200 RMB/mu. However, to give preference and
priority to destitute households, they would be subsidied by 300 RMB/mu, while the normal
households would be subsidized by 100 RMB/mu, basically averaging almost 200 MB/mu. This plan
not only benefited destitute households, but was acceptable to all the households in the entire
village.

Experience: Given the widespread nature of poverty, focussing on the poorest households should
not be taken as a rigid principle in selecting projects and allocating resources,, but applied flexibly,
with consideration for the feelings and thoughts of the rest of the community. If a project were to
be implemented only amongst the poorest households, it would very likely not be supported or
helped by the other households. Therefore, a better way would be to let everybody participate in
the project, but give proper priority and preference to poor households and destitute households in
terms of subsidy, labour contribution and exemption, so that the project is more easily accepted by
all households in the village, and easier to implement.

While conducting participatory poverty assessment (PPA) in Kangba Village, three conflicts
occurred:.Firstly, classifying poverty: some delegates believed that as long as it was all poverty,
there was no need to classify them into different categories. Secondly, during the course of
sampling investigation, some delegates believed the poorer the households were, the harder it was
to get information from them. Thirdly, while talking about causes of poverty, they only viewed the
issue from the perspective of the natural environment. While implementing village-level PP, four
further conflicts emerged: Firstly, there were as many as more than 20 proposed projects, and it
was impossible for the limited project funds to satisfy all of them. Secondly, there were
disagreements between different communities while designing the village road to be constructed.
Thirdly, while composing the project structure, the technician opposed projects such as fish
farming. Fourthly, while finalizing project benefits to households, there were some questions about
different financial allocations to similar types of poor households.

PPA

Solution: Firstly, well publicize and explain to the community that identifying and classifying
poverty and involving disadvantaged groups, was not only for the purpose of poverty alleviation, but
also a basic requirement of PRCDP. Perhaps even more accurate information about poverty causes
can be obtained through the words of the poorest households themselves. For too many proposed
projects, firstly, there was not enough money; secondly, some of them were not representative
enough. Projects such as raising fish were not only short of resources, but also lack appropriate
technical inputs and market opportunities. Looking at the differences in allocations for poor
households, the key was the project conditions and development capacity of the households.
Secondly, guide the farmers carefully to see issues from different viewpoints, and analyze poverty
causes from different perspectives. Thirdly, effectively coordinate construction of village roads in
both technical and financial fields and their impact. In addition, arrange some household loans to
satisfy the differential needs of individual households. Handling the process in this way, all sorts
of conflicts were successfully resolved.

The irrigation ditch of Heba Village is a project supported by Poverty-alleviation funds, which was
built in 2002, about 2 km long, inducing water from the river all year round, which can irrigate 380
mu of farmland for 67 households in Co-ops 3 and 4. All the households in the irrigating areas can
benefit, and they are public resources/properties. The ditch is collectively managed by the village;
and the Co-ops 3 and 4, the beneficiaries, manage the ditch by sections, and the head of the coops
are the responsible persons. For water supply management, since the water volume is fairly large
and continuous all year round, all the farmlands of the beneficiary households can be irrigated. If
there are exceptional circumstances, such as water shortages due to drought, water is rationed to
the different coops during the spring planting season, so that there had never been a conflict in
water supply, and the farmers were very satisfied. For maintenance management, since the
households were not charged for using water at normal times, there are no fixed maintenance
expenses for the ditch. The beneficiary households discussed these issues extensively and decided
that when it needs to be maintained, the coop heads will draw up a budget for the maintenance, and
amortize the expenses evenly to all the households according to actual area irrigated. If there are
surplus funds, these will be left for the next maintenance. If there is a deficit, money will be raised
following the same method. The entire management of the project followed participatory concepts.

case 15: How the Community Participate in Financial Management; 




1. Project Background: As a WB pilot project location, Baidan Village, Huanjiang County was jointly
provided with100,000 RMB of donation from DFID and Huanjiang County. The project, known as
EATS project, was implemented on the basis of PP, and the use and management of project funds
were discussed and decided by the villagers.

PPEATS


2. Participation Method: To determine how the people will participate in the use and management
of project money, the facilitators organized a community congress in which the management of
money was jointly discussed.

2


3. Participants: villagers volunteered to participate, including women, old people and destitute
Households.

3

4. Specific Process: The facilitators provided some questions, such as: who is to manage the
project money, how, where to put the money, whether it is convenient to use, how to improve the
procedures on use of the money; and then let people discuss by themselves.

4


Result: The farmers discussed and elected project money managers, decided on scope and criteria
for expenditures, etc. However, there were two different opinions on the use procedure:



Opinion A: Keep the money under the custody of County WB Office, and follow the application
procedures when money is needed;

A

Opinion B: The project management group will contact the County WB Office, and borrow the
money out in the name of the sub-village, and deposit it in Credit Cooperatives of Chuanshan Town.
The reasoning here was that people do not necessarily need to go to the county capital to buy all
the materials for the project, and it wastes money and time to go to Huanjiang to collect the money
and reimbursements. It was considered more convenient to deposit the money at Chuanshan Town
and, when money is needed, 2 group members may go to withdraw it together. At the end they would
go to the County WB Office for settlement.

                                                                                               132
                                                                             Case studies



2

Through vote by a show of hands, the villagers unanimously agreed on Opinion B. After discussion,
the villagers recognized that the project money could be all managed and handled by the
management group elected by the sub-villages.

B


5. Questions raised by Facilitators: The facilitators proposed that if all the money is managed by
the communities, it would be impossible for the county and town to supervise. Once there is a
problem, it will prevent smooth implementation of the project: the project funds are not loans to
individuals. Secondly, a large portion of the project money is used for purchasing materials. The
place of purchase is either at the county capital or Hechi City and therefore whether it is
necessary for the villagers to bring the money to the town, then withdraw it and bring it to the
county capital for purchasing materials.

5



6. Facilitators discussed with the community and reached a common understanding:

6

   The use of money will be decided by the communities, but communities will accept supervision by
   the project Office, and jointly sign contracts.

   

   The materials to be purchased at the county seat or Hechi City will be jointly purchased by the
   community reps, PO staff and technician, and after being signed by the villagers' reps, the money
   will directly paid by the PO, and invoices will be booked into the account at the PO. The villagers
   will get duplicate copies of invoices, so they know what has been spent.

   
   

   Petty cash can be borrowed by community managers from the PO, and eventually reimbursed at
   the PO with invoices.

   

   Expenses prepaid by the PO and community managers will be explained to the community
   regularly by the community managers.

  While considering where to put the money and how to use it, the first concern of the villagers
  was how to guarantee their control over the use of money. However, once their right of control
  is secured (such as expenses of procurement must be approved and signed by them), they could
  consider the safety, convenience and effectiveness of using the money.

1. Background

   
In the EATS Project in Huanjiang, Guangxi, a pilot study on participation of villagers in procurement
was carried out, as required by PRCDP project. After consulting Huangjiang County PMO, it was
decided to put into practice participation of villagers in procurement during the implementation of a
drinking water project at Yandong Sub-village, Xiatang Village. Before starting procurement, as
promoted by ITAD expert, the PMO, water conservancy department and the community discussed
and reached agreement on procurement as follows:

EATSPRCDP

ITAD

(1) The procurement process will be jointly carried out by the community reps, technicians and
facilitators from PMO. The materials procured must be signed for approval by the community reps,
and the material quality must be verified by the technician, while the PMO will be responsible for
organizing the procurement process, pay procurement money, summarize and document the
procurement experiences.




(2) The expenses incurred during the course of procurement will be borne by all the parties
themselves. The expenses of the community reps will be raised by the community, and the criteria
for expenses will be discussed and decided by the community themselves.



In the Yandong Project, the technician from the Water conservancy Department proposed the
project design and budget, and submitted a list of materials needed, including specifications,
quantities and basic quality requirements, etc. In addition, a quotation list may also be submitted as

2. Procurement Process

   
Community reps of Yandong left the sub-village in the morning of August 25, and arrived at the
county capital at noon. In the afternoon, led by Mr. Wei, the engineer, they did a market survey to
several markets of tap-water and heating facilities in Huanjiang, mainly investigating prices and
qualities of water pipes. The Facilitator of transportation consulted the community representatives,
and agreed to drive the car of Huanjiang County Planning Bureau to Hechi, the round trip of which
was about 120 km, for which the community bore 60 RMB for gas and toll costs, while the other
expenses were borne by themselves separately.

After arriving at Hechi City, Mr. Wei, the engineer, took them to a street near the railway station,
where materials like water pipes were sold, and started inquiring into prices. In about 3 hours, they
visited five or six shops, surveyed qualities and inquired on prices. Mr. Wei judged the qualities
based on his own experiences. Once he thought it was OK the community' reps would start
bargaining on prices with the shop owners. After comparing prices, they identified 2 shops, one of
which mainly sold water pipes and fittings, and the other mainly water pumps, motors and parts. It
was already 6 p.m. after finalizing arrangements with the vendors. They stayed at Hechi City that
night. The community rep spent 20 RMB for lodging himself.

In the morning of the 26th, they started procuring the goods. The community rep hired an
agricultural-use truck for transporting the goods, and agreed on 230 RMB for freight charges.
Then, he counted the materials and confirmed the prices. Mr. Wei inspected every article,
requested the shops to show them how to install the motors and pumps on site. They installed and
disassembled them, so as to ensure that the equipments could be smoothly installed after being
delivered to the sub-village. The entire process lasted about 3 hours, and was completed before
noon. Mr. Zhang Jianguo, the Facilitator paid the money, the shop owners wrote receipts, and the
community rep approved the invoice and list of articles purchased. Finally, the community rep
escorted the materials back to the sub-village.

3. Comments of All Parties on the Procurement

  
3.1 Comments of the COmmunity Reps

  
  Participatory procurement is good, and we are happy with the quality and prices;

  
  We do not know whether the qualities are good or bad, so we need support from technicians;

  
  If we buy by ourselves, there will be some expenses. It will help reduce the expenses if the PMO could
  help us buy them.

  
  If the decision to buy is not made until after comparing several shops, we do not need to come, Mr.
  Wei (technician) can help us buy them: we trust him.

  
  
3.2 Comments of Mr. Wei, Technician

  
  It is good for the community to participate in procurement, as they may feel comfortable with
  what they bought, and their doubts about government employees will go away.

  
  It is good for them to come for the procurement. Both the price and quality are better than
  Huanjiang. If we go to Liuzhou (a large city, where water pipes, etc. are produced), the prices
  would even be better. However, it will not be economical unless a large quantity is needed.

  
  
  The villagers do not know much about quality of the materials. It would be hard to explain
  something concisely, and it would be impolite to explain before the shop owners. If they come
  and buy by themselves, they may end up buying poor stuff. We need to help them.

  
  
  If we have to assist every village and sub-village to make the procurement, we definitely will not




                                                                                                    137
                                                                             Case studies

  manage, as the workload will be too much.

  
  If large scale purchases are to be made, it would be nice to take a group of villagers. If the
  purchased quantity is large enough, we may go to the manufacturer directly, and transport the
  goods to the township in large trucks; the prices will be better, and it will be easy for the
  villagers to go to the township capital.

  
  
3.3 Comments of the County Facilitator

  
  It is good for the villagers to participate in purchasing. They are happy with the goods they
  purchased, and the prices and qualities are better than those of Huangjiang.

  
  It is also a learning process for the villagers to participate in procurement.

  
  In future, when the project is implemented widely, it will be impossible for every sub-village to
  participate in procurement. It may work if every township send 1 or 2 reps, but it will not be
  practical for every village to send reps, as there will not be enough people available in the county
  capital to accompany them in the purchase. It will not work if they come to buy themselves.
  Firstly, they do not know what to buy, and secondly, they can hardly find the right places to buy
  the things.

  12
  
  
  While doing the purchases for pilot projects, expenses such as food and lodging, transport for
  the county PMO staff and technicians may be borne by the county. However, once the project is
  rolled out, we need to consider how the expenses will be reported.

  
  
4. Common Understandings:

  
  The village should participate in procurement, which can minimize project costs, and improve the
  villagers' sense of ownership and abilities;

  
  It will be better to take town and township as the purchasing unit. It will be convenient for
  participation of communities' reps, and there will be enough specialist personnel available in the
  county and township to support them. In addition, larger quantities will be purchased, and the
  prices will be better.




                                                                                                  138

The procurement process involve with participation of several sectors, instead of just the
business of the community villagers. At a minimum, it should include the facilitators and
technicians from the county and township project offices.



The purchasing costs, including the expenses of the communities' reps, technicians and PMO
staff, should be included in the project budget.

A Case from Gansu Basic Education Project




Project Background


The Gansu Basic Education Project (GBEP) was designed as a six-year pilot project in basic
education in poor areas. It started in 1999 and is funded by the British Government Department
for International Development (DFID). The purpose of the project is to increase enrolment in poor
minority areas thereby helping achieve universal basic education and to reduce the inequalities
which exist in the education system. School Development Planning (SDP) aims to bring schools and
local communities together to create a unified approach to the school's development. It does this
by giving schools more involvement in their own development. It also aims to change the relationship
between schools and communities by bringing them closer together and focusing on some of the
social development aspects of education that prevent children entering, staying and achieving in
schools.

Training in Skills


Head teachers and School District Directors were trained in new skills to help bring schools and
communities together and identify common issues. These skills included Participatory Approaches
(PA) ­ involving all members of school and community and especially those traditionally marginalized
in planning and generic training skills and practical knowledge. Training in three key PA tools for
work with communities included:

Process of SDP


Usually, the SDPs would be developed with the following steps:




1. Development of the materials by the consultants and the PMO staff in charge of SDP;

  
2. Training a batch of the facilitators in the counties with the members of having potential to be
   trained as trainers;

  
3. Training of the Head Teachers (HT) and the School District Directors (SDD) on how to do SDP;

  
4. An SDP committee organized in each school with the members of community members and also
   HT as the head of the committee;

  
  
5. HT consulted the community members, especially the disadvantaged groups, through field visits
   and various interviews/meetings (using the skills/tools above) on the main challenges and
   recommendations from the members for the development of the schools with the support from



                                                                                              141
                                                                           Case studies

  the SDD;

  
  //
6. HT called a community meeting with the participation of all available community members to
   finalize the prioritize the problems facing the schools and also the solutions/targets;

  
  /
7. HT drafted the SDP with the support from the committee and then sent the draft to the SDD;

  
8. The SDD reviewed the draft and then sent it to the county education bureau (PMO) if he
   agrees;

  
9. The county PMO responded with the comments on the targets listed in the SDP and also the
   financial support the HT could expect from the project;

  
  
10. HT revised the draft of SDP and then sent it back to the PMO for finalization to be
    implemented.

  


In the first three years of the project DFID funding has provided some hardware and software to
schools. Gradually this funding will be replaced by the counties themselves through the increase of
the non-personal budget for education. In 2002 schools started to receive some funding based on a
pupil-weighted formula which emphasised the needs of poorer schools first. The size of the funding
delegated will be gradually increased over the remainder of the project.

Summary of SDP in GBEP

The main changes provoked by SDP in the project areas are as the follow:


  In the area of school management, key impacts have been in the area of a more systematic and
  participatory approach to goal setting and school development.




                                                                                               142
                                                                          Case studies


  
  
  In the area of community participation in schools, key impacts have been an increased level of
  communication between schools and communities and the development of a more systematic
  structure for community participation in school planning processes.

  
  
  In terms of ways of working in the administration, key impacts have been greater communication,
  greater understanding of the real situation of schools and a more facilitative way of working and
  improved capacity for co-ordination and monitoring.

  
  
  SDP has also made a contribution to the overall progress in enrolment and retention of children
  in a quality education and to the poverty reduction goal of the project.

  
  
One of the main lessons from the SDP pilot of GBEP is that "the project's focus on participatory
training and support seems to have been important in then building enough confidence and
understanding for Head teachers and CEBs to then take the risk of implementing the new
approaches."

"

"
The other key message is that Good quality training and ongoing support, of sufficient depth and
duration, and at different levels, is essential for impact of SDP. One real strength of the SDP in
GBEP is that it did not underestimate the depth of change which it is trying to bring about. Taking
shortcuts on training and support would likely lead to less impact.




The review also found that the SDP in GBEP has not promoted the involvement of all groups equally.
The most disadvantaged groups, such as the poorest families which did not send children to schools,
the females without Mandarin as the mother tongue, etc., were not as active as other groups in SDP
process.

Implications for PRCDP
PRCDP
From GBEP experiences, it is clear that SDP can be a quite effective way of ensuring the
participation of the community members. Definitely, the training of HT with the essential
skill/tools in community consultation is the key to successful launch of the program. A few
thoughts for PRCDP:

/
PRCDP
1. SDP should be part of the community development plan with the financial support from the
   project funds for the education component;
  
2. SDP could be piloted and then expanded gradually with the expansion of the community
   development planning;
  
3. It takes a lot of time and inputs for training and reiteration, and the continuous support to
   reach high quality of participation in both of breadth and width;
  
  
4. Village Participatory Planning (PP) could assist the participation of the most disadvantaged
   groups in SDP process.

                                                                             Case studies



case 18: How to Facilitate Farmers to Reasonably Contribute Labour and Money in Community-
based Public Projects;  
                       : 


If during the course of implementing participatory community development projects, farmers can
be mobilized to play an active role and reasonably contribute labor and money, this will increase
project inputs and improve the efficient use of poverty relief funds. More importantly, it will
enhance the farmers' sense of project ownership, which is one important condition for project
sustainability. On the other hand, an inappropriate way of mobilising labour and money contributions
from farmers may impose an excessive burden on farmers, who may request to reduce their part.
Another possibility is that the works that farmers could do are done by the external labours which,
in addition to excessive inputs of poverty relief funds, also deepen farmers' dependence.




""


The key to facilitating a reasonable contribution of labour and collect money is that the facilitator
realizes that farmers are the subjects of development; then, instead of imposing requirements on
them, he will facilitate their decision to contribute labour and collect money. The following steps
are recommended:


""""


First Step: Provide clear information on the available funds and their limitations to the
community


The amount of poverty relief fund is limited, and there are also certain limitations on the use of
funds. For example, in a drinking water project, the facilitator needs to tell farmers the amount of
money available, and the possible uses. This is very important. Otherwise, the farmers continue to
emphasize all sorts of difficulties, hoping to get additional project support; only after we have told
them clearly, farmers will focus their minds on how to use the available project money.







Second Step: Farmers choose project or set project objectives



                                                                                                  145
                                                                            Case studies



Within the limits of funding and usage available, farmers will select a project, such as constructing
drinking water pipes or building water ponds, or set more specific project objectives, such as
building a 200 m3 or 100 m3 water storage for the households or the villages, etc.


200100


Third Step: Jointly analyze funding and labour needed for the project


Based on the projects and the objectives wanted by the farmers, technicians will make a
preliminary project design and budget. At the same time, the technicians must change the
traditional contractual way of budgeting and consult farmers on which project activities need
monetary inputs, such as purchasing materials and hiring skilled workers, and which activities can be
done through farmers' labor, such as digging foundation, and moving materials, etc. This will lead to
a farmer-centred design and budget.







Fourth Step: Facilitate farmers adjusting projects or project objectives


Compare the budget made by technicians after consultation with the farmers, which includes both
monetary inputs and labor inputs, with the funding available in the poverty relief project, and
conclude how much money and labour is needed in addition. Facilitate a discussion on whether the
shortages could be met by contributions from the community; if the farmers believe they could not
mobilise the additional money or labor, then the farmers need to discuss how to adjust the project
objectives and lower the costs. For example, if drawing water to individual households is too
expensive and beyond what farmers could afford, the conclusion could be to draw water to the
village instead, and redesign project and budget accordingly, according to the project objectives
set by farmers and in a way that the community can afford the inputs of money and labor which
would be needed in addition to the project money.










                                                                                                 146
                                                                           Case studies

Through the described process, farmers decide on the final project objectives and they recognise
this as their own project. They also realise that if they set a higher project objective, they would
need to contribute more inputs; otherwise, they will need to lower their objectives accordingly.
Since objectives and inputs of labour and money are set by the farmers themselves, this will
greatly enhance this project's feasibility, and avoid the problem of excessive burden on farmers by
"portioning out".




""
Step Three and Step Four are normally spontaneously conducted.




Step Five: Farmers discuss among themselves the preliminary internal allocation of labour and
money contributions


The communities normally have experiences on how the inputs needed from the communities can be
allocated to individual households, and how those should be organized.




Step Six: Promote farmers in the community to discuss about caring "disadvantageous groups"

""
""
When distributing inputs of labour and money the community normally will adopt the even allocation
method, which is per head or area of cultivated land. However, such an even allocation method may
easily cause difficulties for the "disadvantageous groups" in the community. Therefore, when the
community proposes an allocation plan, the facilitator needs to raise the following questions for
discussion by the community:


""

       Can the destitute households afford the money-raising plan of the community? If not, what
       are the corrective measures?
       Can the labour-scarce households bear the labour inputs allocated to them? If not, what can
       we do?
       Could it be that due to male labour migration the inputs of labor will mainly be provided by
       women? Will women's burden be excessive? How to solve this problem?

       
       



                                                                                                147
                                                                            Case studies


       
       
By helping the community to discuss these questions and proposing solutions, try to minimize the
negative impacts of inputs of labor and money in the project on "disadvantageous groups".

""

Step Five and Step Six are normally spontaneously conducted.




Through the abovementioned steps, we can enable all project stakeholders to gain a common
understanding on the project objectives. It will also enable farmers in the community to be their
owner driver for inputs of labour and money. In addition, it will also promote a "pro-disadvantageous
group" perspective in the community development. Furthermore, where project poverty relief funds
are more flexible, the community can allocate funding to different projects within a set budget,
based on their priorities and criteria on how to match poverty relief funds with their own inputs of
labor and money, with the objective of achieving a farmer-based sustainable, comprehensive
community development.

During the assessment of EAT projects in Huanjiang County, Guangxi, it came out clearly that
different stakeholders will apply different criteria when assessing a project's "success". The
"EATs" are a number of small-scale community infrastructure projects, mostly drinking water, but
also some village roads, which have been planned and implemented by village communities. When

case   20:    Adjusting   Project   Objectives    Based    on   Availability   of   Labors;
:
 



 Dongmei Community is a pilot village in EATS Project at Huanjiang County, Guangxi
 Autonomous Region. After participatory evaluation of needs, it took solving the problem
 of access to potable water for both man and animals, as well as improving road conditions,
 in which potable water was prioritized.

 Dongmei Community has 16 households, 82 people, with 40 labors. There is a well of
 underground water, which serves as the water source for people and animals at normal
 times. However, during winter and spring, water level of the spring can be too low to draw
 water, and there are three to four months every year when they have difficulties to get
 access to potable water. On the hillside 300 meters away from the community, there is a
 spring with large amount of water available during the rainy season, but are basically
 useless. The water spring out in the dry season is small, but is also used as a
 supplementary water intake for the community in the past. The technician consulted with
 the farmers, and jointly decided to build a water pond under the said water source, and
 collect water during the rainy season, and serve as the water source during the dry
 season.

 It was estimated that the entire community need about 4 tons of water per day during
 the dry season, in which about 1 ton can be drawn from the well, 1 ton can be tapped from
 the water source on the hillside, and there is about 2 tons of shortage. If a 200 m3 water
 pond can be built, it can basically solve the problem of difficult access to potable water
 during the dry season. Therefore, the farmers and the technician jointly set the project
 objective as building a 200 m3 water pond for water in the dry season. According to the
 amount of money possibly available in the project, the farmers in the community decided
 to use the project money to buy materials and hire skilled workers, and the remaining
 jobs, mainly include digging foundations and removing materials, will be conducted by the
 farmers contributing labors.

 During the course of implementing the project, the farmers found it very hard to finish
 the construction jobs by themselves. The first reason was that even though the
 community had 40 labors, about one third were working outside as migrant labors, and
 could not possibly participate in contributing labor to build the water pond. The second
 reason was that they underestimated the workload of digging foundation for the water
 pond. If calculated by building a 200 m3 water pond, the labor input for every labor would
 go beyond their affordability. The farmers and implementation group of the community
 repeatedly complained, and consulted with the facilitator. They adjusted the project, and
 down-sized the volume of the water pond from 200 m3 to 150 m3. Although down-sizing
 the water pond made it impossible to completely solve the problem of water shortage
 during the dry season, what they could do was to reduce the water consumption of every
 household. However, they could afford the intensity of labor contribution after

case   21:   Different   Communities    Choose    Different   Means    of   Implementation:
:
 




Dongmei and Pudong are two neighboring communities, with the common problem of water
shortage, and building public water ponds was also the solution that farmers from both
communities proposed after discussion. However, the basic conditions of these two
communities were somehow different.

Dongmei Community has 16 households, 82 people, with 40 labors. Compared with Pudong
Community, it has a larger number of labors. In addition, Dongmei Community has access to
rough road, and small trucks can directly transport materials to the village.

Pudong Community has 6 households, 25 people, with 12 labors. Pudong does not have
access to road, and the materials to build water ponds, after being trucked to Dongmei,
must be removed by labor before they could get to the village. Each removal will take
about an hour, and each load is normally 30 ­ 50 kilograms.

The average income of agrarian people in both communities was about 300 RMB. Due to low
income, during the slash season, the farmers all have the habit of going out as migrant
labors, by which they could spare some grain rations on one hand, and earn some money to
help out with the daily expenses of the families. Their daily income working as migrant
labors is between 20 and 30 RMB.

According to limitation of money, at the time of project design, the farmers and Project
Office staff discussed and decided that the project will only grant the farmers with
money to buy materials to build water ponds, plus a little money to pay for skilled workers.
The remaining jobs were to be completed by farmers contributing labors. Dongmei
Community basically implemented as per the design plan. However, due to excessively large
workload of digging foundation, the volume of the water pond was down-sized from 200 m3
to 150 m3. Farmers in the community contributed labors in proportion to population,
finished such jobs as purchasing materials, digging foundation, blasting stones and grinding
stone powers, totally contributed more than 400 man days. The households with labors
going out working as migrant labors, which could not input man days accordingly, hired
helping hands or pay for buying the man days, and finished the workload that they had to
input. Therefore, the project money of Dongmei Community was enough to pay for buying
materials and hiring skilled workers, without any need to raise money from the farmers.

When Pudong Community started implementing the project, and inputted more than 50 man
days in buying and removing materials, they found the project implementation placed great
pressures on women. Of the 12 labors in the said sub-village, 6 were working outside as
migrant labors, and 5 of the remaining 6 labors were women. Objectively, women became
the major contributors of labor. In addition, the women staying home also had to harvest
soy beans, raising domestic animals, doing housework. Therefore, they could hardly


                                                                                        152
                                                                   Case studies

undertake any more burdens. After calling the farmers for a meeting, the community
decided to change the original means of implementation, and contract the main jobs of the
entire project to construction teams, and the increased expenditures will be born by
raising money from the farmers. Finally, the community raised more than 120 RMB per
capita, and finished the potable water project. The community farmers discussed and
believed that the community did not have the ability to implement the project by itself.
What they could only do was to hire competent people to do it. Without labors working
outside as migrant labors, they could afford to raise money. After the jobs were
contracted out, the women were freed from great burdens and impacts.

Summary: Based on basic conditions of different communities, when the farmers find
difficulties and problems during the course of implementation, they could adjust the
means of implementation at their own discretion. In this way, it can not only ensure that
the project could meet their desired objectives, but also meet the objective conditions o
the community. Under the under of external conditions remain unchanged, the farmers
decide, at their own discretion, what jobs they could do by themselves, and what jobs
could be contracted out, which reflected farmer-centered development. On the contrary,
indiscriminately stressing farmers doing the jobs themselves would not accord with the
farmers' wills, increase women's burden, and the project could hardly be complete
smoothly, either.

I.      Basics of the Project

Yandong Sub-village totally implemented three projects:       Yandong Sub-village Drinking
Water Project for People and Animals. Nature of the said project was green-field
development, with a 5 m3 pump house, a multi-stage pump, 350 meters of DN40 pipes, a
pumping station, and a set of water pumping equipment, with a total investment of 18,500
RMB;       Yandong Sub-village Women's Health Training Project. Training 24 women,
lectures on knowledge of maternal-child health (MCH) and prevention of diseases,
delivering a batch of books, investing 1,000 RMB;     Yandong Sub-village Building Retaining
Walls to Conserve Soil and Conversion of Sporadic Cultivated Lands on Hillsides to
Forestation Project. Involved in implementation of the project were 6 destitute
households, and 8 other households, investing 1,000 RMB. After implantation of the
drinking water project for people and animals, it solved the problem of access to drinking
water for 30 people in 8 households, plus 120 animals. In addition, by lectures on MCH
knowledge, the local women's knowledge about healthcare and prevention of disease was
improved. The project of building retaining walls to conserve soils got rid of difficulties of
access to land for 58 people, and converted 20 mu (15 mu = hectare) of upland for
forestation.

II.     Project Evaluations

1. Characteristics of the Project

     Features of technical designs: 1. The designed plan can meet the actual needs of the
     local people; 2. It is designed according to local natural conditions; 3. Economic and


                                                                                          155
                                                                     Case studies

  practical.

  Management of Funds: 1. Open and transparent management, with all incomes and
  expenses of project money posted in bulletins; 2. The broad masses participate in
  drafting management methods for the money; 3. There are full-time accountant and
  cashier to manage the use money, and ask for reimbursement of expenses with
  vouchers to the County Project Office; 4. Make project payment as per construction
  progress; 5. County and township facilitators monitor whether the use of money is in
  place or not; 6. The broad masses volunteer to raise money. Since there was not enough
  money to cover expenses of the drinking water project, the local people did not wait,
  depend and request the government to solve the problem for them. They volunteered to
  raise 2,500 RMB, the household paid the most paid 500 RMB, and the household paid
  the least also paid 50 RMB.

  Labor Organization: 1. The broad masses participated in drafting management rules on
  contribution of labor; 2. Free input of labor for the construction jobs that need
  contribution of labors; 3. The households without time to contribute labors pay 15
  RMB/day to the Project Implementation Leading Group; 4. Post on bulletins the days of
  contributed labors; 5. Show up for of the managers elected.

  Decision-making of Project Management: 1. The broad masses participated in electing
  project managers, and participate in promulgating money use management method and
  construction management method; 2. The broad masses participated in determining
  project design plan, the criteria of subsidy for purchasers to show up for work; 3.
  Community, township and county facilitators coordinate in making management decision.

  Purchasing Features: 1. Farmers participated in promulgation of purchasing plan, and
  participate in the entire purchasing process; 2. The county facilitator, village
  facilitator, technician and community enlist the materials to be purchased, and
  purchased on a lump sum basis, for saving freights; 3. The materials bought were
  economical, practical and qualified.

2. PM&E Indices

  What are the differences between the farmers' PM&E indices and what they cared
  about with those of ours?

   Farmers concerns: If the money is being transparently used, if the contribution of
   labor is fair and just, if the construction quality is up to standard, and if the project
   implemented can generate returns.


   Evaluators' concerns: If destitute households and poor households can directly
   benefit from the project, if people of different sexes and roles participated in the
   implementation and decision-making of the entire project.


                                                                                        156
                                                                   Case studies



   What do different groups (of women and destitute households) concern? If
  compared with those of the normal villagers, what are the differences?

   What the different groups (of women and destitute households) concern more were
   how planting and breeding increase economic incomes. However, normal villagers mainly
   concern about how to get access to sub-village road, closed-circuit television,
   telephone, and how to sell agricultural products.

3. Evaluation of Participation Degree

  Ethnic minority participated in the implementation and decision-making of he entire
  project. By the means of interview, the evaluators totally interviewed 8 community
  villagers of Maonan nationality. After interview, it was determined that they would all
  participate in implementation and decision-making of the project, and the degree of
  participation was 100%.

  The most remote and poorest natural village in the administrative village benefited.
  Xiatang Village is 82 km away from the county seat. Coming from the county seat, you
  first drive on a Grade II road, then on asphalt-coated road, then Grade IV road, then
  off road. After arriving at Xiatang Villagers' Committee, you have to take another 20
  minutes of walk on steep stone footpath before getting to Yandong Sub-village.
  However, the said village is in a mountainous area surrounded by stones, without rice
  field and difficult access to drinking water, no economic forests, the natural living
  conditions there are fairly rough. Therefore, we may say that the said village and
  natural sub-village is the remotest, most isolated place with the poorest living
  conditions in Huanjiang County.

  The poorest households adequately benefited, and they could actively participate in
  decision-makings. For example, Tan Jiamin, the poorest farmers in the said natural
  sub-village, due to poverty, his wife left him and went afar. In addition, he was not in
  good physical conditions, and he was penniless, without any source of income. In order
  to take care of him, he was granted an extra 3,000 RMB to make a reservoir, and he
  truly benefited from the project.

  The community establish a fair means of labor contribution, which would not lead
  to worse burden on the households short of labor, nor would it obviously increase
  the burden on women. Since the means of labor contribution for the community was a
  method discussed with the participation of people in the entire community (including old
  people, women and destitute households, etc.), which was jointly discussed and decided
  by everybody, it was fair enough. During the course of division of labor, women mainly
  engaged in lighter jobs, while male labors mainly did more manual jobs, plus that the
  community was forgiving to disadvantageous groups, and could exempt weak farmers
  from participation in construction, it would not cause more burdens on households short



                                                                                      157
                                                                   Case studies

  of labor, nor would it obviously increase the burden on women.

  The distribution of money between different project villages by the county and
  township was transparent, and in the project villages, most farmers knew about
  project budgets and expenditures. Since the project villages are the poorest,
  remotest and most isolated villages located in ethnic minority hilly areas, and the
  arrangement of money was finalized based on evaluation of project needs, and decided
  by villagers after discussion. In addition, budgets and expense of the village were all
  published on walls, and declared on the meetings of the broad masses. Therefore, the
  use of project money is transparent, and known to all.

4. PM&E

  Ethnic minorities participated in the monitoring process. From the entire process of
  project implementation and benefits the project generated, the broad masses
  adequately participated, mainly indicated in that project design plan, purchasing
  methods, money use management were all finalized after satisfactory PM&E of the
  broad masses.

   The remotest and poorest natural villages actively participated in monitoring
  activities. Since the location for implementation of the said project was the remotest
  and poorest natural villages, the targets of service and participation were the locals.

  Women of Yandong Sub-village actively participated in the monitoring process.
  After interviewing four women's representatives, it was found that they participated in
  decision-making and implementation of the three projects of the village, and they also
  participated in monitoring, too.

  The poorest households actively participated in the monitoring process. The poorest
  household in the project, Tan Jiamin, enjoyed privilege of 3,000 RMB of extra subsidy
  and helps form other villagers as the direct object of poverty alleviation, it provided
  him with conditions for monitoring and improved his incentives of participation in PM&E.

  In the project communities, they could feed back their opinions about the project
  to the implementation group. For example, the originally designed water pipe was
  oversized. In order to save money, they requested to change DN 50 pipes to DN40
  pipes. After calculation by the technician, the implementation group agreed to the
  opinions of the villagers, and changed DN50 water pipe to DN40 water pipe.

  After discussion of the evaluation, they come to the conclusion that the project
  implemented in the sub-village was beneficial, in which the women, destitute
  households, and isolated households participated in choice, decision-making,
  implementation and monitoring of the project, and were concerned by the community.

                                              The draft follow-on management rules should include a system of

                                              example, what benefits will the managers receive if they perform
                                              well, and what disciplinary measures or penalties will be imposed
                                              on them if they manage poorly? This should ensure adequate
                                              performance of the managers.

Practical Example 4: Farmer field schools 1:    

Farmer field schools are a specific type of participatory action and learning
groups in agriculture. Farmer field schools are well adapted to the extension of
agricultural techniques that require intensive learning by farmers when farmers
are used to another set of techniques. They have been largely used in the
extension of Integrated Pest Management in paddy fields. In farmer field
schools, some farmers volunteer to manage two of their plots under two different
sets of agricultural practices. Other farmer field school members pay regular
visits to follow how the crop performs under the different practices. Farmer field
schools have proved to be an effective means among remote communities to
extend improved varieties: volunteers grow their traditional varieties and the
new varieties side by side to allow visual comparison, and other farmers visit at
each critical stage of the crop. In setting up farmer field schools, it is important
to ensure that less-educated farmers participate on an equal footing in the
group.

Practical Example 5: Loan groups, livestock credit groups (Yi, Sichuan);
2: 
 


Many townships in China have experience of "micro credit" schemes where households
are asked to form a group, typically of 5 households, in order to access credit. In
addition to being a requirement in the credit scheme for waiving of collateral
requirements, these groups can be an effective way of sharing ideas and experience.
The formation of these groups is however not an easy task. In many communities,
groups tend to include relatives with one or a few better-off households and poorer
households. It should be ensured that better-off households do not expect reciprocation
from poor households in exchange of allowing them to join. Efforts may also be required
to avoid appropriation by the better-off households of the credit received by the poorer
households.

""5





In order to facilitate the formation of these farmer groups, facilitators can try the
following:


  The facilitator should meet with all households within the group, not only the
  representative.

  
  The facilitator can help organize group exchange meetings by attending the first of
  these meetings.

  
In disadvantaged communities where poor households have limited experience in
handling credit in cash, credit in kind may be an appropriate option. Livestock banks and
grain banks are the best-known examples. In a livestock bank, a poor household
receives an animal and passes over one of the first animals born to another household.
In a grain bank, households store grain at harvest and receive back grain later during the
season in case of shortage. However, communities and facilitators should be aware that
there many examples of failure to really benefit the poor in these in-kind banks. When
organizing livestock banks, the following should be paid attention to:






                                                                                      188
                                                              Practical Examples 





  Before organizing a livestock bank, the actual capacity of poor households to handle
  cash should be assessed. Many poor households do handle cash transactions when
  they work out of their farm or go to the market. In this case, cash credit may be
  preferable to in-kind credit.

  
  
  
  There are often existing local systems of animal sharing, e.g. a poor household takes
  care of the animal of another household and keeps part of the young. In this case,
  the livestock bank should adapt the existing system and facilitate its expansion
  instead of creating a new one.

  
  
  
  The cycle of animal lending should always be such that the animal assets of
  participating poor households are sustainably increased through the scheme.
  Livestock banks where households pass on young animals to other households are
  adapted to small animals, up to goats and sheep. In buffaloes and cows, the age at
  first birth delays the expansion of the scheme. It is then better to pass on adult
  animals. The ownership of the adult animal being passed around needs to be carefully
  clarified.

  
  
  
  
  Only vaccinated and healthy animals should be lent. An informal group regulation
  should be established on how to deal with disease or death of the animals that are
  lent.

  
  
  Poor households need technical information in animal feeding, animal care, animal
  housing, disease prevention. Animal bank projects are therefore more efficient if a
  large-enough group of households take part so that training activities can be
  organized for them.

  
  
  
Grain banks are an appealing option at first sight in communities that have regular
                                                                                   189

seasonal grain shortage. However they are even more difficult to manage sustainably
and they should be avoided. When grain shortage happens because households sell
most of their grain at harvest time, grain-short households should be encouraged to
diversify into activities other than grain crop production.

on agriculture; 3: 



Township technicians are usually in too few to justify the organization of a
training course in the township. Also, most villages have a number of farmers
with relatively high education levels or technical expertise. In-village household
training may not be appropriate for them.



The Qinba poverty reduction project has successfully tested joint training courses
for township technicians and selected households from project villages. Not only
do these courses provide cost-efficient and quality training opportunities, but
they also contribute to improving the pattern of relationships between village and
township levels. Ideally, these training courses take place within the township
with a trainer from the county.



When organizing joint technician-farmer training courses, the organizers should
pay attention to the following:
-
  The farmers that are best qualified to attend township courses may not be
  village cadres. They are rather individuals with a strong interest in farming.
  They are more likely to be young people than older people. They are as likely
  to be women as men.
  
  
  Training activities should be balanced between classroom activities and field
  activities.
  
  Training topics should focus less on the agricultural production stage, and
  more on pre-production (input supply), post-production (marketing,
  processing), environmental protection, or farm management.
  
  
  Learning and sharing are important for building farmers capacities.

Practical Example 7: Community-based common property resource management
(especially for grassland); 4:   


Livestock is expected to be one of the main activities developed under PRCDP,
because of its high development potential in mountain areas. In many project
villages, fodder resources are a limiting factor for this development, and the
development of animal production must go side by side with improved fodder
resource management.
Pasture (fangmu di), whether it has been demarcated for individual households
or not, often continues to be used as a "common property resource". Even when
pasture is managed as an individual household asset, it still requires some kind
of community management in defining boundaries and avoiding livestock
damage. Improved pasture management is therefore a critical topic that should
be monitored closely by the community. The appropriate solution is not fencing,
but local informal or formal regulations to manage the animals better.
PRCDP has a specific budget for group or community demonstrations on
improved grassland management.

Practical Example 8: Indicators for Measuring Project Inputs, developed by
Communities  8:


Use and Availability of Project Inputs


1. Input of labor

Quantity and time of labor input are two indices the farmers care about. From the viewpoint
of EATS Project, the poverty relief funds rendered by the project are limited. After
participatory discussion, the farmers hope to maximize the efficiency of using the money.
Therefore, the vast majority of the project money was used to purchase materials, and the
construction jobs were mainly finished by farmers contributing labors. It is thus quite
demanding for contribution of labors by the farmers, especially when the farmers set a high
project objective.
EATS



2. Raising money and expenditures

The sum of money to be raised and the allocation plan were cared about by the farmers at
the planning stage. It was discussed and decided to raise money half by population and half
by the area of cultivated land, and allocate the sum of money to be raised to individual
households. Such a plan of even allocation can be easily recognized by the farmers, but
some destitute households might find it difficult to raise the money. After the financial
difficulties of the destitute households were reported to the implementation group, as a
particular issue, the financially better-off households in the community paid the money for the
destitute households. For example, when Yandong Community was building the potable
water project, by population and by area of farmland, each household was supposed to raise
150 RMB to 300 RMB. However, a few destitute households could only raise 50 RMB, and
some better-off households volunteered to pay 500 RMB. Still, everybody believed it was
reasonable to raise money by even allocation.

The expenditure was another focus of monitoring for the farmers. Posting circulars was an
effective measure to ensure participation of community farmers in monitoring, and the
contents published include all expenditures of project money and the raised money. If

3. Quality of Major Materials

The major materials necessary for construction, such as steel tubes, cement and motors
were focus of concern for the farmers. However, the farmers were inexperienced in
controlling quality of the materials, and they all hoped that the technician could help them
control quality.







                                                                                        195

Practical Example 9: Indicators for Measuring Project Outputs and Outcomes,
                          
developed by Communities 9: 

1. Construction quality

Concern about construction quality made most communities decide to hire skilled
workers to laying bricks to build the water pond. In addition, they also followed
the technical design in the use of cement, even put in more cement. Also the
farmers attached great importance to opinions and suggestions of the technician,
and rework on the construction jobs not consistent with technical standard as
requested by the technician.




2. Project Benefits

Whether the project solved their problems and difficulties, for example, access to
potable water and transportation.


3. Savings of labor

Savings of labor was also an index of concern for the farmers, particularly for the
women. We may see that in geographically isolated karst areas with sparsely
spread lands, great labor intensity is a universal problem.






                                                                               196

Practical Example 10: How to monitor indicators together with communities
10: 

1. Use of Project Funds

Including whether the sums of expenditures and receipts were consistent with
state regulations.


2. Implementation accroding to Project Schedule
    
Whether the project was moving ahead as scheduled, and urged the farmers to
work hard on implementation. During the course of monitoring, it was also found
that due to such factors as shortage of labor and harvesting season, the
construction could not possibly be complete on schedule, after consulting the
farmers, the project schedule was adjusted.



3. Construction Quality and Design Indices

Construction quality is an index of concern to the farmers and project staff.
However, the Project Office also cared about whether the construction can meet
the design requirements. For example, when the households were building water
ponds, the Project Office hoped to subsidize 2,000 RMB, and uniformly build
them into 50 m3 ones. However, according to technical design, merely materials
would need more than 2,700 RMB. Therefore, the farmers still had to invest
more than 700 RMB and all the labor. During the course of monitoring, the poor
households and the households short of labor hoped to build water ponds of
about 40 m3, which could meet their own needs, without adding excessive
burden on them. However, staff of Project Office proposed that it was the
standard of the Province to subsidize 2,000 RMB for building 50 m3 water ponds,
and it was hard for them to explain to the Province if they were built smaller.
Even though after consultation, the Project Office finally agreed that the farmers
could choose to build 50 m3 water ponds or 40 m3 ones, they still believed that it
was okay to do so in pilot projects. While rolling out extensively, they still had to
follow the standard, or it might be difficult to "manage".

4. Project Benefits and Beneficiaries

The project will need to monitore how many households directly benefit from the
investments. In addition, it needs to monitor whether the poor households could
directly benefit from the project, and whether implementation of the project
increased excessive economic burden and labor burden on the poor households.
DFID


5. Impacts on Women

Whether project implementation excessively increased labor burden on women,
and whether women just contribute labor during the course of project
implementation, whether they could participate in such decision-making activities
as discussing plan, and making rules. Farmers in the community could choose at
their own discretion means of implementation, so as to ease the pressure of
labor contribution on women during the course of implementation.

3.2.1 Roles and responsibilities for rolling-out the participation
      approach
The county PMO will coordinate the roll-out of PPA and PP as part of the annual
phasing of PRCDP project activities. Persons in charge of coordinating the roll-out
process should be familiar with the overall planning process being supportive to
the participatory approach, and keep in touch with other project department
staff, township coordinators and village coordinators.
PRCDP



The township facilitators will facilitate the PPA and PP process and support the
community during all phases of participatory project implementation. They will
also support validation of PPA and PP processes, encouraging fair and
transparent integration of planning and resource allocation at the village/county
levels for different sub-villages. Township facilitators will have undergone a
thorough training (including practical application) on participatory methods,
participatory approaches and principles and ways of integration/coordination of
planned activities from the sub-villages to village/county level.

                                                  

 


Village coordinators will take on an important role during implementation and
monitoring and support the facilitators during the planning process. They should
be people within the village who have the recognized skills needed to coordinate
projects activities and community events and processes. (Village coordination is
normally undertaken by village cadres elected by the villagers.) If necessary, it is
also allowable for the villagers or villagers' representatives to elect village
coordinators with the assistance of the township coordinators.








                                                                                204

3.2.2 M&E and Reporting:                        Monitoring          participation
      
Participatory monitoring of project implementation will be done by the project
implementation group in the community. It will need to ensure that different
groups (including women, poor households, and different ethnic groups) have
sufficient opportunity and space to express their opinions and views on project
progress and results. The township coordinator will be responsible for promoting
the process of PM&E and over-seeing it. He also needs to ensure that a complete
documentation of the planning and implementation process is maintained within
each village.




Participatory M&E is an approach to strengthening the community's capacity for
self-management and learning, reviewing project experiences and adjusting
project implementation accordingly. This means that PM&E is mainly to serve the
community's own information needs and as such, the community needs to decide
what they want to monitor and how. Township facilitators will support the
community and the implementation group to set up such a system, to define the
areas they want to monitor and develop methods for monitoring which will
enable women and member of different ethnic communities to express their
views in an appropriate way.





In addition, it will be important for township workstations and county PMOs to
receive regular feedback from communities on project progress and project
results. These feedback mechanisms can build on existing PM&E systems, but
they would not replace them as part of the community capacity building process.
The information requested by the management might overlap with the areas
monitored by the community on some aspects, but might be requested in
addition on others.




County facilitators will develop a format for collecting feedback from communities
and for integrating the information from different sub-villages to the village level
into their information database, to be reported to the county PMO.



                                                                                205
                               Institutional and Management Issues
The county PMO will have to coordinate the contents and process of record data,
urge the village coordinators to complete the records, and keep a complete set of
planning and monitoring documentation in its office.




3.2.3 Roles in Participation as part of the PMO management
      regulations 
The management regulation of the PMO should clarify roles, responsibilities and
team work of PMO in implementing the participatory approach. The management
rules for project offices may be defined by each county separately, however,
they should include the following aspects:


      Job descriptions and appraisal rules of PMO staff (including facilitators).

      
      Office management and staff working system (town, field), including tasks
      to support and integrate PPA, PP, PI and PM&E in county level working and
      planning procedures.

      
      
      Financial management rules (including monitoring by beneficiaries), which
      support the participatory process and provide reasonable powers to the
      facilitators for taking decisions on-the­spot.

      
      
      Data logging and filing management system (including M&E of the
      participatory approach and information from PM&E)

      
      
      Equipment use and management rules (including maintenance plans for
      project villages)

3.3.1 Attitudes of government                     staff     in      participation
      
Effective participation of stakeholders in poverty alleviation necessitates a
change in roles and attitudes for government staff. The poor know best about
their own poverty situation and development priorities. Therefore, it is important
to let the poor themselves be at the centre of the PRCDP process as primary
stakeholders to reveal their priorities and preferences, take decisions, plan,
implement and monitor project-related activities for their own development and
poverty reduction. Government staff should act as service providers and
facilitators, rather than dominating the entire project process, taking the lion's
share of resources, and making all project decisions as in the past.


PRCDP



Participation means government departments and communities working together
on a joint project where both sides share their knowledge and their skills, respect
each other's rights and views and take decisions together in a transparent and
open process. To achieve this, communities need opportunities to take the
initiative and responsibility to build their capacities for sustainable development.



    case 23: Change of Attitudes among local officials as an outcome of PP;
      1PP

Thus, under PRCDP government staff need to act as facilitators and ensure that
the voices and priorities of the poor and the disadvantaged groups (the
poorest, women, ethnic minorities) are heard and sufficiently considered in the
process.

3.3.2 Role of Facilitators 
Clarity about the roles of facilitators and the recognition of these roles both by
the local project and the communities is important for the smooth running of
PRCDP. Forming a cadre of facilitators at the village/township level and building
their capacity implies lower cost for the provinces and easy replication via-a-vis
employing facilitators at the county or provincial level. It is not enough to have a
set of village and township level facilitators - they also need to be empowered to
take on-the-spot decisions (if necessary) on behalf of PRCDP.

Box 16: The facilitator's role;     1: 
The description of facilitators' roles of facilitators is drawn from experiences in PPA and PP
under the Project18:
PPAPP
     The facilitator as assistant: During PPA and PP, facilitators should only facilitate, not
     give instructions or dominate the discussion and analysis, or influence decision-making of
     the community. Local people should be the ones to talk, discuss and decide;
     
     
     
     The facilitator as catalyst: the facilitator should guide the process of transfer between
     PPA and PP, to ensure all analytical and planning contents are completeand to provide
     continuity. If there are disagreements/disputes on, for example, development priorities of
     the community, facilitators need to balance the different priorities with a pro-poor
     perspective using a participatory approach, so that the community reaches a consensus;
     
     
     
     
     The facilitator as service provider: During the course of PPA and PP, the facilitator
     needs to ensure all relevant data is generated and recorded; maintain regular
     communication with key stakeholders; accurately represent local views and ideas; and
     feed back outside information to the community promptly.
     
     
     


3.3.3 How to mediate conflicts:                      some      principles      and     cases
      
Conflict and negotiation is an important part of the participatory process in
PRCDP. Different conflicts over different resources and even induced conflicts
within or outside the local community can raise its head. Local facilitators have
an important role in mediating conflicts and mediating interests of different
stakeholders, especially the poor and the disadvantaged. Their capacities and the
institutional support for addressing and solving conflicts needs to be build up
over time in PRCDP.

When mediating conflicts, facilitators should observe the following points:

   ·   While analyzing and demonstrating project plans, try to consider who are
       the stakeholders of the project plan, particularly which group's interests
       may be jeopardized, listen to their views, and promote the beneficiaries
       and the potential non-beneficiaries to discuss and decide a possible
       solution, so as to avoid conflicts;

       
       
       
   ·   Some conflicts may have already been there, and the project may become
       the catalysis for the conflict to erupt. Only by firstly obtaining a good
       understanding of the community and possible sources of conflict , can we
       possibly avoid the project making the conflict worse.

       
       
   ·   No project could possibly make everybody happy. However, creation of an
       open, transparent and equitable decision-making mechanism will minimize
       potential conflicts.

       
       
   ·   "The minority should be subordinate to the majority" is a way of settling
       disputes. However, we must be careful about whether the opinions of the
       majority may infringe the interests of the minority, and see if it is possible
       to establish compensation method or other alternative measures, so as to
       avoid planting seeds for future conflicts.

       Through adoption of participation as guiding principle, the performance
       and effectiveness of project management will significantly improve and
       conflicts of interests among project stakeholders will be reduced.

       
       
       Building capacities for participatory project planning, implementation and
       monitoring will help PRCDP to better achieve its vision of people-centred
       and sustainable development.

       PRCDP
       


3.4.2 Approach to Capacity Building 
Participatory approaches involve a big dose of learning-by­doing over time. Still,
it is crucial to start with some basic inputs for enhancing capacity development
within PRCDP. A strategic plan for capacity building in a phased manner will be
driven by the needs of the project and will put specific and clear emphasis on the
following three aspects:

PRCDP

   o   Attitudes: Changing stereotyped mind-sets to       adopt a more flexible
       attitude to people-centred development;

       
   
   o   Methods: Application of participatory methods and approaches in practice
       and

       


                                                                              214
                               Institutional and Management Issues
   o   Institutional Change: Institutionalize these methods and approaches
       within the government system to poverty alleviation for a sustainable
       development.

       

Recommended here are some strategies for capacity building, which are to be
used in a comprehensive manner. The strategies are not mutually exclusive.
They are over-lapping and are inter-connected to a great extent and should be
employed simultaneously to achieve the objectives mentioned above.




   o   Building    knowledge,      skills   and    values    for    participatory
       development, which is a crucial component of the whole project process.
       There should be opportunities created for continuous learning and
       reflection contributing towards focused professional growth of the project
       staff. One-shot workshops are not sustainable and there is also the need
       for providing regular support to facilitators to apply new ideas going
       beyond conventional activities. This would also involve performance-based
       assessments and incentive systems, which encourage project staff to take
       a less structured approach.

       
       
       
       
       


   o   Building skills in interpreting and using data from PPA, PP and
       participatory monitoring in order to integrate them with county/village
       level plans and the conventional project data.

       
       


   o   Finding ways to align project objectives with those of local communities
       and coming up with a localized checklist and instructions for
       strengthening and supporting field-level decision-making.

       
       


   o   Finding ways to identify and target poor and the disadvantaged in
       terms of project benefits and related decision-making, to target additional
       resources and support from different partner organizations, to provide
       support for organizational linkages of communities for more holistic

                                                                              215
                                   Institutional and Management Issues
          development and to promote self-help principles amongst the community
          members for sustaining development.


          
          
          


      o   Institutional development ­ Redefine roles and change attitudes (For
          details see the discussion above). In the long run, the institutions in the
          hierarchical structure will need to redefine and clarify their objectives,
          mutual roles and performance yardsticks through a learning process which
          draws from present and past experience. Focused training and
          stakeholders' workshop is considered a powerful means of influencing
          institutional behaviour19.

Appropriate capacity building based on practical experience will help the
managerial team to adopt a learning mode with sufficient flexibility for to
improvement . Such an approach to capacity building will demonstrate the
relevance and usefulness of participation in initiating and running
projects/programmes and especially the significance of facilitator-villager

                               Institutional and Management Issues
   ·   learning from practical application rather than from instructions through
       experts,

       
   ·   improving project performance based on lessons from the field rather than
       sticking to predefined targets only,

       
   ·   understanding learning on participation as a long-term task and creating
       platforms for ongoing exchange of field-based experiences within the
       government system rather than depending on formal training only.

       
       


3.4.4 Focuses of Capacity Building 
Capacity building on participation should focus on the following areas:
PRCDP
   o Capacity building will be focused on developing understanding of
       participation, and on how to effectively promote active participation of
       the community, as well as how to effectively coordinate cooperation
       between different departments (the province, the counties and the
       townships). This will help realize project objectives, and ensure that the
       poverty groups benefit.

       
       
       
   o Awareness raising will be carried out with leaders. The switch should be
       made to the awareness from the past when the leaders made all the
       decisions, and the       people implemented these decisions , to the
       stakeholders jointly make the decisions and jointly implementing the
       activities. Such a switch of awareness is not only to improve the
       effectiveness and efficiency of the project, but also to guarantee that the
       development changes of the poor communities are toward the desired
       direction for reducing poverty and vulnerability.

       
       
       
   o The key trainees will be project facilitators (including line agencies) at
       county, township and village levels, so as to minimize costs during the
       course of rolling out PP. The most suitable promoters of PRA will be project
       facilitators at county, township and village levels, instead of the outside
       "experts". The focus of capacity building should be on capacity of the local
       facilitators, so as to ensure that they can be in operation continuously.
                                                                               217

       ""
       

   o The basic means of training should be through learning-by-doing in the
       field instead of mainly indoor training. The mentality of participatory
       development and facilitating skills for promotion of participation depend
       largely on accumulation of experiences. However, indoor training mainly
       provides concepts and theoretical knowledge. Therefore, self-learning and
       mutually helpful learning in practice is more important.

        
       
       
       


3.4.5 Steps in Capacity Building 
Steps in capacity building in the different areas should be suited to local
conditions. If the level of capacity is at a starting stage , capacity building would
go through the following stages. :



Step One: Clarify Institutional Responsibilities and Training Audience

The institutions involved in PRCDP need to clarify objectives and mutual roles
through `start-up stakeholders' workshops.
PRCDP

   ·   Who will be responsible for managing the capacity building programme at
       PMO level? There should be people who can handle such a mission at the
       County level.

       
       
   ·   Who will be the key resource persons for briefings to leaders and as
       training facilitators? These will be those with considerable knowledge of
       participation, functional and operational skills, and proper attitude to form
       the county-level trainers' team, and also be recognized by the provincial-
       level project coordination department.




                                                                                 218

Scope for holding a series of stakeholders' workshops, based on the emerging
project needs, is useful during the life of the project. So a start-up stakeholders'
workshop will be followed by a series of such workshops either on a periodic
basis and or as and when the situation demands. This is a type of needs-based,
evolutionary process of institutional learning-by-doing in which the lead
institution, its supportive institutions and those networked can mutually learn
from the emerging field experience and resolve outstanding issues.





Step Two: Assess Training Needs

The training must be based on the actual needs of project work, be fully
functional during the course of project implementation, and directly contribute to
rolling out the PRCDP project and PP. Training is for de-bottlenecking the "skill"
difficulties and hurdles encountered during the course of rolling out PRA.
Therefore, the starting point of capacity building is the actual needs instead of
the theories or approaches.

PRCDP
""
The county-level training groups and the provincial project departments will
evaluate the training needs of the counties, townships and villages and
provincial- level relevant units related to participatory poverty alleviation and
development, and determine the different trainees and corresponding training
contents. The training needs analysis should include assessment of knowledge,
attitudes, skills and practices on participation. The results of this study should be
a strategy focusing on identifying and fostering supportive leadership, developing
a skilled and committed staff cadre, and supporting any organisational changes
needed to promote these changes.





PRCDP must strive to build capacities for improved ways of participation in the
project. There are a few critical capabilities needed by project staff which are
described in the following checklist.

                                                                                 219

Step Three: Capacity Building Plans

Based on PRCDP project progress and the above strategy, create county-level
and provincial level capacity building plans. These will be practical documents
showing the number, type, content, and timing of capacity building and training
sessions, including who will facilitate them, and who the participants should be.
The plans should have an accompanying budget. The sessions will include
trainings, workshops, discussion meetings, briefings, exposure visits/exchanges,
etc.

Step Five: Evaluation and Follow-Up

Finally, the effectiveness of the capacity building and training should be
evaluated as part a) of good training practice (e.g. by using trainee feedback at
the end of sessions), and b) of the overall M&E system of PRCDP, especially the
part dealing with the quality of participation. This feedback can be used to
modify further capacity building.

Box 18: Ways for Capacity Building in PRCDP II; 3: PRCDP II
Training-workshops based on field-work can provide useful lessons for influencing
attitude and behaviour. However, there can arise the need for having more than one round of
training-workshop since PRA-type activities require periodic reinforcement of appropriate
inputs. When the needs of the project team are identified for capacity building it is important
to plan suitable ways of meeting those needs. High quality training in participatory project
activities can initiate changes in knowledge, skills and values of the project team members,
which would then have to be sustained.








                                                                                           222
                                    Institutional and Management Issues

An important message to bring to the project team is that in the post-training period, self-
driven learning from the field is a powerful way of reinforcing skills and values required for
participatory projects.



                                                        
Box 19: Ways for Capacity Building in PRCDP III; : PRCDP III
Implementing institutions can build teams of motivated individuals with concentrated
rounds of training to spearhead the participatory process envisaged in PRCDP. Peer-groups
can be encouraged to meet for informal interactions and sharing of views.

PRCDP


Informal learning groups, small in size, cutting across different layers of an institution can
highlight issues from different perspectives and discuss them. Learning groups can cut
across project team members, local communities and others.



PRA `clinics' conducted from time to time can bring to the fore important field and project-
related issues and discuss ways of resolving them. Such `clinics' from time to time can play a
useful role in conflict-resolution both within and outside the project teams and can strengthen
the process of learning.

In mentoring or `hand holding', a close relationship with a senior staff of proven behaviour
and skill is likely to keep a young staff open and yearning for growth. Institutions can nurture
such relationship by assigning mentors to junior staff members. The mentor has to create
effective channels of communication, inspire and instil values in the junior, encourage
positive attitudes, and discourage cynicism and negative attitudes in the junior. This would
increase the confidence of junior staff being mentored, open channels of communication and
influence way of thinking and thereby create opportunities for attitudinal change.

3.4.7 Issue and Challenges 
Some common issues and challenges in capacity building in participatory
approaches are described below.


(i) It is important to point out that training has its own limitations, especially
one-off training. Slow capacity building over time with periodic reinforcement
of new training inputs is desirable for the project team.
   


(ii) Relationship with external agencies/parent organization ­ Often it is
found that the rules which govern a participatory project management structure
stands out differently from those which govern parent institution/s and other line
agencies. These differences often act as constraints to smooth functioning of the
participatory project management structure. It is important to be aware of such
constraints and evolve appropriate capacity building plans for providing
overviews on participatory approaches to parent institution/s, line agencies and
others institutions important to the smooth running of the project.

                                                                                ­





(iii) Transfer of trained staff ­ Often it has been observed that trained staff
from participatory project management structures get transferred on a routine
basis and such transfers may not be beneficial for the project during its start-up
years. An agreement needs to be reached with an appropriate authority for
limiting the transfers of trained staff for a few years.
                                                                                ­




(iv) Use of stereotyped yardstick for performance assessment ­ Use of
performance yardsticks used for less participatory projects       can pose a
constraint, as they may limit the performance of a PRCDP staff who may then
be less inclined to take risk or do something innovative in the course of the
project period. It is important to develop new yardsticks for performance
assessment of staff the project through brain-storming with PRCDP staff .




                                                                              227

(v) Quantitative targeting ­ Reliance on quantitative targeting is limiting in
participatory projects, and these targets are often already in place for projects
where the number of things produced/provided is the only indicator for judging
performance (for example the number of drinking water taps or the number of
roads planned and completed). This approach may have to be dropped or
ignored in PRCDP and more qualitative ways of benchmarking and even targeting
will have to be evolved. This will become important in the setting of monitoring
indicators for the project and the stakeholders' workshop can provide a list of
such indicators appropriate for the PRCDP project.
                                                                                  ­

      PRCDP  
Emphasis on practice and mutual learning as an integral aspect of the
participatory approach will help the institution to be more effective in translating
practical lessons from the field and to be able to manage the project with more
professional confidence and hence better results.


Managerial styles in PRCDP are expected to influence other institutions in direct
contact with PRCDP as well as those which control it. It is important to point out
that the management systems in the higher-up institutions over-seeing PRCDP
will have to adapt and gear themselves to the new participation-friendly style of
functioning. This will imply not only a change of mind-set to appreciate
participatory management but also to appreciate, recognize, grant legitimacy to
and support the following:

              team to adapt to the new ways of project management and take off.

              PRCDP
Ultimately, the re-structuring of institutions towards becoming people-friendly
needs to be mainstreamed on the development agenda. This is also important in
the context of sustaining institutional capacity building towards participatory
development.


In this context, it is important to remember that PRCDP is not an isolated project
structure. It can perform well only if it is provided good support by its controlling
institutions and peer-institutions. Such capacity building of other institutions is
also important for sustaining institutionalization of participatory approaches
within PRCDP. Otherwise there is a risk that PRCDP becomes a mere one-off
experimental project in the vast development world of China. Therefore, some
capacity building of the institutions controlling PRCDP and peer-institutions is

                                                                                 229

of the project strategy, context of activities and the way forward and also for
moving towards improved vertical and horizontal linkages.

3.5 Costs and Benefits of Participation 

3.5.1 Purpose of this Chapter 
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a framework for assessing the costs
and benefits of participation and to provide guidance on financing the
participatory approach in PRCDP.
PRCDP

To achieve meaningful participation it is important to recognize that there is an
`up-front' cost, i.e. at initial cost at the beginning of the project. However, the
reason that the participatory approach has been adopted across so many of the
World Bank's investments globally, is that the initial costs are off-set by much
better impact and more sustainable outcomes in the long run. These initial costs
and longer-term benefits are elaborated here.
""




3.5.2 Costs of Participation 
There are two principle cost types in the participatory approach:



a) Costs associated with training and capacity building
   
    Building awareness and support for the participatory approach among
      management staff at all levels

      
In relation to awareness raising and capacity building, PMOs will need to ensure
that sufficient briefings and workshops with leaders are costed.


    Facilitator training on participation methods, attitudes and quality issues
      (facilitators at County, Township and Village levels)

      
      
    Holding stakeholders's workshop (one day) with regular periodicity (twice
      annually or as frequent as required. These may involve paying subsistence



                                                                               231
                                Institutional and Management Issues
      allowance and travel costs to participants and should be held in locations
      where such costs are generally low.

      
      

In relation to the training, Provinces will need to make sure they have budgeted
for sufficient training of facilitators and that they have a group of experienced
facilitators who can run the facilitators' training. It is recommended that
facilitator training occurs at two separate levels, to reflect the different roles and
capacities of the facilitators:
""


    One set of training for facilitators drawn from County and Township staff
      (to include the Province in one county. In case there are too many people,
      it may be conducted in two sessions).

      
      
    One set of training for village facilitators.
      

The majority of participation facilitators will be at the township and village level,
and the major cost is in training this large group of facilitators. This is in fact a
low cost approach to facilitation, as once trained, the facilitators have low on-
going costs (e.g. work subsidies and daily subsistence fees). Furthermore,
training a group of people at the village level in facilitation skills, is a more
sustainable approach and is empowering to those communities.





It is further recommended that a highly participatory approach is developed for
the training, using small groups and a hands-on approach, and that the costing is
based on using this type of training method (see Annex on Training).




    Introducing the participatory approach to villagers
      
The costs that need to be allocated to introducing the participatory approach to
villagers should be much less than the cost for training facilitators. Since the

                                                                                  232
                                 Institutional and Management Issues
majority of trained participation facilitators will be at the village level already, the
costs of travel, food and subsistence, and so on for people to facilitate the
introduction of the approach to villagers will be minimised.



Villagers could be introduced to participation in a number of ways ­ such as
through a village meeting or through learning-by-doing. Following some briefing,
learning-by-doing together with good facilitation should mean they understand
the concepts better. This would mean that some extra briefing and training costs
and time should be budgeted into each stage of the village-level project cycle.

       Implementation, and PM&E

       
       

Facilitation will be required in each step. In order to cost these facilitations within
their costing frameworks, PMOs will need to decide:


         how many village and county/township facilitators will be involved in
         each stage,

         /
         how many days facilitation each facilitator dedicates to each stage in
         each village,

         
         how much, if anything, village facilitators will be remunerated.

         

Expenses to be budgeted which are related to facilitation during implementation
are :


                                                                                    233

Material costs, transportation and hotel expenses incurred during the
course of project management;

 
Technical inputs, such as engineering costs, transportation and boarding
of technicians going to countryside;

 
Necessary meetings, including reasonable food and other expenses for
meetings of county, township and village coordinators;

 
For county and township project staff and technicians going to the
countryside, it is allowable to work-out reasonable rates of field
subsidies (including food);



As a principle, the project will not provide beneficiary groups with
working subsidies. The beneficiary groups include villagers, villagers'
representatives, managerial people from the natural villages and
villagers' committees. However, if the villagers' representatives and
managerial people have to work outside their villages, the necessary
expenses need to be budgeted.



;
Based on specific project needs, farmers may input money or labour,
however, this will have to be on voluntary basis.



If villagers and villagers' representatives are authorized by villagers to
work outside the village (for example in procuring materials), the
necessary expenses like transportation, food and lodging incurred
during the course of these activities will be jointly born by the villagers.
However, the range and criteria of the expenses will be decided by the
villagers beforehand.




Different villages may decide according to local circumstances if the
labor contributions of farmers in construction of infrastructures will be
subsidized (with labor remuneration), and be included in the plan.

                                                                        234

    Reflective learning and sharing of experiences (improving participation ­
      passing learning on to the next phase and new project areas);

       ­ 

Given the phased approach to PRCDP, between each phase there will be
opportunities for reflection and sharing of experiences with participation.
Provinces should budget for proper reflection workshops, as well as any other
sharing ideas such as networking, to maximize the potential of learning-by-
doing.

3.5.3 Benefits of participation 
Benefits from the participatory approach may be divided into social and
institutional benefits that are difficult to assign a monetary value, and economic
benefits.



Evidence for the economic benefits from a participatory approach are drawn from
experiences with other World Bank community-driven development (CDD)
projects around the world, as well as experiences from some NGOs with Chinese
rural communities.

These benefits include:


    The farmers are more willing to input more resources (mainly labour
      resources) to improve the quality of infrastructure projects implemented
      and managed by the communities themselves, and spare more project
      resources for such inputs as purchasing materials and technical supports,
      which will need "direct" input of money. In this way, with the same
      amount of financial inputs, the project can be bigger than it would be

                                                                              235
                                 Institutional and Management Issues
        otherwise. However, it should be noted that, when the community make
        the project bigger, it may impose pressure on households short of hands
        due to the associated increase in contribution of labor. It may also impose
        unintended pressures on the poor and the disadvantaged households to
        provide labour services on a voluntary basis, which they may not be able
        to cope with and which may result in them being forced to go without food
        and other basic needs.

        
        
        ""
        
        
        
      If, compared with contracted projects, the ones implemented and
        managed by the communities minimized the overhead expenses and
        profits paid to contractors, they     can make almost 100% of project
        money available for the implementation of the project. . In addition, the
        communities will not shortcut input of labor and materials in order to
        increase profits, which will guarantee construction quality, and minimize
        future maintenance and service expenses. This also lays the foundation for
        infrastructure to be sustainable.

      Community-managed infrastructure projects (i.e ones with community
        participation) are better maintained than projects managed by the local
        government21. The conclusion drawn from this is that where communities
        have participated in the full project cycle related to the development of a
        certain infrastructure, they feel more ownership of it, it is `their road', not
        the `government's road'. Therefore they are more willing to commit time
        and resources to maintain it. This saves the local government money on
        maintenance and extends the useful life of the investment. Both of these
        factors improve the economic return on the investment.

            It is worth noting that smaller, less technical sub-projects were found to
            be more effective when a participatory approach was used.

            
            
       Facilities constructed with community involvement (participation) tend to
         improve access to public services. Schools developed where there has
         been community participation in the project cycle have higher attendance
         rates than government built schools, and use of primary health care and
         rates of child vaccinations increased where health facilities were developed
         with community participation22.

         
         
         
       Where there is on-going participation of       the community in the
         management of infrastructure, better outcomes are found: better school
         test results and fewer absentees with community members on school
         boards23.

          
          

The quality of infrastructure is better where the community is involved in project
implementation. Projects constructed without community supervision or
management tended to be poorly constructed by private contractors. The
conclusion drawn here is that communities tightly supervise what they see as
`their infrastructure' and as they are on the ground they are better able to
supervise than town-based technicians. However, studies show communities do
need technical support in their supervision.

       Infrastructure works better where there is participation. In water schemes,

       If participation extends to some control of the funds themselves., then it
         improves communities' willingness to contribute time and resources to
         projects. When government staff or contractors controlled the funds,
         communities viewed their contribution as a tax rather than a fee for
         service25.

         
         
         
       Overall,     participation can improve the sustainability of project
         investments. The process of community participation strengthens the
         community's potential for collective action, which in turn is likely to mean
         that they act together to better maintain infrastructure. However, there is
         evidence that participation and community management can be seen by
         governments as an excuse for minimal on-going support to communities.
         The combination of community participation and continuing support from
         government for margin inputs and training is most likely to create
         sustainability26.

         
         
         
         
         

These economic benefits may be summarized as:

       Better maintenance, and lower maintenance costs by government
         
       Better utilization rates, and hence better rates of return on the investment

    The government improves its own service and management. On the one
      hand, the government should empower the communities, allowing the
      communities to do those things they have the right to participate in and
      can do well. On the other hand, the government should focus their efforts
      on providing the communities with a better development environment and
      services, including managerial supports and technical services, etc.

      
      
      

The last five of these social benefits should all endure beyond the life of the
project.


In summary, the participatory approach entails some upfront expenditure,
mainly in training. Use of village facilitators means on-going costs are lower, and
the capacity is located in the village. The benefits from the approach are mainly
longer term ones that relate to more effective and efficient use of the project
investment, and communities that have improved capabilities for self-
development. The cost-benefit equation favours the use of the participatory
approach.

case 23: Change of Attitudes among local officials as an outcome of PP;
  PP
 1  
Through their involvement in the PP process, local officials have developed a new
understanding about the local community, as well as poor people's perspective on poverty
and its alleviation. Examples of this change are:
PP

1. From lack of trust of analytical abilities of the community to acknowledgement of
   and respect. When they started participating in PP, some officials thought poor
   communities were economically primitive, and that villagers were poorly educated,
   and did not know and could not think about their lives. They believed that county and
   township project staff were better educated, more analytical, and more
   knowledgeable on issues most important for the communities. Conducting PPA and PP
   would only waste time and resources in poor communities. However, as the
   participatory work progressed, attitudes of township and county project staff
   changed. "During the course of analysis, we came to fully respect and trust local
   people's knowledge and abilities, feel relaxed to let them map, vote and draw
   conclusions. We delegated the right to discuss and analyse to the locals completely.
   The results proved that the community have all the abilities to analyze their own
   poverty problems."
  PP
  
  
  
  
  
  
2. From unwilling to communicate with the community to learning from them, and
   listening attentively to their wishes. "At the very beginning, some people believed it
   was sufficient to consult a few village cadres, and that there was no need to do a
   very detailed job. However, after living in the village and establishing a profound
   communication with villagers, county and township project staff discovered they had
   gained a lot of knowledge from the community, and collected a lot of information. We
   realized it was their knowledge that was the key to solve poverty problems. We
   learned how to learn from the community and listen to their voices".
  
  
  
  
  


                                                                                     242

3. From being afraid of empowerment to letting local people make decisions by
   themselves. "Before implementation of PP, some people were worried that the
   community would not use their new rights to plan. However, after a series of PP, we
   noticed that the community had all the abilities to handle all kinds of conflicts of
   interests, and make practical and feasible plans. Therefore, we delegated the right
   of decision-making to the community, and let the locals make the decisions and
   produce very good results from community PP."

case 24: How Conflict was solved during a villagers meeting;
3: 
   
On that day, 114 representatives of the villagers joined the meeting, of which 64 were
men and 50 were women. Before the meeting the facilitators informed the village that
the representatives should consist of 1 woman, 1 poorest household and 1 member of
Villagers' Union. The number of representatives was expected to be 81 though 114
persons came to join the meeting because several sub-villages sent more
representatives in consideration of their population.
In the meeting the representatives had two different opinions in the same village. One
group wanted to build the road different from the other group. So conflict appeared
regarding direction of the road and it was difficult to decide, which road to build on a
priority bases. Each group selected one representative to present their opinion in detail.
After their presentation the work team numbered the two roads as road 1 and road 2
and then wrote road 1 on a piece of paper on the left and road 2 on another piece of
paper on the right. And then the 2 pieces of paper were placed on two bowls
respectively with one bowl placed between them in the center. The two groups then put
beans in the three bowls to vote either for road 1 or road 2 or not vote at all. The work
team then made the decision according to the number of beans in each bowl for
selection of the road project. The results showed that for road 1 there were 9 votes,
for road 2 there were 99 votes and 6 persons did not take sides.

Baidan Village of Chuanshan Town, Huanjiang County, Guangxi Province has 9 sub-
villages. During evaluation of needs in the PRCDP project, difficult access to
transportation and insufficient or unclean drinking water were the common needs of
villagers in all the sub-villages. While preparing to implement the EATS Project, due to
limited funds available, the villagers' reps of all the sub-villages agreed to take potable
water was the major difficulty to be resolved. After planning by the technician from
the water conservancy department and the villagers, it was initially decided to get 5
sub-villages involved in the potable water project, and the other 4 sub-villages, such as
Lower Baidan, since they have basically solved the problem of access to potable water,
they were not included in the range of pilot project. Thereafter, since it was hoped to
explore experiences for participatory implementation for different types of project
through the EATS Project, i.e., diversity of projects, small-scale road building projects
were implemented in two poor sub-villages. Therefore, there were 7 sub-villages
involved in the project experiment. On the other hand, according to local development
conditions and plans of county government, ** sub-villages of which was listed as sub-
villages to be resettled, and there was no need implement projects locally. Therefore,
eventually, only Lower Baidan Sub-village did not get supports from ITAD for
implementing EATS Project. Even though potable project was jointly decided by
villagers from all the sub-villages, plus the comprehensive results of road construction
and government resettlement plan, the villagers of Lower Baidan Sub-village were
unhappy about such results.

according to farmers' requests and field survey, designed the plan for installing pipes to

                                                                                       245
                                                                             Cases 
let water flow by gravity from the pond, the source of water, to Xiaping Sub-village. In
addition, since the water pipe pass through Upper Baidan Sub-village, whose original
potable water system had been scrapped, there was an outlet left on the potable water
pipe from the water pond to Xiaping Sub-village, so as to give Upper Baidan Sub-village
access to potable water at the same time. The plan was discussed and decided by the
facilitators, technicians, villagers from Xiaping Sub-village and Upper Baidan Sub-
village. Thereafter, they started to procure materials and implement the project.
       
  

                                                                          


   Since the very beginning of implementation, the project was opposed and obstructed
by villagers from Lower Baidan Sub-village. Their reason was that the water pond was
their source of irrigating water, and drawing water will result in insufficient irrigation
for them during the dry season. Their justifiable reason for opposing installation of
potable water pipe was that "They need potable water, but we also need food, too". In
fact, even if in the dry season, the out flowing water was still enough for a 1/3 meter
diameter water pipe. However, the diameter of the Xiaping Potable Water Pipe was only
32mm. That is to say, the water intake was not quite 1% of the total water volume
available, and there would not be much impact on irrigation. The villagers of Lower
Baidan Sub-village also proposed to close the potable water pipe during the dry season,
so as to secure villagers of Lower Baidan Sub-village with irrigation water. That plan
was also considered by the villagers of Lower Baidan Sub-village as being infeasible.
Anyway, they just disagreed to install the potable water pipe from the Upper Baidan
Sub-village to Xiaping Sub-village.
       

  
 
  In order to solve this conflict, facilitator of Chuanshan Town, vice mayor in charge of
the project and party secretary all came to Xiaping Sub-village as lobbyists. They all
hoped the villagers of Lower Baidan Sub-village could bear the overall situation in mind,
compromise and let the potable water pipe be smoothly installed. While doing the lobby,
they were installing the pipe. The project was completed in early July. However, since
the lobby of the Xiaping villagers was not successful, the water pipe was damaged by
the villagers from the Lower Baidan Sub-village only two days after transporting water.
It was repeatedly fixed and damaged, and the potable water project with over 40,000
RMB of investments could not work.
       



                                                                                      246
                                                                            Cases 
   After the conflict happened, the county facilitator and the director of the County
Planning Bureau came to Lower Baidan many times, to mediate the conflicts. They even
proposed to give them some preference in future project. However, the villagers were
still very emotional, and were unwilling to compromise.
       
  



    It was found after further survey that, drawing water for irrigation was only an
excuse. It was actually continuation of conflicts between villagers of the two sub-
villages in the past. The water pond was jointly owned by both sub-villages. After the
water flow out of the pond for about 1 km, there was a naturally formed herringbone
fork, which flew to Lower Baidan Sub-village on the left and to Upper Baidan Sub-village
on the right. They use their own irrigating water and potable water after the
herringbone fork. In the past, the villagers of both sub-villages tried to change the
herringbone fork, so as to divert more water into their own sub-village. They ended up
having many conflicts, even fights. Even though they eventually reached equilibrium, the
villagers from Lower Baidan Sub-village still believed they were screwed, and they were
still upset about it.
       
            


  The villagers of Lower Baidan Sub-village opposed erection of Xiaping ­ Upper Baidan
Potable Water Pipe for the following reasons: Firstly, all the other sub-villages of
Baidan Village had EATS Project, but they did not. Secondly, they were not consulted
beforehand, and their objections were not honoured before the project was
implemented. Thirdly, the water intake was above the herringbone fork, which was
jointly owned by both the Upper and Lower Baidan Sub-villages, which also meant the
Upper Baidan Sub-village would get more water, and they could not tolerate to be
screwed anymore. Fourthly, They did not believe there would be any more projects in
future, or would they be given any preference.





Under such a condition, they requested: since the water pipe started from above the
herringbone fork, it should be split into two branches after it got to the fork, allowing
Lower Baidan Sub-village to get half the water. Or help them erect a potable water pipe


                                                                                     247

of the same diameter, so as to help them get rid of the water pollution problem. In
fact, the original water intake of Lower Baidan Sub-village was below the herringbone
fork, and was close the sub-village It was true that the water source was polluted by
the farmland and animals. Anyway, the villagers believed that the most important point
was to fairly allocate water between the Upper and Lower Baidan Sub-villages. Without
this problem being solved, the potable water project already built will never be
functional. In addition, the conflicts between the Lower Baidan Sub-village, Upper
Baidan Sub-village and Xiaping Sub-village.



Based on the actual situation, the county and township project staffs analyzed and
believed the key was on how to settle the conflicts between the communities by the
project, instead of making it worse. Therefore, after consulting the leaders of the
County Planning Bureau, Township Government and the facilitators, the following
solution was proposed:




  The Planning Bureau would supplement some project funds, help the Lower Baidan
Sub-village solve the problem of access to clean drinking water, and solve the problem
of water allocation between the Upper and Lower Baidan Sub-villages. After consulting
with the farmers in the relevant sub-villages, everybody accepted the plan. The potable
water project was successfully implemented.

I.     Process of Developing a Participatory Learning System
       

 "Participatory Learning and Working Plan for Preliminary Preparation of PRCDP in
Guangxi"
Based on the starting stage implementation plan on development of participatory skills
developed by British ITAD Company, and according to the requirements for preliminary
preparation of the project, Guangxi project system worked out the "Participatory
Learning and Working Plan for Preliminary Preparation of PRCDP in Guangxi." It mainly
clarified the objectives for participatory work at the preliminary preparation stage,
working procedures for applying the participatory approach in feasibility study, training
program, working range and contents for application of participatory approach, major
outputs, working expenses budget, etc.

Training and piloting on participatory planning at two villages in a county
At early 2003, Guangxi PMO and ITAD selected two poverty-stricken communities in
Huanjiang Maonan People's Autonomous County (Baidan Village and Xiatang Village), and
started the training and piloting on PP there. Each of the 6 project counties sent at
least 2 project facilitators to attend the training on participatory approach by piloting,
which served as an example for the 6 project counties to conduct participatory planning
and training.

and selected workers from the county and township PMOs who would participate in
village PP to attend the training (6 people from each county). Secondly, conducted PP
farmer facilitator training course, and trained the village cadres and farmers'
representatives from the project communities that were the first batch of
communities to conduct village-level PP (4 people from each village). Also, the entire
project staff from the provincial (autonomous region) PMOs attended the training, and
the trainee network at the four levels of province, county, township and village took
shape.

PPA and PP at 18 villages in 6 project counties
According to degree of poverty, ethnic minority and pilot demonstration requirements,
each of the 6 project counties selected 3 poor villages, and had the project facilitators
to organize the communities and farmers apply participatory approach to conduct PPA in
the community, and completed 18 PPA reports. On this basis, the project facilitators
and technicians from relevant departments organized the communities and farmers to
analyze the natural resources available in the community, discuss solutions for the
poverty problem, analyze the project conditions and resources available in the
community, propose project plans and work out project plan of the community.

Participatory analysis of needs for education and public health in the community
According to the social content requirements of PRCDP, under the guidance of the
experts from the education and public health department, the 6 project counties
conducted needs assessment for education and public health projects. Using the
participatory approach, 10% of project villages were selected, and the status quo of
education and public health needs were investigated and discussed in the community,
and they finished the needs analysis reports of education and public health projects.

During the course of conducting PPA and PP in pilot villages, the project counties kept
reinforcing the exchanges and discussions between the counties and villages, between
different departments, and between different counties. During this period, the Guangxi
Project System organized 3 workshops, provided the pilot villages of all the project
counties with a platform to exchange PPA and PP, and paid attention to summary and
recommendation. All the project counties, based on completing PPA and PP in three
project villages with the participatory approach, link with county and village ten-year
poverty alleviation development plan and project requirements of World Bank and /
ITAD, promulgated the project plans of the project counties after adequate
discussions between different departments.

During the course of identifying projects, project proposal, discussing plans and
feasibility study, certain degree of community participation in empowerment and direct
participation of poor people was secured, and reflected the poverty alleviation purpose
of decision-making and planning during the course of preliminary project preparation.
PRCDP


Learning and working network by participatory approach preliminary took shape.
Through training of participatory project facilitators in the levels of province
(autonomous region), county, township and village and practices of "piloting ­ summary ­
rolling out" learning and working mode, Guangxi Project System formed a learning and
working network by participatory approach, and gradually developed a system of
experiences and methods for application of participatory approach in the project areas,
and generated a bunch of people familiar with the application of the participatory
approach.

"

Promoted participatory capacity building of the Guangxi Project System
Over the last year, by training on participatory approach and learning by participatory
work practices, the Guangxi Project System enabled the top-down team of project
facilitators to start from being unfamiliar with the application of participatory
approach to being familiar, and from caring little about it to attaching importance to it.
In addition, a group of "indigenous experts" who respect and understand participatory
principles came into being, who have play an important role in promoting the communities
to actively participate, guarantee interests of the poor people, and in effectively
coordinate the departmental works.

Laid a solid foundation for implementation of participatory poverty alleviation
project
Application of the participatory approach is one of the basic requirements for
implementation of PRCDP Project. At the preliminary preparation stage of the project,
Guangxi Project System, by establishing a participatory learning and working system,
continuously summarized the system of participatory approach, improved project
coordinators and participatory capacity of the communities, and laid a solid foundation
for active exploration into effective participatory poverty alleviation mode in the
PRCDP Project.

4.1 Objective of this Chapter 
The Project Development Objective of PRCDP includes the aim to "achieve
sustained participation of the poorest rural people". This means that PRCDP will
fully involve poor people from project villages in the design, implementation,
monitoring and impact assessment of the project. The extent to which villagers
are involved, i.e. participate, in all aspects of the project is critical. A key
performance indicator for the PDO is the "degree of effective participation of
communities... throughout the whole project cycle". This chapter explains what
is meant by "effective participation throughout the project cycle" and proposes
indicators for monitoring participation in PRCDP.

4.2 How do we know we're doing participation well?
    
In PRCDP the focus of participation is on giving voice and choice to the poor
throughout the project cycle and thereby addressing problems of poverty in a
more sustainable and effective way.

4.2.1 Different Modes of Participation 
Going back to the definition of different "Modes of Participation" ( see we can
distinguish between different "modes" of participation in PRCDP:
1""PRCDP""
   o   Consultation: communities are asked for their opinions

       
   o   Collaboration: joint decision-making with communities

       
   o   Empowerment of local communities: communities take the lead in
       planning, implementation and monitoring, a process through which their
       capacities for sustainable development are strengthened.

4.2.2 Minimum standard of participation 
PRCDP will adopt a minimum standard (quality) of participation which is required
to be met in all project communities. The minimum standards for participation
are agreed by WB, DFID and Provincial PMOs and incorporated into the annual
planning. They will specify:

4.2.3 Pilots on "deeper" participation during the implementation
             """"
     phase; """"
During the preparation phase, the three Provinces have developed a clear
understanding on what is possible on participation at a time when planning is still
open and flexible. Also, they have developed a clearly defined approach to
PPA/PP and criteria to monitor the process of participation.




Participation during implementation is expected to develop flexibly within the
PRCDP project management structure and also to vary widely between project
areas, depending on factors such as:
PRCDP

   ·   Local management capacities to support participation.

       
   ·   The degree of flexibility adopted by local project managements to allow for
       more decision-making at the local level.

       
   ·   Capacities of project communities to implement inclusive decision-making.

       
   ·   Aspects of communication, information and access to project communities
       and the level of facilitation given to support participatory processes.

       
   ·   Procedures and requirements on different types of projects (e.g. on
       procurement).

       
It is therefore important to admit that PRCDP will not be able to achieve an even
level of participation throughout all project areas. However, improved or
"deeper" participation should be trialled wherever possible. Those innovative
approaches to participation include:
PRCDP
""
   ·   Giving more responsibilities for decision-making and implementation to
       project communities, e.g. on procurement.

     ·   Piloting innovative approaches to participatory project implementation
         within the different sectoral projects, aiming at increasing community
         capacities through collective action

         
         
Chapter 2.3 includes a number of cases and examples of what "deeper
participation during implementation" could be.

These pilots need to be monitored separately and serve as learning examples for
PRCDP27. The Provinces should keep a clear track of records on pilots where they
feel they have done better on participation. They should develop their own
criteria for monitoring pilots, based on the understanding of different modes of
participation described above. The following table provides guidance on what is
understood as minimum requirements on participation in PRCDP and on "better"
participation which would be trialled in selected project areas.

Experiences with pilots on "better participation" will be assessed by the annual
supervision mission. Aspects to be looked at will include:
""

         Coverage and types of pilots: How many pilots implemented by each
         province? What kind of projects?

         
         Criteria developed to describe and monitor "better participation": What is
         the understanding of participation and how does it develop through the
         course of implementation? How has "improved" participation been
         achieved in pilots?

         ""

         Lessons to be learnt: What is "possible" on participation in PRCDP? How
         can positive approaches be further strengthened and expanded?

The overall M&E system will guide provinces on optimum ways to improve the
way the project is being executed through reflecting on the on-going experiences
and pilots. It is very important that where innovation occurs it is documented
and other parts (townships, sectors, etc) are informed. This monitoring should
also record in what way the participation is `deeper' than the minimum standard,
and what results of this have been.

4.3 How to develop                  indicators        on     participation?
    
Indicators on participation need to be developed by the PMOs, together with
project participants. A minimum set of core indicators needs to be selected by
Provincial PMO staff against which they will regularly report, in phase with WB
supervision missions. Some indicators for measuring participation of poor and
marginal social groups can be selected by communities themselves, in a similar
process to the selection of indicators for measuring project outputs (see Chapter
2.4 PM&E). Indicators for monitoring the participation process should be both
quantitative and qualitative.


5.4

2.4


Quantitative indicators. These are the most commonly used indicators and
there are some which can be used to to measure participation. In some cases,
indicators which are primarily quantitative can act as proxies for qualitative
outcomes. But the qualitative dimension of participation should be explicit
especially since participation of poor and marginal groups is a primary objective
of PRCDP and project success depends on empowering participants to take on
greater degrees of responsibility and control.

Box 20: Quantitative Indicators; 1:
Quantitative indicators are for example, the proportion of women represented in a workshop,
or proportion of people present at a meeting that are women. This indicator does not tell us
about the mode of participation. Women can be present at a meeting or workshop, but still
not participate which means taking an active role, having their voices heard, and being
empowered to take action. Once a set of indicators has been agreed, the next step is to
agree what will equate to the minimum satisfactory quality standard of participation for each
indicator. For example, is women being 33% of people at a meeting satisfactory, or should
the figure be 50%, or even 75%; should those women's assessment of their involvement in
that meeting be satisfactory if the score is 4/10, or should the standard be 6/10?




33%50%75%
4/106/10

Qualitative indicators These are descriptive statements about the process and
outcomes of participation i.e. descriptions of attributes, traits or characteristics
which are not in themselves quantifiable. The appropriateness of such qualitative
dimensions of participation is influenced by cultural norms: thus primary
stakeholders should be responsible for their definition.




Box 21: Qualitative Indicators; 2:
One way to assess the quality of participation would be to ask women to state their
satisfaction with the process. For example, women present at a meeting could be asked if
they felt their opinions were heard and they had a role in the final decision making ­ they
could even be asked to give a score to how well they were involved. Thus Quality
Assessment of Participation might find that 30% of poor women attended a workshop, that
50% of participants were women, but on average women gave a satisfaction rating for the
way in which they were involved in the meeting as only 3/10. Therefore quantitatively, this
might appear satisfactory (half of participants were women), but qualitatively it is not, as
those women felt they were not well involved in the workshop.

4.4 Methods and tools                 for     observing        participation
  

Quantitative indicators of participation quality, such as the proportion of women
attending a village meeting, can be monitored very simply through the records of
village facilitators. These could then be collated into the MIS.

MIS

Qualitative indicators of participation quality, such as how effectively
participatory tools were used, how well people feel they were able to have active
involvement in meetings, how well they think their voice and choices are
reflected in outcomes, etc need to be observed and cross-checked using a range
of methods and tools. These tools are likely to be used as part of a purposive
evaluation, or case study approach.

include:

community level. More specifically this means: Are poor and marginal groups
effectively involved in the implementation of PRCDP throughout all project
phases?

4.7 Assessing the                     Impact           of           Participation
  
To assess the effectiveness of participation, we need to consider three different
levels or dimensions:

      Tools and Methods: Do the tools applied help poor and marginal groups
      to voice their situations and needs and support group communication and
      decision-making?

        
        
      Outputs. Does participation of poor and marginal groups in decision-
      making and implementation lead to better achievement of the project
      objectives, which are improved livelihoods security and sustained
      participation of the poorest rural people in the development process?

        
        
      Long-term outcomes: Does involvement of poor and marginal groups in
      participatory processes during the project develop their capacities for self-
      help, for instance through increased community awareness and
      networking?

4.8 Reporting systems 
Reporting on the indicators assessing the quality of participation will be defined
by the Provinces as part of their M&E system for PRCDP. Documentation on
monitoring and evaluation of participation will be an important part of the
Provinces' internal M&E system and needs to be made available for WB
supervision missions.
PRCDP




Implementation of the Participation Approach (including scope and quality of
participation) will be monitored by supervision missions. The project
management needs to ensure that complete documentation on the participation
approach is maintained by the different levels involved.

5.1 Introduction: Purpose of this Annex
    
This annex provides an Outline for a "Learning System" in PRCDP.
During the preparation phase, initial experiences on participation have
been generated which informed the drafting of this Participation Manual. It
is important to understand that this manual can only be a starting point
for developing the participation approach within PRCDP and that "learning"
on participation will be a long-term task that needs to be sustained during
project implementation and even beyond. It is also important to note that
"learning" on participation is not confined to delivering formal training
only, but needs to be understood as part of a wider approach to building
awareness and capacities31.

The outline of a learning system integrates different components related
to managing, implementing and monitoring participatory projects in order
to


      Maintain and maximise use of information and lessons available on
      participation                     within                      the

      between                   the                   components
      

      And through this ultimately building up experienced-based
      knowledge within PRCDP which will be used for improved project
      planning                                                  and
      implementation.PRCDP
      


Training on participation is an integral part of the learning system and
an essential base for implementing the participation approach according to
the principles and quality criteria described in this Manual. During the


                                   282
                        Introduction: Purpose of this Annex


preparation phase, the project has developed an appropriate methodology
on participation and has trained a promising cadre of facilitators to carry
out pilots on participatory project implementation. The major challenge
during the roll-out phase will be to overcome the initial bottleneck of
limited staff and experiences and to improve and extend awareness and
skills among the wider project staff.








Therefore, it will be crucial for the Provinces to design and implement an
appropriate training approach which will support a high-level of
participation within this project. In this context it is important to note that
training on participation has its distinct features and principles which differ
from conventional forms of training. The part "Training on Participation in
PRCDP" provides further guidance and suggestions on how appropriate
training should be planned and implemented.

    PRCDP  

5.2.1 What is a learning system?
A learning system means institutionalising learning processes and
sustaining them as part of the organisation development. The idea is to
transform PRCDP into a learning system where the continuous testing of
experiences will be converted into knowledge that will be accessible to the
whole project, and through this support its project goal of participatory
project alleviation.

This annex has distinguished between a training system and a learning
system. The following box highlights some of the differences between
learning and training:

5.2.2 Purpose of the learning system
The purpose of the learning system is to build experience-based
knowledge and capacities within PRCDP which will enable and improve the
innovative approach to participatory poverty alleviation. Therefore the
learning system aims to:

PRCDP


Build institutional capacities on participation within         the   project
through                       

      Change of roles and responsibilities

      Change of management and organisation

      Change of ideas and guiding principles


Strengthen individual capabilities among facilitators and project staff
through introducing new:

      Skills and capabilities

      Attitudes and beliefs

      Awareness and sensibilities


Increase knowledge on participation within the organisations which can
be used for roll-out and improving ongoing projects and possibly even
beyond that project's lifetime, especially on




      Ideas, methods and tools for participation at the community
      level

      Methods     and tools                  to       train          qualified
      facilitators

      Ways to increase awareness on and support given to participation
      within institutions


To achieve this, the learning system needs to focus at two levels:



      The organisations implementing PRCDP need to create an work
      environment that encourages and supports its staff to practice
      continued                                            reflective
      learningPRCDP     
      

      Individual staff working on PRCDP need to develop the habit of
      being                                                reflective
      learnersPRCDP             



5.2.3 Learning Principles
Learning takes place in cyclical processes which iterate between action
and reflection. Learning means to reflect on previous experiences and use
them for improved action in the future. PRCDP will need to develop its
mechanisms for reflection on existing experiences and feedback into
action for an improved project performance based on the following
principles.




                                    286
                                  Outline of a Learning System



PRCDP




Emphasis on action and practice


Practical application and field-based experience is at the heart of learning
on participation. Practice of methods and tools during training and
exchange of experiences among practitioners will help the project to
develop its understanding and learning of how participation could work
and how it could contribute to better projects. Training manuals and
theoretical literature on participation can only provide some generic ideas
and guidance as a starting point; facilitators and project staff need to
apply in practice what they have read and learnt in the classroom to
understand the dynamics and implications of participatory communication
practices and processes, to get a feeling of how different stakeholders
think, act and work in a project, to practically test and experience
methods of facilitating stakeholder communication and decision-making
and to develop their own role in support of such processes accordingly.









Lessons from the field are also a powerful means to convince
management staff and decision-makers. To make its practical experiences
available for a wider audience, PRCDP will need to maintain a
comprehensive       documentation     of   field-based  materials.   The
documentation should not only include formal project reports, but also
first-hand documents, like visual material (pictures, videos), cases and
stories from facilitators and villagers. There should be an emphasis on
documenting project processes ­ how things are done.

                                  Outline of a Learning System

Finally, emphasis on action and practice means that the knowledge and
experiences of practitioners and communities is valued as an asset for
PRCDP on which future thinking and action needs to build on. The
Participation Manual (Chapter 2.5.) describes the approach to
participatory monitoring and evaluation, and it will be essential for the
project to gain regular feedback from local facilitators and communities to
understand their views on the project.

PRCDP





Ongoing reflection and sharing on practical experiences




Ongoing reflection is important to deepen the existing knowledge, to draw
conclusions from practice and to share working experiences. Reflection
means to look into assumptions and pattern of behaviour, to analyse
failures and successes and from that to abstract further insights and
conclusions. Reflection can be done best in like-minded groups that share
a common background.







Ongoing reflection can and should be something that individuals do. The
target is to develop staff to become reflective participation practitioners,
who have the habit of reflecting on the participatory aspects of what they
are doing in their work while they are actually doing that work. This
thoughtful approach to work is an individual attribute that PRCDP should
encourage in its staff. This continual learning develops individuals
knowledge.



PRCDP



In addition to personal reflection there is a need for staff to come together
to reflect and learn in groups. PRCDP needs to create platforms and


                                    288
                                  Outline of a Learning System

forums that create systems and opportunities for reflection and sharing
among facilitators and management staff, so that they can come together
to analyse achievements and shortcomings of the participatory approach.
Regular workshops, meetings and networked communication among
practitioners will help them to deepen their knowledge and improve their
skills on participation. In addition, strategic reflection and sharing events
involving senior project staff and decision maker will help to disseminate
the message of participation and change mindsets on how projects should
be done.

PRCDP








Although the project has gained some experience on how to use reflection
and sharing workshops for building capacities among its staff, it will
remain a challenge to transform the habits of a conventional meeting into
a fruitful event where participants are enabled and empowered to develop
their reflective thinking and embark on a joint process of productive
communication and cooperation. Tools for participatory workshop
facilitation, like small group discussions, visualisations, presentations and
brainstorming are further explained in Chapter 4 of this Annex.







Draw lessons for the future and incorporate them into further
planning




Based on the reflection and sharing, lessons for the future can be drawn.
It will be important to establish mechanisms for using field-based
experiences and reflective learning for planning and further action both
ways:




                                    289
                                  Outline of a Learning System






      to take care that practical experiences are sufficiently documented,
      shared              and              communicated               and
      

      to ensure that project planning and implementation is soundly
      based on the continuous feedback, insights and reflections of those
      who               already               have                gained
      experiences.
      


It is important for PRCDP that it is not possible to design a "perfect"
methodology for participation in the beginning and to provide facilitators
with a complete set of knowledge in one-off training before the project
commences. Thus the actual lessons from implementation will be crucial
for further developing and refining the participatory approach. Thus if
PRCDP can become a `learning project' it is likely to develop an adaptive
and thus highly appropriate participatory methodology, and also a more
sustainable approach to developing and transferring knowledge. This also
means that planning of the roll-out of participation, capacity building and
field-level projects needs to be adjusted in a continuous way to
incorporate the lessons gained during the previous phase.

Implement further action




What the previous sections explain is that learning is not a single cycle of
train ­ do ­ reflect. There needs to be a series of learning loops ­ after
reflection, lessons should be taken forward into further action.
Implementation of the participation approach is supposed to improve after
each learning loop: after the project has assessed previous shortcomings

way.                           --------

5.2.4 Components of the Learning System


A learning system utilises lessons drawn from a number of project
activities. The main element are:





The M&E system&

Part of the overall M&E system for PRCDP is M&E of participation. This
means ongoing review of practical experiences with participation and
feedback of these experiences through different tiers of project
management and implementation.

&PRCDP&



      PM&E: Feedback from Project Communities on implementation
      process, used by project management to improve planning and
      implementation.  PM&E    also   includes   self-monitoring by
      communities in relation to their participation in the project
      processes.&
      &
      

      (Internal) M&E of participation by project management: Monitoring
      implementation of participation approach, quality control, and
      reviewing experiences with participation; assessing lessons from
      pilot
      projects.&
      
      

      (external) M&E: reviewing by WB and DFID of the participation
      process and capacity-building on participation, extracting lessons
      and feeding back recommendations to project management.

      &
      
      



Internal sharing and networking


Internal sharing and networking will support experience-based learning on
participation among actors who share similar roles and perspectives in
project implementation (like communities, facilitators and project
management staff). The type of activities which should be promoted
include:






      Community-wide sharing of experiences on participatory project
      planning, implementation and monitoring as part of the PM&E
      exercise
      &

      Ongoing exchange of experiences, reflection on methodology for
      participation among township facilitators (local facilitators
      network)
      

      Sharing      among project                       counties         on
      participation



Pilots on participatory poverty alleviation


Pilots on participatory poverty alleviation will help project staff to gain
new insights and experiences on participation as part of their ongoing
learning. The pilots are understood as a strategic vehicle for maintaining
innovativeness and learning within PRCDP.


PRCDP

      Pilot projects on participatory project implementation: small (pre-)
      projects to generate experiences and to prepare communities for
      project implementation. Pilots are useful for developing experience

Formal training


      PRCDP will deliver a wide range of training as part of its capacity-
      building component. The training will be on technical topics
      (agriculture etc), on project management and community
      participation. Chapter 3 of this manual provides ideas and guidance
      on how training on participation should be designed and delivered
      in PRCDP, as part of capacity building. The training system for
      PRCDP            is          further        detailed         below.

5.2.5 Indicators on the learning system
The learning system itself will need to be monitored, to assess whether it
is achieving its aims, and so that it too can be modified if parts are not
succeeding as planned.




Monitoring and evaluation of the learning system should consider whether
the system is succeeding according to a set of input, output and outcome
indicators. These indicators set the standards or quality measures that
should be achieved by the learning system.

5.3.1 Important    principles of                        training         on
      participation
The training in PRCDP is designed to train staff in PMOs and other
agencies involved in PRCDP, plus village level facilitators. The training
needs to be tailored to fit the way that this group of people learns new
things. Fundamental to this is the need to recognise that adult learning is
different   from    children's     education    because     adults     are:
PRCDPPMOPRCDP



      problem centred - they need to know why they are learning
      something  ­ 

      goal oriented

      practical and problem-solvers 

      and very importantly for PRCDP, they have accumulated life
      experiences PRCDP

In practical training terms, this means that "instruction for adults needs to
focus more on the process and less on the content being taught.
Strategies such as case studies, role playing, simulations, and self-
evaluations are most useful. Instructors adopt a role of facilitator or
resource rather than lecturer or grader"34.

"

The principles of Adult Learning Theory should be applied in the training
carried out in PRCDP, summarised as follows:

 ·   Maximising participant involvement during training, through
     use of participatory training techniques35, and participant evaluation

     outcomes.4                                             
     
 ·   Using small learning groups, to allow all participants to take part
     in discussions; to promote teamwork and allow participants to play a
     variety of team roles; to encourage collaboration; and to emphasise

     learning concerns exchange of knowledge in an environment where
     life-experiences are valued; this is distinct from children's education
     which is more like the transfer of knowledge from expert teachers to
     inexperienced
     pupils.
     
     
     ----
 ·   Using participants' experience as a resource, both as a
     motivator to demonstrate the practicality and relevance of the
     training event, and as a means of drawing on the learning
     opportunities that `real-life' perspectives bring to the training arena.
     This has already demonstrated to great effect already in the `pilots' in
     PRCDP. This needs to be a core part of the training.

 ·   Encouraging and supporting learning, by cultivating self-direction
     in participants to build their self-esteem, by challenging learners to
     acquire new perspectives, and supporting them in their efforts to do
     so. This principle involves organizations empowering individuals to
     take control of their own professional development.     ,
     
     
     



5.3.2 Defining a suitable training approach
"Cascade Training" is the common approach to training in China. It is a
relative cheap way of rolling-out a training program among a big number
of participants.







                                     297

Box 23: Cascade Training Approach 1
 "Cascade training" is a pyramid training system whereby a small number of senior
staff learn about the subject from acknowledged experts. This training is then
cascaded down to their subordinates, who in turn train their juniors, and so on
(Figure 1). This diagram illustrates the ideal situation where at each tier the learning
is applied and reflected upon before being taught down to the next level. There is
also a system of monitoring that the learning is being properly applied.

/

Next level of hierarchy
                               Learn       Apply                       Check

Done in this way, cascade training can be a cost effective method of disseminating
learning from a small pool of expertise to a wide base of field-level practitioners
because of its fast multiplication. It also has the advantage, when done in this way, to
be action-based, i.e. the learning is put into practice at each level and then trained
down with the benefit of experience. However, its biggest weakness lies the very
concept of cascading because at each multiplication level the learning is inevitably
diluted, even with the best trainers manuals and guidelines in place. The additional
problem with this approach is that the training content is not well tailored to the
different levels of staff, and the same training style tends to be perpetuated down the
cascade.

                                            Training on Participation

Also, often the cascade skips the "application" stage, because of time and cost
constraints. This means at each layer the trainers are just giving the theory to the
next level down, without the benefit of themselves having tried the ideas out in
practice and reflected on that experience. The cascade then becomes entirely
devalued, as the system is one of learn-teach, learn-teach down each tier, with only
the lowest tier applying the learning, in a very diluted form (Figure 2).

To overcome the common problems of cascade training, the training
system should include the following features:



  ·   Training tailored and targeted for each level
      separately

  ·   A strong learning-by-doing approach

  ·   Link of training system to M&E system, so that the training quality is
      monitored&

5.3.3 Designing a training strategy
The purpose of the training strategy is to outline the programme that
needs to be put in place in order to develop a cadre of capable
participatory practitioners. The training should ensure that knowledge of
participatory project cycle management is translated into improved
operational practice in RPCDP.


PRCDP


The strategy needs the following five main elements:



 ·   Training needs assessment ­ to identify the training needs that
     address the needs of PRCDP for staff at different levels with certain
     knowledge and skills, as well as individual needs.----
     PRCDP
     

 ·   Training of trainers ­ to ensure that there is a group of trainers
     with knowledge of participation and modern training
     skills.----

 ·   Planning, design and development of training ­ to identify who
     will be trained, when, where, and how; to identify properly trained
     trainers; to agree learning objectives, select the training methods to
     be used for each type of trainee; and to develop effective training
     materials.  ----
     
     

 ·   Training delivery ­ to specify the style in which the training is
     given. According to the training principles, this should concentrate on
     training in small groups, using practical experiences as the key
     resource; it should avoid training that is essentially classroom
     teaching to large groups. The trainers are facilitators, not
     teachers. ----
     
     

 ·   Evaluation ­ to measure training programme performance and
     impact, and to identify areas for continuing improvement in training
     design and delivery.----

5.3.4 Developing a training system
The following main groups of trainees are identified:


 ·   Leaders

 ·   Trainers

 ·   Facilitators at township and county levels 

 ·   Facilitators at village level


Each of these groups has different training needs, and the training
content and delivery style should be adapted to the specific groups.
This approach to training differs from the common `cascade training'
approach, where the same material is trained to each level of officer in the
same way in a cascade (see Box 23:).

For each group the training system specifies the type of content in their
training, the delivery mechanism and the expected learning outcome from
the training. This is presented in a Training Matrix (Table 10.).

1 

At each level, the training content should be structured around five key
areas: 


 ·   Understanding what real participation
     means

 ·   Participatory techniques (how to use
     them)

 ·   Enabling participation (i.e. providing space, being responsive,
     inclusive etc) 

 ·   Issues in ensuring the quality of the participatory
     approach

 ·   Issues of mainstreaming participation throughout

The balance, depth and style of training will be customised at each levels
according to need and the most effective delivery for each group. Thus
village facilitators need training to build confidence in their ability to
engage groups of villagers and facilitate processes with them. A large
amount of the training system is directed at the two groups in the
facilitation cadre. This is very important, as only through developing a
capable body of facilitators can the costs of participation be meaningfully
reduced. This level of trainees needs training in both facilitation skills and
in participatory techniques.

PP and PI in participatory poverty alleviation projects is not only a highly
operational issue, but also a process of handling all sorts of complications. It is
highly operational, firstly because, whatever procedures and methods you use at
the planning stage, either complicated or simply, and whatever theory you use as
a guide, you eventually need to output a realistic, implementable poverty
alleviation plan. Secondly because at the implementation stage, no matter what
organizational means you adopt to allocate resources and tasks, you eventually
have to make the project achieve the expected effects, and realize equitable
benefits for all. Therefore, during the entire PP and PI, it is inevitable to handle
all sorts of complications, and balance different stakes of different groups. We
may say that, even though village-level poverty alleviation projects involve small
investments, to achieve operatability, suitability and equity, it is highly
demanding for the managerial and technical skills of PP and PI. It is an important
way for guaranteeing operatability and equity of village-level poverty-alleviation
projects to promote farmers to directly participate in planning and
implementation. Therefore, during the entire PP and PI process, it is particularly
important to properly adopt PRA tools and relevant facilitating skills to promote
participation.

When we apply PRA tools and relevant facilitating skills, there are two very
important key concepts.

The first concept is "facilitation", which means that the outsiders, including
technicians and managers, for the villagers, they are project facilitators instead
of owners, and their role is to assist the villagers, but not replace the villagers,
or control the villagers. The villagers are the subjects of village-level poverty
alleviation. However, due to the long history of incomplete access to information,
low education level, the villagers lagged behind in knowledge and command of new
technologies, and do not have access to inaccurate information. They are often
not confident enough, and prefer to let the outsiders make decisions for them.
It is particularly true when the outsiders are modest, and truly helpful to them,
the villagers would easily volunteer to hand over their decision-making rights to
the outsiders based on trust. Under such a circumstance, the facilitators must
be very clear-minded that they should assist and suggest the villagers to make
good decisions, but not substitute them. Facilitation will benefit them
permanently, and substitution will only benefit this time. Therefore, when we
facilitate the villagers, we must be aware that we are not only returning them
their decision-making rights, but also returning them the opportunity of
decision-making practices, and we are assisting them to eventually make
effective decisions by themselves.




                                                                                311
 Tool Two: Resources and Farmers Distribution Map


The second concept is, the tools serve the purpose. PRA tools are not the
purposes, and none of the participatory facilitation tools or skills are for
generating a beautiful diagram, or a pretty table. Application of all the
facilitating skills and facilitation tools are for achieving the following purposes:
         Guarantee the villagers with access to complete information, and
         constitute complete information basis for participation in decision-
         making.
         Establish communication platforms for the villagers, and enable the
         villagers to participate in decision-making based on meditation,
         reflection and analysis.
         Guarantee the mechanism for participation in decision-making, and
         enable the villagers to realize their rights of participating in decision-
         making by certain procedures and methods.
         Foster participatory skills, and enable the villagers to improve their
         decision-making capacities by participation in decision-making practices
         once and once again.

Since the application of facilitation skills and PRA tools is targeted at the
ultimate purposes of the villager-level poverty-alleviation projects, during the
course of facilitation, the facilitation skills and PRA tools are not fixed. The
facilitators can creatively apply different materials and means, draw on local
resources, and make do with whatever is available. The purposes are relatively
fixed, but the tools can be very flexible36.
The PRA tools and facilitating skills described in this annex are assembled
according to the facilitating needs and contents at different stages of PP and
PI. Each tool is explained with its purpose of use, operation methods, and key
precautions during the course of application.

Tool One: Joint Walk
Purposes:
1. Inquire about the distribution, quantity and quality of such natural resources
   as land and forests. In addition, inquire about such infrastructures as roads
   and water ditches.
2. Have an objective understanding about the problems relevant to natural
   resources and status of infrastructure in the community.
3. It is a good way to communicate with the villagers, talking while walking, and
   discuss about the problems and difficulties on site, which is easy to establish
   good communication relationship with the villagers, and lay a solid foundation
   for further deeper investigations in future.
4. By observing what you have seen, it is easy to bring relevant information into
   discussion, and purposely develop some subjects that need to be probed into
   seriously.

Operational methods and steps:
1. Select the village cadres and the key informants from the village, and explain
   to them that you need to inquire about the status of natural resources,
   problems and difficulties;
2. Select the walking route together with the villagers, trying to walking
   through the cross section, seeing different types of lands, such as irrigated
   fields, non-irrigated lands, grasslands, water surfaces, etc, including
   unutilized lands, and inquire about the problems and development potentials;
3. Except walking through cross section to have comprehensive inquiry, it is also
   okay to conduct field survey to key sections of great concern for the
   villagers, such as headwaters land, and aforestable land.
4. After walking, you may draw a sketch map to show all the types of lands you
   walked through, and mark the purposes of the land types, and the problems.

Precautions and problems to be handled:
1. While inviting the local village cadres or villagers to take a walk together,
   the number of 3 ­ 5 people would be appropriate. With fewer people around,
   you may only be able to see and hear some places and problems of special
   concern to some particular individuals. With too many people around, it would
   be unfavorable for communication;
2. Try your best to select a cross section that you can see different types of
   resources lands, so as to understand the conditions in an overall manner;
3. While walking, you should pay attention to observe all sorts of indicator
   articles. For example, whether the varieties of crops are improved, the
   possibility of rolling out new varieties, the color of rivers and the
   relationship with forest coverage, etc.
4. During the course of walking, try your best to discuss the problems on site.


                                                                              315
 Tool Two: Resources and Farmers Distribution Map


   For example, when you walk to a woodland, discuss about the characteristics
   and problems in utilization and management of forests;
5. During the course of walking and discussing with the villagers, you should
   hear the opinions of the less talkative people, and encourage them to
   participate in discussion;
6. The cross section map and key points of discussion during the course of joint
   walking should be marked on a large piece of paper, which can be the start of
   semi-structured interviews, and it would be easy to find topics to have in-
   depth discussion with the villagers.

Tool Two: Resources and Farmers Distribution Map
Purposes:
1. Inquire about the macro distribution of community resources or certain
   important resources;
2. By discussing the resources map, jointly analyze with the villagers the
   difficulties, problems and possible solutions in utilizing the resources;
3. Mark how each household is located in the entire village, and serve as the
   tool and working base map for classifying the poor households;
4. Mark the location of the community organizations, and such networks as
   rivers, roads, and irrigation ditches, to serve as basis for the plan in the
   next step. For example, you can discuss how to lay out the potable water
   pipes and water ponds on the map, so that more poverty households can
   benefit.

Operating methods and steps:

1. Select a few people who are familiar with the situation of entire village for
   discussion together, and the makers can be village cadres or villagers;
2. Tell them clearly that they should map the basics of the entire village on a
   large piece of paper. The mapping should start from the places that they are
   most familiar with, and first map the things familiar to everybody and easy
   to position, such as rivers, roads, wells, etc., and gradually supplement with
   such natural resources as land and forests, and then such buildings as
   farmers' houses, schools, and Village Office;
3. After the mapping is basically complete, mark the locally established legends
   and direction of the map;
4. While the villagers are mapping, the facilitator will focus discussion on issues
   related to the resources map.

Precautions and problems to be handled:

1. If the villagers are not accustomed to mapping on the paper in the beginning,
   you may ask them to willfully map on the floor, and transfer what they
   mapped on the floor to the large piece of paper. Or the project facilitator
   may, according to the speeches of the villagers, map a few information on
   the paper as an example, and then hand over the pen to the villager, and let
   him (her) continue mapping;
2. You should explain the concept of "resources" clearly to the villagers. To put
   it simply, everything "useful" to the farmers in the village are "resources",
   and ask them to map all the useful things on the paper;
3. If the conditions of resources and social facilities are complicated, you may
   draw them on different maps. For example, on the land utilization
   distribution map, you only draw the contents relevant to distribution of land,


                                                                               319
 Tool Two: Resources and Farmers Distribution Map


   and mark with such relevant information as what lands are mainly planted
   with what crops, etc. On another map, you may draw all kinds of buildings,
   and mark with such information as which household is poor household, etc.;
4. You should try your best to let the farmers draw the legends or marks on
   the map, so that it will be easier for them to understand and discuss,
   however, it is necessary to note what each symbol represent. In addition, you
   should be careful that, before mapping, do not finalize the direction in
   advance. Instead, you should allow the farmers to finish drawing the map,
   and then mark the direction accordingly. If you finalize the direction
   beforehand, it is quite possible that the directions in the minds of the
   farmers are different from our customary direction of "upper north, down
   south", which may cause confusion in directions on the map.

Tool Three: Semi-structured Interview
Purposes:

1. Make up and improve the information that cannot possibly be obtained from
   statistics;
2. Inquire in depth the issues of common interests to the facilitator and the
   farmers.

Operating methods and steps:

1. Semi-structured interview is a way to get information from interviewees
   directly, which can either be used in individual interviews, or group
   interviews;
2. According to different purposes, select different interviewees. For example,
   if you want to know the common, general conditions of the entire village, your
   interviewees should be the village cadres and some key informants. If you
   want to know the causes of poverty, you should pick poor households as the
   interviewees. If you want to know the possible ways to shake off poverty,
   you should pick relatively better educated farmers as the interviewees;
3. Based on the purpose of investigation, determine the subject for interview
   accordingly. For example, if the purpose of investigation is to know how well
   the farmers command the production technologies, and find out ways to
   improve the farmers' production technologies accordingly, then you should
   take "command of production skills by the farmers" as the subject of
   interviews;
4. According to interview subjects and relevant factors, come up with
   secondary subjects. For example, under the aforementioned subject, you may
   come up with the following secondary subjects (refer to Case 1).

   Case 1: Subjects, Secondary Subjects and Major Questions for Semi-
                          structured Interviews

Subject: Command of Production Skills by the Farmers

Secondary subject:
1. Production skills in plantation;
2. Production skills in animal husbandry;
3. Production skills in forestry and fruits;
4. Production skills in processing industry;
5. Other production skills.

Centering on secondary subjects, you may use several assistants to extensively


                                                                             325
                     Tool Three: Semi-structured Interview


ask questions, and profoundly inquire into the complete situation. For example, if
the farmers of the village are concerned about growing seedlings with nutritive
bags, you may ask the following questions:

1. Why they wish to command the technology of growing seedling with nutritive
    bags (why);
2. Which lands are suitable for planting with nutritive bags (where);
3. Who in the village command this technology (who);
4. From which channel did they learn the technology (which);
5. Who come to extend and teach this technology (who);
6. How did they train or teach that technology;
7. Who in the family participate in the training (whom);
8. During the actual plantation, who in the family did this job? If there is
    division of labor, who is responsible for what?
9. If you have technical difficult, whom are you going to ask?
10. Why didn't you use nutritive bags to grow seedlings?

Etc.

Precautions and problems to be handled:

1. The interview process is a process to understand the farmers, and learn
   from the farmers, but not a process of "guiding" and educating the farmers.
   What you wish to know is how the farmers think, but not how the farmers
   should think. Therefore, the attitudes and behaviors of facilitator to the
   farmers should be earnestly understand and excavate, and ask questions like
   a student asking the teachers, but not lecturing the farmers like parents
   disciplining children;
2. The selection of time and venue for interviews should be convenient for the
   farmers, but not the interviewers;
3. Before the interview, you should explain to the farmers the purposes and
   intentions of the interview. This is not only respect to the farmers, but also
   can inspire their interests to talk with you. It will also prevent the farmers
   from having unrealistic expectations or guesses;
4. During the course of interviews, when the farmers are answering the
   questions, they are very likely influenced by their own guesses and
   understandings about the purposes of your interviews, and easily please you
   based on their own understanding, trying to avoid "mistakes", which might
   jeopardize the interests of themselves or the village. Therefore, when the
   farmers hesitate in answering the questions, being vague or avoid answers,
   you should be careful of why is it, and repeat the purpose of the interview,
   and all the conditions that may be possibly involved in future when necessary.
   Your should try to eliminate their worries, and do not promise the farmers


                                                                              326
                        Tool Three: Semi-structured Interview


      with any benefits, as the focus of farmers who avoid answering questions are
      on gains, instead of the objective facts of the question;
5.    Start from simple topics acceptable to the farmers, such as the weather and
      yields of this year, etc.;
6.    The interview process should be somehow systematic, and once you find the
      starting question, you should interview one by one, following logic sequence.
      The omitted questions should be made up after the interview subjects or
      secondary subjects come to the end of a stage. You should avoid beating
      about the bush, and leap from this question to that, or the farmers' train of
      thoughts may be repeatedly interrupted, and can hardly answer your
      questions. If several interviewers conducted the interviews together, you
      should not willfully interrupt other people's interview, which may destroy the
      integrity and logic of the interview. If you have any supplementary questions,
      first take notes on your notebook, and make a visible mark, and supplement
      the question when it come to the end of a stage. When the person asking the
      questions is done with the interview, he (she should ask the partners if they
      have any more questions to ask, and also ask if the farmers have any
      questions for the interviewers;
7.    When you interview informant in a household, it does not necessarily has to
      be the head of the household. For example, if you want to know the process
      and method of raising pigs, it may be more fruitful to interview the wife than
      the husband. This is because it is normally the job of the women to raise pigs
      in a family;
8.    You should encourage the farmers to actively answer the questions, but avoid
      scolding or criticizing the behaviors of the farmers. Even if they are
      unwilling to answer or do not give the true answers, you should also make
      other investigations to prove the genuineness of the farmers' answers,
      instead of criticizing them directly;
9.    The questions you ask should be simple, and you may divide a complicated
      question into several simple, small questions. For example, instead of asking
      "what are the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid pigs and local pigs",
      you should ask, "What are the advantages of raising hybrid pigs? What are
      the disadvantages? What are the advantages of raising local pigs? What are
      the4 disadvantages?"
10.   You should not ask inductive questions. An inductive question means that you
      give the answer to the question, and the farmers have to agree to your
      answer. For example, "Your household grows flue-cured tobacco, because it
      brings high economic returns, right? Since you have already made a judgment
      that growing flue-cured tobacco brings high economic returns, even if the
      farmers believe the returns are low, they have to agree with you, as they do
      not want to make you lose face. For such inductive questions, the farmers
      may answer "yes" to please you, but the truth may be that they grow flue-
      cured tobacco because it was ordered by the higher authorities, or it may be


                                                                                327
                        Tool Three: Semi-structured Interview


      truly because it brings high economic returns;
11.   You should not ask concealed questions. A concealed question refers to a
      question that has already been given a few limited answers, and the farmers
      can only select one from them. For example, "Did you buy fertilizers from
      the township or the county seat", but actually, the fertilizers may be
      delivered to the door by suppliers. Therefore, the right question to ask
      should be, "Where did you buy your fertilizers?" When the range of choices
      have covered all the possibilities, you may also ask concealed questions, such
      as "Are there more men or more women participated in the training?"
12.   Semi-structured interviews may be used in group interviews, for example,
      issues of concern for everybody at the community level, such as management
      of collectively owned woodland in a certain village. It may also be used in
      individual interviews with farmers, for example, you may interview different
      farmers about the same topic, and find out the generalities and differences
      in the production and life of the farmers;
13.   When you are interviewing a farmer, particularly a poor person, someone may
      answer the question for the poor. When you encounter such a circumstance,
      you may take the following method: Tell the interrupter that you wish to
      hear the own view of the poor, and ask him not to answer or explain instead.
      If he still kept interrupting with answer or explanation, you may ask a person
      to specially interview him. In addition, the other people may interview the
      poverty households at other locations.
14.   For some vague answers or if there were lengthy discussion during the
      course of answer, the interviewer should repeat the key points he grasped,
      and confirm that there is no misunderstanding, and all the focal points are
      there.

Tool Four: Discussion Meeting
Purposes:
1. Discuss and analyze the criteria for division of poverty households;
2. Inquire about the views of different stakeholders about different problems
   and difficulties;
3. By analysis and discussion, find out solutions and methods, and reach common
   grounds;
4. Jointly coordinate for solving problems or some management methods during
   the course of implementing the project.

Operating methods and steps:
1. Discussion meeting is a way for the farmers to extensively participate,
   however, the purposes of the discussion meeting are different, and the
   participants selected for the discussion are also different. For example,
   while finalizing the criteria for division of poverty households, people
   normally take natural villages (sub-villages) as the unit, and all the farmers
   should participate. However, while discussing about the problems and
   difficulties of greatest concern for the poverty households, the discussion
   participants should be the poverty households. Therefore, the first step of
   convening a discussion meeting should be selecting the right people to
   participate in discussion;
2. The facilitator should clearly explain to the discussion participants the
   purposes and subjects of discussion for the meeting;
3. The facilitator should encourage the participants to launch their own
   opinions and suggestions on the topics under discussion. The facilitator
   should play a guiding role in the course of discussion, and avoid diversion
   from the topic. However, he should also be "impartial", and avoid directly
   supporting certain viewpoints. The key is to promote the farmers to reach
   common grounds;
4. The facilitator should take note of the farmers' discussion results, edit
   them, summarize the discussion results, promptly feed back to the farmers,
   and prove if the summary truly reflected the discussion results of the
   farmers. If there are any disagreements, it is necessary to make up or make
   adjustments.
5. Once the discussion results are published, enough time should be spared for
   the villagers to feed back the opinions. The facilitators should absorb
   opinions of different stakeholders.

Precautions and problems to be handled:

The following problems are the often encountered in the discussion meetings
organized:


                                                                             334
                                    Tool Four: Discussion Meeting



1. Few people participated.

There are mainly three reasons for such a problem: Firstly, the farmers are not
clear about the purpose of attending the meeting; Secondly, the subject being
discussed does not have much to do with the farmers participating in the
discussion, or they are not interested; Thirdly, the discussion meeting is
inconvenient for the farmers in the arrangement of time and venue. Accordingly,
the solutions are: Firstly, before organizing the discussion meeting, make a clear
publicity to the farmers about the purposes and subjects to be discussed on the
meeting. Secondly, while selecting meeting attendants, you should select the
people directly related to the subjects to be discussed. For example, when a
certain village is discussing implementation of potable water project and labor
input of farmers, you should call all the villagers in the entire village to attend
the meeting. However, the beneficiaries of the said project only involve two sub-
villages of the said village, the villagers' representatives from other sub-villages
may believe that the meeting has nothing to do with them, and do not attend the
meeting. Thirdly, the time and venue of the meeting should consider the actual
situations of the farmers, and avoid holding discussion meetings on busy farming
time or street market days. While selecting venues, you should also consider
whether it is convenient for the farmers to attend. For example, it is a general
practice to hold the meeting in the homes of village cadres or "well-to-do
families" with larger houses. However, if you call the poverty households for a
discussion meeting, such places would easily impose psychological pressure on
them, and they often choose not to attend such meetings.

2. The meeting attendants do not talk, or discussion can hardly go in
   depth.

Due to different characters, social status, economic status, and opportunities to
participate in public affairs, as well as influences of traditional culture, some
villagers are unwilling to launch opinions in public. This is especially true for
women and poverty households, which is very universal, but their opinions are
very important for PP and PI. Therefore, the facilitator needs to encourage
them to participate and express their opinions. Firstly, you should create
appropriate air for communication, ease their tense and uncomfortable minds,
and feel relaxed, so that they can possibly participate in launching opinions.
Secondly, it is often complicated for discussions cannot go in depth, and the
farmers can hardly find the right point right off hand. Actually, it is a
progressive process for the farmers to discuss about something, and it is
necessary to segregate the discussion subject into a series of minor questions,
and gradually go deeper into discussion. For example, if we directly discuss the
subject of "how to organize implementation of potable water project and


                                                                                335
                                  Tool Four: Discussion Meeting


sustainable management", it would be very hard for the farmers to discuss, or
they may beat about the bush, and can hardly come up with anything complete.
The farmers need to divide this subject into several questions, to facilitate the
discussion. These questions include:
    (1) While implementing the potable water project, who in the village will
         come to organize the management? It is necessary to elect?
    (2) Which projects are the managerial people mainly responsible for?
    (3) During the course of implementation, what are the jobs of the farmers?
    (4) How is labor inputs distributed?
    (5) Who purchase the materials?
    (6) Who is responsible for management of financial expenses? Who is in
         charge of money? Who is in charge of accounts?
    (7) Who is responsible for quality control in the implementation process?
    (8) How is labor inputs and expenditures published to the farmers? By
         whom?
    (9) Once the project is complete, who will be responsible for daily routine
         maintenance and management?'
    (10)         Where will the pays for the managerial staff come from?
    (11) What will the rate of water bill be?
    (12)         How will the maintenance costs be raised in future? Will the
         balance of water bills be enough to pay for future maintenance? What if
         it is not enough? So on.

In this way, only by starting from particular questions one by one, can you
gradually go in depth the subjects under discussion.

3. Elites dominated the discussions, and nobody else can talk.

On the discussion meetings, some people often dominated the right of speech on
the meeting. Such people are often talkative, capable, and somehow influential in
the village. On one hand, they are the potential organizers or kernel people for
community development. However, sometimes, their voices can be so strong that
the other farmers cannot fully express their own opinions on the meetings. This
is somehow influential to whether the poverty alleviation project can accurately
answer the needs of the poverty households. Therefore, on the discussion
meetings, if the voices of some figures are too strong, and dominated the entire
direction of discussion, making it impossible for the other farmers to express
their opinions, the facilitator need to make proper intervention, so as to
guarantee that different opinions can be freely expressed on the discussion
meeting. You may take the following measures and solutions to handle the
situation of elites dominating the discussion meeting:




                                                                             336
                                   Tool Four: Discussion Meeting


Method 1: You wish everybody can speak on the discussion meeting, but give
them a time limit, such as 3 minutes. They should talk one by one, and guarantee
everybody can express their opinions.

Method 2: Call different groups for discussion meetings separately, or have
discussions by different groups. For example, village group cadres discussion
meetings, poverty households discussion meetings, women's discussion meetings,
on which the elites can only dominate certain meetings. The other groups can
freely give speeches, and when necessary, decline some elites with thanks to
attend the discussion meetings of other groups.

Method 3: For some warm-hearted people who would easily control the
direction of discussion, the facilitator can privately remind them to hear
opinions of different groups, and never substitute everybody's ideas with their
personal views, so that it will be good for everybody to reach common grounds,
and get everybody's support in the subsequent implementation. However, while
persuading such people, you should give them face, and do not hurt their
initiatives of actively give counsels to the collectives.

4. The farmers proposed demanding requirements

It is a good thing for the farmers to propose all sorts of different requirements
on the discussion meetings, which mean that the farmers have started to
actively participate in the preparation of poverty alleviation. However, many
requirements of the farmers cannot possibly be solved by entirely promoting the
poverty alleviation project. However, if we disregard the unsolvable problems, it
will frustrate the initiatives of the farmers to participate, making them
passively wait for arrangements "from higher authorities". Therefore, you
should also actively answer to the demanding requirements. The following are
several kinds of common demanding requirements:
     (1) Specific requirements of individual families. For example, they have a
         sick person at home, and spend a lot of money on medical service, wishing
         to get subsidy. When you encounter such a circumstance, you need to
         explain to the related people the range of poverty project. In addition,
         you may tell them that you will report such specific difficulties to
         relevant departments, such as applying for civil remedies, etc.;
     (2) They propose demanding requirements. For example, they wish to build
         Grade IV roads for every natural village. Under such circumstances, you
         need to explain to the farmers that "village-level poverty alleviation
         project is a staged poverty alleviation undertaking, which is aimed at
         solving the problem of stable poverty alleviation." Therefore, the
         objectives of the project can not be set too high, and explain to the
         farmers that, according to the poverty relief objectives of World Bank


                                                                              337
                               Tool Four: Discussion Meeting


    Project, only requirements within this range can be supported, but not
    anything beyond;
(3) They proposed too many requirements. It seems every requirement the
    farmers made fall into the range of the poverty alleviation project.
    However, if you add all the requirements up, they may go far beyond the
    resources available in the village-level planning, which is a very common
    case. Under such circumstances, the facilitators cannot simply answer
    which requirements are more reasonable and practical, and which are
    not. Instead, you should facilitate the farmers to sum up all the
    requirements, and firstly eliminate some repeated requirements.
    Secondly, ask the farmers to think about it, if not all the requirements
    can be satisfied, which ones are not that important, and can be
    abandoned. Thirdly, if it is also impossible to satisfy all the requirements
    they considered as important, it will be necessary to sort out such
    requirements, and prioritize them by giving grades. Once priorities by
    grades is complete, if there are still too many requirements that must
    be solved, you should ask the farmers the possibility of investments by
    different categories, and see how much money the farmers can raise,
    and if it go beyond the affordability of the farmers, ask the farmers to
    screen the requirements again.

Tool Five: Scoring and Ranking
Purpose:
1. Screen out the target groups of poverty alleviation project, i.e., screening
   poverty households;
2. Understand people's preference about certain things, and analyze influential
   factors of people's preferences;
3. Understand the farmers' degree of concern about different poverty
   problems, and find out the most recognized poverty causes for most people;
4. With limited resources available, let the farmers autonomously decide the
   sequence of project implementation, allowing the poverty alleviation funds to
   answer the most concerned projects of the farmers.

Operating methods and steps:

There are many kinds of priority by grades. With regard to WB Participatory
Village Level Planning Project, we introduce the following two methods:



5.1 Matrix grading

Operating methods and steps:
1. Draw a matrix on the ground or on a large piece of white paper, and list the
   questions to be analyzed and judged in proper measurement and local
   terminologies;
2. Explain to the participating villagers the purposes of priority by grades, and
   questions need to be judged, and the specific criteria for commenting things;
3. Ask the farmer participants to fill their own views and comments on certain
   things in the matrix in words, numbers, symbols or with articles (such as corn
   or stones, etc.) one by one;
4. Count the result of priority by grades, and sort out the priority of the things
   being discussed.

Refer to Case 2.

The 24 farmers' representatives (18 men and 6 women) discussed the problems
in the villages one by one, and everybody put a corn in a square accordingly in
each row, and then count the numbers, and prioritize by the total number of
very serious and serious. (On the discussion meetings dominated by women, * was
considered as important problems).

Precautions and problems to be handled:
1. The questions listed in the matrix to conduct needs analysis should be the
   problems that the facilitator found and summarized from semi-structured
   interviews, instead of the questions believed by the outsiders. Before giving
   grades, you should invite the farmers to see if they still have any more
   questions to supplement;
2. It is necessary to patiently explain to the farmers the method of giving
   grades and judging criteria, including the details. For example, for each
   question, only one answer can be selected;
3. If the question of evaluation and judgment will not cause any conflict, it can
   be conducted in an open manner, and the farmers can discuss with each other
   during the course of giving grades;
4. For the listed questions, except explanations in words, you may also draw
   pictures beside the questions, or substitute with articles, so that the
   illiterate farmers can make judgment;
5. Since the men and the women have different degrees of concern over the
   questions, if they give grades together, the women are often guided or
   interfered by the men. Therefore, it would be best to let the men and the


                                                                             344
                                Tool Five: Scoring and Ranking


   women give grades separately.

5.2    Restrictive ballots

Operating methods and steps:
1. With the help of the facilitators, you first need to select or decide the
   contents to be put in a list, for example, the list of projects that the
   farmers proposed, and hoped to be supported;
2. The facilitator should explain in details, introduce the ways to cast ballots
   and the restrictive conditions. For example, each farmer participating in the
   votes can only select three items from the list of projects he/she consider
   as the most important;
3. According to local conditions, the votes released to the voters should
   normally be in kind, such as corn, soy bean or potato, etc;
4. The participants should have autonomy in the choice of votes;
5. The participants elect a vote counter, who will sum up the election results,
   and publish on site the number of votes each project in the list got;
6. Based on the number of votes, prioritize the projects.

Precautions and problems to be handled:
1. The projects on the list should be as complete as possible. If there is any
   omission, it can be supplemented on site before casting votes;
2. The contents on the list should be as clear as possible, and be explained to
   the farmers one by one. In addition, the different contents should also be
   expressed in kind or pictures, so that illiterate farmers can understand;
3. There might be potential conflict of interests in such votes. For example,
   some people want to make certain projects happen, while some other people
   may want to make other projects happen. Therefore, in order to guarantee
   that the voters can make their own judgment without interference, the
   facilitators should facilitate in creating an independent environment for
   casting votes, and guarantee that when someone is casting votes, the other
   stakeholders are not on site. However, there should be 1 ­ 2 outsiders there
   to help explain how to cast votes, for example, each project can only be put
   in but one corn, and each project represent what;
4. In order to guarantee the voters can express their own wills, when each
   person is casting votes, he/she should not see the results of votes by people
   before him/her, so as to avoid "following populace", whatever the majority
   votes, I will vote. One way is to cover the big bowl with a small bowl, to serve
   as a vote box for each project. While casting votes, the voter should put the
   votes on the bottom of the small bowl. When the voter is done with votes,
   the workers will put the votes into the big bowl underneath. In this way,
   what's inside the big bowl is the total result of the voters before, when the
   next voter come to vote, he/she cannot see what the people before him/her


                                                                               345
                               Tool Five: Scoring and Ranking


   voted for, and can make a choice based on their own judgment;
5. While casting votes, the votes for male and female voters should be
   different. For example, the male use soy beans, while the female use corn. In
   this way, it will be very easy to get the results of priority and total results
   by different sexes. If there is great difference in the priorities between
   the men and the women, you may organize them for discussions, so that the
   men and the women can understand each other, and reach common grounds.

Tool Six: Problem Tree
Purposes:
1. Sort out, categorize and analyze the problems and difficulties that the
   farmers proposed, find out the inherent relationships, and possible results.
2. Connecting the supportive conditions that the project may possibly provide,
   find out possibly starting point of the project, enabling the projects being
   implemented can effectively answer the reasons that caused difficulties for
   the farmers, but not the phenomenon;
3. Help the project coordinator clear his mind, so that the project proposals
   can be written up in a more logic and oriented manner.

Operating methods and steps:
1. After analyzing the semi-structured interviews with the farmers and group
   discussions, finalize the kernel problems of concern to the farmers;
2. Enlist the possible influences that the kernel problems can bring, i.e., if the
   said problem is not solved, what may be the possible consequences. Such
   consequence may have already happened in reality, or may possibly happen.
3. Analyze and discuss with the farmers, and enlist the direct reasons that
   caused the said problem;
4. Further analyze and discuss about the reasons behind the reasons, and dig
   out the root of the problems that give rise to the problems.
5. Jointly analyze what is a good starting point for solving the problems by
   analyzing from what reasons and what levels.

Precautions and Handling of Problems
1. Problem tree analysis is a logic reasoning tool, and to use it correctly, you need
   to be careful about two conditions: Firstly, correctly position the questions,
   which is the prerequisite for logic analysis. Secondly, it should conform to the
   logic reasoning process.
2. While orienting the problems, we need to first define clearly, "Is this a
   problem?" Some issues, such as "low grain yields" may be a problem, or it may
   just be a phenomenon. If the high-return cash crop is the major source of
   income for the locals, it will be fully affordable to pay for buying grains, then
   "low grain yields" cannot constitute a problem. The so-called problem refers to
   "contradictions, complications and differences that need to be studied,
   discussed and resolved. To be specific to communities, it is the difference
   between the needs of the villagers and the status quo." Therefore, while
   analyzing and finalizing the problems, you should not only see the status quo, but
   also the needs. This will involve another aspect of orienting the problems,
   "whose problems?" To put it simply, you cannot compare the status quo of the
   village with the perspectives and needs of external project staffs, and find out
   the problems that need to be solved. Instead, you should facilitate the villagers
   to analyze their own needs and status quo, and find out their problems that
   need to be solved the most urgently.
3. The problems are everywhere in the community. Conduct problem tree analysis
   is mainly aimed at the key problems affecting community developments, i.e., the
   problems causing great influences on people's production and life inside and
   outside the community. Therefore, you need to try your best to enlist all the
   influences of the problems, so as to analyze the depth and extensiveness of the
   problems. On the contrary, if the problems are not that influential, you may
   need to abandon, and concentrate you efforts on key problem.
4. During the course of analyzing the problems, and find out the reasons, you need
   to enlist all the possible reasons that cause the problems, and avoid omitting any
   important reason. After enlisting all the reasons, sort out the reasons that need
   further analysis.
5. The expression of problems or causes should be clear and specific, so that
   different people will not have different understandings while reading it. For
   example, "certain community is short of water" is not clear and specific enough.
   You may understand it as short of potable water, or short of irrigating water.
   Clear and specific expression is the foundation for finding out the key reasons.
6. There must be direct relation of cause and effect between the next layer and
   the former layer. There are two layers of meanings: Firstly, there is logic
   relation, the next layer is the cause of the previous layer. Secondly, the relation
   of cause and effect should be direct, or it will be uneasy to understand. A
   simple examination method is to make sentences with the lower layer as



                                         356
                                           :  Tool Six: Problem Tree


"because", and the upper layer as "therefore". If what comes up is a logic
sentence, then the logic relation of cause and effect should have clear
graduations, or the logic relations may be displaced or short of certain layers.
For example, "Because of deforestation for opening up lands, therefore, forests
reduced" conforms to clear graduation of logic layers. "Because of
deforestation for opening up lands, therefore, the forests are hard to manage"
is not logically smooth. "Because of deforestation for opening up lands,
therefore, incomes reduced", there may be logic relations, but there are
something missing in-between, and a possible successive sentence may be
"because of deforestation for opening up lands, forests reduced ­ because
forests reduced, it caused soil erosion ­ because of soil erosion, the crop yields
are low ­ because of low yields, incomes reduced." Another example is, "Because
it is hot, electric power consumption increased", the logic relation is not direct.
However, if it is expressed as "Because it is hot, the number of homes using air
conditioners increased, therefore, electricity power consumption increased,"
which improved all the layers. However, what displayed between different
layers are direct relations of cause and effect, and avoid being badly organized,
end up with unceasing arguments.

Tool Seven: Investments of Stakeholders, Balance Sheet of Returns

Purposes:
1. Find out the major groups related to the said project or certain job, which may
   include institutions, organizations or individuals;
2. Analyze the investments and returns of major stakeholders during the entire
   project process;
3. The most important thing is to find out the fragile point of stakeholders. The
   so-called fragile point refers to certain one or several major stakeholders need
   to make critical investments or great investments in the project, however, the
   said group cannot afford to make enough investments, or are unwilling to make
   investments due to failure of getting returns accordingly. By analyzing the
   investments and balance sheet of returns, you may foresee the possible fragile
   points, and take remedial measures, which can effectively avoid failure of
   project implementation.

Operating methods and steps:
1. According to project activities, first enlist the project stakeholders. The so-
   called stakeholders refer to the groups being influenced by the project, and the
   groups influencing the project. For example, while constructing a potable water
   project for people and animals, the major groups being influenced by the
   project include:
          Beneficiary farmers: they will get potable water;
          Farmers whose lands are occupied: Part of their lands will be occupied
          during the course of building potable water facilities;
          Owners of water sources: Maybe the neighboring villages, as it may lead
          to reduction of their water consumption.
    However, the major groups influencing the project include:
            Poverty alleviation bodies: decide on money to support the project, and
            coordinating organization for the project;
            Technician: engineering design, quality supervision and acceptance;
            Village cadres: Being in charge of organization and coordination, etc.;
            Implementation group: Being in charge of specific implementation of
            the project, who will influence the construction quality and schedule;
            Owners of water source: It will affect whether to supply water source
            or not, and the volume of water;
            Township leaders: coordinate solution of disputes over land and water
            sources, etc.




                                       361
                   
                    Tool Seven: Stakeholder Analysis


    Of course, there may be many other stakeholders, such as material suppliers
    and carriers, etc. However, we normally only analyze critical stakeholders.

2. Analyze the investments and returns of major stakeholders, and complete the
   balance sheet, such as the following table:

         Inputs           Stakeholders                Achievements
A little labor          Farmers             Solve difficulties in access to
                                            potable water, and save labor
Poverty     alleviation Poverty alleviation Finish performing duties;
funds, organizational department            Win trusts from farmers
coordination;
Time and skills of the
people involved
Technology         and Technical            
talents                 department
Water source            Neighboring         
                        villages
......                  ......              ......

3. Analyze the equilibrium between investments and returns, and find out the
fragile point. For example, in the aforementioned stakeholder analysis, the
technical department is responsible for labor input time, technical design,
monitoring and quality control and acceptance. If that department is an enterprise,
and the project does not budget money for their expenses accordingly, then the
technical investments of the said technical department may not be in place.
Another example is, the water source belongs to the neighboring village. Through
the mandatory requirements of the township government, the neighboring village
permits the water taking. However, the neighboring village does not get anything,
and it is quite possible that they may cut off the water supply in future. Therefore,
in the said project, the technical department and the neighboring village become
the fragile point. It is necessary to take some measure beforehand, for example,
while making project budget, include the design and supervision fee, and give the
technical department certain economic compensation. For such fragile point as the
neighboring village which provides water source, it is necessary to give them certain
compensation. On way is to promote the beneficiary village to negotiate with the
water source providing village, and let the beneficiary village pay for it. If
negotiation failed, you should temporarily suspend the project, otherwise, it may
result in waste of money and disputes between the villagers. Another way is to
offer the water source providing village with additional poverty alleviation project
as compensation, in exchange for their water source. No matter compensating from



                                         362
                  
                   Tool Seven: Stakeholder Analysis


whatever perspective, the investments and returns should be basically equilibrium.
In addition, such equilibrium should be established on autonomy of the
stakeholders. Otherwise, it will just be the superficial equilibrium, and the fragile
point will still be troublesome. Furthermore, for such issues as providing water
source, while considering compensation method, there should be written
agreements accordingly, so that it will not be difficult to explain when new
problems come up.

Precautions and Handling of Problems
1. Any project may involve many stakeholders. However, effective equilibrium
   analysis only needs to be conducted to those major, critical stakeholders. As to
   whether they are critical stakeholders, you may measure with two simple
   criteria: Firstly, very influential groups, without "them", the project will not be
   implemented smoothly, or will not achieve desired objectives. Secondly, the
   roles or functions of the said group can hardly be replaced. For example, if you
   have to take water from the neighboring village, then the neighboring village will
   become a critical group. However, it will be a different story to buy water pipes.
   If one supplier is not suitable, you may go to another one. Therefore, the
   suppliers are not critical stakeholders.
2. The investments can be all round, such as money, materials, labor, technology,
   resources and policy. Returns can also be very inclusive, such as money,
   facilities, improved capabilities, establishment of trust and friendship,
   performance of duties, sense of accomplishment, etc. However, during the
   course of implementing poverty alleviation projects, the returns for many
   stakeholders may not be material, and you need to carefully analyze such
   returns. Otherwise, you may end up with many unbalanced stakeholders.
   Similarly, it is quite normal to see imbalance. However, what need to be analyzed
   are whether the stakeholders can accept such imbalance or not, and what you
   truly need to pay attention to are those imbalances unacceptable and unbearable
   for certain stakeholders.

Tool Eight: Seasonal Distribution of Labor Diagram

Purposes:
1. Understand about the seasonal changes of male and female labors in a year, and
   find out proper project implementation time and schedule for discussing the
   projects possibly implemented;
2. Understand the difficulties that the farmers often encounter in farming
   activities of different seasons, and find out possible solutions;
3. Understand what production activities do the farmers of both sexes do in
   different seasons, so that the timing of training projects and selection of
   trainees can be more oriented.

Operating methods and steps:
1. Draw a local calendar on a large piece of blank paper, from January to
   December, and do mark if it is solar calendar or lunar calendar;
2. Beside each month, you should note what do men mainly do, and what do women
   mainly do;
3. Put corns or soy beans beside the major jobs to represent the bustling
   intensity, and 10 seeds represent the busiest.
4. Discuss the difficulties in the production activities of each month with the
   diagram;
5. Discuss arrangement of project schedule with the diagram.

Refer to the following table.

Precautions and Handling of Problems
4. The season and month on the diagram should clearly indicate whether it is solar
   calendar or lunar calendar. If the farmers are used to lunar calendar, you'd
   better use lunar calendar to indicate;
5. Do not directly use number 1 ­ 10 to express bustling intensity, but use soy bean
   or corn instead, so as to make it easy for making adjustments after comparison;
6. Similar seasonal diagrams can be used to understand about the distribution of
   farmers' incomes and expenditures, to serve as references for loan projects, or
   arranging time for the projects that need to raise money;
7. Winter and spring are often the time to construct infrastructures. However, in
   some places, many men go out working as migrant labors during these seasons,
   project implementation may mainly rely on the women. As to whether the
   intensity of labor inputs exceeded the affordability of the women, it is
   necessary to promote both sexes to jointly discuss and propose solutions.
