Amount          SDR 12.0million (US$18.5 million equivalent).
Terms           IDAterms: 20-year maturity; a 10-year grace period.
Objectiveand    The proposed series of four annual single tranche Poverty
Description     Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) is intendedto support policy
                and institutional reforms in furtherance of the Government's
                Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSCs focus on
                four critical reform themes:
                (i)consolidatingmacroeconomicdisciplineandstrengtheningof
                governance; (ii)  sharpening competition and entrenching property
                rights; (iii)mitigating social and environmental risks; and
                (iv) modernizing the rural economy. The first three PRSCs were
                extended in November 2004, January 2006, and March 2007.
                PRSC-IV is now being presented for Board approval based on
                policy and institutional reform actions taken as agreed with IDA.
Benefits        The credit will help to sustain economic growth and poverty
                reduction by advancing high priority reforms identified in the
                PRSP and by providing resources for the budget.
Risks           First, a continuation of government capacity and willingness to
                implement reforms that has been demonstrated over PRSCs-1-111
                will have to be maintained inthe lead-up to presidential elections
                inMarch 2008. There is continued risk of reform fatigue as the
                reform agenda addresses difficult terrain (for example, in
                governance and regulatory reforms).           Capacity i s being
                strengthened through reforms and by the active engagement of
                donors; and wide participation through which the PRSP was
                formulated. The continuing involvement of civic organizations in
                its implementation offer some protection against reform fatigue.
                A second risk relates to exogenous economic shocks reflecting
                reduction in worker remittances, export earnings, remittances by
                the Armenian diaspora, or a substantial energy supply,
                commodity price shock or regional trade and border restrictions.
                Clearly, each shock will have to be addressed specifically,
                necessitating the use of other Bank instruments as envisaged in
                the CAS.
Estimated       SDR 12.0million (US$ 18.5 million equivalent) will be disbursed

                                     I.INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit-IV for Armenia is designed to
build on the progress achievedunder PRSC-I, I1and I11that were extendedinNovember
2004, January 2006 and March 2007, respectively, in an amount of US$20 million
equivalent (for PRSC Iand 11) and US$ 28 million for the PRSC 111. The program of
poverty reduction support credits is anchored on an ambitious Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), publishedby the Armenian authorities in late 2003, laying out a
comprehensive program stretched over a decade for sustaining high rates of growth and
directing public resources sharply towards fighting poverty. Central to this strategy are
improvements in core public sector functions and higher investments in human capital
and infrastructure, whilst maintaining macroeconomic stability.'

focused on three areas that best fit the Bank Group's comparative advantage and
complement the activities of other donors: (i)          promotion of private sector led growth,
through raised efficiency in public services and strengthened competition; (ii)re-
orientation of growth to fighting poverty, through acceleratedjob creation in the private
economy, modernization of the rural economy, and effective social protection systems;
and (iii)  reduction of non-income poverty, through education, health and infrastructure
reforms.

3.       The CAS identified a program o f PRSCs as the central instrument for supporting
policy and institutional reforms in these key areas. Given Armenia's continued strong
reform performance, which qualifies it for the CAS "high case", a fourth PRSC is
proposed to be extended. This reform performance i s reflected in Armenia's strong
annual performance based IDA allocation (PBA).                 Performance with respect to each
PRSC IV trigger is discussed inchapter V ofthis document.




  An updated PRSP is planned for publication by end-2007. The authorities have indicated that the basic
objectives and the centralthrust ofthe PRSP will be maintained unchanged.

  A mid-term progress report on the CAS (CAS-PR 05-08) was discussed by the Board inconjunction with
its approval of PRSC-I11inMarch 2007.

4.       The proposed four year program of PRSCs, totaling up to US$86.5 million
equivalent, is rooted inthe three objectives described inthe CAS, and i s designed around
four themes that each encompass several se~t0i-s:~


         consolidatingmacroeconomic disciplineand strengtheninggovernance
         sharpening competition and entrenchingproperty rights
         mitigating social and environmental risks
         modernizing the rural economy

5.       The first theme o f consolidatinP macroeconomic discipline and strengthening
governance recognizes that a continuation of Armenia's exemplary macroeconomic
performance over the past decade is necessary to underpin high rates o f growth.
Moreover, governance reforms that cut across budget, fiduciary, revenue raising, and
public administration institutions and sectors will improve the climate for private sector
investment, remove opportunities for corruption, and enhance revenue mobilization.

6.       The second theme o f sharpeninp competition and entrenching property rights -
cutting across trade, utilities regulation, property and contract law, banking and capital
markets, and rural sectors             --  addresses the key weaknesses in the competition
environment.        Armenia needs to reduce costs and sharpen its competitive edge by
complementing its highly liberal regime in trade in goods with liberalization in key
services, such as civil aviation and telecommunications, and by consolidating its
impressive reforms in state owned utilities.             In addition, entrenching property rights
through provision o f a legal framework for secured transactions, by instilling confidence
inthe banking sector, and by developinginsurance markets is essential to secure growing
rates o f private investment.

7.       Social and environmental risks - the third theme cutting across education, health,
social risk management and environmental protection sectors - are designed to be
mitigated by a program o f reforms directed at raising both the share o f public spending
devoted to these sectors and the quality o f spending through changes intheir composition
and institutional reforms, notably inthe private provision o f health and pension services.
The resulting strengthening o f human capital and reduced risks for sustainable
livelihoods innatural resource use will greatly assist inthe reduction o f poverty.

8.       Interventions in the rural economy           -the final theme, cuts across the agriculture,
non-farm, and infrastructure sectors - are intended to modernize a lagging sector o f the
economy and one in which the impact o f growth on poverty needs to be further
strengthened. Greater predictability and sustainability inpublic services inrural Armenia
i s expected to strongly benefit the fight against poverty.

9.       The expected development outcomes and the monitoring indicators for assessing
performance under these themes are contained inAnnex 111.

                11.POLITICALAND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

                                POLITICAL BACKGROUND

10.     Armenia's birth from the dissolution o f the Soviet Union took place at a time o f
severe economic difficulty, exacerbated by natural disasters and energy shortages as well
as by an armed conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the territory o f Nagorno-
Karabakh. Over the past decade, Armenia has attained political stability - a key factor
behind the impressive growth and reform achievements.            Presidential and national
assembly elections took place in early 2003 with the emergence o f a stable coalition
government, though not one without the usual stresses associated with a multi-party
coalition. The most recent parliamentary elections in May 2007 saw a return o f the
coalition to office with a strong majority and the reinvigorated government has adopted
an ambitious economic reform program. Fresh presidential elections will be held in
March 2008. The Council o f Europe declared that the parliamentary elections reflected
improvements in fairness in the electoral process. Rule o f law, civic participation, and
electoral fairness will remain important indicators indonor support decisions.

11.     Two o f Armenia's neighbors with which it shares the overwhelming portion o f its
frontiers, Azerbaijan and Turkey, have closed their borders with Armenia. This imposes
costs on the economy. The main surface trade links are rail and road connections with
Georgia and its Black Sea ports. The re-opening o f links with Azerbaijan and Turkey,
when it occurs, would raise the potential rate o f growth, particularly as Armenia lies at a
huboflinkagesbetweenthe MiddleEast andthe Caspian Sea states, onthe one hand, and
Turkey and Europe, on the other.

                                ECONOMIC    BACKGROUND

12.     The Armenian authorities carried out a successful stabilization and structural
reform program following the hyperinflation, fiscal crisis and severe economic
contraction immediately after independence in 1991-93 - a period that also saw the
devastating consequences o f a major earthquake and armed conflict with Azerbaijan.
Trade and prices were liberalized, the legal framework for a market economy was
established, most small and medium-sized enterprises were privatized, and the
government's intervention in the economy was considerably reduced. Macroeconomic
stability was maintained, inflation was low, structural reforms were carried out
successfully and economic recovery began. Successful implementation o f economic
reforms contributed to an average growth o f 5.5 percent per year during 1994-2000.

13.     Reforms accelerated after 2000, with a shift towards improving the business
environment and public utilities management, strengthening governance, competition and
financial intermediation as well as promoting structural changes in public service
delivery. Annual average growth rates o f 12 percent were achieved over 2001-06 (see
Table 1 below). Such high rates o f sustained growth have led to a fall in poverty from
over half o f the population in 1999 to less than 27 percent in 2006, and an even sharper
fall in severe poverty from 21 percent to under 5 percent. Growth has only recently
begunto dent unemployment which stands at nearly one-third o fthe labor force.

                           RECENT   ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

14.     Economic growth accelerated during 2001-2006, with GDP growth rising from
average of 5.4 percent for 1995-2000 to 12 percent for 2001-2006. In 2001-2006,
economic growth was mainly driven by export growth and expansion inconstruction, and
service sectors. While in 2001-2003 the construction growth was mainly financed by
grants from the diaspora and other donors, the construction boom of 2004-2006 was
fueled by growing domestically-financed private investments inreal estate. In2001-2006
the averageinflationwas inline with the long-termtarget of 3 percent.

15.     The economy continued its strong performance during the first eight months
of 2007. Preliminary data indicate that as of August 2007 real GDP increased by 13.6
percent, driven mainly by expanding construction and growth in services and trade. As
of September 2007 the rate of 12-month inflation stood at 2.7 percent, lower than 2007
target of 4 percent.

16.     Fiscal stance was prudent in recent years. The average fiscal deficit for 2001-
2006 was 2.3 percent of GDP with 2006 deficit shrinking to 1.6 percent of GDP. Tax
revenues improved slightly since 2003, with the tax to GDP ratio rising by 0.4
percentage. Monetary policy was eased over the past two years, when rapid growth in
monetary aggregates were experienced, related in significant part to external inflows and
central bank intervention to slow the rate of nominal appreciation of the local currency.

17.     External sector performance was favorable in 2001-2005, with exports more
than doubling since 2001 and diversifying to some extent. In2006 export growth slowed
substantially, which is largely related to difficulties indiamond cutting industry and trade
disruption due to Georgia-Russia border closure. Import grew by 21 percent inreflection
of buoyant domestic demand. Preliminary export data for the first half of 2007 indicates
that export growth will recover in2007. Import growth will also be strong, which largely
related to increaseinimports of mineral products, cars and capital goods.

18.     While market shares for exports to other countries in the CIS declined from 40
percent in 1997 to 22 percent in 2006, the shares of exports to EU increased from 28
percent to 47 percent in the same period. The current account balance in relation to GDP
continued to improve due to robust growth in private remittances and reached -1.4
percent of GDP in 2006. It was comfortably financed by rising foreign direct investment
and donor inflows, suchthat gross international reserves rose by US$400 million in2006
to stand at nearly five months of imports. During 2004-2006, the dram appreciated
substantially both in nominal and real terms in reflection of large external flows and
productivity growth; at end-2006, the real effective value of the dram is judged to be
close to long term equilibrium.

                          MEDIUM-TERMECONOMIC            OUTLOOK

19.     Economic performance is expected to remain strong in the medium-term with
growth projected at 11 percent in 2007 and about 8 percent per annum during 2008-
2010. Medium-termgrowth projections assume a slowing from the very high rates of the



                                            6

recent past as "catching-up" effects and strong productivity gains from resource
reallocation are worn off. Also, the expected increase inenergy prices, especially, inthe
price o f imported gas, will most likely dampen the growth prospects. Still robust growth
outlook is based on the assumptionthat the government will be able to maintain its strong
track record on reforms and economic management, and that gross investment will be
sustained at a level o f 29-30 percent o f GDP in the medium-term. The government
reform program as reflected in the PRSP will continue emphasizing the need for further
measures to enhance investor confidence, improve the business climate, and promote
exports to facilitate the private sector undertaking muchof this investment.

20.      Over the medium-term, improving revenue mobilization to finance poverty
reducing expenditures is a major task confronting the government. This requires the
government addressing deficiencies in the tax and custom administrations, especially in
the areas of VAT, personal income, profit and property taxes, as well as implementing
self-assessment systems. Only through a determinedpursuit of reform measures inthese
areas will an increase in tax revenues be achieved consistent with the official goal of
raisingthe tax/GDP ratio to 16.3 percent in2008.

21.     Prospects for increasing net exports inthe short runare now less encouraging, as
the still limited diversification of exports is expected to lead to a growth rate for exports
that will exceed that of imports only by a small margin. Current account deficits in the
range of 4% per cent of GDP are expectedto be filled by increasedremittance flows and
FDI. Inthis connection, Armenia's eligibility for grant funding from the US Millennium
Challenge Account is a development of great significance. Grant funding from this
account for project and budget support will make possible an increase in the investment
share of GDP and raise the medium term growth potential of the economy, whilst
ensuring viability inexternal payments and leading to an even sharper decline inexternal
debt indicators. It would also strengthen fiscal prospects and lead to the generation of
additional revenues for poverty fighting ends.

22.     With impressive progress in structural reforms and macroeconomic stabilization
in recent years, Armenia's creditworthiness has improved to the point that it has been
declared eligible for IBRD lending. Thus, Armenia has moved to a blend of IDA and
IBRD resources. Sovereign ratings by Fitch and Moody's indicate a stable outlook for
the economy.

                               DEBTSUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS5

23,     The country's external debt profile improved considerably in 2001-2006 because
of robust economic growth, debt write-offs vis-a-vis claims by Russia, export expansion
and real exchange rate appreciation. A joint Bank-Fund external debt sustainability
exercise carried out inclose consultation with the authorities in September 2007 indicates
that the net present value of debt to exports ratio is estimated to fall from 52 percent in
2006 to 45 percent in2010. (Figure 1).



 See Annex IV for details.


                                             7

24.     External debt service as a percentage o f exports o f goods and services is estimated
to fall from 9.7 percent in 2005 to about 6.8 percent in 2010. In the same period, total
public sector debt service as a percentage o f fiscal revenue, i s estimated to decline from
8.3 percent to less then 3 percent. These favorable developments will further strengthen
Armenian prospects for creditworthiness.                    Multilateral concessional debt accounts for
about 70 percent o f external debt, o f which debts to IDA was 58 percentage points.

26.      Income per head (Atlas method) began to rise rapidly at the opening of this
century. It more than doubled from $720 to $1,930 between 2001 and 2006. The
increased income of the population, combined with the government's pro-poor policies
and expenditures resulted in increased living standards of the population: the. poverty
indicators beganto fall and access to basic social andinfrastructure services improved.

27.      By 2006, all consumption based measures o f poverty and extreme poverty
declined compared to their levels in 1998/99 (Table 2). Extreme poverty incidence fell
considerably faster than the overall poverty rate. At the same time, poverty became

                        111. POVERTYREDUCTION-
          GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION

29.     The authorities are preparing a second poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP 11)
inclose consultation with Bank staff, as Armenia enters into the next phase of the PRSP
process following the successful completion of the first PRSP. The first draft of PRSP I1
that covers 2008-2021 will be put into circulation for extensive consultations in
November 2007. The final document enriched by the comments and inputs from various
stakeholders will be approved by the government in January 2008. The draft has been
prepared based on a wide participatory process within the government, civil society and
the donor community. It offers a comprehensivepoverty reduction program and contains
an extensive poverty analysis for the period of 2003-2006 and ,a well-defined strategy
with short and long-term perspectives.

30.     The poverty diagnosis in the draft PRSP I1 sets out a comprehensive analysis
based on a wide range of indicators, including indicators related to income and income
distribution, consumption, health, education, access to water, nutrition, fertility, and
regional issues. The draft states that poverty reduction in non-yerevan urban areas and
some of rural areas lag behind national trends of poverty reduction. It identifies several
factors responsible for this, including non-conducive business environment and lack of
essential public and business services. For rural areas, the draft finds that although there
were significant interventions since the adoption of PRSP I,the broad based sustainable
growth in rural Armenia i s still hampered by underdeveloped rural infrastructure, in
particular poor road conditions and higher transport costs, and lack of non-farming
employment opportunities.

31.     Policy priorities outlined in the current draft are broadly in line with the first
PRSP. It identifies five themes for action: promoting sustainable economic growth
through macroeconomic stability and private sector development; improving public
infrastructure; enhancing human development and improving social safety nets;
implementing prudent fiscal policies and reformingthe tax system; improving core public
sector functions.

32.     The PRSP I1 recognizes that macroeconomic stability is essential for continued
highrates of growth andpoverty reduction. The fiscal and monetary frameworks of PRSP
I1 are sound and it will support the macroeconomic stability in 2008-2021. PRSP I1
envisages prudent fiscal stance with fiscal deficit below three percent of GDP, and
expanding fiscal base that is important for increase in pro-poor and growth facilitating
expenditures. Tax to GDP ratio will increase by 6.5 percentage points cumulatively in
2008-2021 reaching 24.5 percent of GDP by 2021 (including social contributions). This
will be achieved through continued reforms in tax and custom administration without
major revision of tax rates. The document also recognizes that continued improvements
inthe business environment are critical to continued job creation and poverty reduction.
Improved governance and competition will be conducive for longterm growth.

33.     Based on the policy analysis for 2003-2006, the current draft proposes further
reallocation of budgetary expenditures towards activities that proved to have a high


                                          12

impact on poverty reduction. Budget allocations for education, health, social safety net
will continue to increase interms o ftheir share intotal expenditures and GDP. Inthe first
years o f PRSP implementation there will be a major shift o f resources towards old-age
pensions. The average pensions will be brought to 150 percent o f the poverty line by
2012 that will lead to major poverty reduction among the families with elderly.

34.       In addition to sectoral expenditure shifts, the draft PRSP I1 recognizes the
importance o f good governance for poverty reduction, which i s a contentious area, given
entrenched corruption inpublic services, where tenacious reform efforts are required. Tax
and customs administration reforms, the strengthening of the judiciary, the development
o ftransparent and independent audit institutions, and the fostering o fpublic vigilance and
monitoring are urgent reform measures that are still intheir infancy.


          IV. THE PRSCSUPPORTEDREFORMPROGRAM'O

                                       INTRODUCTION

35.     As noted, the PRSCs are rooted inthe mediumterm poverty reduction program o f
the authorities developed through extensive consultation with civic society. It consists o f
selected priority actions to be taken by the government as the basis for extension o f IDA
credits. The PRSP consultation process is being institutionalized and continues to be
active within the PRSP I1as well. Further, the above mentioned priority action areas had
been selected by the authorities and include the following: (i)   advancing reforms in core
public fiduciary services and in key revenue-collecting agencies; (ii)     the development of
private markets; (iii) the continuation of reform inkey social policies - education, health
and social protection; and (iv) promoting the revival of the rural economy. (See Box:
"PRSC At A Glance", page 2).

36.     The relationship between the major PRSP policy priorities and the PRSC-
supported program i s illustrated in Table 3. The Bank initiated its PRSC support for a
select sub-set o f policy and institutional actions developed in the PRSP in line with its
comparative advantage. The thrust and the content o f the PRSC-supported three year
reform program remained unchanged throughout the program implementation.                     As
discussed below, there has been satisfactory compliance with the implementation o f the
PRSC-IV actions. The expected development outcomes are provided inAnnex 111.




loThe ReformProgramhas been supportedby a series of generous PHRD grants extendedby the Japanese
government.

                   Theme 1: Consolidating Macroeconomic Discipline
                                and Strengthening Governance

MaintainingMacroeconomic Stability"

38.     Armenia has a creditable record o f economic stability, as noted in the opening
sections of this document.           Over the medium term, the macroeconomic program
underlying the PRSP calls for fiscal deficits inthe range o f the equivalent o f 2% percent
of GDP, i.e., what can be financed by concessional borrowing from IDA and other
donors, from limited volumes o f domestic debt issues as the authorities try to develop a
capital market for long term debt, and from modest amounts o f IBRD borrowing.
Monetary policy i s intendedto be geared to keeping inflation low; the central bank has
announced that inflation targeting will be formally adopted as soon as preparations are
completed. The exchange rate regime i s a freely floating one, with the dram likely to
continue to appreciate in real terms in parallel with high rates o f productivity growth in
the economy and continuing substantial foreign exchange inflows. The central bank
policy is to intervene only for smoothing purposes. The external debt and debt service
burdenis low and i s expected to remain comfortably low. By the standards of CIS or of
emerging economies, the economic record and the mediumterm outlook are enviable.

39.     Nevertheless, the authorities should remain vigilant to the major sources of
vulnerability to economic performance. Challenges over the near term arise from two
sources: the recrudescence o f inflation and the narrowness o f the fiscal base. Cost push
factors accounted in large part for the acceleration inprices in2006, but were reversed in
2007 and inflation has fallen correspondingly. Cost push factors such as a large rise in
energy prices and commodity prices are likely to be felt again in 2008 and the official
inflation target will come under threat.            Moreover, the rates o f monetary expansion
remain high as the central bank has frequently intervened to constrain the nominal
appreciation o f the dram, and has not been able to sterilize such interventions."                    The
management o f large external inflows will remain a challenge; if large and persistent,
may require a tightening o f the fiscal stance. Energy and commodity prices have risen
significantly in recent months. The planned transition to an inflation targeting regime
will be complicated by gaps in information on the monetary transmission mechanism, by
unstable relationships between inflation and control variables, and institutional factors
such as the depth o f financial markets. Thus, firmer control over monetary aggregates,
limiting foreign exchange intervention to smoothing operations, and the development of
long term debt instruments are important.

40.     Inrecent years, a modest rise inthe tax to GDP ratio has taken place; the ratio
nevertheless remained low during the past five years at around 14% percent.                           The
explanation for the limited rise in this ratio, amidst conditions of rapid real growth, i s
two-fold. First, the major source o f growth - construction- is untaxed or lightly taxed, as
inmany countries. The sale o fproperty by individuals is neither subject to VAT nor the


  Matrix 1. Achievements under PRSC-IV were coveredin Chapter 11.
  Monetary growth has also reflected de-dollarization and financial deepening, which are non-inflationary
processesand supportive of capital market development.


                                                    17

capital gain taxation; foreign-sourced construction i s associated with a tax holiday. In
addition, donor-financed investments also escape the tax net as such financing i s tax-
exempt. Second, strong evidence points to widespread evasion o f VAT payments as well
as large profits tax evasion in the economy. The average Gross Compliance RatioI3for
VAT between 2000 and 2006 is only around 36 percent, which is very low by
international standards. In2007, a significant rise inthe tax to GDP ratio to 15% per cent
is projected, largely because o f strengthened tax administration, related to the reforms
beingsupported by the PRSC (see paras 56-61 for details). As a result, the revenueyield
from VAT has, thus far this year, risen by 42 per cent. However, part of the increase i s
related to ad hoc efforts at tax collection and to a substantial rise inarrears inVAT refund
due to exporters -factors that will be unwound in2008.

41.      An improvement in tax buoyancy over the medium term can be expected given
(i) effortstostrengthenthetaxadministrationtohelpimprovetaxcompliance, (ii)
    the                                                                                          the
proposed measures to remove several weaknesses and loopholes in the tax laws, and
(iii) wideningofthetaxbaseinlinewithreformstopresumptivetaxesandtothe
     the
system o f simplified taxes and the encompassing o f the agriculture sector from 2009
onwards to conform to WTO rules. But such an improvement can be sustained only if
determined efforts are made at tightening customs and tax administration.                   In this
connection, fresh initiatives are being implementedto reinvigorate cooperation between
these two services involving information exchange, risk management and enforcement.

42.      Questions also arise as to the capacity of the economy to efficiently absorb
large volume of external grant funds that may flow from the Millennium Challenge
Account and to ensure a high quality o f public expenditures. To the extent grant funds
and rising public investment finance imports, the economy will be shielded from Dutch
disease effects. But rising investment will place additional demands on an already
overheating construction sector and lead to further wage rises. Public expenditures must
shift from wages to items that enhance service quality, e.g., in the planning and
management o f infrastructure services, curricular reform and education aids, broadening
o f education services, primary health care, and in improvements in the poverty benefit.
The authorities should stand ready to tighten the fiscal stance by squeezing low priority
spending if evidence o f crowding out o f private investment appears and also inthe event
o f overheating o fthe economy.

43.     A sharper strategic approach to capital spending based on an overall public
investment plan that explicitly makes sector choices is also necessary, particularly in the
context o f the M C A disbursements. The revised PRSP accords due importance to this
need. Inthis context, the implementation o f policy adaptations that are proposed in the
programmatic public expenditure review, prepared with the close participation o f the
authorities, relating to public finance management and the integrated management and
budgeting o f infrastructure would be important and would be a focus o f the dialogue
betweenthe authorities andthe Bank inthe coming months.

13The Gross Compliance Rate (GCR) measuresthe revenue forgone both as a result of exemptions and tax
evasion, and hence measures weaknesses in both tax policy and tax administration.The GCR for VAT is

44.     The mediumterm growth potential of the economy is sensitive to improvements
inthe business climate and inparticular to establishing fair conditionsfor competition.
Inthis connection, firm adherenceto the governance agenda, both inpublic governance
and in corporate governance, would be essential. Growth will necessitate diversification
up the knowledge-intensive supply chain, making best use of the technical skills of the
labor force, and will have to be basedincreasingly on the exports of services.

45.     The budget for 2008.        The draft 2008 budget is broadly in line with the
government program, with the deficit in relation to GDP projected at 2.2 per cent,
somewhat higher from the level expected in 2007. Current expenditures are projected at
around 18 percent of GDP, partly reflecting more than 60 percent increase in pension
expenditures plannedfor 2008. Capital expendituresare projected at around 5 percent of
GDP as compared to the expected level of 4.6 percent in 2007. The draft budget
envisages an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.8 percentagepoint which would bring
this ratio to 16.3 percent in 2008. Such an increase in tax revenues is planned to be
achieved through improved tax administration, particularly with regard to large tax
payers.    Nevertheless, this rise represents an ambitious target, particularly as the
authorities have undertaken to eliminate arrears in VAT refunds and to eschew ad hoc
efforts at tax collection. The budget continues a shift in spending towards poverty
fighting programs, particularly inthe social sectors.

46.     The deficit will be financed by external concessionalloans that will provide more
thanhalf of the total deficit financing, with the remaining financing being provided by a
substantial increase in the stock of government securities.      This planned rise in the
volume of securities will provide instruments for sterilization to the central bank and will
assist inthe deepening of capital markets. Overall, the 2008 budget is consistent with the
maintenance of macroeconomic stability, and fiscal policy continues to place high
priority on poverty reduction expenditures.

StrengtheningPublic Governanceand the Fight against Corruption

47.     Over the past few years, the record on governance performance has been mixed.
According to the 2005 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS), corruption is perceived by about 30 percent of Armenian firms to be a
significant constraint to doing business, nearly as many as for the average in other CIS
and ECA countrie~.'~In several areas, there has been a disconcerting increase in the
perception of corruption in Armenia. While only 5 percent of firms reported frequent
unofficial payments to deal with taxes and tax collection in 2002, for example, this had
increased to 18 percent in 2005. Other areas in which a higher proportion of firms
reported having to frequently pay bribes were obtaining government contracts, dealing
with customshmports, and dealing with courts. The Life in Transition Survey (LITS) of
the fall of 2006 made clear that the general population also makes unofficial payments
relatively frequently for many services. While unofficial payments for many services are
relatively frequent, the overall picture is somewhat less stark: firms in the BEEPS
reported bribery to be less frequent overall than in other countries - 10 percent of firms


14Anti-CorruptioninTransition3", (ECA Region, World Bank, 2006).


                                            19

surveyed said that they frequently paid bribes, compared to over 25 percent in CIS
countries and 20 percent in the ECA region. According to Transparency International's
2006 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Armenia ranks 93rd out o f 163 countries
surveyed, with a CPI o f 2.9, which compares well with respect to the CIS group.

48.      Since end-2003, the authorities have been implementing an official anti-
corruption action plan. Armenia joined the Group o f Corruption Fighting Countries
(GRECO) in 2004 and adopted OECD recommendations on eliminating corruption in
transitional countries.         The government twice initiated activities for updating
anticorruption strategy and the action plan, to include a second stage o f measures to
improve the transparency o f public sector management, but in both cases the efforts were
not completed and formalized in form o f new policy documents.                 Development and
implementation o f a new anti-corruption agenda will remain a key part o f the dialogue
withthe Bank.

49.      The current official strategy i s generally sound and consistent with the Bank's
recommended best practices on combating corrupti~n.'~It includes key public sector
management reforms; actions to build a competitive private sector; measures to address
political and public accountability; and efforts to increase civil society voice and
participation. Gaps, however, still remain. As noted, there have been setbacks between
2002 and 2005 in areas such as state capture, frequency o f bribery in tax administration,
and corruption as a problem in doing business.'6 Further specificity inmeasures will be
essential and effective monitoring mechanisms need to be developed. Sustained, high
level commitment to advancingthe agenda i s also critical to success.

50.      Earlier draft amendments to the government Anti-Corruption Strategy, for which
the Bank produced comments and passed to the International Anti-Corruption Working
Group chaired by OSCE, were based on GRECO recommendations.                           The current
leadership o f the Anticorruption Monitoring Commission has initiated efforts to update
the strategy but little progress is evident. The government will maintain a focus on
improving the transparency o f public sector management. Tracking progress with the
anti-corruption agenda will remain a key part o f the dialogue with the Bank over the
medium term.

51.     The PRSC program has provided support to the governance strategy.                    The
government's principal measures included public administration reforms directed at the
two principal revenue-raising agencies, tax and customs administrations, reforms in the
judiciary, actions to build a competitive private sector and higher public financial audit
and accounting standards. A progressive planfor the strengthening o f the large tax payer
unit has been implemented with good results in revenues raised. The authorities begun
gradual introduction o f self assessment in taxes and have begun implementation. In
addition, a law on electronic signature and document was approved and i s under
implementation - this law would help to reduce the interface between tax payers and

63 andBox 2.3.

officials to the benefit o f governance. The benefits o f this measure would be reinforced
by the government's strategy on e-procurement intended to further diminishopportunities
for corruption during public procurement transactions.

52.      Inthe area ofpublic management reforms, substantial results have beenachieved.
Budgets follow GFS classification standards, with integrated charts o f accounts and
reporting standards. Program budgeting has been piloted in key spending ministries. In
the area o f civil service reforms, the major achievement over the PRSC period was
developing a staff performance appraisal system for civil servants to allow for a merit
based wage and bonus system, which will now be piloted. The civil service base pay was
increased by 50 percent in2006 and almost 20 percent in 2007 to improve comparability
with private sector pay. The authorities are now developing proposals on (i)strategy to
                                                                                 a
introduce formal work plans for civil service bodies, which would detail the tasks o f each
structural division and individual civil servant; (ii)the introduction o f the human resource
management information system to facilitate performance appraisal procedures; and (iii)
reforms o f the pay grid and base rate.

53.      Internal audit functions have been reformed. Finally, legislative changes have
been drafted so as to define state non commercial entities and an appropriate reporting
framework is being established.

54.      Sustained high level commitment to advance the governance agenda remains
critical. The PRSC-supported reform agenda focused on strengtheninggovernance in the
two principal revenue-raising agencies. The key reform actions supported by PRSCs
have been chosen on the basis o f the expected impact on the criteria o f efficiency and
probity as well as their business impact.

55.      Strengtheningtax administration." Despite steps taken inthe last few years to
strengthen tax administration - the establishment o f a large tax payer unit dedicated to
fighting cases o f evasion, the introduction o f tax identificationnumbers, the development
o f tax manuals and an information website, revisions to the criminal code and to audit
practices as well as planning the implementation o f self assessment - tax administration
has serious weaknesses that represent an impediment to the efficient collection raising of
revenues, to probity in government and to business activity. The presence o f a large
shadow economy has aggravated the situation. The state tax service (STS) has, until
recently, been dealing with these impediments in a reactive rather than strategic manner.
Significant reform efforts began with the initiation o f the PRSC program and recently led
to the formulation o f a triennial plan for strengthening tax administration that covers
several key areas.     The plan should be strengthened in certain aspects relating to
functional organization and strategic planning. Evidence suggests that reforms over the
PRSC period have begunto exert a significant impact on raising the tax to GDP ratio.

56.      The self-assessment system. Recent reform efforts have centered on the option
provided to taxpayers to send their tax returns by posts or submit their returns
electronically.    Furthermore, tax education and assistance has been initiated and


l7Matrix 1.2 (a).


                                           21

dedicated telephone lines have been arranged in each tax inspectorate to respond to
taxpayers' inquiries. Attempts have been made to automate tax administration and
strengthen audit capacity. A national audit strategy has been approved. The tax service
will need to continue with determined implementation o f the next phases o f the reform
over the next two to three years for a fully functional system o f self-assessment to be in
place.

57.     PRSC-IV supported the next phase o f reforms. A series of measures have been
adopted aimed at promoting the development o f the self-assessment system. A review o f
the return submission and processing, including processes, procedures and technologies,
was conducted with a view to improve their effectiveness and accuracy. A separate
division for taxpayer service has been established withinthe STS headquarters designated
for (i)defining the policies and procedures o f taxpayer education and assistance for tax
inspectorates, (ii)overseeing the performance o f taxpayer service divisions o f tax
inspectorates, and (iii)managing the taxpayer education and assistance operations
throughout the STS. The capability o f this unit was built up.

58.     Under PRSC-IVYthe near term agenda for reforms was fleshed out. A work plan
for improving the enforcement o f the Law on Declaring Individuals' Property and
Income was developed.        STS proposes to issue a decree on abolishing the recording
commissions during the course of 2008.          A pilot for an automated system is being
developed for generating periodic list o f non-fillers or payment defaulters which will be
used for generating reminders for such defaulters.       The full roll-on o f the automated
system inother tax inspectorates will be accomplished in2008.

59.     The large taxpayer unit. The administrative and audit capacity o f the LTU was
strengthened under the PRSC-supported program inter alia through merging the central
audit department into LTU and increasing the number o f days permitted for concluding
an audit. Reforms focused on legislative initiatives to facilitate effective tax audits and
on development o fpersonnel, institutional and administrative infrastructures in support o f
LTU. An annual audit plan based on risk classification, priorities and targets was
introduced.    Other measures, such as periodic publication o f the list o f 300 large
taxpayers and changes in the management practices greatly helped to increase the
productivity o f this unit.

60.     PRSC-IV supported building institutional capability inspecialized audits (related
to excises, banks, and mining sectors)     --  the most important function o f an LTU. A
national audit strategy was approved and the development o f risk-based selection criteria
for taxpayers to be audited and the preparation o f audit guidelines took place. Under
PRSC-IVY annual action plans were developed to improve the performance o f tax
inspectorates servicing large taxpayers. A decree was issuedestablishing objective set o f
criteria for the selection o f large taxpayers. An analysis was carried out to identify large
taxpayers in the profitable but hard-to-tax sectors (e.g., construction, energy, etc.) for
specialized audit within the LTU. Preliminary data suggests that the proportion o f
declarations submittedby post or electronically, as a percentage o f total declarations filed
in LTU has been gradually increasing; it is 30 percent higher than last year.              A
mechanism for cross verification o f information accumulated at the LTU i s being


                                            22

developed in order to improve the effectiveness o f using third parties information for
carrying out audit and the STS i s procuring software to facilitate information matching.
Finally, a review o f the functions and staffing o f tax inspectorates servicing large
taxpayers was conducted.       The STS i s preparing a work plan for moving to the
organizational structure recommended inthe functional review.

61.     Reducing arrears for VAT refunds. Since 2004 the government has made efforts
to amortize the stock o f VAT refund obligations to exporters and significant progress was
made. However, most recent evidence indicates a recrudescence o f the problem with a
build up in delays. It is suggested by enterprises that such a build-up is related to
attempts to satisfy revenue targets that the government sets the tax administration.
Delays in refunds have become a serious impediment to the proper functioning o f VAT;
they raise the cost o f doing business and weaken competitiveness. To a degree, the
problem is associated with the proliferation o f bogus claims o f VAT refund.          The
authorities have agreed on a series o f measures to eliminate the stock o f arrears by end-
2007. Moreover, reforms to the tax code that are planned in 2008 will strengthen VAT
administration andprevent a re-emergence o f the problem.

62.     Strengthening customs administration.18Customs services have been plagued
with inefficiencies, clearance procedures have until recently remained archaic, and a high
degree of discretion in service provision existed; it i s now reduced. Survey data point to
customs practices as a major impediment to governance and an efficient business
environment. The reform program introduced transparent and swift procedures destined
to facilitate trade while safeguarding revenue collection in line with established
international good practice.

63.     Over the PRSC program, significant structural improvements were achieved in
customs administration, such as the introduction o f modern software and improved
personnel practices. The central reform was the institution o f direct trader input (DTI)
that currently covers about 70 percent o f imports, DTI has initiated a systemic change
away from the intimate involvement o f customs officials at the declaration validation
stage, where opportunities for discretionary behavior are rife. The system has the
capability to provide for immediate validation and assessment o f acceptable declarations.
                                                                                    --
based automated customs data system (TWM) -- i s phased in, the direct interface o f
When these reforms are consolidated and further extended as modern software           web-

traders and customs brokers with customs officials will be practically eliminated.

64.     Under PRSC-IV, the working o f DTI was made increasingly effective through
the implementation o f a comprehensive post-release review program for imports. Such a
program i s an essential element o f the rules-based and risk-based approach to the
administration o f imports. The post release review program has required a review o f
work processes within the current post clearance audit division and customs houses, a
regular assessment o f performance, and personnel training. The post-release reviews are
being increasingly effective in ensuringproper customs administration whilst minimizing



  Matrix, 1.2 (b).


                                          23

the opportunities for poor governance. The state customs administration (SCC) will add
to the staff of the post-releasereview unit.

65.      PRSC-IV also supported the detailed preparatory technical work, involving the
central bank, commercial banks, the SCC, importers and brokers, for the introduction of a
bank guarantee mechanism for approved importers. Such a scheme would greatly
facilitate the smooth flow of imports, strengthen the rules-basedregime, reduce risks, and
minimize the interface between importers and customs officials as is the case in all
advanced countries. Legislative amendments for the implementation of guarantees were
approved by the government at end-September 2007 and will now be sent to the
parliament for adoption.

66.      Progress has also been made in selectivity of customs control. A risk-based
systemwas introduced under the PRSC program; and genuine green channel selections at
Yerevan custom houses rose from practically nil in 2005 to around 15 percent in 2006.
Under PRSC-IVYconditions were establishedfor the use of risk-based selectivity to rise
once the planned introduction of a modern selectivity module at all networked customs
locations takes place later in 2007. This will lead to a progressively rising proportion of
imports being routed through green channel outright release. Reforms in this area under
the PRSC program have led to greater automaticity and predictability in clearance of
goods, reduced discretion and lowered business costs.          The reform program has
introduced transparent and swift procedures destined to facilitate trade while
safeguardingrevenue collection inline with establishedinternational good practice.

67.      Improve public financial managementfunctions. The reforms, supported by
the PRSC program, were directed at achieving greater budget transparency and
accountability, improvingbudget planning and expenditures; and strengtheningthe public
procurement system.

68,      Budget management.l   9 Reforms focused on (i)   improving budget classifications
andpublic sector accounting and reporting standards and ensuring that the 2008 budget is
generally consistent with GFS classification and chart of accounts, (ii)advancing in
introduction of the program budgeting, (iii)reducing fiscal risk by strengthening financial
management and reporting by the State Non-Commercial Organizations (SNCOs), and
(iv) strengthening institutional arrangementsfor internal and external audit.

69.      Budget classification andpublic sector accounting and reporting standards. The
government advanced well in its initiative to improve budget classifications, accounting
and reporting standards, and envisages basing the 2008 budget on GFS 2001 principles
and progressively introducing IPSAS accounting standards in the public sector. The
action plan on "Implementation of the Cash basis IPSAS and transition to an accrual
based full IPSAS" has been adopted; furthermore, the ministry of finance with US
Treasury Support has developed a new comprehensive chart of accounts, compliant with
GFS 2001 classifications and the cash basis IPSAS. Detailed implementation manuals
have also been introduced, which facilitated initial implementation of the new chart of


l9Matrix 1.3 (a).


                                           24

accounts in pilot agencies in 2006. Over the next year, initiatives will focus on ensuring
performance reporting and adjusting budget execution practices in pilot ministries to
comply with program budgeting requirements.

70.     Internal audit.    The government progressed well in adopting internal audit
structures and implementing key actions in accordance with its 2005-2008 internal audit
strategy.    In particular, a separate unit established in the ministry o f finance has
developed an internal auditors training and certification strategy, three pilot agencies
have been selected and the new system is under implementation in those agencies. The
ministry o f finance has also taken the important step o f setting up a department, which
over the next year, will focus on assessingthe quality o f internal audits undertaken inline
ministries, and o f internal audit arrangements in place in these ministries (rather than
conducting inspections itself).  The ministry o f finance has drafted a law on the internal
audit which i s in line with the best international practices and the adoption o f the law by
the parliament is expected by the end o f 2007. Public sector internal audit standards and
internal audit manual are being developed based on the principles set inthe draft law.

71.     State non-commercial enterprises (SNCO).            SNCOs emerged from recent
decentralization reforms in the social sector, in which a large number o f budgetary
institutions in education, health and cultural sectors were granted autonomy and left the
Treasury financial accounting net. The creation o f SNCOs implied an ex ante loss o f
control by Treasury on commitments and expenditures and also, in the absence o f an
adequate financial reporting system, an ex post lack of supervision and control.
Legislation has been drafted to clarify the definition o f diverse SNCOs and establish an
appropriate SNCO reporting framework. The budgetary classification o f their resources
(subsidy/transfer for public and business NCOs, and to goods and services for entities
considered private), and adaptation o f the appropriate type o f financial reporting and
monitoring will be pursued over the next year.         Specific fiduciary control including
reporting andmonitoring guidelines are expected to be designedin2007.

72.      Other measures. Additional reforms relate to program budgeting, where the
government continues to build on steps taken since the 2003-04 budget to introduce
elements o f social sector program budgeting through collection o f information on
program descriptions and performance indicators. The government has piloted program
budgetingin selected ministries and is on course to extend this to all budget agencies by
the 2008 budget.

Strengthening Corporate GovernanceZ0

73.     Inparallel with the efforts on improving public governance, the authorities have
initiated a program to strengthen transparency and accountability o f the enterprise sector.
The first steps were to complete and publish a ROSC on corporate governance, using
OECD's corporate governance principles as a benchmark and to conduct workshops to
develop a consensus on reform. Under PRSC-supportedprogram, steps were taken to
improve bank governance with a June 2005 revised banking law that requires public


2oMatrix 1.4.


                                            25

disclosure o f the controlling owners o f banks and strengthens the powers and
accountability o f bank boards and shareholders' meetings.

74.     Under PRSC-IV, standards in corporate governance, as one o f the key triggers,
have been further improved with a focus on the most critical issue: transparency o f
ownership. Revisions to the law on registration o f legal entities are to be submitted for
Parliament's approval that require public access to the records in the business registry,
thus giving any member o f the public basic information regarding the founders o f that
legal entity at no charge (Le. legal name and its legal form, list o f founders and filing
date) and copies o f companies charters for a minimal administrative fee. The ministry o f
justice has prepared a draft government decree to this effect including the proposed plan
and timing o f the phased enforcement o f these requirements. Further issues related to
registration o f banks and other financial institutions, filing o f financial statements and
charters, annual updates o f the company filings and actual enforcement mechanisms will
be finalized following completion o f the upcoming Business Process and Organizational
Design Study for the business registry to be led by the ministryo fjustice, inconsultation
with other stakeholders such as ministry of finance, the central bank, and the tax
administration and statistics bodies. All these reform steps are essential transparency
requirements in line with good international practice and will help Armenia meet the
transparency requirements set under the EUdirectives.

75.     Inaddition, the central bank has submittedto the parliament changes to the Law
o f Securities Market Regulation requiringthat owners o f more then 2 percent o f publicly
traded companies must disclose their direct and indirect holdings. The definition o f
indirect holdings closely follows the requirements o f the EU's Transparency Directive.
Once approved, the central bank will issue an instruction to the central depository to
publishthis information on its website. Finally, as a further measure to improve corporate
governance, the central bank and the stock will develop a corporate governance code for
companies listed on the stock exchange.

Expected Results

76.     National output is projected to grow by 65 percent over the 2004-08 period, with
income per head approximating $2200 in constant 2004 dollars. Inflation i s expected to
be kept at 3 percent (end o f period basis) throughout 2004-08, consistent with fiscal
deficits around 2% percent o f GDP, on the basis o f tax revenues rising from the
equivalent o f 14 percent o f GDP in2003 to 16%percent o f GDP in2008.

77.     Key institutional outcomes are expected to be the attainment o f international
standards in customs control and intax administration, the adoption o f GFS 2001 budget
classifications and IPSAS cash basis standards in all ministries, budget execution reports
to contain both financial and non-financial performance indicators, staff performance
appraisal system in implementation in pilot ministries, adherence to the international
standards and best practices in internal and external auditing, the internal audit system
being fully in place in pilot ministries, non-commercial organizations complying with
financial reporting requirements, and electronic procurement introduced. The efficiency




                                          26

o f capital markets, the volume o f listing o f companies and of share trading will benefit
from stricter corporate governance standards.

         Theme 2: Sharpening Competition and Entrenching Property Rights

78.     The maintenance o f growth at the potential rate o f the economy over the medium
term will require improved confidence in property rights and the predictability o f the
regulatory regimes. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f key services such as
aviation, railways, telecommunications, and continued reform inpublic utilities continues
to be a highpriority.

Competition

        (a) Liberalization in key services

79.     Liberalization in international civil aviation.21      For a landlocked country and
particularly one that is subjected to closures of its two principal borders, the quality and
price o f civil air services is a critical element o f economic development policy. Technical
improvements in aircraft efficiency and new business models have significantly lowered
prices in economically de-regulated aviation markets. In contrast, the government, in
entering into agreements with other countries, has operated a restrictive civil aviation
policy, e.g. by requiring some foreign airlines to enter into agreements with Armenian
firms in regard to sharing o f increased services before the increased services can be
permitted to be operated, and by not permitting airlines intermediate and beyond rights.
The local airline company has been granted exclusive rights to Armenia's international
air services. The airline, via the commercial agreement with the government, specifying
these rights, also has an effective veto on government decisions to permit additional
services where it would be adversely affected (arguably any new service).

80.     Within PRSC-supportedprogram, the government adopted a decision announcing
its intention to expand participation in provision o f international aviation services, raise
efficiency and cut costs. Inaddition, the government has also adopted a policy statement
with more liberal and flexible stance to civil aviation and indicating the simplification o f
procedures and publishedthis policy statement. The policy reflects the existence o f the
commercial agreement with Armavia and a policy concern about service continuity ifthe
Armenian airline is weakened by increased competition.

81.     As a result o f these measures, inthe first two quarters o f 2007, the number o f air
transport passengers increased by 24 percent compared to the same period o f 2006; the
air freight volumes have also increased by 6 percent over the same period. However, the
overall performance o f the air services market has been lagging behind the robust
economic growth over the past several years. The flight frequencies continue to be quite
low, the connections are quite limited and the services prices are high. The continued
existence o f the commercial agreement severely constrains normal government policy
choices.


  Matrix 2.1 (a).


                                              27

82.     Under PRSC-IV the government made sound progress in satisfying the pre-
conditions (including signing o f the air services safety agreement) for signing o f an Open
Skies agreement with the United States.         Negotiations are progressing towards the
signature o f the Open Skies agreement. The benefits o f such an agreement would be
maximized only once direct US-Armenia flights take place.

83.     The government has made sound progress towards signing "horizontal" aviation
agreement with the EU, which will allow amending all air service agreements with EU
nations to replace "national" airlines with "EU" airlines. The "horizontal" agreement
negotiations were completed and the agreement was sent to the relevant government
agencies and bodies for final review. The "horizontal" agreement i s scheduled to be
signed by the year-end. This i s a liberalizing measure, the benefits o f which would be
maximized only if the restrictive aspects o f existing agreements with individual EU
countries (e.g. no more than daily flights, with narrow body aircraft in the case o f the
UK) are removed. It would allow Armenia to subsequentlyenter into the EUequivalent
o f an open skies agreement as signed between the EU and Morocco. Once again, the
existing commercial agreement would give Armavia a right o f veto on this.

84.     Improving efficiency in railways. The government has adopted a restructuring
plan for railways based on a vertically integrated concession for railway services. In
early 2007, a working group was established to implement the restructuring.             The
concession process is underway. The government has also prepared the draft railway law
providing for competitive infrastructure access regime, liberalized pricing o f services,
oversight and safety regimes.

Regulatory Reform in State Owned Utilities22

85.     The utility sector has undergone extensive reforms in recent years. The private
sector participation increased through trade sales, leases, and management contracts. The
Public Service Regulatory Commission (PSRC) has established a direct contracting
mechanism between the power distribution company and the generators and service
providers and abolished the state electricity wholesale company, thereby greatly
enhancing the transparency o f the power sector operations. Following the successful
experience with the energy regulation, regulatory functions in the drinking water,
irrigation and telecommunication sectors were transferred to the PSRC.             Under the
PRSC-supported      reforms,    the government        adopted    the     Integrated Financial
Rehabilitation Plan (IFRP) for public utilities (electricity, drinking water, irrigation and
urban electric transport), which served as guidance for policy development and reforms,
encompassing service provision rules, service quality monitoring indicators, public
disclosure on the service quality, and the responsibilities o f utility companies.

86.      In 2006-2007, the PSRC adopted the service quality indicators and monitoring
system for electricity and drinking water sectors - these show a steady, impressive
improvement instandards.

87.      Increasing competition in telecommunication^.^^       Telecom infrastructure and
services have registered substantial improvements over the PRSC period, but still remain
below CIS averages.         Conditions for competition are being established under the
oversight o f the Public Services Regulatory Commission PSRC.            A second mobile
operator i s now functioning, with substantial benefits to consumers and the economy
from increased competition and innovation. The granting o f the third GSM license for
mobile telephone service i s allowed in2009.

88.      The PSRC substantially revised the license o f the fixed line operator to eliminate
its monopoly rights. Also, after the abolition o f exclusive rights to provide internet
services, 29 private operators applied and received licenses for construction o f such
networks. The number o f mobile telephone service subscribers more than doubled within
the last two years.

89.      Inthis situation, further competition inthe sector and development o fthe services
i s largely dependent on the availability o f radio frequency spectrum and the PSRC's
overall regulatory policy and licensing policy. Though the legal and regulatory
framework currently allows full liberalization the PSRC i s inclined to proceed cautiously
inpermittingentry because of concerns over the position of incumbents with their sunk
investments. The Bank continues the dialogue with PSRC with a view to encourage an
early fully liberal approach given the net economic benefits it offers to Armenia, while
respecting the statutory independence o f the PSRC.

90.      Under the      PRSC-supported program,        the  parliament   enacted a new
telecommunications law and initiated the development o f a modernregulatory framework
to allow for progressive licensing of additional telecommunication service providers. In
addition, the PSRC developed a telecommunications sector regulatory policy. The new
regulatory policy stance aimed at further liberalization o f telecommunication sector,
ensuringo f effective use o f spectrum, protection o f market competition, and development
o f a universal service policy.

91.      Under PRSC-IVYthe government has adapted the Armenian Table of (Radio)
Frequency Spectrum Allocations as requiredby the Law on Electronic Communication to
ensure its compliance with the International Telecommunication Union's Table o f
Frequency Allocations. The resulting radio spectrum policy expressed in the new table
will specify the spectrum available for commercial uses that can be allocated by the
PSRC.       A working group has been established to develop the detailed frequency
allocations. The government has committed to approving a satisfactory table by end-
2007. There are risks that sub-optimal amounts o f spectrum get allocated to potential
commercial uses, that the amounts allocated are tied to specific uses or technologies (as
against allowing users to make their own choices, subject to checks on interference). The


23 Matrix 2.l(a).


                                            29

PSRC should also move expeditiously to allocate the available commercial spectrum.
Technical assistance i s being provided to ensure that the government is fully informed on
the policy choices available before it approves the final spectrum policy and table.

EntrenchingProperty Rights

92.     The chief deficiencies inthe area o f property rights stemmed from weaknesses in
the enforcement o f collateral - a factor that has hobbled the development o f the financial
sector and raised the cost o f capital for firms. The business climate has continued to
improve as a result o f measures supported by the PRSC program: strengthening the
financial regulatory environment, legal rights, credit information, property registration as
well as contract enforcement. Despite these improvements Armenia remains an economy
with shallow financial intermediation markets, which constitute an obvious handicap to
future self-sustained growth. At 2006, the private sector credit and deposit to GDPratios
were 9.0 percent and 10.2percent, respectively.

93.     Under the PRSC program, the government enforced legislative changes to
strengthen creditor rights, improve civil procedures for debt recovery, and simplify
procedures for certification o f property sales and registration o f secured credit. These
legislative amendments and the new facility for registering pledges o f moveable property
in the central cadastre registry provide an adequate legal framework for most secured
credit transactions used inArmenia.

94.     The reforms described above are expected to create the conditions for the
deepening o f financial intermediation.     Regulatory reforms in the banking industry
sponsored by the central bank are highly significant in this regard.         Following on
strengthening o f banking supervision practices that were recommended by an FSAP
update in 2005, under the PRSC program, the efforts o f the authorities - principally the
central bank - shifted to the implementation o f modernized corporate governance laws
for the banking industry. Furthermore, to ensure the continued stability o f banking and
capital markets, the authorities instituted a unified supervision regime that is being
gradually implemented with the abolition o f security exchange and insurance
inspectorates and moving their responsibilities under the auspices o f the central bank.
Finally, under the PRSC program, the authorities ensured that the insurance industry
complied with updated regulations, minimum capital requirement for insurance
companies were raised and an actuarial system established. The authorities believe that
the proposedunified supervisionregime would benefit the insurance industryas well.

95.     The next stage o f reforms builds on the above achievements. The civil code will
be strengthened by incorporating rules that provide for bulk transactions in secured credit
such as inventory or accounts receivable financing. Inthe area o f movable property and
leases, the pledge registry will be consolidated; furthermore, the current restrictive list o f
assets eligible for registration will be liberalized and the registry upgraded to an
electronic platform. The enforcement o f court decisions i s expected to improve by virtue
o f recent legal amendments that bolster incentive compensation for enforcement agents,
but further amendments are necessary and are being worked on that would discourage
dilatory tactics byjudgment debtors. Public auctions o f pledgedproperty should be made


                                            30

more efficient. The Second Judicial Reform Project will finance a feasibility study for
the introduction of a private bailiff service that could replace or work inparallel with the
ministry of justice's Enforcement Service Department.         Based on the findings o f the
study the project could support the piloting of a private bailiff system in Armenia.
Finally, the central bank will build up the unified supervision capability and begin to
realize its benefits.

Expected Results

96.     The improved competition environment will be evident ina sharp fall intransport
costs in aviation and rail services and in quality gains in utilities services in line with
quantitative indicators set as minimum service quality standard for frequency and
duration o f available service. A new telecommunication policy would make possible the
entry o f a third GSMoperator. The entrenchment o f property rights i s expected to lead to
an expansion of financial intermediation with increases in credit extended (as costs and
risks associated with secured transactions fall) and in deposit mobilization by banks (as
confidence grows). A near four-fold rise in insurance activities i s expected over a three
year period.

                   Theme 3: Mitigating Social and Environment Risks

97.     Despite the recent strong gains inpoverty reduction, vulnerable population groups
continue to require well-designed social protection program. Key medium term
challenges lie in (i) ensuring adequate functioning of the public pension program and
reforming the system along multi-pillar lines; (ii)sustaining cash social assistance
programs, while developing social work and care services; and (iii)       focusing on labor
market policies that will foster efficient functioning o f labor markets by protecting
workers, not jobs.    Further reforms in education and health focus on raising quality o f
service provision, aiding human capital formation in high pay-off areas such as early
childhood education, and an attack on non-communicable diseases. The mainstreaming
o f environment factors into sector policy formulation and re-shaping policies to reduce
degradation and reduce the vulnerability o f the poor to natural calamities lie at the heart
o f reducing environmental risks.

Improving Social Protection and Social Risk ManagemenP4

98.     Achievements in the battle against poverty have been greatly assisted by the
introduction in recent years o f targeted social assistance, including development o f a
proxy-means targeting mechanism, regular adjustments in the targeting mechanism to
make it more focused on the very poor, the development o f an automated management
information and monitoring system and strong rise in resources for social assistance. In
pensions, the authorities developed a detailed framework for reform, and streamlined the
current pension system, introduced computerized individual records and strongly raised
pensions. A modern labor code is being implemented.




24Matrix 3.1.


                                            31

99.     Under PRSC-supported reforms, the family poverty benefit was sharpened as the
key poverty alleviation tool through: (i)real increases in the benefit; (ii)further
differentiation o f the benefit amount according to family social parameters; (iii)  regular
annual review o f the targeting formula, so as to allow for improvements in the benefit
targeting efficiency and effectiveness; (iv) continued monitoring and evaluation o f the
program's poverty impact; and (v) further improvements in benefit administration,
including staff training and improvements inthe management information system.

100.    Inthe area ofpensions, the PRSCprogram supported the design ofreforms inthe
overall system. The current pension system, though effective in reducing poverty,
generates small, almost flat income (the average replacement ratio i s at about 20 percent).
As such, it provides little incentive for participation, and the public views the system as
neither fair nor efficient. With this inmind, a strategy that envisages introduction o f a
diversified pension system was developed and technical work on the design o f the new
pension system commenced including modeling o f the fiscal consequences o f various
pension system design options.

101.    The reformed pension system consists o f four pillars: a "zeroy' pillar for all those
who for various reasons will not participate inthe new system (to be financed by the state
budget); a "first" pillar for all participants in the new system (to be financed form the
state budget), a "second" funded pillar from, and a voluntary pension pillar.

102.    The launching o f the multi-pillar pension reform and its implementation require
institutional readiness and human resource capacities. To this end, the Bank will remain
in close dialogue and will provide TA towards meeting the conditions required for
successful implementation o f the reform, such as the establishment o f an individual
records system; the re-equipping o f the unified financial markets supervisory body, the
identification o f capital marketconstraints and steps to address them.

Raisingthe Quality of Education25

103.    Under PRSC-supported reforms, a substantial increase in the public spending in
education has occurred, directed to the general education sector, with a strong increase in
teacher salaries (raised from extremely low levels).          Significant reforms towards
efficiency and effectiveness were achieved.

104.     The school rationalization program.          Under PRSC reform actions, the
government has continued to make progress in rationalizing schools and raising teacher
salaries by a further19.4 percent in2007, following a rise o f 16.1 percent in 2006 and o f
65 percent in 2005. In 2006, as a result o f the reforms, the pupil teacher ratio reached
13.8. and in 2007 14.0 The government has also reviewed the per capita financing
formula for general secondary schools; the new formula determines school funding
taking better account o f factors such as maintenance needs for buildings and higher costs
associated with certain geographical areas.          The government is also considering


''Matrix 3.2.


                                           32

amending the formula to account for the differences among levels o f education,
integration o f children with special needs, and other factors.

105.    Early childhood education. A strategy on early childhood development and pre-
school education for 2007-2010 was developed and a new law on Pre-school Education
was passed. Under PRSC program, the framework for standards on service provision for
early childhood education was to be developed. The Ministry o f Education and Science,
with the assistance of UNICEF, drafted these standards, which are now being tested. In
addition, the strategy will be piloted intwo regions where the preschool enrollment rate i s
among the lowest inthe country.

106.       Tertiary education. Under PRSC-supported program, the government worked
towards (a) developing sustainable mechanisms for financing institutions and students;
and (b) expanding the course credit system. The government has started the introduction
o f new financing mechanisms for scholarships and stipends, taking into account both
merit and social status. Discussions on a student loan scheme and adjustments to the
stipend system have been undertaken to ensure greater access by the poor. Decrees on
scholarships and stipends have been introduced in order to turn higher education more
accessible to those students showing high academic achievement in secondary education.
Moreover, a new "unified" university entrance examination was administered for the first
time in June 2007 under increased conditions o f transparency and objectivity. The
government has committed to integration in the European Higher Education Area by
signing the Bologna Declarationz6on the recognition o f higher education qualifications
and it is now working with the Council of Europe and with international donors to find
resources in order to help meeting the Bologna standard^.^' Higher education institutions
are in the process o f introducing and/or expanding the European Credit Transfer System
(ECTS) that would expand the opportunities for more flexible learning modes and the
introduction o f Life Long Learning approaches inArmenian Tertiary Education.

Controlling Risks in Health"

107.    Armenia health outcomes are at par with those o f countries at similar socio-
economic development and compares favorably with other CIS and those in developed
nations. At the same time, the post-transition drastic drop in public spending on health
care caused health facility use to be one-third o f that in countries with similar
epidemiological profiles. Health care utilization is significantly tilted against the poor
and the rural dweller. In 2004, public expenditures on health care accounted for 1.5
percent o f GDP, a rate that i s lower than the corresponding average GDP share for lower
income countries (2.5 percent). To provide adequate financial protection for the poor so
that they could access health services when needed would require increased public
funding and better targeting.



''ThisBologna
26    Accord created compatible higher education systems across signatory countries.
  The         process is currently the most important international policy forum on the development and
synchronization of higher education policies among European countries.
28Matrix 3.3.


                                                33

108.    Reforms supported under the PRSC program have been directed at enhancing
accessibility and quality of health services, especially for the poor, by increasing
spending in real terms on a sustainable basis; intra-sectoral reallocation of resources
towards more cost-effective care modalities (such as primary health care, especially in
rural areas); and optimization and efficiency improvements inthe hospital network across
the country to reach the productivity benchmarks set for the hospital system by 2009.
The reforms also covered strengthening governance of the health system. Furthermore,
non-communicable diseases program as well as introduction of voluntary private health
insurance was partof the PRSC reforms.

109.    Future reforms will support a continuation of the rise in allocations to health
spending in real terms. First, the focus will remain in strengthening primary health care
(PHC). Public spending inhealth has steadily increasing, reaching 1.6 percent of GDP in
2006 comparedwith 1.2 percent of GDP in2002. The bulk of the increasedresourcesare
being spent for the provision of PHC services and outpatient specialized services. In
particular, in 2006 the budget for PHC institutions, polyclinics and ambulatories,
increased by 13 percent as compared to 2005, while the budget for in-patient care
remained practically the same. In addition, further development o f legal and regulatory
framework for the expansion of PHC group practices is important.            In 2006, the
government began introducing a free-enrollment scheme that allows family physicians to
practice under appropriate legal environment and financial incentives. The abolition of
fees at PHC level has contributed to marked increase inthe access of poor to basic health
services, Further increase in the health budget, as provided for inthe 2007-2009 MTEF,
would be neededto sustainthese achievements.

110.    Second, the hospital rationalization program will remain a key element of the
reform strategy.    Rationalization in hospitals in Yerevan is progressing well, with
improvement in efficiency at merged hospitals as evidenced by increased utilization of
hospital services and a gradual decrease in the number of hospital contracts. At the
regional level, the government has developed rationalization plans for all marzes, which
will be followed by a time-bound implementation plan. The pilot program has been
initiated intwo marzes, where the efficiency gains from optimizations are expectedto be
the highest.

111.    Third, the strategy for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases
i s being implemented, with modest allocations in the 2007 health budget. However, the
detailed action planfor tackling the priority problems inthis area remains to be designed,
with athorough analysis of major risk factors contributing to increased incidence of non-
communicable diseases being a foundation of the action plan. The government will take
further step to prioritize comprehensive preventive and control measures on non-
communicable diseases that will be includedin 2008 budget along with the development
of sustainable monitoring and evaluation system to enable monitoring of intended
outcomes.

ReducingRisks in Natural Resource Managementfor SustainableLiveLiho~ds~~

112.    The main sources of environmental vulnerability consist o f deteriorating forest
stock, inadequate water supply and solid waste services, pollution o f water resources,
urban air pollution, significant soil erosion, increasing vulnerability of the rural
population to natural hazards, threats to biodiversity, and limited access to water and
sanitation to the poor in rural areas. The country's forest resources, in particular, have
been put under increased pressure due to uncontrolled and illegal logging for fuel and
industrial wood, non timber forest products, as well as grazing and hunting. While the
legislative framework for environmental management continues to develop, institutional
and administrative deficiencies have led to weak enforcement and low environmental
compliance.      The PRSC program supported the development o f forest code and
associated institutional strengthening.

113.    Illegal logging. While illegal logging is associated with firewood for household
heating, illegal commercial timber use is widespread.           A national action plan for
combating illegal logging has been approved and broad public discussion has been
initiated to increase public awareness on the need to combat illegal logging and introduce
the public to the scale and scope o f interventions required to prevent illegal logging.
These efforts are being complemented by investment projects in rural areas, such as
gasification o f villages.    Under PRSC-IV, coordination within the government, its
ministries and agencies, was radically improved so as to enable the establishment o f an
effective system for monitoring illegal logging. In addition, a number o f key indicators
to track illegal logging were adopted, essential to enable the monitoring center to monitor
logging activities.

114.    Supported by PRSC IVYthe government passed a decree that provides for modes
and mechanisms of monitoring illegal logging and assigns the formal responsibility for
this to the ministry o f agriculture, but the practical responsibility to an autonomous State
Forest Monitoring Center. The deputy prime minister will chair an oversight committee
consisting o f key ministers and agency heads to ensure the effective implementation o f
the policy. It will be particularly important to safeguard the autonomy o fthe monitoring
institution and its operation under clear, transparent rules. Inaddition, it will be important
that the oversight committee ensures that all state bodies such as customs and tax
administrations provide information and cooperate with the work o f monitoring illegal
logging.

Expected Results

115.    Rationalization o f schools and hospitals will remove inefficiencies and address
priorities issues inthese sectors and are expected to re-direct expenditures towards raising
school quality, primary health and family poverty benefits. Development o f a diversified
pension system i s expected to better protect retirement benefits. Livelihoods o f people,
especially the rural poor, are expected to improve through building capacity and

                                             35

strengthening environmental management and supervision institutions, particularly when
it comes to forestry and illegal logging.

                        Theme4: Modernizingthe RuralEconomy

116.     Agriculture accounts for the livelihoods for some 500,000 people, which is nearly
half o f total employment, and three times as many people as the sector employed prior to
independence. Key challenges are to increase productivity and farm incomes; further
develop the agro-processing industry, which i s a major source o f off-farm employment;
and encourage development o f commercial activities inrural areas.

117.     Stimulating farm incomes. The reform strategy supported by PRSC program i s
anchored in securing farm productivity gains. Small farms can be highly efficient, but
require access to productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies that also promote
sustainability o f land, water, pasture and forest resources. Effective market links for
small farmers - to service providers and input suppliers, to traders and to the processing
industry, and, to financial service providers are essential for achieving these gains.

118.     The main areas for reform are strengthening the de-centralized advisory services
system, improving access to planting material, and strengthening the management o f the
country's irrigation infrastructure and investments. The government i s committed to
developing a sustainable and well-functioning agricultural advisory system to help
farmers improve their productivity, quality o f production, and market access. To this
end, the government adopted a framework for agricultural extension, research and
education. All these efforts were supported by PRSCprogram.

119.     Seeds law. The government has made significant progress in regulating the seed
market and reduced uncontrolled seed imports and multiplication. A Seed Law has been
approved and seeds certification procedures have been adopted which provide a
satisfactory legal framework for development o f the seed sector and are in line with the
requirements o f OECD seed schemes and the EU's seed and planting material regime.
Under PRSC-supportedprogram, this law and certification procedures were put fully
into force.

120.     Food safety standards. Meeting food safety standards in a cost-effective way is
essential for Armenian producers and processors to improve their competitiveness in
export markets as well as meet increasing domestic consumer preferences for food
quality standards that match standards set by imports. Under PRSC reform program,
the government has continued work on harmonization of legislation and developing
standards.     In addition, the government is discussing widely with all stakeholders a
comprehensive framework for analysis, design and implementation o f capacity building
efforts inthe area o f food safety measures.

121.     Developing rural infra~tructure.~'One o f the legacies o f the Soviet Union i s an
extensive,     but now deteriorated        network   of    rural  infrastructure   -  roads,
telecommunications, water, and energy. In the initial decade o f the transition period,

30Matrix 4.2.


                                            36

minimal recurrent expenditure on the networks took place, with a deleterious impact on
their condition. The problem was compounded in many cases by the absence o f clear
lines of ownership and, hence, responsibility for the different levels o f networks. The
outcome is a broad mix o f network quality, ranging from a small proportion o f networks
ina reasonable condition, usually reflecting the capacity o f the local community for self-
governance, to those which are completely ineffectual. Despite receiving substantial
financing from donors, there i s a high rate o f failure among rural infrastructure
interventions.     This is because they are generally implemented at a local level,
independently from similar, or previous, initiatives in the same or other areas o f the
country. There has been progress with policy and legislative actions to foster
development o f rural infrastructure. In 2006, the Government passed the Law on
Automobile       Roads,  which clearly delineated the operational and ownership
responsibilities o f automobile roads and defined the accessibility o f a road for any
residential area. The Government reiterated its commitment to development o f rural
infrastructure and with support from M C C and ADB will rehabilitate a large section o f
lifeline road network.

122.     Infrastructure reforms.  The improvement o f rural infrastructure is recognized
explicitly by the government as a key element for rural poverty alleviation, acting as a
catalyst for development and enhancing access for rural communities to a broad range o f
essential social and commercial services. On the basis o f a diagnostic study prepared
under PRSC program, the government developed and initiated a rural infrastructure
strategy in order to address key reform actions necessary and take maximum advantage
o f the limited available resources. The action plan underlying this strategy was supported
by PRSC program. This plan focuses on dealing with the institutional reforms
necessary to support a sustained improvement in rural infrastructure services, such as (i)
the classification o f communities according to clearly defined criteria, (ii) definition o f
universal access concept and development o f adequate financing mechanisms, (iii)
delineation o f ownership and operational responsibilities, and (iv) introduction o f
simplified standards and newtechnology for rural infrastructure.

Expected Results

123.     A rural economy on the path o f modernization will see, by 2007/08, an
acceleration in productivity growth and cost recovery in areas served by extension
services and an increase in farmers access to advisory services and using recommended
practices. Farm output will benefit by raised standards in seed quality, and with the
development o f food safety standards, share o f agricultural products tested and certified
would significantly rise. The shift in emphasis in infrastructure services to the rural
economy with associated tilt in donor financing will result in a convergence o f quality
standards inutilities throughout the country.

                                          LESSONSLEARNED

124.     The sources of lessons learned from past Bank experience with development
policy lending are reviews preparedby OPCS, and, for Armenia-specific-operations, IEG
Country Assistance Evaluation and the region's CAS completion and progress reports.
Lessons learned that have informed the PRSC-supportedprogram have been summarized
in earlier PRSC documents. Specifically for PRSC-IV, lessons learned and utilized in
relation to design of conditionality are discussedinBox 2.

                            Box 2. Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Inthis box, an assessmentis made ofadherence to goodprinciplesonconditionalityinPRSCoperations.

Principle 1;Reinforce Ownership

This operation is based on PRSP developed in 2003, currently being updatedby the authorities. The PRSP was
prepared with wide consultation, including parliamentary involvement. The track record is one of strong
ownership and rigorousadherence to the PRSP-the medium term expenditure framework and the annual budget
are derivedstrictly from PRSP objectives, guidelines and spendingprograms. The policy choices are determined
by the authorities, with inputs from public and civic institutions. Analytic work supportedby the Bank feeds into
policy analysis and debate (notably economic reports, poverty assessments, tailored studies on governance,
infrastructurereforms and sector reforms, as well as comments on the annual MTEF, annual budgets and the
PRSPupdate itself).

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The policy matrix is the central accountability tool in conjunction with the letter of development policy. The
environment is results oriented and progress is tracked using agreed monitoring indicators. No other donor
providespolicy basedsupport usingany other ftamework.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank support to country circumstances

Bilateral aid is provided for investment projects. Through dialogue with the government and with donors, such
aid is designed to be complementary and best fit country needs; the Bank's dialogue with the Millennium
Challenge Corporationis the most notable example. TA from bilaterals and other IFIs is also well coordinated.

speeches andgovernment statements.

Principle 4: Choose only actionscriticalfor achieving resultsas conditionsfor disbursement

All triggers in programmatic development policy lending take the form of agreed prior actions to reflect high
PRSP priorities and Bank's CAS objectives. They are implemented within the agreedaccountability framework
as described above. The PRSC-I11operation is limited to ten triggers andthe proposedPRSC-IV is designed with
six triggers.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-basedfinancial
support

Reviews focus on actions and on their contribution to results within the accountability matrix and the CAS-
supported results framework. Performance reviews are quarterly, support is provided within an annual budget
cycle andbuilt intothe budget financingestimate andBank support volumes are made known well inadvance.

125.  As the PRSC reforms have progressed over the past three and a half years, the
government has increasingly chosen its reform priorities independently and embedded
them within the context of the PRSP. The government took the lead in executing the
PHRD grant and has been a highly efficient user of the results of technical assistance.
Notably, in PRSC-IV reforms in civil aviation, telecommunications, corporate
governance and the monitoring system for illegal logging were selected by the
government based on PHRD-financed inputs. The government also took the initiative to
design reforms in tax and customs administrations using PHRD assistance. Letters of
Development Policy are drafted entirely by the government and then discussed with the
Bank team. This evolution towards a near-complete degree of design and ownership of
reforms has undoubtedly made a large contribution towards their sustainability.

2005-08 CAS (see Box 3) which was discussed by the Board inmid-2004 and focused on
three main objectives: (i)
                         promoting private sector led economic growth; (ii)making
growth more pro-poor; and (iii)reducing non-income poverty. The CAS envisioned the
PRSCprogram as the key element insupporting PRSP implementation.

127.     A CAS-Progress Report was considered by the Boardjointly with the PRSC-I11
operation inMarch2007. The CAS ProgressReport reaffirms the validity of the strategy,
point to the substantial achievements over the last two years, and reaffirms the intention
of the PRSC-IV as envisaged inthe CAS high case. The PRSC program is therefore fully
consistent with the CAS-PRYand complements other IDA assistance activities being
extended or planned, such as programmatic credits in the health sector. The PRSC
program is also well aligned with the current exercise under way within the government
to update the PRSP which i s expectedto be completed by the end of 2007 inwhich Bank
staff are playing a strong advisory role and with the 2008 budget. Finally, the PRSC
preparation is closely coordinated with the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF).

128.    There are strong complementarities between the PRSC program and the Bank's
lending activities (Table 5).   For example, the PRSC supports achievement of Public
Sector Modernization Project and the Second Judicial Reform Project's objectives by
strengthening the institutional capacity to implement reforms in internal and external
audits and electronic procurement.      Likewise, the PRSC promotes competition and
regulatory reform, thereby adding to the effectiveness of the Enterprise Incubator,
Investment and Export Facilitation Project and rural enterprise projects, which are
addressing important constraints to private sector development. In strengthening the
mitigation of social and environment risks, the PRSC program provides the incentives
and means for policy reforms and rationalization in institutions in education, health and
social protection, and in environment -thus complementing the investment operations in
these sectors which provide resources for capacity building. Similarly, with regard to
modernization of the rural economy, the proposed PRSC.provides the policy reform
support for a number of investment operations inthese areas.

129.    Much of the remaining funding from the Bank in FY07-08 will be focused on
extending ongoing operations and follow a high case scenario with around $25 million to
be provided in FY08 focusing on fiduciary and governance issues (a total of $226
betweenFY05-08). Inaddition, a first IBRDloan is being preparedand may be extended
inFY08 inanamount ofUS$lOmillionfor railways.

beenunderlaid by a range of economic and sector work. Specifically, the PRSC program
capitalized on the growth and the public expenditure reviews prepared during 2002-06.

131.    The Japanese government-provided PHRD grants (totaling US$2.5 million) for
the PRSC series have been critical to the success of the PRSC program. These grants
have financed vitally-needed studies across the entire reform agenda.

133.    In the context o f the implementation of the first PRSP and preparation of the
second one, the government has developed an active role in coordinating the large
number of donor programs, including via the Foreign Financing Projects Management
Center under the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The high degree o f donor support
for the PRSP i s notable, with both donor technical assistance and donor financing being
framed inthe PRSP context. The role o f PRSP incoordinating donor assistance was also
reflected in Armenia's successful bid for M C C funding, which was based on priorities
identified inthe PRSP and was supported by the PHRD grant.

134.    The second PRGF, approved by the Executive Board o f the IMF in 2005, for a
period o f three years in an amount o f about US$34 million continues to support the
government's medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives through measures
aimed at strengthening public finance, maintaining a monetary policy consistent with
price stability, and improving regulation o f banking sector.          The PRGF-supported
program i s consistent with the PRSP and the PRSC and i s on track. The IMF Executive
Board concludedthe fourth review o f the PRGF inMay 2007, thereby makingavailable a
disbursement o f US$5 million and bringing the accumulated disbursements to US$25

leadership o f the government and in close consultation with civil society and
development partners. In the area o f economic and social governance, it i s aimed at
helping to expand and strengthen the national social monitoring system, working with
partners to introduce innovative income generation schemes, helping to strengthen
disaster management and recovery inat-risk communities, will work with partners to help
strengthen multi-sectoral responses to HIV/AIDS. Inthe area o f democratic governance
aimed at helping to strengthen governing institutions with policy, oversight and electoral
functions, to promote participatory policy-making among targeted groups, to increase
respect for, and the awareness o f human rights, including women's rights. Inthe area o f
Environmental Governance it i s to help to strengthen the conservation and sustainable use
o f natural resources and to increase access to sustainable energy. UNICEF i s assisting
with the development o f pre-school education. A variety of other UN agencies support
PRSC and other Bank project activities in the areas of environmental management,

thereby contributing to the long term objective o f sustainable development, including the
protection o f the environment; (iv) Further improvement o f investment climate and
strengthening o f private sector-led growth; (v)Further convergence o f economic
legislation and administrative practices; (vi) Contribute to a peaceful solution o f the
Nagorno-Karabakhconflict; (vii)Enhanced efforts inthe field o f regional cooperation.

137.    EBRD's strategic priorities inArmenia are: (i) micro, small and medium-
                                                          support
sized enterprises; (ii)natural resources: appropriate development and management; (iii)
Financial sector: increasing intermediation, upgrading skills; (iv) Agribusiness: support
efficient processors, retailers; (v) Transport infrastructure: local and regional focus; (vi)
Municipal and environmental infrastructure: water, heating, urban transport, energy
efficiency; (vii) Energy: renewable energy, power sector improvements, regional
projects. Some o f the recent projects are: $7 million EBRD loan to Cascade Credit
combined with $5 million from the WB and $3 million from CFF; FirstMortgage Facility
o f EUR 1.5 m to Armeconombank; $20 million to finance the completion o f the new
passenger terminal at Zvartnots airport; EBRD Direct Investment Facility $4 million
equity investment to finance the expansion, development and strengthening of the "Star"
supermarket chain.

138.    Armenia joined the Asian Development Bank in 2005. The ADBs interim
operational strategy identifies three broad priorities (i)accelerating rural development;
(ii)promoting private sector development; and (iii)enhancing regional cooperation. An
operational country assistance program for Armenia, covering 2006-2009, i s under
preparation. To address problems, such as the poor condition of rural roads and other
rural infrastructure, and lack o f access o f the poor'to markets, jobs, and social services,
ADB will rehabilitate rural roads, improve the rural water supply and sanitation system,
andhelpimprove access to private finance.

Bilateral Donors

139.    USAID focuses primarily on public sector management and private sector
development. To improve governmental functions, a major program to improve tax and
customs administration and social protection, to strengthen the bar andjudiciary; improve
public sector accounting; and strengthen the management o f health care; and improve
secure and sustained access to energy and water resources are under implementation.
USAID is helpingprivate sector development improving accessto finance and improving
the capacity o f small and medium sized enterprises. Both USAID and MCC strongly
support Bank objectives o f improving the financial strength and sustainability of
electricity and drinking water utilities and the country's irrigation system.

140.    DfID focuses on major programs on public sector reform and on integrated
regional development intwo marzes. It has supported boththe PRSP and MTEF process,
including through initiatives to develop marz level poverty reduction strategies inthe two
poorest marzes. KfW supports micro-finance lending by four commercial banks, has
provided seed money for the establishment of a deposit insurance system, and will help
develop a market for housing finance. It i s also assisting in the provision o f drinking
water in two major cities. It has been active in rehabilitation o f electricity transmission


                                            45

lines and hydropower plants. It is expected that DflD will be closing its operations in
Armenia ina year's time.

141.    In summary, the Bank is the lead partner on the governance agenda and public
sector management, with two key bilaterals (UK, US) and the EU playing an important
role. The Bank shares with the Fundresponsibility for advice on macroeconomic policies
and structural reforms, as well as infinancial sector reforms, where USAIDhas also been
prominent. The Bank is also the lead advisor on reforms in sharpening competition and
private sector development, helping devise policies on liberalizing trade and utility
services, removing barriers to investment and enterprise and developing creditor rights.
The Bank is also the lead partner in social sector reforms, but in certain aspects of these
reforms the UN agencies have played a notable role as has DfID. In the dialogue on
environment and the rural economy, the Bank has forged partnerships with SIDA
(forestry), US government agencies (agriculture), EU (food security), IFAD (irrigation
policy) and UN agencies (crop development, crisis management, and work for food
programs).

                            DESCRIPTIONOFTHE OPERATION

142.     A series of four PRSCs, all single tranche operations, will support policy and
institutional reforms of the PRSP. The fourth PRSP is presented to the Board given
satisfactory implementation of the triggers that have been agreed with the authorities.
The extension of a fourth PRSC will make possible IDA support of critical reform steps
envisaged as a part of the implementation of the PRSP in2007 inthe areas of governance
- public and corporate strengtheningthe competitive base of the economy, and reducing
                       -
risksinnatural resourcemanagement.

143.     The proposed credit will support measuresto strengthen public management and
corporate governance. It will also expand employment opportunities and increase
incomes, through reforms to strengthen the business environment for private sector
development and improve competitiveness, especially inaviation andtelecommunication.
It will further the natural resource management agenda for better and more sustainable
livelihoods.

144.     The fourth PRSC prior actions for Board approval have all beenmet. The PRSC
supportedprogram and triggers for Board presentation of the fourth PRSC are elaborated
in the letter of development policy and in the policy and institutional reform matrix
underlying the operation. The matrix and letter of development policy provide a coherent
and unified framework for coordination of different ministries and agencies. They also
provide the government instruments for continuous development of policy reforms and
institutional measures and monitoring implementation progress and the Bank instruments
to conduct policy dialogue with the government.

o f Armenia. Upon effectiveness o f the Financing Agreement, expected in fourth quarter
o f 2007, the proposed single-tranche credit of SDR 12.0 million (US$18.5 million
equivalent) will be made to the Republic o f Armenia, represented by the Ministry o f
Finance and Economy (MOFE). Provision o f a legal opinion by Armenia that it has
followed its laws and procedures for the ratification o f the credit agreement, will be the
effectiveness condition. The proposed credit will be on IDA terms, including 20-year
maturity and a 10-year grace period.

                                   FIDUCIARYASPECTS

PublicFinancialManagementand Procurement

146.    The Bank has extensive knowledge o fthe country's Public Financial Management
(PFM). Public Expenditure Reviews of 2002 and 2005 have provided recommendations
to improve the budget management system. A Country Financial Management
Assessment (CFAA) was prepared in2004. The report notes the impressive achievements
in the period since independence, and supports the ambitious plans to further improve
budgeting, accounting, and develop modern treasury and internal control systems. The
CFAA also urges the government to reinforce its oversight o f the public financial
management reform effort as a key condition to succeed with this ambitious program.
The CFAA also concludes that managers in all sectors and levels o f the administration
need to be better informed about the key components of the new public financial
management reforms (PFM), including budgeting, accounting and reporting, and internal
and external audits. CFAA has noted the significant commitment of senior government
officials to reform the basic systems o f financial accountability. The description o f
Theme1: Consolidating Macroeconomic Discipline and Strengthening Governance above
includes further details on the reform processes to strengthen public governance and
enhance the fight against corruption. Particularly, the reform efforts o f the public
financial management functions are also described under the Theme 1 (paragraphs 74-
79). At this time the CFAA assesses the overall fiduciary risk as significant, with further
efforts and capacity building required in order to institutionalize these reforms. The
PRSC program has specifically supported measures to reduce fiduciary risk such as
improved budget classification, program budgeting, and the strengthening o f the internal
audits. These measures, together with the government's determination to further reforms,
lead to the judgment that the public finance management system is adequate to support
budget support credits.

147.    A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was finalized and disseminated to
the Government in October 2004. The Government confirmed its commitment to
implement the CPAR Action Plan, specifically in the areas o f (i)improvement of
legislative framework and strengthening capacities, (ii)procurement decentralization, and
(iii)introduction o f system o f electronic procurements. Since that time the Government
has made certain progress in the initial implementation o f the CPAR action plan. In
particular, a new Law on Public Procurement was enacted on January 1, 2005 which has


                                           48

decentralized procurement to the line Ministries. The procurement law permits use o f e--
Government Procurement. The website o f the public procurement Authorized Body has
been established (www.procurement.am)           which provides information on bidding
opportunities and contract awards. A decree dated 26 January, 2006, number 137-N
approving the strategy for the introduction o f the system Electronic Procurement in the
Republic of Armenia was issued.            The technical assistance for introduction and
implementation o f the e-procurement program has been provided under the World Bank
Public Sector Modernization Project, support from USAID and other donors, and inlight
o f experience with e-procurement in other countries. A contract was awarded in January
2007 under PSMP to carry out detailed functional and technical design o f modern system
o f electronic government procurement appropriate to Armenia's needs. A review by the
Bank team in June 2007 suggests that systemic weaknesses inprocurement system such
as use o f noncompetitive practices needs to be addressed and more work needs to be
carried out under PSMP through development o f electronic data base o f goods, works and
services; standardization o f biddingdocuments; pilot e-tendering system; and developing
a detailed design for introduction o f E-Purchasing system.

Review of Central Bank and Foreign Exchange Management

148.    The IMF conducted a safeguard assessment in2002, which was updated in 2005.
The update found that the CBA's safeguards framework had been strengthened since
2002. In general, the procedures used by the CBA for sales o f its foreign exchange are
viewed as transparent and the safeguards have been recognized as being adequate. The
CBA adopted the IAS in 1996 and has been audited by internationally recognized
auditing firms. The independent audit o f the Central Bank's financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was conducted by KPMG Armenia, and clean
(unqualified) opinion was issued on the those financial statements.

                    DISBURSEMENT AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS
                                       AND

149.    Borrower and credit amount: The Borrower will be the Republic o f Armenia.
Upon effectiveness o f the Financing Agreement, expected in fourth quarter o f 2007, the
proposed single-tranche credit o f SDR 12.0 million (US$l8.5 million equivalent) will be
made to the Republic o f Armenia, represented by the Ministry o f Finance and Economy
(MOFE).     Provision o f a legal opinion by Armenia that it has followed its laws and
procedures for the ratification o f the credit agreement, will be the effectiveness condition.
The proposed credit will be on IDA terms, including 20-year maturity and a 10-year
grace period.

150.    Disbursement: The Bank will disburse the Credit at the deposit account in the
MOFE's US$ account inthe Central Bank o f Armenia with this account being available
for budget expenditures financing. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit o f the
proceeds o f the Credit into the said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the
Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, that is: the
MOFE's budget account will be credited with the dram equivalent at the official
exchange rate within 30 days o f disbursement. The foreign exchange proceeds o f the




                                            49

proposed PRSC will be sold by the CBA or held in reserves, in accordance with the
objectives of monetary policy.

151.   Accounts, auditing and closing date: The Borrower will report to the Bank (in a
format acceptableto the Bank) on the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system. If, after the proceeds are deposited inthe
CBA account, the proceedsof the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe
Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the Recipient to promptly, upon notice from
the Bank, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to the Bank. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of the
Credit will be the responsibility ofthe MOFE.

152.    Considering the Bank's knowledge of the public finance management systems
and the ongoing improvements of these systems, considering the recent positive
assessment of the CBA made by IMF, and the previous audit of deposit account under
PRSC-I (Dutch grant TF 054431) was unqualified and acceptableto the Bank, as well as
clean opinions issued by the CBA's auditor on the recent years financial statements, no
audit will be necessary of the deposit account. The closing date of the proposed credit
will be June 30,2008.

153.    Implementation. The government continues to take the lead in preparing the
PRSC policy matrix and will coordinate its implementation along the PRSP
Implementation Action Plan approved in January 22, 2004, in close consultation with
stakeholders, civil society, trade unions, business groups, NGOs, the Church, local
governments, and the donor community.         The Ministry of Economy and Finance is
responsible for coordinating the government's inputs and actions from all the relevant
ministriesand agencies inimplementing the PRSC action plans. Several working groups
will review, prepare, and follow up on implementation of the action plans and timetables.
The government will closely monitor and evaluate through periodic surveys and
assessments implementation of the PRSC in the context of the overall monitoring of the
PRSP process, using a set of performance indicators.

                                ENVIRONMENTAL     ASPECTS

154.    The PRSC supports several policy and institutional reforms in the environment
and forestry sector by focusing on environmental supervision, national forest policy,
combating illegal logging,        establishing community forestry,     and institutional
restructuring in the forestry sector. An environmental assessment has been elaborated.
Notably, a, key government policy initiative supported by the PRSC program is
environmental impact assessment and supervision.        Key environmental risks in the
country are expected to be reduced by creation of community forestry programs and
reduction of illegal logging; the monitoring systemfor illegal logginghas beendeveloped
during PRSC-IV and is expected to come to fruition. Actions taken under the PRSC
program are not expectedto cause adverse effects on the environment.

                                          RISKS

155.    The proposedcredit i s subject to severalrisks. First, although the authorities have
demonstrated most impressive, single-minded efforts at pursuing difficult reforms over a
sustainedperiod, attention may begin to shift to the presidential election campaign that is
expectedto begin towards the end of 2007. Second, as the reform agenda advances deep
into difficult terrain - the fight against corruption, adopting modern standards in
regulatory reform, reductions in health labor force and facilities, making contentious
choices in designing the pensions system - reform fatigue could set in, especially under
conditions of easy and large donor grant funding. Third, external price shocks (energy,
commodities) could intensify or a fall in remittances if growth in Russia and the world
slows significantly could take place; these would pose a risk to growth and inflationifnot
metwith appropriatemacroeconomic policy responses.

156.    These set of risks require pro-active management. Dialogue with the Bank will
continue to be intense and it is encouraging that over the direction of economic reforms
there i s broad consensus.     The wide participation through which the PRSP was
formulated and the continuing involvement of civic organs in its implementation offers
some protection against reform fatigue. Donors should also remain alert as to the quality
of projects and absorption constraints when deciding on commitments. The Bank will
remain in active dialogue with the client and with donors on all these matters. The
comfortable fiscal and debt positions and the willingness of the authorities to use fiscal
and monetary instrumentsto counter possible shocks are notable.

                      DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)

The IMF-World Bank stafls' debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Armenia is
at a low risk of debt distress, with all debt indicators well below the relevant country-
specijk debt-burden thresholds. The analysis highlights the importance of continued
sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms for safeguarding the favorable
debt outlook.
1.       The DSA was prepared jointly by Fund and World Bank staffs in
consultationwith the authorities,using the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country
Debt Sustainability                     Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline
scenario are consistent with the framework presented in the staff report for the fifth
review under the PRGF (Box 1). The external debt data used for this exercise were
updated by staffs based on information provided by the authorities and multilateral
institutions. In addition to a menu o f standard alternative scenarios and bound tests,
Armenia's debt outlook i s also stress-tested under a scenario o f a sharp increase in
Armenia's gas import prices.

2.       Armenia's externaldebt stock as of end-2006 is estimatedat $1,448 million
(23 percentof GDP),mostly represented by public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
owed to multilateral international
organizations (Figure 1).33The                        Fhm1.Axmenin'sExternalDebtStockend-2006

debt.
3.       The externaldebt

in2006. Prudent debt management, combined with favorable exchange rate dynamics
and robust economic growth, contributed to a decline inthe external debt ratio from 27
percent o f GDP in2005 to 23 percent o f GDP in2006.



32The most recent assessment of Armenia's debt sustainability was conducted in November 2006 in the
context of Article IV Consultations and Third Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the
Poverty ReductionandGrowthFacility(EBS/06/141).
33The DSA coversthe centralgovernmentonly, since other public sector debt is believedto be negligible.

           Box 1.MacroeconomicAssumptions for the DSABaseline Scenario, 2007-27
Annual real GDP growth is projected to average around 7 percent over the medium term, gradually
declining to its long-run rate of 4 percent. The near-term growth is supported by the robust activity in
constructionand services,onthe back ofcontinuedprivatetransfers andFDIinflows.
Consistent with the CBA's target, the average inflation rate is assumed to be around 3 percent in the
long-run. The near-term inflation is projected to be somewhat higher, largely on account of higher food and
energy prices.
The external current account deficit is projected to average around 4 percent of GDP over the DSA
projection period. Somewhat higher deficits are envisagedinthe near-term, against the backgroundof strong
import growth. Exports are projected to grow robustly over the medium term, as new investments in base
metal, minerals, and food processing sectors become operational. Private transfers will grow strongly in the
near-term,financing a significant share ofthe trade deficit,but will gradually moderatethereafter.
In 2007-12, net FDI is expected to average about 4.5 percent of GDP, gradually moderating from the high
levels explainedby the privatizationinbase metal and mineral sectors.Inthe near term, FDI is expectedto be
concentrated mostly in these two traditional sectors, but also in food processing, telecommunication, banking
and energy sectors.Improvementsinbusiness climate, however, shouldyield a more diversifiedFDIstructure,
with new investmentgoing into new industries (e.g., tourism and IT sector). The long-run net FDI is projected
to average around3 percent of GDP.
Central government revenues(excludinggrants) are projectedto gradually increase from 16.4 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2012, andwill continueto improve over the long-run.
The overall fiscal deficit is projectedat 3 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008, reflecting the fiscal costs of
the current gas subsidy. Consistent with the staff recommendations, the baseline assumes that the current
subsidy will be allowed to expire and no new subsidy will be introduced, resulting in a lower fiscal deficit in
2009 and beyond (about 2 percent of GDP). It is also assumed that the import prices for gas will increase in
2009 from their current levelof$110to $170per 1,000m3.
The levelof concessionalityof new external borrowing is envisagedto decline in the future, as Armenia's
income increases. The projecteddisbursementsfrom the World Bank-Armenia's largest creditor, accounting
for about 60 percent of country's total external debt stock as of end-2005-assume that starting from 2009
h e n i a will begin receiving IBRD loans in addition to IDA credits, gradually shifting to exclusively IBRD
borrowingby 2017. Starting2007, IDA repaymentterms are hardened, with the maturity periodshortenedto 20
years. This reflects the fact that Armenia's per capita income exceeded the IDA eligibility threshold for two
consequent years.Unidentifiedresidual lendingfor 2009 andbeyondis assumedto be on EBRDterms.
Consistent with the authorities' intention, deficit financing is assumed to be increasingly financed by
domestic, rather than external, borrowing. Residual borrowing from domestic sources reduces risks
associated with currency mismatch of debt portfolio and contributes to deepening of domestic financial
markets.
The private sector external debt stock in 2006 is estimated as the difference between Armenia's long-
term total external debt and government's external debt. The new external borrowingby the private sector
i s assumedto matchthe balanceof payments' conservative assumptionon commercialbanks' inflows o f about
1 percent of GDP per annum. As the terms of Armenia's private sector borrowing are unknown, they are
assumedto be similar to those inother comparablecountries.Specifically,the maturityperiodis assumedto be
6 years (with a 1 year grace period) andthe interest rate is set at 8 percent-a compromisebetweenthe interest
rate on U S dollar-denominatedsovereignbonds of similar maturity in Russia and Ukraine (about 6.5 percent),
and the ongoing lending rate in U S dollars charged by Armenian banks on long-term loans (about 15-17
percent). To the extent that most of this lending is likely to be from foreign banks to their Armenian
subsidiaries,this relativelylow interestrate assumptionisjustified.

4.       The share of domestic debt in the stock of public and publicly guaranteed
debt is rather small, reflectingthe small size of domestic debt markets. In2006, the
PPG debt owed to domestic creditors accounted for only about 2 percent o f GDP,
virtually unchanged from the year before.

                                      THEBASELINESCENARIO
5.       The baseline scenario shows that the fiscal position remains sustainable
(Table 1,Figure2). Notwithstanding increasingissuance o f domestic debt securities, the
net present value o f public sector debt remains at manageable levels, rising from
11percent o f GDP in 2007 to 26 percent o f GDP in 2027. The debt service inpercent o f
revenues i s projected to increase only marginally, from 5.5 percent in 2007 to 7 percent
in2026, reflecting continued buoyancy offiscal revenues inthe long-term.

6.       The external debt outlook remains benign, notwithstanding a notable
moderation in external concessional financing (Table 3, Figure 3). The net present
value o f external debt falls only moderately from 12 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 10.5
percent o f GDP in 2027, reflecting a gradual increase o f the share o f the deficit financed
by domestic sources and increasingly greater importance o f external borrowing by the
private sector. While Armenia's reliance on external financing gradually diminishes, the
borrowing terms are projected to harden, leaving the external debt service in percent o f
exports broadly constant at about 7 percent over the long-term. The net present value o f
public external debt in percent o f exports falls from 47 percent in 2007 to38 percent in
2027.

                                            STRESS TESTING
7.       The standard menu of alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that
Armenia's public debt outlook is particularly sensitive to a lasting shock to
economic growth and the dynamics of primary balance (Table 2).34 Under the
extreme scenarios considered, Armenia's                  debt ratios exceed relevant thresholds,
highlighting the critical importance o f a\ steady progress on the "second generation"
structural reform agenda. More generally, the stress tests indicate that all public debt
ratios show an upwardtrend through the projection horizon, reinforcing the importance
o f continuing with prudent policies and preserving macroeconomic stability in order to
safeguard the debt outlook.
8.       Armenia's public debt outlook is moderatelysensitiveto an increase in debt-
creatingflows. The staffs also considered the possible impact on debt sustainability o f a
"significant" fiscal event, such as the envisaged overhaul o f the pension system. If such
an event were to occur in2008 and would cost around 10 percent o f GDP, the net present
value o f public debt to GDP ratio in2027 would remain manageable at about 31 percent,
as compared with 25 percent under the baseline.

34The framework for low-income country DSA incorporates alternative scenarios and bound tests aimed at
identifyingthe sensitivities ofthe baseline projection to arange of potential shocks.

9.     Armenia's external debt outlook is robust to a variety of shocks (Table 4).
Under all alternative scenarios and bound tests, the external debt ratios remain well below
the relevant thresholds. Nevertheless, the outcome o f a scenario reflecting gas import
prices increasing to the regional level (Box 2) highlights the sensitivity o f Armenia's
balance o f payments to a long-lasting deterioration in the terms o f trade. Under this
scenario, the net present value o f public external debt in percent o f exports-while  still
remaining manageable-rises      from 47 percent in 2007 to 60 percent in 2017 but falls
only moderately thereafter. This i s in a marked contrast with a gradual decline in the
corresponding ratio envisaged under the baseline scenario.

10.     The authorities welcomed the finding that Armenia is at a low risk of debt
distress. Sound debt management continues to be a priority for the government. Since
2001, the Ministry of Finance and Economy has produced an Annual Report on Public
Debt o f Armenia, covering both domestic and external debt. This publication reports on
the evolution of debt aggregates and the government's debt management strategy. The
authorities also informed the staff about the progress made in improving monitoring of
the private sector's external borrowing.

                        Box 2. AlternativeScenario: Gas Price Increasein2009
The alternative scenario considers the macroeconomic implications of bringing gas import prices to
the level currently paid by Armenia's neighboring countries. The price increase (from the baseline
mumption of $170 to $235 per l,000m3, the price offered by Gazprom to Armenia's neighboring
:ountries) is assumedto come ineffect in2009, uponthe expirationofthe current delivery contract.

D        The scenario assumes that the current subsidy will be allowed to expire in 2008, raising the final
         consumers'tariffs to a levelconsistentwith the current gas importprice ($110per 1,000m3).

D        The new gas import price ($235 per l,000m3) is assumed to be gradually passed through to
         consumersby end-2011, with the difference subsidizedby transfers from the budget.
The macroeconomic implications caused by the hike in gas import prices are projected to be
significant (see Table):

         Real GDP growth over the medium-term will be lowered by about 1 percent and adjustments in
         final consumers' tariffs will significantlyworsen the inflationoutlook.

         Assuming inelastic demand for gas, higher final consumer tariffs will have only moderateimpact
         on gas volume consumptions but will encourage improvements in efficiency and conservation
         over time.

         Imports will surge as the gas import bill more than doubles in 2009, resulting in a significant
         deterioration inthe trade balance.The nominal exchange rate is assumedto depreciate moderately
         on account of continuedappreciationpressuresarisingfrom robustforeign exchange inflows.
         While sizeablereserves minimizethe initialbalanceofpaymentsimplications ofthe higher import
         bill, it is assumed that reserveswill stay around3-4 months of imports in the long-term, with the
         additionalexternalborrowingcomputedas a residual.

         The fiscal impact of the new subsidy is estimatedto be 2.4 percent of GDP in 2009, and rapidly
         declining thereafter. The deterioration in the overall fiscal balance is assumed to be financed

2.       Inthe 1980s, poverty in Soviet Armenia is reported to have been virtually non-
existent. The end of the decade, however, saw poverty increase sharply as the 1988
earthquake, the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabagh war cost many
people their livelihoods. The war also brought an influx of refugees, adding to the ranks
of the poor. Although economic growth resumedinthe mid 1990s, poverty did not begin
to fall untilthe end ofthat decade.

3.       However, since 2001, average income per head (Atlas method) began to rise
rapidly. It more then doubled from $720 to $1,930 between 2001 and 2006. The
increased income o f the population, combined with the government's pro-poor policies
and expenditures resulted in increased living standards o f the population: the poverty
indicators beganto fall and access to basic social and infrastructure services improved.

4.       By 2006, all consumption based measures of poverty and extreme poverty
declined compared to their levels in 1998/99 (Table 1). Extreme poverty incidence fell
considerably faster than the overall poverty rate. At the same time, poverty became
shallower and less severe.36In absolute figures, over half a million people escaped
extreme poverty. However, despite these remarkable achievements, 26.5 percent of the

below the poverty linepoor householdsare; andthe severity of poverty captures inequality amongthe poor.

population - almost 800,000 people - are still poor, including around 120,000 of
extremely poor individuals.

5.      Income inequality declined substantially in the reference period, contributing to
poverty reduction. Although declining, income inequality i s still relatively high: the 2005
Gini c~efficient~~of 0.36. Consumption inequality is much lower (a Gini coefficient of
0.26) andhas been relatively stable inthe observedperiod.

6.      In2006, poverty was most severe in urban areas outside Yerevan, where almost
36 percent of the population reported consumption below the poverty line. Poverty in
rural areas and in Yerevan in particular was significantly lower but the rate has been
falling muchfaster in Yerevan than inrural areas. Similar patterns apply to the trends in
extremepoverty (see Table 1). In2006, there was no clear distinction betweenurban and
ruralpoverty. Similarly, there was no significant gender difference inpoverty rates.

7.      The poverty profile is stable. Children under five continue to experience higher
poverty risk as do the less educatedand larger householdswith childrenas well as female
headed households with children. The unemployed and non-participants in the labor
market other than pensioners (housewives, students, etc.) in secondary cities face higher
poverty risk and their relative position has substantially worsened during since 1998/99.
In contrast, the elderly whose risk of poverty was above the average in 1999/99,
experiencedlower thanthe averagepoverty risk in2005.

8.      Income from labor is the largest source of income for Armenians in all income
groups representing around 44 percent of the total income. Incomes per month have
increasedinreal terms during 1999-2004by almost 38 percent. The poorest registeredthe
largest increase both in real income (98 percent) and in consumption (39 percent). Thus,
employment continues to be a crucial determinant of poverty inArmenia but employment
(and wages alone) did not quite protect households from poverty, especially those
employed in agriculture. For the poorest, the farms incomes, social transfers and
remittancesare the second, third and the fourth largest income sources.

9.      Armenia has performed well in health and education, despite low (but rapidly
increasing) levels of public expenditures. Access to basic education and health is good
but differences between poor and non-poor as well as between urban and rural areas
clearly exist. Health outcomes are better than in most CIS countries; many health status
indicators are similar to those in Europe (WHO 2005). Life expectancy at birth is high
(76.4 for females and 70.3 for male). Mortality rates, including infant (down from 15.6
per 1000 live births in 2000 to 12.3 in 2005), under-five (down from 19.8 per 1000 live
births in 2000 to 13.6 in2005) and maternal (down from 52.5 per 100,000 live births in


37 The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, with 0 indicating complete equality of consumption or
income, and 1 indicatingcomplete inequality.

2000 to 16 in 2005) are all showing encouraging downward trend. Immunization rates
remain high. Total health expenditure in Armenia in 2005 was 5.3 percent o f GDP: 1.4
percent public and 3.9 percent private.

10.      Access to basic education is good, but with differences betweenthe poor and non-
poor as well as between urbanand rural. The entire population is literate and net primary
enrollment rate was 94.2 percent in 2005. In contrast, net enrollment rate in upper
secondary schools and tertiary institutions is much lower (85.6% and 26% respectively),
again with substantial differences between poor and non-poor.            At the same time,
perceived low returns to education and high opportunity cost o f tertiary education,
coupled with hightuition costs (even for non-poor), keep both boys and girls aged 16-20
out o f the education system. As a result, the average school life expectancy inArmenia is
only about 10.6 years. Overall public expenditures on education are rapidly rising (2.53
percent o f GDP in2005)' but they are still low.

11.      Social transfers andremittances represent almost o f quarter o f the total income for
Armenia's poorest households. Social transfer spending (encompassing pensions, the
family poverty benefit, birth grant, maternity and sick leave payments, child care
allowance and unemployment benefits) amounted to 4.8 percent o f GDP in 2006 and i s
well targeted and important for poverty reduction. For each percentage point of GDP
spent on social transfers, poverty incidence declines by 2.3 points.

                             IMPACT OF REFORMS ON POVERTY

12.      The analysis suggests that sustaining high rates o f growth will remain a decisive
factor for continued poverty reduction in Armenia with macroeconomic stability and
reforms stimulating private investment being the central part o f the government's poverty
reduction agenda. The government can affect the poverty reduction intwo main areas: (i)
reforms that sustain and diversify sources o f growth, includingthe measuresthat encourage
incomes o f the poorest households, and (ii)reforms that strengthen public transfer
programs and improve public service delivery. An attempt has been made to review the
potential links o f the PRSC supported programs to the poverty reduction and simulate the
PRSC supported reform impact.

13.      Armenia needs to generate growth in excess o f 5 percent annually to be able to
cut poverty to 20 percent and reduce extreme poverty to 2.6 percent by 2010, assuming
broadly unchanged income distribution.

14.     The key variable underpinning poverty reduction projections is private
consumption, which is projected to grow by about 5 percent a year between 2007 and
2010. Assumingthat households inall parts o f the income distribution benefit uniformly,
poverty i s projected to fall from 34.9 percent estimated in2004 to 20 percent in2010, or
by about 0.4 millionpeople. This implies a yearly decline o f around 15 percent or a cut in
the poverty rate o f close to 2l" percentage points every year for the period between2005
and 2010 period (Table 2).

15.     Growth will continue be channeled to the households through multiple sources
increasing both factor and non-factor income. Strong growth in factor income from both
labor and capital will be accompanied by consistent improvement in public transfer
programs and sharp rise inold-age pensions in2008-2012. The country will also continue
to depend on remittances but to a lesser extent as the growth will become the main driver
o f job-creation and poverty reduction. Domestic savings will continue to grow. Such
multiplicity o f income sources will benefit various types o f households and resulted in
broad based poverty reduction as well as reduce the economic vulnerability o f Armenian

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth
review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement for
Armenia. The completion o f the review, which was undertaken on a lapse o f time basis39
enables the release of a further SDR 3.28 million (about US$5 million) under the
arrangement. This will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR 16.4
million (about US$24.9 million).

The PRGF is the IMF'sconcessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in
the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. This is intended to ensure that PRGF-
supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,
structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an
annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5% -year grace
period on principal payments.
