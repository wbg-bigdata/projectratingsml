Uttar Pradesh Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructuring Credit/Loan Summary
Borrower:             Government of India
Implementing Agency: Government of Uttar Pradesh, Office of the Chief Secretary and Departments
of Finance, Planning, Personnel and Administrative Reforms
Beneficiaries:       State of Uttar Pradesh (population: 160 million)
Amount:              SDR 93.3 million (US$125 million equivalent) in IDA credit and
US$126.3 million in IBRD loan
Terms:               IDA: Standard with 35 years maturity and 10 years grace period
IBRD: Payable in 20 years including 5 years of grace period; standard variable
interest rates for LIBOR based USD single currency loans
Onlending Terms:     Standard terms of central resource transfer for state developmental budgets.
Description:         Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and one of its poorest. It has
experienced prolonged economic stagnation, fiscal crisis, and little progress
against its massive poverty (41% poor) in recent decades. The Uttar Pradesh
Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructuring Credit/Loan would support the
government's efforts in initiating multi-year reforms to turn this situation
around. The fiscal reform component of the program is aimed at ensuring
sustainability and to create additional fiscal space over the medium term for
well-targeted public investments in high priority areas of development,
including quantitative and qualitative improvement in social sector spending.
The public sector restructuring component of the reform program is intended
to improve the quality of service delivery by reorienting the role of
government, by reforming the civil service, by reducing corruption through
improved transparency, deregulation and strengthening of anti-corruption
institutions, by decentralization and by improving financial management and
accountability. The proposed credit/loan will be disbursed in one tranche, and
is the first in a proposed sequence of three or four operations. The completed
actions triggering the presentation of this operation to the Board have been
agreed upon and emerged from the economic policy dialogue with GoUP
spanning the last 18 months.
iBenefits:           The operation, which is designed to support CAS objectives and is a key
component of the Bank's overall program of assistance in UP, reinforces recent
initiatives by the Government of India to stimulate reforms in the states.
Expected direct benefits include: (a) improved fiscal situation; (b) improved
governance and social service delivery; (c) higher economic growth and
reduced poverty; (d) contribution to reduction in the overall public sector
borrowing requirement; and (e) encouragement of similar reforms in other
Indian states.
Risks:               The major risks are: (a) possible reversibility of reforms due to political
resistance; and (b) lack of adequate institutional capacity.
Poverty Category:    NA
Disbursement:        The credit/loan would be disbursed in one tranche in an amount equivalent to
US$251.3 million upon effectiveness. Key actions agreed over the past 18
months of dialogue with the government have already been taken.

Dear Mr. Sarma:
Subject: Proposed Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructurng LoanJCredit
Letter of Development Policy
Introduction
1.   Uttar Pradesh (UP) is a state with a proud history and significant accomplishments to its credit.
However, over the last decade, slowing growth, serious fiscal problems, and a weakening of public
institutions have constrained the economic and social development of our state. In particular, as a result of
our fiscal and institutional problems, the quality and quantity of public services rendered through health,
education, nutrition, population and anti-poverty programs have suffered. Poverty, significantly above
the national average at around 41 percent, is stagnating.
2.    The Govermment of Uttar Pradesh is making a concerted effort to revitalize the state's economic
performance through a wide-ranging reform program. We are strengthening the provision of education
and health services to improve the basic well-being of our people. We are restructuring the major
infrastructure sectors to attract private investment, and accelerate growth. In particular, we have initiated
a comprehensive restructuring of the power sector, which until now has been a drain on our finances and
the most severe constraint on our growth. We have now passed reform legislation and established an
independent regulator. We have unbundled the State Electricity Board into separate companies in
preparation for privatization.
3.    However, all of these and related efforts will not bear fruit unless we restore soundness to the
state's fiscal position, and to the quality of governance. In order to improve both the quality and quantity
of essential public services, it is critical that the state's high fiscal deficit is reduced while high priority
development and social expenditures are increased. System-wide improvements in the incentives,
processes, and public institutions are needed to redefine the role of the government in the economy
through deregulation and divestment while increasing its transparency, efficiency and accountability.
4.    In continuation of our ongoing discussions with Gol on fiscal reforms, we have developed a wide-
ranging medium-term Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructuring Program (the Program), described
below. The Government has already taken a number of difficult measures, during the 1999-2000 fiscal
year, in the areas of fiscal stabilization, structural reforns and administrative improvements. As a result,
the deterioration in the state's finances has been arrested and revenue collection, expenditure control and
financial management have all started to improve.
5.    To implement and ensure adequate funding for the costs associated with the first phase of our
Program, the Government of Uttar Pradesh (the Government) would like the Government of India to
propose to the World Bank for consideration a Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructuring
Loan/Credit of about Rs. 1100 crore (US$250 million equivalent), as the first in a potential series of three
or four such operations. This assistance would provide financing of the transitional costs of reform. It
would supplement the assistance we are receiving from the Government of India to support our Reform
Program and project assistance we are proposing to the World Bank in the social sectors, education and
health, as well as for power, irrigation and roads sectors.

The Fiscal Reform & Public Sector Restructuring Program
6.    Wide-ranging reforms cannot succeed unless they are carried out in a completely transparent
manner, and have the backing of a strong public consensus. In 1998, we published a White Paper on the
State's Finances which brought to public attention the state's deteriorating fiscal position. Since then, we
have published several sectoral policy papers, including one on power and another on irrigation sector
reforms. The Fiscal Reform and Public Sector Restructuring Program is spelt out in five Policy
Papers - i.e., Medium Term Fiscal Reform Policy, Reforms in Governance, Civil Service Reforms, Public
Enterprise Reform and Privatization and Financial Management & Accountability Strategy. These will be
tabled, after Cabinet Approval, in the State Legislative Assembly for public debate on March 27, 2000.
The paragraphs below summarize the major provisions of these Papers, as does the attached Matrix of
Medium-Term Benchmarks/Actions (The Matrix).
Medium-term Fiscal Policy
7.    The main objectives of our medium-term fiscal policy include: (a) reducing the fiscal deficit so
that the ratio of debt to Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and interest payments to revenues begin to
decline; (b) improving the composition of public spending to enhance its developmental impact; and (c)
reforming the tax system to improve efficiency in resource allocation. The extent of required fiscal
deficit reduction over the next five years (1999-2004) is considerable.
8.   In order to stabilize the level of its debt and debt service ratios, the Government is committed to
eliminate the primary deficit (the gap between revenue and non-interest expenditure), estimated at about
3.5 percent in 1998-99, and turn it into a surplus by 2003-2004. This is inclusive of the projected
budgetary support for financial restructuring of the power sector and Voluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS) of workers in public enterprises that will be closed/divested. The overall fiscal deficit is targeted
to decline from 7.5 percent of GSDP in 1998-99 to about 4 percent by 2003-2004. Although power sector
reform will result in very large benefits for the Government's budgetary condition over the medium term,
a substantial part of the fiscal deficit over the next few years is attributable to the costs of restructuring the
power sector and preparing for privatization. The deficit net of power sector requirements is targeted to
decline from 6.7 percent to less than 3 percent. Over this period, the state's own tax revenues is projected
to rise from 5.4 percent to 7.6 percent and public investment together with non-wage O&M to rise from
less than 2 percent of GSDP to about 4 percent. Social sector spending, including through devolution to
local bodies, is anticipated to rise from 3 percent of GSDP in 1998-99 to 4 percent by 2003-2004.
9.    There has already been measurable improvement in the state's fiscal management over the past
twelve months. The fiscal deficit is expected to decline from 7.5 percent of GSDP in 1998-1999 to 7.0
percent in 1999-2000. Consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework, the Government aims at a
further reduction of the fiscal deficit to no more than 6.0 percent of GSDP in 2000-2001. Net of the
power sector's projected financial restructuring requirements, the deficit is targeted to decline from 6.0
percent of GSDP in 1999-2000 to 4.5 percent in 2000-2001. To help us achieve our fiscal targets,
contingency plans are being prepared on an annual basis, starting in 1999-2000, to enable mid-course
revisions.
10.   The Government has imposed strict controls over its debt and guarantees. Given the projected
increases in our sectoral investments, the debt stock to GSDP ratio is expected to continue to rise initially,
though more slowly than in the recent past, to peak at about 42.0 percent in 2002-2003 and then begin to
decline. We have also decided to better regulate growth of state guarantees by requiring an escrow
arrangement; and we are considering various options for capping guarantees, proposed by the Reserve
Bank of India, and will adopt an appropriate one in 2000-2001. Outstanding guarantees will remain in the
range of 2.5-3 percent of GSDP over the medium term.
Public Expenditure Policy and Management
11.   Our strategy for improving public expenditure policy and management includes the following
measures.



Annex A
Page 4 of 11
12.   First, to stabilize debt, we are targeting a cut in overall non-interest expenditure, from 16.6 percent
in 19999-2000 to 15.3 percent in 2003-2004.
13.   Second, growth in the wage bill is being controlled by restrictions on recruitment already in place
so as to downsize the civil service by about 2 percent annually (see further under Civil Service Reforms).
We have also taken additional austerity measures such as abolishing staff entitlement to encash
outstanding leave.
14.   Third, towards reducing the burden of non-merit subsidies, we have raised the rates of user charges
for professional education and hospital care by 50-100 percent and decided to raise canal irrigation user
charges in 2000-2001. Explicit subsidies non-merit are targeted to fall from 1.4 percent of GSDP 1998-
1999 to 0.7 percent in 2003-2004.
15.   Fourth, we have identified a category of "high priority developmental expenditures", which
includes non-wage O&M and capital investments in irrigation, roads, education and health sectors as well
as the up-front costs of reforms in the power sector and other public enterprises. We have committed to
protect this category of expenditures from any budget cuts and to enhance significantly budgetary
expenditure on this category in the coming years. Orders have been issued to all treasuries to ensure that
high-priority development expenditures get priority in clearance of bills. We have also requested the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India for a special audit of these components of the expenditure
budget, to be conducted at the end of each fiscal year.
16.   Fifth, we have prepared a strategy for establishing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF). The MTEF will begin to be implemented in 2000-2001 and be fully in place the following year.
17.   Sixth, we have decided to conduct annual public expenditure reviews and strengthen, over time,
capacity in the government to evaluate the effectiveness of public spending.
18.   Seventh, we have decided to review our current pension and provident fund systems. A study of
reform options will be carried out in 2000-2001, with reforms themselves to be initiated in 2001-2002.
19.   Eighth, and finally, a number of measures have been taken to improve Expenditure ControL The
practice of depositing unspent balances at the end of the year into the Personal Ledger Accounts has been
terminated. A new system of reporting time and cost over runs and stricter requirements for new project
starts have been established. Related measures to improve financial management are discussed below
(see Financial Management and Accountability).
Tax Reforns
20.   The State's goals in tax reform are to substantially enhance its own tax revenue and create a fairer
and simpler tax system. The Government's reform strategy envisages replacement of our main tax, the
sales (or trade) tax, by a VAT in 2004, after adequate preparation and in coordination with other states
and the government of India. Over the next four years, the strategy focuses on improving both tax
policies and tax administration.
21.   The Government has abolished the costly and unproductive sales tax incentives on new investment
in the state, including both tax holidays and deferral schemes. As a first step towards rationalisation of
sales tax rates, the Government has implemented the Floor Rates in accordance with the agreement
reached among all states and the Centre. Further steps to reduce the number of rates from 11 to no more
than 5, and to reduce the commodity classification from about 1400 to about 200 will be implemented in
2000-01. An entry tax has been introduced on selected commodities including non-levy sugar and
tobacco, and its scope is proposed to further expand in 2000-01. The Motor Vehicle Tax Act has been
amended to enable the government to make annual revisions in rates through executive orders.
22.   Estimates suggest that our campaign to curb evasion of sales tax has yielded at least Rs.200 crore
additional revenue during 1999-2000. The Cabinet has approved amendments to the Trade Tax Act,
which governs the sales tax, to strengthen enforcement and curb evasion practices such as under-valuation

and non-registration. A pilot survey of unregistered dealers in 2 districts has revealed that 15 percent of
the surveyed dealers are required to register. Steps have been initiated to modernise tax administration
through the introduction of computerized procedures. A complete set of customised software has been
developed and tested for acceptance. Over the next 2 years, a functional restructuring of the Trade Tax
Department will be completed, which will place greater emphasis on better staff recruitment and training
and a departmental anti-corruption strategy. By 2003-2004, the state would rely on self-assessment, with
appropriate audit procedures, and the introduction of modem information technology statewide to reduce
direct interface with tax payers. The system of land registration and property valuation will also be
modernized, leading to increased yield from stamp duties and the urban property tax.
Civil Service Reforms (CSR)
23.   The Government's strategy to combat issues of low productivity, overstaffing, under-utilization
and limited skills , as outlined in our Civil Service Reform Paper, has three components. First, to
strengthen our fiscal position, we are targeting a global downsizing of at least 2 percent per year from
1998-1999 to 2003-2004. This will yield an estimated savings of about Rs.20 billion, or 1 percentage
point of GSDP. The 2 percent downsizing target has been chosen on the basis of an annual attrition rate
of 3 percent, to allow for increased staffing in critical areas such as rural health care education and law
enforcement. We recognize that much greater downsizing and redeployment is likely to be necessary in
certain areas, such as Irrigation and Public Works. Already about 10,000 vacant positions identified as
redundant in various departments have been abolished.
24.   The second thrust of the reforms is to enhance the productivity of the civil service. This will be
initiated via a series of inter and intra-departmental functional reviews. The first such reviews will be
conducted during 2000-2001 for five key departments that are considered the most important for
improving economic performance and reducing poverty. Four of these departments, Forestry, Irrigation,
Medicine and Health, and Public Works, comprise over 30 percent of all civil servants in UP. The fifth,
the Trade Tax Department, plays a critical role for the state's own tax mobilization effort. GoUP's
detailed plan for civil service reform in the departments is presented in the Policy Paper on Civil Service
Reforms.
25.   Third, we aim to improve meritocracy within the civil service and restore managerial authority,
through a variety of measures including: establishing a computerized human resource database,
improving existing systems for performance monitoring and evaluation, allocating more for training,
improving training processes, and reducing transfers. With regards to reducing transfers we have:
finalized and publicized guidelines for the appointment and transfer of senior and mnid-level officers and
are monitoring compliance with the same (the annual transfer policy has been placed on the web);
classified job requirements for all senior positions (the top 1,800 civil service positions within the state);
and established a consultative mechanism to oversee transfers, which has already been initiated in the
case of the most senior officers.
Anti-Corruption and Deregulation Strategy
26.   The key objective of the government's reform in this area, as elaborated in our Governance Reform
paper, is to reduce wastage of public resources, and increase efficiency, transparency and accountability
of all departments. Our strategy has four main components. First, we have commissioned a series of
independent surveys of officials, businesses and the public. The survey results will be fed into the
production of a detailed anticorruption strategy and published, along with this strategy, in the year 2000.
Follow-up surveys will be conducted at two-year intervals to monitor progress in the wake of the reforms.
27.   Second, we will pursue deregulation to reduce opportunities for corruption in the administration of
rules and regulations. Internal reviews will be conducted by Policy Planning Cells, which have been
established in 62 major departments, while the high-level Deregulation Commnittee we have established
will conduct an external review with the objective of streamlining the administrative and regulatory
framework.



Annex A
Page 6 of 11
28.   Third, we have already begun strengthening the key accountability institutions: Vigilance
Department and the Lok Ayukta, or Ombudsman. The Govermnent will significantly increase the
resource allocation to both the Vigilance Establishment and the Lok Ayukta in 2000-2001, and these
institutions will be given more control over staff-hiring. Vacancies in the Lok Ayukta organization will be
filled and the backlog of Ayukta reports - stretching back to 1991 - will be submitted during 2000-2001
to the Legislative Assembly. Further institutional strengthening is expected in 2000-2001 from the
recommendations of a Governance Reform  Task Force we have established.  The task force
recommendations will be implemented in 2001-2002.
29.   Fourth, to make government more responsive to the citizens, we have published citizens charters
for 18 Government Departments specifying service standards. The Cabinet has approved a code of access
for documents of local government, state financial institutions and development agencies. A Freedom of
Information Act, covering a more comprehensive access, will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly
for consideration in 2000-2001.
Decentralization to Rural Local Bodies
30.   Beginning with the 1999-00 Budget in March 1999, the Government has initiated a far reaching
program of decentralization and devolution of powers and responsibilities to elected local bodies in the
countryside, called Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). Key measures introduced to date include the
following: (i) transfer of responsibility for providing village level services to lowest tier of rural local
bodies - including elementary education, reproductive health, drinking water supply, etc.; (ii) transfer of
corresponding assets; (iii) transfer of control of corresponding staff (65,000 regular staff; 275,000
teachers) ; (iv) redefinition of accountability relations between the executive and elected local
government bodies at the district level; (v) empowerment of local bodies to recruit new staff at terms and
conditions to be determined by them; (vi) transfer of funds to the local bodies according to the formula
recommended by the State Finance Commission (4 percent of the state's own net tax revenue to be
devolved to the rural local bodies); (vii) constitution of village level committees to ensure collective
decision making; and (viii) preparation of a comprehensive training manual for all local body
functionaries.
31.   Based on experience with implementation of measures undertaken to date, the Government plans
to continue to decentralize with the objectives of improving the quality of social services and
infrastructure maintenance in rural areas, and increasing the accountability of government.
Public Enterprise Reform
32.   The main objective of the government's Public Enterprise (PE) reform program is to increase
efficiency in the use of public resources and reduce the managerial and financial burden on the
government. The successful implementation of the program would result in: a reduction in fiscal drain
caused by continued subsidization and non-performing loans to loss making enterprises; release of assets
and resources to private owners who are likely to manage them more productively; and reorientation of
the government's role away from commercial activities.
33. The Govemment's Policy Paper on Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization details the
Government's policy of divestment, privatization or closure of enterprises which compete with the private
sector or are fundamentally commercial in nature. The Paper provides guidelines for an open and
transparent divestiture or closure of the public enterprises including detailed procedures for
divestment/closure, voluntary retirement and for dealing with environmental issues, which have been
approved by the Cabinet. The Policy Paper also includes procedures for implementation of the First
Phase of the program by March 2001, involving 20 industrial units and about 20,000 workers. A
Divestment Commnission has been established and staffed. One enterprise, Uttar Pradesh Instrumentation
Limited, has been closed and its assets sold this year and progress is being made in other units.
34.  In each of the two years after 2000-2001, about eight industrial units of PEs are proposed to be
divested or closed in accordance with the communications of the Divestment Commission. By March



Annex A
Page 7 of 11
2004, the PE reform program is expected to be completed with divestiture or closure of those PE's which
meet the policy's basic criteria. Only a few enterprises that serve important social aims are expected to
still be in government ownership by March 2004.
Financial Management & Accountability
35.   Our Financial Management and Accountability Strategy Paper puts forward three main strategies
to strengthen mechanisms for financial management and accountability.
36.   First, to strengthen financial control, we plan to modernize and computerize the financial
management and control architecture, including internal controls, accounting and management
information systems across the state. We have created and filled a new position of a Financial
"Controller" to provide leadership in modernizing the system of financial management.  Having
computerized the transactions in 90 treasury offices, we plan to enhance the state's treasury function by
converting the treasury offices into Integrated Pay and Accounts Offices next year. Also as of next year,
major departments will be required to publish revised annual reports outlining clearly their objectives,
activities, costs and actual achievement.
37.   Second, to strengthen audit, we will in 2000-01 create the position of "State Internal Auditor". We
will consolidate the internal audit function and modernize internal audit practice. We are already ensuring
timely response by the government to the audit reports by Controller and Auditor General (CAG).
38.   Third, we propose to organize a national conference on "Parliamentary Control of the Public
Purse" in 2000 to build national consensus in favour of increased legislative scrutiny. To improve public
scrutiny, we have established a task force, with members from outside as well as within government, to
recommend modes of presentation and frequency of government financial statements to the public. Action
on the recommendations of the Task Force will be taken next year. The Public Accounts Comrnittee of
the States Legislature has been reactivated, which will further strengthen the scrutiny of public
expenditure.
39.   Fourth, and finally, we have arranged with C &AG to conduct audits of high priority expenditures
and of procurement undertaken by major departments.
Reform Implementation and Monitoring
40.   A number of bodies are being created to implement the above reforms. Governance reforms will
be overseen by the Governance and CSR Core Group, headed by the Chief Secretary. Fiscal and financial
management reforms will be led by the Reform Implementation Task Force, headed by the Principal
Secretary of Finance. For tax reforms, a Reform Working Group will be formed in the Trade Tax
Department early in 2000-2001. A Divestment Commission is leading the PE reform program.
41.   To assist with reform implementation, a number of technical assistance assignments will be
needed. These cover the areas of: public enterprise reform, tax reform, implementation of property tax
reforms, civil service reform, anti-corruption measures, public expenditure management, financial
management and poverty monitoring. Funding from the World Bank has been requested for these.
42.   Monitoring of the Reforn  Program. The Government has prepared a list of Reform
Process/Outcome Indicators on each component of the reform program. These indicators will be
monitored on a regular basis during the period of implementation of reforms. In addition, these
indicators, together with the Poverty and Social Monitoring System (PSMS) indicators (see below), will
be tracked by a Monitoring Unit that has been set up in the office of the Chief Secretary for this purpose.
Poverty and Social Monitoring System
43.   Our ultimate objective in undertaking reform is to reduce poverty. An effective monitoring system
will enable the Government to not only to mitigate any negative impacts of reform, but also to better link
policies and expenditures to human development outcomes. A Poverty and Social Monitoring System
(PSMS) has been set up in the Office of the Chief Secretary. The system's main components are:



Annex A
Page 8 of 11
identification of a set of performance indicators and targets to track progress in reducing poverty and
promoting human development; building capacity to better use the extensive statistical information that is
already being collected as well as collect new information; and preparing analysis of the information to
understand the impact of the reforms on the poor and inform policy decisions.
Need for Extraordinary Financing
44.   Reforms have costs to begin with, while the fiscal gains take time to materialise. Restructuring
the power sector, for instance, has upfront financial costs so as to begin afresh, whereas there are
significant gains over the medium-term as the budgetary burden will vanish. Recovery of costs of public
services through user charges requires that the quality of service delivery first shows some improvement,
which requires additional allocations for operation and maintenance.  Closures, divestment and
privatisation of public enterprises will entail up-front costs including the cost of separation benefits. In
addition to these direct costs, there is the risk of expenditure cuts affecting non-wage O&M and capital
outlays in key sectors. Hence the protection of high-priority spending also needs to be factored into the
costs of reforms.
45.   Much of these costs of reforms will be met by controlling expenditure and augmenting revenue.
Nevertheless, extraordinary financing including quick disbursing external assistance will be required in
the initial years of the reform programn. Preliminary projections indicate that the extraordinary financing
requirement will decline over the years - from Rs 1800 crore about (US$425 million) in 1999-2000 to
about Rs. 1300 crore in 2000-2001 and Rs.700 crore in 2001-2002.
Commitment and Request
46.   The Government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to implement the reform Program as set out in the
five above-mentioned Policy Papers, and as summnarized in this letter and in the attached Matrix of
Medium-term Actions. We have already completed the first phase of reforms, as detailed in the first
column of the Matrix. We are determined to complete the Program, and thereby to accelerate economic
and social development in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
47.   I hereby request that this Letter of Development Policy be forwarded to the President of the World
Bank for consideration of financial assistance in support of our reform Program.
With regards,
Dr. Yogendra Narain
Chief Secretary
Government of Uttar Pradesh

Uttar Pradesh
Medium Term Fiscal Reform Policy
1.    Preamble
The Government of Uttar Pradesh has formulated its fiscal reform policy
as one of the main pillars of its comprehensive medium-term strategy to stabilize
the financial position of the state and reverse the trend of declining economic
performance and persistence of poverty. The comprehensive strategy includes
governance and civil service reform and power sector reform, public enterprise
reform, financial management reform, as well as reforms in policies and
institutions pertaining to other key infrastructure (irrigation and roads) and social
(education and health) sectors. The aim of the comprehensive reform strategy is
to achieve fiscal sustainability and create an enabling environment for improved
economic performance and more rapid poverty reduction, so that over the
medium-term, Uttar Pradesh can reach the top half among Indian states in terms
of physical, social and human development indicators.
The populous and sprawling State of Uttar Pradesh is well endowed with
rich natural resources in the form of vast fertile lands, plentiful surface and
ground water resources, forest and livestock resources. In spite of its rich natural
resources and vast manpower, the State of Uttar Pradesh continues to be among
the most backward in the country in terms of socio-economic indicators.
Uttar Pradesh has lagged behind the national average in the growth
process considerably except for a brief period of 1974-79 and 1990-92. As a
consequence, the distance between the State and national per capita income
has been constantly widening. In 1996-97, U.P's per capita income is currently
less than two third of the national per capita income. The relative gap has
tended to widen at an accelerated pace during the nineties when national growth
rate accelerated, while State growth rate remains only marginally above the
population growth rate.

The percentage of people below the poverty line in U.P. was 40.9%
against the all-India figure of 35.9% in 1993-94. Though this percentage has
gone down over the years, yet the absolute number of persons living below the
poverty line has increased from 530.60 lakhs (53 million) in 1983-84 to 604.40
lakhs in 1993-94. It is clear that poverty cannot be reduced without reversing the
trend of declining rates of economic growth.
U.P. lags behind most of the major States in terms of the level of
infrastructure facilities. With respect to electricity, roads and irrigation, U.P. is far
behind the faster growing States like Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra
and Karnataka (Annexure I). Not only is the economic infrastructure inadequate
but it is also of poor quality. Over the years, the relative gap in infrastructure
between the developed States and U.P. has widened.
In terms of social indicators too, the situation is far from satisfactory, with
U.P. at the bottom among Indian States. The fertility level is the highest in India
at 4.8, affecting both population growth and the health of women and children.
The infant mortality rate is 85 per .1,000 compared to 72 for India as a whole.
(Annexure II). The demographic situation presents a worrisome picture.
II.   Reasons for poor economic performance
The general economic backwardness and the slowing down of the
development process can be attributed to many factors, chief among which are:
(I) Inadequate and poor quality of infrastructure, especially power supply
shortages, reflecting the low level of investment in the economy over the years,
both in the public as well as private sectors, (ii) inadequate and ineffective
spending on education and health resulting in a low level of human resource
development and (iii) frequent changes in the government, resulting in a
perceptible decline in the quality of governance. In fact, all these factors are inter
related.

The failure of the State Government to maintain the desired level of public
investment in infrastructure and social services can be traced to the deteriorating
situation of the State finances since the early eighties and to the increased
political instability in the 1992-97 period. The mounting revenue expenditure of
the State Government on staff salaries, pension, interest payment and subsidies
have forced a squeeze in its capital and maintenance expenditures. The capital
expenditure which was around one third of total expenditure in the early eighties
has come down to below one fifth in the nineties. Similarly the ratio of plan
expenditure to total expenditure has also sharply come down from around two
fifths to one fifth, reflecting the decline in expenditure flexibility. The composition
of plan expenditure itself has shifted in favour of current expenditure at the cost
of capital expenditure. The efficiency of public spending has declined.
The slowing down of public investment has had its impact on the pace of
private investment in the State. The declining credit-deposit ratio and the share of
loans and advances by the national financial institutions is one reflection of the
showing down of economic activity in the State.
The low level of human resource development reflects substantial under-
investment in education and health services in the State. This causes great
deprivation to large masses of people. It restricts their capabilities to benefit from
the limited opportunities available to them, on the one hand, and lowers the
growth potential of the state economy due to low productivity levels, on the other.
U.P. has been caught in a vicious circle. The fiscal, governance and
infrastructure problems have fed into each other. Slow economic growth has
made increasing the revenue yield difficult. Poor governance has further lowered
the revenue performance. Financially weak infrastructure sectors have placed a
massive burden on the state exchequer. The fiscal stress caused by the setting
of tariffs well below cost-recovery levels has been added to by the deepening
culture of non-payment of customers to public utilities. The fiscal crisis has
prevented the state from investing enough to provide the foundation for growth
and lift social indicators to acceptable levels.
Ill.  Fiscal Crisis
U.P is facing an extremely adverse fiscal situation. From a revenue
surplus of Rs. 250 crores in 1987-88, the State now has a large and rising
revenue deficit, which reached Rs. 8696 crores in 1998-99. Revenue Deficit as a
percentage of Revenue Expenditure, which represents the proportion of
operating costs that are financed by borrowed resources, reached 33% in 1998-
99. Instead of using revenue account surpluses to partially finance public
investments, as is the financially prudent course, the Government is making
future generations pay for current operating costs.

The adjusted' gross fiscal deficit reached Rs. 11341 crores or 7.5% of
estimated GSDP in 1998-99. As a result of high and continued deficits, running
for more than a decade, indebtedness of the State has risen sharply. The stock
of debt is as high as 35% of GSDP, while interest payments constituted 35% of
the total revenue receipts in 1998-99. Some of the other important dimensions of
the fiscal crisis are as follows:
(i)   Revenue (recurring) expenditure has reached over 150%  of revenue
receipts2 in the State.
(ii)  Interest payment as percentage of total revenue expenditure has gone
from 14% in 1986-87 to 19% in 1998-99.
(iii)  The average tax rate in UP is only 50% of the level in the middle income
States. Since tax compliance in the State is relatively poor, the actual tax
revenue realised is almost one-fourth in comparison to these States.
(iv)   Expenditure on salary and allowances and pension of regular government
servants is estimated to have reached 40% of the State's total revenue in
1999-00; along with interest payments, they would amount to 75% of
revenue.
(v)   Capital expenditure and net lending has come down from 22% of total
expenditure in 1987-88 to 7% in 1997-98.
(vi)  The ratio of development & non-development expenditure in total revenue
expenditure has come down from 67: 33 in 1986-87 to 53: 44 in 1998-99.
(vii)  While the salary of class IlIl and class IV employees has increased by
nearly 75 and over 100 times, respectively, between 1964 and 1998, user
charges have actually declined in some areas.
(viii)  In the 50 Public Sector Units, the total investment of State Government
was to the tune of Rs. 13127 crores till January 1997 but the returns
received against these investments were negligible.
IV.  Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
Recognizing the unsustainability of prevailing trends, the State
Government has decided to launch a medium-term fiscal reform strategy to
achieve the following outcomes : (a) stabilization of the debt to GSDP and debt
servicing to revenue ratios, so that these ratios are on a declining trend by
2004-05, (b) improving the composition of public spending to enhance its
developmental impact and (c) reforming the tax system to improve efficiency in
resource allocation. In order to stabilize the level of its debt and debt service
ratios over the medium-term, the Government of U.P will need to eliminate the
primary deficit (the gap between revenue and non-interest expenditure) and turn
it into a surplus by 2003-04. The gross adjustment will have to be greater, to
enable the state to meet the upfront cost of reforms (including the cost of

restructuring power and other PEs) and increase its spending on infrastructure
and human resources, while at the same time reducing the deficit.
The Government's medium-term fiscal reform strategy targets to reduce
the fiscal deficit from 7.5% of GSDP in 1998-99 to about 4% by 2003-04 and to
3.3% by 2004-05. Over this period, the-primary deficit of 3.5% in 1998-99 is
targeted to turn into a surplus of about 1% of GSDP, while the state's own tax
revenues are projected to rise from 5.4% of GSDP to 7.9%.

In the absence of the reforms, the state's financial crisis would further
intensify leading to a collapse of development expenditures and a halt in most of
the government's operations and social service provisions The vicious circle
would continue and the per-capita income of the state would stagnate. Even
though the fiscal deficit is limited by the borrowing capacity of the state,
exhausting this borrowing capacity in conditions.of economic stagnation would
lead to an explosive growth path of the debt/GSDP ratio ; this ratio is projected to

rise under the No Reform Scenario from 34% in March 1999 to 51% by March
2005.
Under the Reform Scenario envisaged by the Government of U.P, the
additional public investments in infrastructure and human capital, improvements
in governance and the policy and institutional climate, and reforms in critical
sectors including power, are together expected to "crowd in" private investment
and gradually raise the rate of economic growth as the reforms take hold over the
medium term, thereby beginning to reverse the trend of widening gap between
UP and the rest of India. The fiscal, governance and sector reforms will lead to
the creation of additional fiscal space and enable the State to sustain higher
levels of public investment and non-wage operation and maintenance (O&M) in
irrigation, roads and social services as well as to improve the quality of services
rendered.
The key effects of the proposed reforms on the State's fiscal situation
include: (I) a significant increase in resource mobilization through increases in
the state's own taxes and cost recovery for public services provided by the state;
(ii) substantial improvement in the composition of expenditures through increases
in spending on high priority developmental expenditures along with significant
reductions in unproductive expenditures such as subsidies (particularly through
reforms in power and irrigation sectors), wages and salaries (through civil service
reform) and those related to losses of public enterprises (through PE reform and
privatization). Under this scenario, the debt-to GSDP ratio and the debt service-
revenue ratio would both begin to decline over the medium-term. The
government would regulate and control the issuing of guarantees through the
levy of guarantee fee, requirement of escrow arrangement (set aside fund) and
adopting a ceiling on outstanding guarantees, after studying the various options
proposed by RBI. Outstanding guarantees will remain below 3% of GSDP over
the medium-term, excluding those that may be issued to support the financial
restructuring of the power sector.
The medium-term fiscal framework of the reform scenario is shown in
Annexure Ill. The projections are based on assuming a 6% rate of annual
inflation and 11% interest rate on new loans in future years. The reforms and
improved targeting and quality of public spending, along with the induced higher
level of private investment, are projected to raise the rate of economic growth
from the current level of about 3%-3.5% to around 5% by 2004-05.
The Government of Uttar Pradesh expects, as a result of the
implementation of the medium-term fiscal reform policies, the Fiscal Deficit of the
State to decline not only in proportion to State income, but also in absolute rupee
terms. Adding principal repayment obligations, the gross financing requirement
will remain in the range of around Rs.12000-12500 crores in each of the next 5
years. The plan is to reduce over the medium-term the share of financing from
the most expensive sources, such as small savings loans and market borrowing,
while enhancing the share of project financing by external donors. In the initial



Annex B

Page 8 of 19
years of the reform program, the State would need extraordinary financing, from
the Government of India and from external donors, to enable financing of the up-
front costs of reforms, including PE reform and Power Sector restructuring, and
to adequately protect High Priority Development Experditures. Such
extraordinary financing is projected to be phased out in the later years, as the
reforms yield additional revenue and expenditure savings.
V.   Revenue Enhancement Strategy
The State's own revenue to GSDP ratio has been hovering around 5%-6%
over the last several years. The Government is determined to raise this ratio to
over 8% by 2002-03 and close to 9% by 2004-05, through reforming the tax
system, introduction of new taxes and strengthening the cost recovery efforts in
the irrigation, power, transport, education and health sectors.
Trade Tax Reform: Evasion of the state's first point sales tax, called
the UP Trade Tax, the state's biggest tax instrument, is estimated to be as high
as 40% of the revenues being collected. The Trade Tax Department (TTD) has
identified the main forms of evasion and initiated short-term measures to combat
each form of evasion. This short-term strategy is focused on reducing tax
evasion through stricter enforcement of the law and effective use of information
collected at the state's border check posts. At the same time, the Government
has recognised the need to develop a medium-term strategy for reforming and
modernising the sales tax policy and administration. The medium term goal of
trade tax reform is a more simple and modern tax system which will lead to
improved voluntary compliance, reduced opportunities for lengthy legal disputes
or taxpayer harassment, and improved climate for private sector growth. The
medium-term strategy would consist of the following sequence of steps:
*    Implementation of floor rates to rationalise the Trade Tax, in
accordance with agreement among all States (1999-00);
*    Rationalisation of tax incentives to ban any new tax holidays or
deferral (1999-00);
*    Amendment of the Trade Tax Act to strengthen the anti-evasion
drive by curbing under-valuation of goods, non-registration of
dealers and to prevent unnecessary delays and curb frivolous
appeals (2000-01);
*    Reduction in the number of Trade Tax rates from 11 to 5, in line
with Phase I of the recommendations of the government
commissioned Report by the Institute for Social and Economic
Change, Bangalore (2000-01);
*    Computerisation of existing business processes on pilot basis
(2000-01);
*    Reorganisation of the TTD based on functional design (begin in
2000-01 and to be completed in 2001-02);
*    Improved staff training and recruitment (starting 2000-01);



Annex B
Final Copy
March 17, 2000
Page 9 of 19
*    Implement external audit of the Trade Tax Department on a sample
basis by an external professional auditing firm (2000-01);
*    Make officials of the Trade Tax Department subject to Vigilance
supervision and require all tax officers to make an annual
declaration of their family assets (2000-01);
*    Further rationalisaton  of Trade  Tax  rates and  commodity
classification, in line with Phase II of the recommendations of the
government commissioned Report by the Institute for Social and
Economic Change, Bangalore (2001-02 Budget);
*    Scaling up of computerization (2001-02);
*    Business process re-engineering (study in 2001-02 and implement
in 2002-03);
*    Introduction of Self-Assessment and modern IT-based Audit
procedures (start in 2002-03 and complete in 2003-04);
*    Amendment of Trade Tax Act in preparation for VAT (2003-04); and
*    Introduction of VAT (2004);
Motor Vehicle Tax Reforms: In November 1998 the Government of U.P
brought into force a number of reforms. A presumptive design was adopted for
buses to minimise opportunities for evasion. The Act was revised to convert the
lifetime levy on personal four-wheel vehicles from specific to ad valorem rates.
The State plans to
l    Further revise the rates applicable to the presumptive base of the
passenger bus tax, which is currently defined in terms of seats and
hence lacks buoyancy, by at least 10% (1 999-00);
o    Amend the Act again to enable the rates to be revised annually
through Government Orders (1999-00); and
O-I   Revise rates annually, starting in 2001-02.
Stamp Duty and Registration: 'n order to create a more transparent
system for the determination of stamp duty liability, to ensure fair administration
of stamp duties and registration fees, and to adequately conserve property
conveyance records for the future, the State plans to
El    Modernise property valuation determination using standardised
objective  characteristics  and   computerised   administrative
procedures (starting 2000-01);
oI   Introduce appropriate scanning technology for the storage of
registered conveyance deeds in two Tehsil registry offices, on a
pilot basis (2000-01); and
O    Expand the scanning and storage of stamp duty and land
registration system state-wide (2001-02).
New Entry Tax: An Entry Tax, which is in effect an additional sales tax on
selected commodities including those on which a sales tax cannot be levied by
the state, has been introduced through a Government Order issued on
November 1, 1999. Phased implementation has begun in December 1999.

User Charges: Towards improving the rate of cost recovery from public
provision of private and semi-private goods and services, the Government will
implement a program of phased increase in user charges pertaining to power,
irrigation, higher education, specialised hospital services and other selected
economic and social services. The medium-term strategy would consist of the
following steps:
C    Upward adjustment of power tariffs as recommended by the
Electricity Regulatory Committee
0]    Upward adjustment of canal irrigation rates to double the rate of
cost recovery from 9% to 18% (1999-00, effective from April 1,
2000);
0     Revision of fees in engineering, medical, other colleges and
secondary schools to double the rate of cost recovery from 6% to
12% (1999-00, effective from April 1, 2000);
0    Double cost -recovery  from  hospital and veterinary services
(1999-00);
0     Implement second  round  of rate revisions in all of the above
(2001-02, effective from April 1, 2002)
VI.  Expenditure Reprioritization Strategy
Over the medium term, government spending will need to be increased in
both absolute and relative terms on elementary education, primary and
secondary health care, high priority investment and maintenance including
irrigation system rehabilitation and strengthening of roads. This will be possible
only if government spending is significantly reduced on subsidies, on wages and
salaries (through civil service form) and on budget support to loss making
enterprises.
The strategy to reprioritize expenditure will have the following key
elements:
(a)   The total number of government employees/officers would be
brought down by at least 2% every year for the next 5 years, to
achieve a reduction of at least 1 percentage point of GSDP in the
salary bill;
(b)   Comprehensive plan to reduce non-merit subsidies and transfers -
including those for higher education, professional education, urban
water supply and urban hospitals -to bring them to the bare
minimum level of no more than 0.5% of GSDP by 2004-05;
(c)   Reform  of  pension  and  provident  fund  based  on  the
recommendations of a study to be commissioned in 2000-01.

VIl. Expenditure Management Reforms
Expenditure Management Reforms, along with Financial Management
Reforms (explained in the Governance Reform Policy), will improve and
modernise the processes of planning and budgeting, accounting and audit,
monitoring and evaluation of program performance and outcomes.
As a result of recent initiatives such as the computerisation of treasury
transactions, the Government of U.P has already begun to strengthen the
efficiency of cash management and to prioritize the release of scarce funds so as
to protect the high priority developmental items in the expenditure budget from
resource shortage. Over the next two years, a suitable Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) will be designed and developed to ensure (i) a
realistic resource framework for budgeting; (ii) linking resource allocation to
sector priorities and policies, consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework;
(iii) financial sustainability and timely economic and social returns from ongoing
projects, (iv) adequate allocation and attention to operation and maintenance of
existing assets and (v) ensuring that borrowed resources are used only for
financially viable investments that yield returns adequate to service the debt
incurred.
The medium-term strategy of expenditure management reform would
consist of the following sequence of steps:
0    Begin  implementation  of strategy  to  protect high-priority
developmental expenditure (1999-00);
E]   Improve the timely availability of financial management information
through effective use of computerised treasuries (2000-01 );
0    Finalise and begin piloting a suitable MTEF for planning and
budgeting within a realistic resource envelope (2000-01);
1    Fully implement the MTEF in the context of preparing the budget for
2002-03 (during the year 2001-02);
0    Achieve  full  computerisation   of  budgeting,  expenditure
management and accounting by 2002-03.
VIII. Fiscal Correction in 1999-00
The Government of U.P has begun to implement the medium-term fiscal
reform strategy in the current year. The 1999-00 Budget emphasised the need
for financial discipline as a measure of development strategy. The Budget
speech recognised the need, on the one hand, for measures to augment financial
resources and productive investments, and on the other hand, measures to save
on unproductive expenditures so as to improve the composition and
effectiveness of public spending and at the same time reduce the deficit.



Annex B
Final Copy

Page 12 of 19
During the current year 1999-00, the Government of UP expects to reduce
the adjusted fiscal deficit from 7.5% of GSDP in 1998-99 to 7.0% in 1999-00.
This reduction is being achieved on the one hand by higher revenue collections
and on the other hand by compressing recurrent expenditures. As a
consequence, the ratio of revenue deficit to revenue expenditure, a measure of
the proportion of operating expenses financed by borrowed resources, is
expected to go down from 33% in 1998-99 to 26% in 1999-2000. The
Government has developed and is implementing a Contingency Plan to fulfill
these targets in the event of unforeseen revenue or financing shortfalls.
The State Government has already taken the following measures during
this current year 1999-00:
(i)   Revenue Measures
(a)   Entry tax has been levied on three commodities with effect from
1.11.99. It is expected to fetch Rs.50 crores during the remaining
months of the financial year. Coverage will be extended to two
more commodities including tobacco;
(b)  Intensive drive has been launched to recover the arrears of
Government dues;
(c)   Surveys of establishments that remain outside the tax net have
been started by the Trade Tax Department;
(d)   Rules for house tax revision have been notified on 16.6.99;
(e)   Floor rates for the trade tax have been implemented, and a study
has been initiated for further rationalisation to reduce the number of
rates to no more than five;
(f)   The costly and unproductive trade tax incentives for new
investments have been abolished;
(g)   A committee has been constituted under Chief Secretary to
examine all proposals to increase cost recovery; and
(h)   A legal amendment has been enacted to enable the Government to
make annual revisions in motor vehicle tax rates through executive
orders.
(ii)   Expenditure Saving Measures
(a)   Abolition of leave encashment facilities for Class I and 11
employees;
(b)   Ban on foreign travel;
(c)   Ban on air-travel by certain categories of officers.
(d)   Freeze on selective basis the grants-in-aid to the secondary and
higher secondary schools, degree colleges and universities at the
1998-99 levels;
(e)   Ban on creation of new posts and non-filling of vacant posts.



Annex B
Final Copy
March 17, 2000
Page 13 of 19
(f)   7000 posts lying vacant for more than a year have already been
abolished and the task of abolishing another 8000 identified posts
is underway;
(g)   Ban on inducting new educational institutions on grants-in-aid list;
and
(h)   Government has initiated a study to quantify the amount of subsidy
being given for various schemes through the budget so as to
reduce explicit subsidies and phase out those that can no longer be
justified on economic or social grounds.
The above measures are expected to result in significant
expenditure saving. Downsizing the civil service by at least 2% through
attrition will result in saving of roughly Rs. 100 crores. The freeze on
secondary and higher education subsidy at the previous year's level will
result in savings of about Rs. 107 crores.
(iii)  Expenditure Management and Control
(i)   The practice of transferring unspent amounts at the end of the year
to Personal Ledger Accounts, thereby inflating the accounted
expenditure and weakening expenditure management, has been
terminated;
(ii)   Treasury transactions are being computerized, to improve the
government's information system and cash flow management
during the year (About 90 percent of the treasuries in the state have
already been computerized);
(iii)  Treasuries have been instructed to give priority, in clearing bills, to
(a) resource linked projects and programs including centrally
sponsored and externally aided schemes, (b) non-wage operation
and maintenance ; and (c) those state funded projects that are
close to completion (i.e. where over 75% of total project cost has
been spent);
(iv)  The call letter for 2000-2001  budget preparation  made it
compulsory for all the departments to review their ongoing schemes
with a view to close the unproductive schemes.
(v)   Introduced a new system of reporting of time and cost over runs
and stricter requirements for new project starts;
IX.  Further Fiscal Correction in 2000-01
Consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework, the budget for 2000-01
will aim at a further reduction in the fiscal deficit by 1 percent of GSDP, even
while enhancing the allocations for high priority development expenditures by at
least 0.5% of GSDP. This will be achieved through further containment of non-
developmental spending and increased tax yield, mainly through base



Annex B
Final Copy
March 17, 2000
Page 14 of 19
broadening and improved compliance. As in 1999-00, the Government will
prepare a Contingency Plan to compensate for unforeseen developments.
X.   Expected Outcome by 2004-05
As a result of continuing with the implementation of the envisaged multi-
year fiscal reform program during the period 2000-05, additional fiscal space will
be created, expenditure composition will improve and high priority additional
investments and social sector spending will be undertaken. At the same time, the
State's finances will be stabilised; both the debt-to-GSDP and debt service-to-
revenue ratios will be on a declining trend by 2004-05. A notable aspect of the
fiscal reforms, accompanied by governance reforms and sector reforms, will be
the high return on public sector spending in the areas of infrastructure and
human resources. There will be a "crowding in" impact whereby additional public
sector investments and improved service delivery will induce greater private
investment by increasing the productivity of the latter.
The fiscal reforms, accompanied by governance reforms (including
reforms in the civil service, public enterprises and financial management) and
sector reforms in power, irrigation, roads, health and education, will create an
enabling environment for improved economic performance and more rapid
poverty reduction. The implementation of this comprehensive reform program is
expected to take the State on to the path of recovery. It is expected that the rate
of growth of GSDP will reach around 5% by 2004-05 and the State will thereafter
be ready for a take off-stage in a serious attempt to reach the top half among
Indian states in terms of physical, social and human development indicators.

POLICY PAPER ON REFORMS IN GOVERNANCE IN
UTTAR PRADESH
1.         INTRODUCTION
1.1        The 1998-99 Budget presented in the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh
addressed the,State's fiscal situation and underscored the need for financial
discipline as a critical factor in the development strategy of the State.
Recognising the mutual relationship between fiscal crisis and economic
stagnation, the State Government delineated a strategy to increase the pace of
development and committed the Government to a far reaching program of public
sector reform.  This is in accordance with the recommendations of the
Conference of Chief Ministers held in May, 1997, which discussed in detail an
action plan for effective and responsive Government at Centre and the State
levels.
1.2        Some of the factors that impinge negatively on economic growth in UP are:
* infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the power sector,
- low level of human development,
* high fiscal deficits forcing the State to resort to debt financing,
- a public sector that is over stretched and unable to discharge all of its
responsibilities effectively,
- weak governance, which manifests itself in poor service delivery, excessive
regulation and uncoordinated and wasteful public spending, and
- inadequate transparency, accountability and integrity of the public services.
1.3        Infrastructure bottlenecks act as both a drag on existing investments and a
deterrent to new investment, in which the State risks being bypassed. Power
supply is unreliable; illegal connections, non-payments of bills and other
leakages result in heavy utility losses which drain the budget. Food production
and living standards are stagnant or declining for many poorer groups in the
State.
1.4        The State is unable to collect its revenues efficiently. It imposes less tax than the
potential. The ratio of trade tax to GSDP is 2.8%, which is the lowest in the
country. On the expenditure side, the State is disproportionately burdened with
salaries and pension payments and poorly targeted subsidies which crowd out
capital expenditure. If we add the debt servicing component, very little is left
for operations and maintenance of existing infrastructure.  The growing



Annex C
Final Copy
March 14,2000
Page 3 of 20
unproductive expenditure of the State is impeding the growth prospects of the
State.
1.5        Any strategy to improve the quality of governance and the effectiveness of public
institutions in the State will need to have multiple components.  First, a
redefinition of the role of Government is required, specifically a reduction of its
role in the economy through deregulation and divestment is needed, so that it is
able to focus its limited capacity on those areas in which it has a core concern.
Second, Government also needs to become more transparent and accountable to
the general public, by making more information on policies and programs
available, by strengthening grievance eliciting and redressal mechanisms, and by
combating corruption. Third, a program of civil service renewal is required so
that the government can better perform its core functions.  This will entail
restructuring departments, "rightsizing" staffing levels, improving the work
environment, emphasizing performance, and increasing capacity through a more
strategic approach to training. Fourth, decentralisation will have to be designed
so that significant gains in service quality and accountability could be achieved
through well-planned devolution of spending responsibilities and revenue raising
powers to elected local bodies. Fifth, public participation in governance will
have to be structured by intvolving Non Governmental Organisations, who could
also exercise delegated voluntary functions. Sixth, financial management
reforms will also need to be integrated so as to improve financial accountability
and provide managers with the information they need to improve performance.
2.          REDEFINING GOVERNMENT
Overall the role of the State Government will progressively change, with less
emphasis on direct provision of goods and services and more on setting policy,
contracting out, mandating, regulating, facilitating or financing economic and
social services through the private sector. There are two major thrusts to the
Government's effort to redefine government: deregulation and divestment.
2.1        Deregulation: According to one estimate, 30 Departments are administering
349 State and Central Government Acts. In addition there are 268 Rules and 78
Regulations/Orders, many of which have been issued under the authority vested
in the GoUP by various Central Acts. Much of this regulatory framework dates
back to an era of control and intervention which is now seen as a source of
unacceptable efficiency costs on the State economy. Regulations impose a heavy
burden on enterprises. The distortions that are created make the economy less
responsive, and private investment is deterred.  Indirectly the poor and
disadvantaged sections of the population are affected in terms of their access to
education, health care, and nutrition.

2.1.2      Departments will review all laws, rules, regulations and orders administered by
them by 1 July 2000. They will specify amendments to legislation, indicate the
regulations they intend to retain, amend or drop. Laws & regulations that are
retained will justify themselves on criteria of efficiency, equity and simplicity.
The State Government will ensure that with the introduction of market forces, the
poor must not be denied access to basic minimum services; and that regulations
should be readily understood, unambiguous in their application, and
straightforward to implement.
2.1.3      The process of de-regulation will entail the following:
* The repeal of old and dysfunctional legislation.
* Unification and harmonisation of statutes and regulations.
* Revision of procedural law and dispute resolution methods.
* Scrutiny of subordinate legislation and procedures of government agencies.
* The design of new regulations consistent with econornic and social reform
goals.
e Clarification of the interface with Central legislation, and elimination of
contradictions and overlaps.
C Compliance with applicable international conventions and WTO obligations.
* Simplified administration based on IT enabled information, reduced forms
and returns, integrated processing of matters involving inter-departmental
concerns, and where appropriate, the introduction of sunset clauses.
A high powered Deregulation Committee has been set up to coordinate this
work.  Over the coming year it will work closely with the concerned
departments, their planning cells and senior managers, to review existing laws
and regulations. It will examine the continuing relevance of the underlying
policy that gave rise to the regulations, and make recommendations beginning by
2000/01 on proposals for their scrapping or reformulation so that they are
consistent with economic goals. In performing this task, the views of business,
NGOs and civil society will be actively solicited.
2.2        Divestment:  The UP portfolio of State Level Public Enterprises (SLPEs)
consists of 42 main enterprises, registered under the Companies Act 1956 and 8
corporate bodies established under various statutes. The SLPE performance has
been below  expectations.  Instead of augmenting Government resources,
executing developmental works in a cost-effective manner and spearheading
development, they have been a constant drain on the exchequer. Generally, they

operate in areas of the economy where private entrepreneurship is likely to
produce better outcomes.  State monopolies are typically among the worst
performing, and their staff are often perceived as rent seeking. In the ultimate
analysis, divestment is expected to result in budgetary savings in the medium
term.
2.2.1      The state government is committed to take the following steps:
Issuance of policy on PEs indicating divestment from commercial activities
or from areas where the private sector already operates;
* Establishment of an implementation framework such as Divestment
Commission for the divestment program;
. Closure and/or divestment of selected enterprises, with the first phase
completed by March 2001 and the remaining PEs completed by March 2004.
* Ensuring a safety net for displaced employees.
Public Sector Enterprises alreadv closed/divested or expected to be closed/
divested by 31 March 2001
* UP State Mineral Development Corporation,
i UP Instruments Ltd.,
U UP Pashudhan Udyog Nigram Ltd.,
* UP Cement Corporation,
*  11 units of UP Sugar Corporation,
* 5 units of UP Textile Corporation;
3.          CIVIL SERVICE RENEWAL
3.1        In the area of civil service reform, the Government faces three critical challenges.
It must enhance the productivity of the civil service and make certain that each
employee is performing socially relevant tasks. It must ensure the long-term
affordability of the civil service, and it must enforce procedures for rewarding
and promoting merit, disciplining malfunction and misconduct, to strengthen
accountability and performance quality.
3.2        First, it must deal with the immediate fiscal consequences of an excessive wage
bill, exacerbated by the salary awards consequent to the Fifth Pay Commission.
Salaries and pension payments (excluding the salary components of grants to



Annex C

aided schools) together added up to Rs. 100.67 billion or 6.3% of GSDP in 1999-
2000, which is nearly equal to the state's tax revenue. Actual compensation
figures are even higher, due to the presence of large numbers of casual and work
charged employees and the fact that many senior employees receive housing,
electricity, phone, etc. that do not show up as part of their compensation package.
Over 75% of total state revenues are currently being spent on salaries and
unfunded pensions; together with interest payments, the State has exhausted the
total revenue in 1998. At the same time, allocations to non-wage operating costs
have been severely squeezed, resulting in a decline in maintenance and efficiency
standards. In other words, the expenditure flexibility of GoUP has been reduced
to a bare minimum.
3.3         The second challenge is to reshape the civil service to bring about and meet the
demands of a redefined role for the government in the economy. It will focus on
core public functions and develop new ways of ensuring that critical economic
and social services are provided directly or indirectly or in partnership with
c*ommunities and the private sector. This will entail the introduction of a new
work culture - not only in managers and professionals positioned at headquarters
but also in field staff at the cutting edge of service delivery in decentralized units.
The resulting civil service is likely to be markedly different to what exists now:
with more contracting out of services than at present, an appropriate skills mix,
lower overall numbers over time, more responsive to the needs of clients, more
productive, and with a greater emphasis on accountability for the results of their
actions.
3.4         Controlling the wage bill is an immediate issue; changing functions and making
the civil service more performance oriented will be a continuing preoccupation
of the government for many years to come. Over the years, with the increase in
services, the number of civil servants has increased considerably. Today there are
about 940 thousand civil servants under direct employment of the government
and 243 thousand employed in Public Sector Enterprises.
3.5         In order to establish effective control over the growth of the salary bill in the
short term, the Government will
* ensure global reduction of at least 2% per year till the year 2004,
*  install a reliable system of timely information on the number of employees
and vacancies, by category and department,
.  undertake downsizing/ rightsizing programmes in each category of the
Departments through intensive internal reviews; identify redundant posts and
personnel to be retrenched/ re-deployed,



Annex C

Page 7 of 20
. constitute Policy Planning Cells in each Department to undertake in
consultations with external experts a strategic in-depth functional review and
determine workloads, positions and skills, with the goal of streamlining
operations, improving the ratio of front-line staff vis-a-vis support staff, and
significantly increasing the number of functions that are privatized and/or
contracted out,
* establish a Core Group and a Technical Working Group under the Chief
Secretary to help conduct inter-departmental functional reviews and monitor
the rationalization and restructuring of the departments, yarious agencies and
organizations, with the objective of improving the effectiveness of service
delivery and making them consistent with Indian and international norms.
The phased rationalization of departments is to begin on 1 January 2000 and
be completed on 31 December 2004,
develop and implement appropriate organizational performance indicators for
all departments starting by 31 December 2001,
* set clear sectoral objectives in the process of devolution of funds and ensure
appropriate and effective control of the elected local bodies over
functionaries,
* encourage innovations in the way departmental functions are discharged by
issuing certificates of merit, letters of commendation and other appropriate
mechanisms for recognition and reward,
post competent, innovative and energetic civil servants who are favorable to
reforms, to head key units and agencies and ensure good managers are
retained long enough in their posts to implement the required transformations,
make special efforts to recruit and ensure training for women candidates as
per existing government policy to give 20% reservation.
* integrate progressively the management of the wage bill into the broader task
of redefining the role of government, adjusting staffing levels, and bringing
policies and programs in consonance with the resources indicated in the
medium-term fiscal framework of the reform programme of the State.
3.6         Human Resource Management and Development
Renewing and modernizing the Uttar Pradesh civil service will entail upgrading
information systems, strengthening meritocracy and managerial authority,
substantial investments in new skills, retraining and inculcation of new work
habits and attitudes. This requires that a much more strategic approach be taken
to several important aspects of human resource management and development.



Annex C

Page 8 of 20
* Establishing a computerized human resource database, so the GoUP can
immediately produce accurate and timely information on the size and
composition of the civil service;
* Civil service terms and conditions will be reviewed in comparison with
global and Indian best practice to identify options for greater flexibility in
rightsizing and redeployment
* Adoption of best practices to provide greater stability in tenure for senior civil
servants,
* Publicize transfer policy and initiate annual monitoring and compliance,
* Annual Confidential Report process to be evaluated to improve its
effectiveness,
* Training for All, including civil servants of all levels, is the declared national
policy. In line with this policy a State Training Policy has been
conceptualised and adopted. This contains, inter alia, the following:
- Induction - professional and in-service training to be made compulsory for
each civil servant. The provision to this effect will accordingly be made in
the various service rules governing civil services.
- Training institutes will be involved in departmental reform programmes
and in building of capability, policy planning, research and evaluation.
Some of them will be developed as Centres of Excellence.
* Secretariat Training Institute will be strengthened.
* Computer skills and the use of information technology will be given priority.
At the same time, the Government fully understands that effective capacity
building requires that increased supply of training be matched by demand on the
part of departmental managers and heads of agencies for better skilled staff. This
demand will build, as the environment within the public sector progressively
emphasizes accountability for performance. Each department will design its own
training programme andfund it with 1% of the salary budget.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Financial Management System
4.1     Sound financial management is essential for good governance. Financial accounting
and internal auditing systems are at the heart of good financial management. The
GoUP's long established accounting system was designed to focus on bookkeeping



Annex C
Final Copy
March 14, 2000
Page 9 of 20
and expenditure control in relation to budgeted grants, rather than supporting
financial management. Since the responsibility for accounting and compilation rests
with the Accountant General (AG), the departments have not developed any reliable
and useful management accounting systems. The State Government is placing
strong emphasis on the need for improved financial management across all
Departments. This is seen as a critical foundation for managing public expenditures
for efficient and effective outcomes.
4.2         The State Government will, in consultation with the Accountant General and the
Government of India, initiate steps to design & develop an appropriate
accounting system. This will ensure (i) greater accountability and transparency in
transactions and (ii) a regular and reliable feedback enabling sound management
decisions. In order to facilitate this a Comptroller of Accounts (at the Secretary
level) will be appointed.
4.3         The present government accounting system will be modernized. Advise will be
sought on the design of a resource based accounting system, where the focus of
the system will be to capture and present costs (resource use) in achieving a
predetermined set of outcomes (agreed benchmarks).
4.4         The State finance and audit cadre will be strengthened by imparting training in
modern financial management.
4.5         An internal audit department will be established in order to strengthen internal
control systems. It will be headed by an Internal Auditor (of an appropriate
senior rank) and incorporate the local fund audit and the cooperative societies
audit with the newly established internal audit department.
4.6         The role of treasuries will be reviewed in the context of the new accounting
arrangements.
4.7         A survey will be conducted amongst the various stakeholders such as businesses,
the media, and the general public to design a public half yearly fact sheet
containing information regarding the financial status of the Government.
4.8         With the introduction of decentralization, the  Government will review the
financial control systems at the local bodies (the Zilla Panchayats, or village
panchayats) and take steps to strengthen them.
Budgeting
4.9         The GoUP has initiated the computerization of treasury transactions to improve
the information system (80 out of 90 treasuries have been computerized); as a
result, monthly revenue the expenditure outcomes are now available with less
than one month delay, albeit not with the desired level of desegregation. Nearly
half of the annual allocation for capital projects have been released in the first

half of the year, a break from past tradition. The practice of transferring end-of-
year unspent balances into the PLA  has been banned in June 1999.  A
Government Order issued in July 1999 requires the reporting of time and cost
overruns and restricts new project starts in each department to at most 20% of
actual expenditure on ongoing projects in the previous year. on ongoing projects
in the previous year. The Budget Call Circular issued by the Finance Department
in August 1999, to initiate the process of formulating the 2000-01 Budget
attempts, for the first time, to ensure budgeting within a realistic resource
envelope by requiring every department to accompany additional demands for
funds with identification of potential savings and additional resources.
5.          DECENTRALIZATION
5.1        Decentralization of revenue raising power, functions and staff resources has
already substantially started in Uttar Pradesh. It will be taken further as suitable
structures are evolved and put firmly in place.  These clearly set out the
regulatory and non-regulatory roles of various levels, especially at the State,
District, and the remaining two tiers of the PR system. District level and sub-
district level mechanisms are specifically to be strengthened after a very clear
analysis of the existing and future scenarios. Once this has been finally worked
out and agreed division of responsibilities has taken place, departmental
restructuring will take final shape.
e Following the 73 d and 74th Constitutional amendments and according to the 1 th
and 12 h schedule, the decentralisation which is to take place with respect to the
financial, administrative and personnel powers, has been formally announced.
Recommendation of the State Finance Commission to transfer 11% of State's
resources to the local governments (urban 7% + rural 4%) has been implemented.
* The administrative and financial powers vested in the Divisional Commissioners

appointed to discharge the aforementioned functions.
* Decentralisation in government departments is commensurate with their
responsibilities for efficient discharge of their duties.
* Regional devolution of powers to authorities to administer specified areas has

6.          GOVERNANCE
6.1        The Government of Uttar Pradesh  has signaled a very clear conmuitment to
improve the quality of governance in the state, to increase accountability, and to
reduce the incidence of administrative misconduct or corruption. Due emphasis
has been laid on the essence of CSR i.e. improving the delivery of services to the
people, by development of a new work-culture in the civil services.
6.2         Open government:  Concrete  measures  that could  serve  to  enhance
accountability, transparency and access to information include:
* Enactment of legislation for Right to Information along the lines of the statutory
scheme of the Government of India; The enactment of UP Right to Information
Act will be speeded up, as announced in the budget speech of 1999-2000.
*  Publication of reports of state-sponsored commissions and key policy papers.
U Use of information flows. Departments providing services will design a
management information system to empower consumers to exercise better choice
on services available.
* Government will approve a code of access for government documents to bring
greater transparency in decision making.
Responsive Government
6.3        With a view to make government functioning people-oriented and client centred,
every department will take the following steps:
* Introduction of a citizens charter for each department and office that has a public
interface, clarifying citizens entitlement to timely delivery of public services.
The citizens  charter issued by every department should clearly define the
standard for the services being rendered. It will also specify the remedial
mechanisms available to the citizen.
* The departments which have promulgated citizen's civil charters will ensure that
the necessary changes have also been introduced in every aspect of the



Annex C
Final Copy
March 14, 2000
Page 12 of 20
functioning of the department and at every level to conform to the standards set
in demand of these charters. The departments which have not issued charters will
be required to do so no later than 30 September 2000.
During introduction of citizen charters, departments would also ensure the
following:
- Merely notifying citizen's charters should not be an end in itself. Each
department should organise large scale capacity building programmes to
bring in attitudinal change in their employees.
-  Official interface with public on at least one fixed day in addition to
routine interaction. Devising system for ensuring a speedy disposal of
grievances at all levels of governance.
6.4   Anti Corruption Strategy and Strengthening the Rule of Law
Accountability, transparency and the rule of law, are integral constituents of good
governance. The issue of accountability is crucial for effective financial management
and a responsive civil service. A responsive legal system is essential for private sector
development and ensuring that all citizens, and particularly the poor, have access to
justice.
* In establishing the rule of law, the burden on the courts from excessive cases will
be lightened with the help of innovative mechanism such as Lok Adalat (Peoples
Courts for altemate dispute resolution).
* Nyaya Panchayati in the villages will be strengthened to reduce litigation
e  The state govemment will mount surveys of the perceptions and experiences of
businesses, civil society and civil servants in sectors which have a public
interface. These surveys will both measure public perception and experience of
the integrity of staff interacting with the public, and overall performance in the
delivery of services.   Surveys will be carried out by an independent
institute/survey body of recognized survey experience and integrity, and the
results will be published in time bound manner.  Implementation of the
recommendations of these surveys will be ensured.
* The Prosecution Wing of the Vigilance Department will effectively deal with the
low conviction rate of criminal offences. Improvement of conviction rate of
crimes will be effected with the introduction of Information Technology and
sustained human resource development
* Enactment of legislation/regulations to mandate strictly competitive bidding for
all contracts and procurement of works, goods and services by the govemment

and its entities, with regular publication of tender notices, bid closing dates, and
contract awards will be effectively ensured.
To reduce problems of corruption and mal-administration it is proposed to move
in two directions simultaneously. The first is to strengthen the key accountability
institutions and anti corruption bodies and secondly, to create an integrated, flexible and
responsive anti-corruption strategy based upon solid empirical evidence and regular
stakeholder feedback. The above two-pronged strategy is imperative as corruption
needs to be combated proactively by strengthening preventive measures in nodal and all
line departments with particular attention to fostering successful anti corruption efforts
at the departmental level.
To achieve the objectives of the above mentioned two-pronged approach the
following measures are to be taken:
* Set up a broad based task force with representatives from both Govermnent and civil
society chaired by Chief Secretary to consider options for rationalizing and
strengthening key accountability institutions, such as the Vigilance Department,
Vigilance commission & Administrative Tribunal, the Vigilance Establishment,
Chief Vigilance Officers within various departrnents and the Lok Ayukta
(Omdudsman), with particuiar attention to their mandate, staffing, budget,
organizational  structure,  work-processes,  regulations  and  guidelines  and
performnance indicators.
* Ensure Lok Ayukt reports from 1991 through 1998 are laid on the table of both the
Houses.
* Ensure that the Lok Ayukt is the appointing authority for at least 50% of all
departmental staff and he is allowed the freedom to recruit, transfer, promote and
terminate the staff independently.
* Fill all front-line investigation vacancies for the Lok Ayukt and expand front line
investigative and technical staff by at least three times over current established
levels; and increase budget for 2000-2001 proportionately.
Vigilance establishment to be allowed to recruit, transfer and dismiss at least 50% of
its staff independently.
* Immediately fill all open front-line investigative positions within Vigilance
establishment and increase budget by at least 20% for FY 2000-2001.
* Update Conduct Rules for GoUP civil servants not subject to All India Rules on the
basis of international best practices, ensuring that they are brief, user friendly and
drafted in non technical jargon.

* In accordance with standard survey methodology, survey a cross section of
government employees regarding attitudes towards corruption, service quality and
government performance.
* In accordance with standard survey methodology, conduct a household and business.
* Survey of attitudes towards corruption, service quality and government performance
to be completed by 31 March 2000.
* Prepare and conduct a more detailed survey of the Tax Department and its relevant
stakeholders regarding attitudes towards corruption, service quality and government
performance.
* Summarise the results of these surveys.
6.5 E-Governance in Uttar Pradesh
* The State Government of Uttar Pradesh has decided to use Information Technology
as a vehicle for economic development and a high quality life for the citizens. This
can only be possible if governance is effective. For effective governance, the need
for 'accurate' decision support system, 'timely' management information system,
'responsive' citizen  interface,  'effective' computer  literacy  and  'sound'
communication backbone can hardly be over-emphasised.
* The accurate decision support system shall replace 'subjectivity' with 'objectivity'
and the timely management information system would ensure timely implementation
of Government programmes. Irrigation, Roads, Education and Health sectors have
been identified for first phase of implementation of GIS based Decision Support
System in the State. The Management Information System on the other hand, shall
cover all the schemes of all the Departments up to the district level.
Objective decisions and timely executions may also not bring in the desired results if
the citizens, at large, face inconvenience and delays while transacting their business
with Government. Henceforth, a need for Simple, Methodical, Accountable,
Responsive and Transparent (SMART) Interface system exists. This interface, on
the one hand, would ensure implementation of "right to information" of citizens, and
replacement of "commuting" with "communication", on the other. The saving in
time of commuting would enable the citizens in utilising the same for more
productive purposes, thereby leading to overall productivity and efficiency in the
system. Under this concept, the information of public utility shall be computerised
and the same shall be hosted on departmental servers and sent to District hubs
through networking. This information would be transmitted to citizens through
Internet, Information Kiosks, Call Centres, Set Top Boxes and Cable TVs. The
departments selected for first phase are District Administration, Urban
Development, Trade Tax, Local Development Authorities, Electricity, Water

Page 15 of 20
Supply, Police, Tourism, Municipal Corporation, Railways & Department of
Telecom and the selected cities for its first phase implementation are Lucknow,
Noida and Allahabad. By 2008, all districts and all departments would be covered.
* For enabling Government system, as a whole, to deliver better services, and for
citizens to utilise these services, computer education and computer literacy will have
to be propagated as a mass movement. The Government has decided to train all its
employees on computers, and also, simultaneously create 20 million computer
literates by the year 2008.
* Effective governance through Information technology pre-supposes existence of
strong communication backbone across the State. With 65 of its 83 district already
covered by Optical Fibre Cable, such communication backbone already exists, and
rest of the district shall be covered soon by alternative sets of technology, viz., V-
Sat, GSM and OFC. A Wide Area Network (WAN) shall be created which shall link
up all Districts by 31s' March 2000, all Tehsils by 31s' March 2002, and all Blocks
by 31st March 2004.
* The State of UP is now ready to enter into the new millenium with a vision of high
tech and vibrant society working at a great efficient level, and ensuring better
services to common man at his door steps.
7   THE TASK AHEAD
The following sections set out some of the principal actions the government will
take in the months ahead.
7.1   Economy Measures:
The State Government recognizes the importance of resource allocation based on
certain priorities. Action on taxation reforms and other revenue reforms will reduce
the strain on the budget. On the other hand, the growing wage bill and other
spending pressures an account of a huge government bureaucracy will have to be
trimmed. In order to make the budget system more effective the state government
will do the following:
To assist the Government manage the financial implications of the restructuring
of state functions, and ensure that new policy is made consistent with the
available and expected resources, the 'Government will consider developing a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework .This should ensure more predictable
allocations to service delivery units, facilitate the setting of spending priorities,
and contribute to the setting and achieving of realistic aggregate fiscal targets. It
will also help in the making of more sustainable annual budgets, and make the
costs of policies more transparent over time.

targeted to the intended beneficiaries. Low cost recovery, as reflected in subsidized
tariffs in power, irrigation and water supply sectors will be effectively dealt with. With
this objective in view the state government will develop a comprehensive plan to reduce
subsidies by 15% in the year 1999-2000 over the previous year's level, and to phase out
unnecessary subsidies over time.
7.4  Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation:
* A Cabinet Committee, headed by the Chief Minister, has been constituted for
providing guidance and direction to the overall implementation of the
Governance Reform Policy.

CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS
IN UTTAR PRADESH
Government of Uttar Pradesh

Page 2 of 21
POLICY FOR CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS IN UTTAR PRADESH
Preamble
Civil Service is an integral part of the overall system of governance in the State.
The Civil Service in Uttar Pradesh, as in the rest of India, is a legacy of British colonial
rule. At the time of Independence, Uttar Pradesh inherited a strong Civil Service which
ensure smooth transition to independence and provided to the state a strong district
administration system, which ensured law and order and responsible revenue system. In
the post-independence period this Civil Service took up fresh challenges in the area of
planning and development, development of grass root democracy, and withstood the
severe pressures arising out of social and economic pressures.  In fact, the
commencement ,of the planning era saw UP in the vanguard of land reforms and
community  development movement with  several innovative  rural development
initiatives. UP also took lead in involving local urban community in managing the urban
bodies and this initiative dates back to the middle of the 19th century.
However, at present there is growing public perception that the civil service had
declined considerably in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Although it is not large
by international standards, the current staffing profile is unaffordable. It is also felt that
the civil service is currently over-stretched and is in need of significant rationalization
and redeployment. It also suffers from overstaffing in lower echelons; inappropriate skill
mix; cumbersome organizational structures and working processes and a general
weakening of critical accountability institutions and procedures.
UP is the largest State of India, having country like proportions, with a population
of 139.1 million as per the 1990-91 census. The increasing pressure of population
coupled with a deteriorating fiscal situation of the state government has made it
increasingly difficult to mobilize resources for investment in the vast developmental
needs of the state. The government of UP has a huge bureaucracy of roughly 1 million
government employees. A major part of the revenue receipts of the government is
consumed by the salary/wage bills of the employees and debt-servicing, sparing very
little financial resources to be invested in other critical development activities.
The Government of Uttar Pradesh has recently launched a comprehensive
programme for economic and fiscal reforms, to address the urgent problems of social
development in the State. Important initial steps have been taken to address the problems
of the power crisis and the fiscal crisis which, if not attended to, could derail the entire
process of development.   A  major initiative towards people's participation  in
development has been launched in March 1999, involving massive devolution of powers
and responsibilities to the elected local bodies, down to the village panchayats. The
success of these reforms in policies and institutions depends, to a large extent, on the
success or failure of the Civil Service to reform itself.
The Civil Service in Uttar Pradesh needs to change the way it functions and the
way it relates to the individuals and non-governmental groups in civil society. Without
fundamental reforms in the organizational structure of the administrative set-up, work
culture and ethics, client relations and orientation of government officials and public

servants, Uttar Pradesh will not be able to successfully implement the envisaged reforms
and achieve the desired objectives of economic and social development.
In the changing economic scenario characterized by liberalization, globalization
and democratic decentralization, a need is felt to think through the existing role of civil
service in order to introduce suitable modifications for making the civil service respond
to emerging challenges. From a predominantly controlling and regulating role, the
government machinery needs to reorient itself today, to play an enabling role for market
oriented economic growth. From a highly centralized and secretive bureaucracy, public
administration and service delivery need to be brought closer to the people, made more
transparent and accountable to them. From a large sized and perceptibly inefficent
system the civil service needs to transform itself into a trim and efficient, honest and
dedicated army of public servants who are fired with the passion for social development
and poverty reduction. It needs to develop over time into a modern system that makes
effective use of the latest information technology.
The above outlines the context and contours of Civil Service Renewal, or Policy
for CSR in Uttar Pradesh. The Policy for Civil Services Renewal incorporates various
components that are envisaged to be implemented during the next few years, their
appropriate sequencing and an implementation strategy.
Basic Assumptions
The basic assumptions of the CSR Policy are as follows:
> Civil Service is central to the system of governance and has a critical role to play in
the economic growth and social development of the state.
>  Civil Service continues to have a crucial role to play both in policy work in support of
departmental functions and collective decision-making, and in the delivery of a wide
range of public services
>  Civil Service has to respond to the need of developing professional approaches to
management, delivery of high quality and responsive services and injection of
competition and choice into service provisions.
> Within the broader framework of policies and strategic objectives established by the
State's political leadership, and in the context of careful monitoring focused upon
results, the civil service needs to be free to manage its human and financial resources
to achieve the goals set for it.
Objectives
To provide for the state of Uttar Pradesh and its citizens a highly professional, motivated
and dedicated Civil Service which is known for its efficiency, effectiveness, integrity,
political impartiality, objectivity, accountability and quality of service with a greater
concern for service users. These objectives of good governance are proposed to be
achieved by taking following specific measures:



Annex D
Final Copy
March 14,2000
Page 4 of 21
3 To improve the financial position of the state and the generation of adequate revenue.
>  To inculcate a strong sense of gender equity and justice.
>  To create a professional body of civil service characterized by transparency,
motivation, accountability, responsiveness, integrity, efficiency and effectiveness.
> To make the civil service function as a catalyst in the socio-economic development of
the state and its people by limiting its involvement to providing certain basic services
and fostering an enabling environment for private sector growth.
>  To re-orient civil service towards enabling and facilitating the on-going process of
decentralization of govemance in the state.
Key Principles
The Govemment is wholeheartedly committed to sustaining the following key principles
on which the civil service is based:
(i)    Transparency
> To make sure that people know exactly what is going on and what is the rationale of
the decisions of the Govemment.
(ii)   Accountability
> To make sure that for every action and inaction in government and its consequences
there is a civil servant responsible and accountable to state, society and people.
(iii)   Responsiveness
> To make sure that people's need, aspirations and their well-being are the prime
concern of the civil service and is reflected in the nature of response of civil service to
people.
(iv)   Efficiency
> Performance based on outcomes and the optimum utilization of resources to have a
favorable input-output ratio to be the driving force of the civil service.
(v)   Effectiveness
> Realization of the reform objectives to re-orient the civil service to meet the emerging
challenges by ensuring that all departments have monitorable outcome measures
linked to their broader social function,

> Improving policy making, management and service delivery, the Civil Service needs
to increase its focus on performance and on developing all its staff.
Reform Agenda
The Civil Service Renewal Agenda consists of the following components:
> Redefining Functional Goals
> Reorganizing and Restructuring the Administrative set-up including the Secretariat,
Directorates and field formations
> Ensuring Affordability
>  Human Resource Management and Development
>  Improving Systems and Work Methods
(i)    Redefining Functional Goals
In the wake of changing economic and political environment in the state and
macro policy shifts at the national level a need is felt to redefine the functional goals of
the civil service with a view to making it more relevant and responsive in the present
context. The functional goals are redefined in the following manner.
>  The core government functions such as revenue generation, maintenance of law and
order and upholding the rule of law for bringing about communal harmony and social
cohesion in the state need to be further strengthened by making the civil service more
sensitive and by encouraging it to adopt best practices possible
>  However, the civil service has to gradually make a shift from its earlier role of being
a provider and regulator to one of a facilitator and promoter in an overall sense.
- The civil service is to function as a catalyst in the economic growth and social
development of the state by providing a level playing field for all the stake holders
including the private sector, NGOs, voluntary groups and the people themselves.
>  The ethos of civil service to be characterized by professionalism, premium  on
performance and productivity and a commitment to reduction of corruption.
>  Facilitating and enabling the on-going process of devolution, de-concentration and
decentralization together with de-regulation.
(ii) Reorganizing and Restructuring the Administrative set-up
With a view to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and productivity it is proposed to
rationalize, realign and reengineer all departments, at the Secretariat, Directorate and the
field level. The objective would be to eliminate functions and tasks that are no longer
needed or bring little value added so that the govemment can concentrate upon high
priority areas, save in overhead and administrative costs by reducing administrative and
support functions and involving more staff in front-line tasks of service delivery.



Annex D
Final Copy
March 14,2000
Page 6 of 21
To enhance effectiveness by increasingly focusing from compliance to outputs and
outcomes it is proposed to undertake following steps:
Establish Policy Planning Cells within 62 major departments to coordinate
departmental Reform efforts.
Department of Personnel and Appointments (DPA) designated as nodal agency for
CSR Reform process, assisted by Department of Administrative Reforms (DAR) and
UP Academy of Administration.
' DPA and DAR to initiate preliminary intra-departmental review process regarding
department mandate and mission, product and services, organizational structure and
work processes.
Each department to redefine its functional goals and come up with decision and
mission statements, existing structure and areas for rationalization of departments are
to be allowed to retain anticipated savings through rationalization.
>  Establish Technical Working Group to the CSR Core Group in DPA to conduct a
major inter-departmental functional review in order to rationalize the distribution of
work between departments, eliminate functional overlaps and redundancies and
merge and truncate tasks functions and departments; and identify areas for
contracting out, with the goal of making them consistent with Indian and international
norms.
> Draft TOR and recruit international and domestic consultants for Technical Working
Group and initiate interdepartmental reviews.
(iii)   Ensuring Affordability
In order to ensure the long term affordability of the civil services, to improve
productivity by redeploying staff to more valuable tasks it would be essential to allow
for greater managerial flexibility by expanding options for redeployment and
retrenchment on the one hand and putting an end to the "entitlement mentality"
regarding jobs in the public sector. The following steps are to be taken to achieve the
objective:
>  Consistent with the objective of reducing the size of the civil service by at least 2%
per annum, impose a freeze on all recruitment, including the filling of vacancies, with
clearly specified exemptions for front-line staff in high priority areas.
Conduct a civil service census that compares established positions against actual staff.
>  Abolish about 10,000 positions identified as vacant and redundant.
>  Department of Personnel and Appointments designated to coordinate in monitor
downsizing/rightsizing exercises.
Initiate a review of civil service terms and conditions to identify changes that will
allow for greater flexibility in downsizing and redeployment.

Human Resource Management and Development
To improve productivity by allowing public sector managers greater freedom and
discretion in managing their staff, to enhance meritocracy by strengthening the process of
performance monitoring and evaluation and, finally to improve the quality and skills of
the workforce, following steps are to be undertaken for improving human resource
development:
>  Establish a computerized human resource database, so the GoUP can immediately
produce accurate an timely information on the size and composition of the civil
service.
Constant up-gradation of knowledge, skills and attitude of civil servants working at
all levels of the government with a focus on the cutting edge level through
compulsory induction, in-service and specialized training.
Transfer policy to be finalized, and guidance for the appointment and transfer of all
officers will be publicized, on an annual basis.
>  Directive sent by Chief Minister to all Cabinet members, and by the Chief Secretary
to all Heads of Department and senior department staff, that new transfer policies are
to be strictly adhered to.
Department budgets for transfers to be disaggregated and strictly monitored.
>  For the transfer of senior officers of the All India Services, the suggestions of the
Chief Secretary and other senior officers shall be taken and the final decision shall be
taken by the Honorable Chief Minister on the basis of the names suggested.
Senior positions like those belonging to Class I and Class II officers are to be
classified for rational and judicious placements.
>  Annual Confidential Report (ACR) process to require regular year end feedback
sessions between supervisory and subordinate staff.
>  The goal of training for all, as stated in the national and state training policies, to be
realized through sustained efforts and interventions.
Sensitization of civil servants on gender issues and social responsibilities at all levels
to be undertaken through a series of workshops, seminars, training and orientation
programmes for a better and gender sensitive system of administrative governance.
>  Institutionalization of best practices in civil service administration and their
documentation for institutional memory.
Establishing institutional linkages with think-tanks and advocacy groups both within
and outside the government for continuous learning and development.
Inter-sectoral mobility of civil servants to be encouraged as per the emerging needs
and opportunities.
Greater use of Information Technology including modemization of record keeping.

> Specialization to be encouraged among the Group A and B level civil servants
through informned career planning and training.
> Class IV civil service personnel to be posted preferably in their home division and
district, respectively.
(iv)  Improving Systems and Work Methods
> The aim of improving systems and work methods would be to create a new work
culture based on openness, accountability, responsiveness, efficiency and
effectiveness.
> The following systems to be examined and redesigned for bringing about professional
efficiency in the functioning of civil services.
Y Regulatory system of the state
>  Budgetary system of the state
> Public Grievance redressal system
>  Management information system
>  Personnel management system
>  Financial management system
>  Decision making system
>  Performance evaluation system
>  Policy making system
Regulatory system of the state
A highly complex regulatory regime for regulating the function of various
govemment departments and its personnel has grown over the years in the form of a vast
body of Acts, Rules and Regulations, many of which are now totally irrelevant and
outdated. There is an urgent need, therefore, to introduce desired deregulation for
bringing about efficiency and effectiveness in government functioning.
The civil service would be involved in the exercise by encouraging it to undertake
a study of all extant administrative laws and regulations and the rules and procedures
under them and to formulate proposals for amendment wherever required; determine
specific changes required in rules and procedures in relation to certain economic and
social areas; and to identify the laws, regulations, rules and procedures which need to be
repealed.
Budgetary system of the State
> Demystification of the budgetary process in order to ensure active involvement of
major stake-holders i.e., major government departments to ensure a consultative and
rational budgetary allocation.
>  A thorough overhaul of the budget system including suitable modification of the
budget manual and process to be uindertaken to ensure the rationalization of budget
heads.

>  Budget document to be simplified making it more realistic indicating government
priorities more clearly and made more readable and comprehendible to wider
audience including the members of civil society by putting it up on intemet.
> Performance budgeting proforma to be revised, showing the outcomes more clearly,
to be made more purposeful.
Public Grievance Redressal System
> Public Grievance redressal systems to be examined and redesigned in all the
concemed departments to make them more people friendly as well as personnel
friendly on the one hand to ensure speedy redressal of public and personnel
grievances on the other.
>  Some pilot schemes to be taken up for effective redressal of grievances at the district
level itself with requisite monitoring arrangement.
>  The authority who is responsible for its final disposal to be sent all petitions and
applications.
MNanagement Information Systems
,  MIS is to be organized in such a fashion as to avoid multiple layers of reporting and
undesired overlapping of feedback.
>  An effective MIS has to be developed with standardized procedures of feedback both
top-down and bottom-up with a provision of suitable punishment for the wrong
feedback.
Personnel Management System
, The existing methods of disciplinary proceedings against civil servants have proved
to be ineffective for a variety of reasons. Operational bottlenecks are to be removed
and the system strengthened further, by constituting additional benches of
Administrative Tribunals, if considered necessary.
Financial Management System
>  Efficient and effective financial management systems to be put in place in all the
government departments based on principles of rational expenditure management and
value for money
z Present system of audit of accounts has proved ineffective in so far as the timeliness
and coverage of institutions to be audited is concerned and audit organization deals
both with the cooperatives and the panchayati raj institutions. With the democratic
decentralization having taken place with substantial financial devolution to the
district, sub district and village panchayati raj institutions it has become imperative to
substantially improve the existing audit mechanisms. With increasing volume of
business of the cooperative institutions, volume of business increasing
continuously, it has become essential to strengthen the existing audit capabilities to

ensure financial accountability. It would be necessary to bifurcate the existing audit
system to be divided into two independent organizations, one fully responsible for the
audit of PRIs and the other for the cooperatives. If necessary the strengthening be
carried out by taking surplus staff from other organizations and if it does not meet the
end getting audits performed by the chartered accountants.
> Strict and concurrent audit of Govt. expenditure to be introduced by ensuring rational
and judicious use of public money for the benefit of the state and its people.
> An effective internal audit system to be introduced for strengthening internal controls
for better expenditure management.
>  Strengthening of the Intemal Finance Advisor System, and bringing all the
departments under it.
>  Annual audit of all auditable institutions to be made mandatory and audit machinery
strengthened suitably to achieve this objective.
Decision Making System
> The process of decision making to be rationalized by identifying the exact levels at
which decisions need to be taken and minimize the levels by cutting them down to a
maximum of two to three levels by which a decision is taken. Department of
Administrative Reforms to coordinate and oversee the work.
Performance Evaluation System
> Suitable performance evaluation  systems based on outcome-based objective
performance standards to be devised and put in place in all the government
departments
> Classification of work norms both in the office and field in terms of individual and
group norms to facilitate the measurement of performance by civil servants
> Good performance to be duly acknowledged and appreciated through monetary and
non-monetary incentives such as citation of good work done to individuals and
groups of civil servants.
Work Methods
> Officer oriented work disposal methodology be introduced and effected.
> Leadership, motivation and team building along with people needs and demands to be
emphasized in creating systems and work methods.
>  Innovative work methods and creativity to be encouraged among individuals and
groups of civil servants through a rationally devised incentive system.
> An institutional mechanism for ensuring consultative process for identifying the
innovative work methods, creativity and good work done to be put in place e.g.
introduction of Quality Circles, with special emphasis on cost-effectiveness.

Right to Information
P Each department to review and define the areas where access of citizens to
information is introduced immediately.
3 All forms required to be used by the public be made public through the Internet.
>  All departments, agencies and organizations who receive payments, loans or

position of payments made and due on the Internet (with adequate password
protection), making it possible for individual citizens to access their personal
information without having to visit to these places.
> By 2002, the GoUP will introduce a Right to Information Act.
> Prior to the introduction of the Right to Information Act, a Code of Access for access
to information be introduced.
Anti Corruption
To reduce problems of corruption and mal-administration it is proposed to move in
two directions simultaneously.  The first is to strengthen the key accountability
institutions and any corruption bodies and secondly, to create an integrated, flexible and
responsible anti-corruption strategy based on solid empirical evidence and regular
stakeholder feedback. The above two-pronged strategy is imperative as corruption needs
to be combated proactively by strengthening preventive measures in nodal and all line
departments with particular attention to fostering successful anti-corruption efforts at the
departmental level.
To achieve the objectives of the above mentioned two pronged approach the
following measures are to be taken:
> Set up a broad based task force with representatives from both Government and civil
society chaired by Chief Secretary to consider options for rationalizing and
strengthening key accountability institutions, such as Vigilance Department,
Vigilance Commission & Administrative Tribunal, the Vigilance Establishment,
Chief Vigilance Officers within various departments, and the Lok Ayukta
(Ombudsman), with particular attention to their mandate, staffing budget,
organizational structure, work processes, regulations and guidelines and performance
indicators.
> Ensure Lok Ayukta reports from 1991 through 1998 are laid on the table in both the
Houses.
> Ensure that the Lok Ayukta is the appointing authority for at least 50% of all
departmental staff and he is allowed the freedom to recruit, transfer, promote and
terminate the staff independently.

>  Fill all front-line investigation vacancies for the Lok Ayukta and expand front line
investigative and technical staff by at least three times current established levels;
increase budget by for 2000-2001 proportionately.
Vigilance establishment to be allowed to recruit, transfer and dismiss at least 50% of
its staff independently.
>  Immediately  fill all open  frontline  investigative  positions within  vigilance
establishment and increase budget by at least 20% for 2000-2001.
>  Update conduct Rules for GoUP civil servants not subject to All India services on the
basis of intemational best practices ensuring that they are brief, user friendly and
drafted in non-technical jargon.
In accordance with standard survey methodology, survey a cross-section of
government employees regarding attitudes towards corruption, service utility and
government performance by 31 March 2000.
>  In accordance with standard survey methodology, conduct a household and business
by 31 March 200.
>  Survey of attitudes towards corruption, service quality and government performance
on a regular basis every two years.
Action for punishment or prosecution of the officers against whom the charges of
corruption/serious irregularity have been established through enquiry should be taken
in a time-bound manner within three months.
> The provisions for screening personnel to be strictly implemented.
Implementation Strategy
A policy has no meaning unless it can be truly and effectively realized in practice.
The biggest challenge of this policy is to translate it into practice. Hence the need of an
implementation strategy. The strategy adopted is as follows:
>  A Cabinet Committee, headed by the Chief Minister, to be constituted by providing
guidance and direction to the overall implementation of the CSR policy.
>  An implementation team, known as the CSR Core Group, headed by the Chief
Secretary to the Government of UP would spearhead the implementation of the
policy. The responsibility of the Core Group would be to carry out necessary follow-
up, monitoring and mid-course corrections in the policy implementation. Its work
will be supported by a Technical Working Group in the Office of the Chief Secretary
and Policy Planning Cells within the various departments.



Annex D

The department of Personnel would be the nodal agency for the implementation of
the policy, working under the guidance of the Cabinet committee for CSR and direct
supervision of the CSR Core Group.
A compendium of important government order to be brought out annually by each
department mandatory both for the use of its own staff and information of the general
public.
The Department of Administrative Reforms is to be strengthened suitably in order to
be able to take up various follow up activities, emerging out of the reforms being
presently undertaken.
The other elements of the implementation strategy are as follows:
To bring about suitable structural and systemic changes for improved functioning of
the civil service.
> To create a critical mass of change agents committed to professional efficiency and
either in administration.
To ensure effective management of change.
> To inculcate a culture of financial discipline by adopting best principles and practices
of financial management such as value for money etc.
Total office automation in phases to bring in transparency and professionalism in
administration and public service management.
Wide use and application of information technology in government operations to
create a culture of professional efficiency, transparency and public commitment.

SECTOR SPECIFIC CSR ISSUES
Education:
Special priority has been given to total literacy and primary education. A vigorous
campaign has been launched for total literacy in 50 districts of the State with the help of
District Literacy Committees, Villages Education Societies and Voluntary Organisations.
World Bank aided "Education for all Programme" has been extended to 42 more
districts, thus covering 77 districts in the State. Education Guarantee Scheme has been
launched in 1999-2000 to enlist community participation in education. The state
government has decided to give free education to girl students upto graduation level.
The state government will design a strategic plan to
* this could be a good opportunity to again make the point that the state should do a
total sector policy review prior to further planning for each substage of education
to ensure continuity and consistency.
the strategic plan should also include (a) expansion and quality improvement of
early childhood care and education and (b) a holistic approach to education and
development of children through more effective convergence of the school
program with school health and nutrition programs.
* the first point on educational options should be further elaborated to include "and
provide for consistent professional onsite support to these options for ensuring
sustained quality and equivalence with the formal school program."
* expand the educational options to increase effective supply/access, such as double
shifting, small schools, para-teachers;
* improve retention through improvements in quality inputs and processes, and
recruiting female teachers;
* effectively monitor performance;
* build capacity of the implementing departments and;
* decentralise decision making to the community level.
Forestry
The Forest Department (UPFD) is tasked with balancing the conflicting requirements of
increasing forest cover, conserving biodiversity, and maximizing productivity and
revenue generation in the use of forest products. It is also increasingly being asked to
advance ecodevelopment and involve communities in participatory forest management.
It currently comprises 21,186 sanctioned position establishments, or approximately 2% of
the GoUP total. Other organizations active on forest issues include the Hill Development



Annex D
Final Copy

Page 15 of 21
Authority and the Forest Corporation. Together, the Forest Department and Corporation
employ about 24,362 individuals on a regular basis.
Reforms in the Forest Department are more advanced than in other sectors. The
Department is currently implementing a number of initiatives to improve its management,
including: (1) ensuring that the policies, management processes, and organizational
structures of UPFD are appropriate to its role as the nodal agency in forest management;
(2) strengthening human resources management and development; and (3) developing
information systems to assist with all aspects of the planing and management of forests.
Regarding the reform of organizational structures and business processes, one of the
Department's top priorities is to decentralize decisionmaking procedures. Managers have
historically not been delegated the' necessary authority to discharge their duties
effectively, which has lead to delays and diluted accountability. Several initiatives to
increase administrative and financial decentralization and improve the clarity of
responsibilities are under consideration, and site specific, bottom-up, participatory
planning processes are now being implemented. In conjunction with the broader civil
service rationalization, plans are also under consideration for reorganizing the
Department, perhaps along functional lines regarding wildlife, conservation and
plantation activities.
The Forestry Department is moving forward with a number of reforms in the area of
human resource management and development. A proposal for restructuring the Indian
Forest Service (IFS) cadre in the State based on functions has been finalized and is
awaiting GOI approval since May 1999. Efforts to refocus in a more performance driven
organization have been initiated with the preparation of a new performance appraisal
system. A Human Resources Development (HRD) plan is under preparation, and a
training needs assessment has just been completed and is ready for implementation.
More training is needed in the general principles underlying site specific planning and in
broader communications skills for field staff.
A financial management accounting system is under preparation, but further work is
needed to ensure that withdrawal allocations are processed on time. Low disbursements
are of concern, and a detailed analysis of the causes of these delays will be undertaken
shortly. The Department is also preparing a system of performance audits.
Any reform of the forest sector must also address the reform of the Forest Corporation, a
harvesting and sales organization that currently enjoys a monopoly on the exploitation of
wood and non-wood forest products from public forests. The Forest Corporation has
suffered from a legacy of extemal interference and patronage recruitment. A number of
reforms are needed to ensure its long-term financial viability.
Irrigation
A study of UP Irrigation Department has concluded groundwater operation is a
substantial loss-maker and is choking the financial capability of the ID to run the other
services effectively. It is therefore necessary to unburden ID of this operation. UP
Irrigation Department has upgraded its norms of maintenance and construction and based

on 120 divisions and 6 circles has been declared surplus. The state government is aware
that efficient and sustainable exploitation of already developed irrigation system would
be a critical element of its irrigation reforms.  Central to improving irrigation
performance will be a higher priority on water management.    Comprehensive
institutional reforms will include the following actions:
* Water Users Associations will be formed along all main irrigation systems
*  Expenditure (especially O&M expenditure) incurred by the WUAs will be linked
to the collection of water charges in their respective command areas.
*  Enabling provisions in appropriate Act will be used to set Rules for O&M of tube
wells by Panchayats
* Utility Regulatory Commission will be appointed
The Irrigation Department and its affiliated organizations (Minor Irrigation, Irrigation
Inventory Control, Irrigation Construction, Ram Ganga Command) are one of the largest
employers in the state. There are approximately 64,000 regular position establishments,
and the Department also utilizes over 22,000 casual and work-charged employees,
bringing its total employment to approximately 86,000.
The reform of any large department, such as Irrigation, will be an extremely complicated
task requiring patient and persistent effort over a number of years. From a strategic
perspective, the department faces a number of important decisions regarding the
rationalization, reorganization, restructuring, rightsizing, decentralization, unbundling
and selective commercialization and privatization of services. Productivity is low, and
operations such as surface and ground water management are currently sustaining major
losses through overstaffing and weak cost recovery.  Sweeping reorganization and
rationalization will be necessary to eliminate loss-making functions, and the GoUP is
developing a comprehensive strategy towards this end.
Consistent with best practice in other settings, the Department is moving towards a
management strategy using the river basin as the basic hydrologic and geographic unit.
This objective will, in tum, require the creation of a State Water Planning Office under
the existing State Water Board. It will also involve establishing an independent Water
Tariff Regulatory Commission (WTRC) and a Water Resources Data and Analysis
Center (WRDAC). The preparation of river basin plans will take place at the basin level,
and it will take place in a multi-disciplinary, multisector and participatory fashion. An
initial pilot will be conducted from the Ghagra-Gomti basin and then adapted and
replicated in other parts of the state. For operations and maintenance, decentralized water
service agencies should be established and linked with water user associations and other
bulk consumers at the retail level. These could be commercialized and selectively
privatized. This approach will also be piloted initially in the Ghagra-Gomti basin.
Under any serious reform scenario, overstaffing will be a major problem. Preliminary
estimates indicate substantial numbers of staff may eventually need to be redeployed.
Current plans envision transferring large numbers of staff to the Gram Panchayat level,



Annex D

where they will be trained to facilitate the provision of ten functions.' (This undertaking
will be a major exercise, whose successful completion will require a massive effort at
human resource development.) Other efforts at functional rationalization may involve
devolving the responsibilities -for the Department of Minor Irrigation to local
communities. The GoUP has already taken some steps forwvard, and 107 divisions were
eliminated.
Beyond redeployment, the staffing mix of the Department will need to be revised. It is
currently strong on technical staff, such as irrigation engineers, but weak in areas such as
water management, accounting and financial management. It is imperative that staff with
these critical skills be expanded as soon as possible, though the number of new recruits
needed is likely to be modest. As is true with many other parts of the civil service, the
link between performance appraisal and promotion needs to be strengthened.
Additional progress will be necessary in several areas. The first is data management,
including the provision of modem  equipment (survey, design, communications, data
acquisition, storage, processing and analysis, etc.) The second is the creation of modem
technical, financial and operational management capacity using computer based MIS and
telemetry. (Updated accounting and monitoring capabilities are particularly needed.)
The third is increasing participation and feedback into the planning process through the
forrmation of water user associations, intensive outreach training and technical assistance
by the Department, and expanded participatory rehabilitation and modemization of the
irnigation and drainage systems.
Medicine and Health Department
The health sector is one of the largest employers within the govermment of Uttar Pradesh.
The Medical and Health Department has an established strength of 97,236, or 12.3% of
all position establishments as of 1 April 1999. There are two additional departments that
provide more traditional health related services: the Ayurvedic & Unani Department,
with 10,184 established posts, and the Homeopathic Medical Department, with 3,851
positions.
The Medical and Health Department requires a number of urgent reforms. Many of the
problems that beset the department are common throughout the civil service, such as
frequent transfers and inappropriate skills mix. Accountability mechanisms will also
need to be improved. Others, such as the changing extemal environment and the number
of altemative service providers, are more pronounced in this sector.
In the area of strategic management, there is a need to rationalize the provision of
services to elimninate unnecessary overlap and duplication of functions and save on
overhead costs. The division of responsibilities, such as between urban hospitals and
rural health services, also needs to be reviewed and reformed to ensure greater
These functions and their related infrastructure include primary and junior schools, tube wells, hand
pumps, health sub centers, animal husbandry sub-centers, youth welfare, agriculture, rural development,
.panchayat raj and public distribution system.

coordination and more effective referral mechanisms. The number of alternative services
providers, particularly those in the private sector, is rapidly expanding, which provides
opportunities for forging partnerships and enhancing service quality in response to higher
public expectations. The gradual devolution of government services to elected Panchayat
bodies represents a clear opportunity for the Department to enable them to be more
responsive to the needs of local communities.
Preliminary data indicates that government health facilities appear to be poorly utilized,
leading to inefficiency. The Government's health effort is spread too thinly and some
consolidation will be necessary. There is a bifurcation of public health and clinical
services at the district level.  Greater decentralization of decisionmaking, within a
framework of improved systems for monitoring performance, will also be essential for
the Department. In advancing the strategic agenda, both leadership and its development
will be of critical importance.
In the area of human resource management, accountability mechanisms have to be
strengthened.  This will entail revising systems for monitoring organizational and
personnel performance and strengthening the link between these systems and promotions
and transfers. There are few rewards for good performance, and departmental managers,
especially at district and divisional levels, need to give more attention to managing
performance. Serious staff and skill mismatches also occur at the facility level, and
certain key skills such as nursing and financial management, are in acute demand in rural
areas. Significant redeployment Will be necessary. There is a need for more flexibility in
the current staffing arrangements, and procedures for training and human resource
development are in need of systematic overhaul. Absenteeism is a significant problem,
particularly in the east and in rural areas.
In the area of public expenditure management, present methods for budgeting and
expenditure control are targeted at controlling inputs and do not provide adequate
managerial flexibility or discretion over spending within an overall budgetary ceiling.
Measures need to be adopted to enhance the strategic allocation of resources within a
multiyear framework and to control the expansion of the wage bill, which in 1997/98
totaled 79% of all expenditures for the department; as a result, non-wage expenditures,
such as those for medicines and fuel for emergency vehicles, have fallen to levels that
severely compromise the quality of services.
Finally, the department is taking some steps to improve customer responsiveness that
should be encouraged and expanded. The Department does not routinely measure patient
satisfaction, but it recently conducted a baseline survey in this area and is in the process
of incorporating the survey results into its monitoring indicators. Citizen's Charters have
been drafted and need to be disseminated widely.
Public Works Department
The Public Works Department (PWD) is one of the largest employers within the state
government. As of 1 April 1999, both the Department and Secretary Branch had an
established strength of 43,166, or roughly 5.4% of all state position establishments. In
addition, the department also employs approximately 13,805 staff in a daily wage

category, and 19,569 staff as work-charged employees.2   Currently over 76,500
individuals draw their salary from PWD.
A detailed institutional review of PWD will be initiated during the first quarter of the
year 2000, and specific reform initiatives will come out of this exercise. Preliminary
assessments indicate that the department currently suffers from a number of managerial
and institutional problems, many of which are common throughout the public sector in
Uttar Pradesh. At the strategic level, the organization is currently performing many tasks
that could be privatized, corporatized, or devolved to local governments. Solutions have
to be found for the maintenance and upkeep of rural feeder roads. Consistent with the
general GoUP civil service move to "steering, not rowing," greater attention needs to be
devoted to outsourcing and downsizing, with increased emphasis upon strategic planning,
performance evaluation and monitoring, and contract management. Resolving issues of
interministerial coordination are also important, for responsibility for roads is fragmented
between a number of departments. Also, along the lines of the 5th Pay Commission,
decisionmaking procedures need to be decentralized to improve responsiveness and
reduce unnecessary delays. Functional reorganization and realignment is also likely to be
necessary in the wake of the institutional reviews.
PWD is considerably overstaffed to perform this new function, and rightsizing efforts
will have to be taken. There is a critical need to update the department's current skill
mix, which is strong in technical fields such as engineering but weak in non-engineering
areas such as project management, traffic management, social and environmental
planning, transport economists and financial management. As is common in many
departments, productivity can be enhanced by reducing the logistical and administrative
tail and curtailing the number of "unofficial" supervisors. Accountability mechanisms
need to be strengthened, and promotion, transfers and sanctions need to be much more
strongly linked to performance evaluation.
In the area of financial management, accurate cost data needs to be developed that fully
accounts for the salary expenses of casual and work-charged employees.  Priority
expenditures on capital works and non-wage maintenance needs to be protected and
expanded. More stringent project selection criteria needs to be utilized, along with
greater emphasis upon completing ongoing projects before making new commitments
and greater emphasis on the maintenance of existing assets.  Improved revenue
mobilization through revision of road user charges is also important.
Major sector specific issues will include: (1) resolving issues of improved strategic
management and interdepartmental coordination; (2) changing the skill mix to reflect a
broader interdisciplinary approach to transportation; and (3) developing and
implementing performance indicators germane to the transport sector.
2 Work charged employees are staff who are employed on a regular basis but whose salaries are charged to
the maintenance budget and do not show up in the departmental wage bills. Since 1992, there has been a
freeze on hiring such staff, although significant numbers remain in the PWD and Irrigation departments.

Trade & Tax Department
The Trade Tax Department administers the sales tax in UP. It employs approximately
12,000 staff, of which 2,000 are officers engaged in registration, assessment enforcement
and appellate work. The department is a highly fragmented geographically and currently
maintains 264 sector offices that deal with assessments and 65 appellate offices. The
average number of tax officers or class 1 and 2 staff is approximately 2.5 per office.
The Assessing Officer typically has diversified roles or tasks, covering taxpayer
registration, returns processing, tax payments and assessment. Little attention is given to
taxpayer education and publicity. There is a strong case for moving the Department from
its current focus on processes and norms and towards result orientation management.
The tax declaration and assessment procedures have yet to be computerized. At present,
assessments are made by the revenue authorities on the basis of taxpayer declarations and
desk audits. Self assessment is limited to dealers with only a small turnover The state
has recently procured customized software to automate the assessment, tax filing, stop
filing detection, and collection processes, as well as and to combat evasion through better
utilization of information from importers and inter dealer sales. However, there is a
major risk that the computerization process will not be implemented effectively due to
inadequate staff training and/or management commitment.
The GoUP's reform strategy has two key objectives. First, it seeks to build a revenue
system  that promotes sustainable revenue performance on the basis of voluntary
compliance, reducing evasion and opportunities for corruption through lower compliance
costs and fewer inefficiencies. Second, it seeks to develop simple and transparent tax
administration that fosters efficient, equitable and honest tax collection.
These objectives will entail the computerization of basic business processes, including
registration, collection, declaration processing, assessment, and audit of returns. They
will also entail the adoption of a functional organization to increase productivity through
specialization and to minimize the opportunities for collusion with tax evaders. The
GoUP is currently planning to utilize technical assistance to modernize the structure of
the department. In preparation, it has agreed to simplify and rationalize the tax rate
structure and the commodity classification system to reduce the costs of administration,
improve taxpayer compliance and reduce the incidence of litigation and taxpayer
disputes. Furthermore, it will need to implement self-assessment techniques with
effective audit procedures, construct an effective  management information system,
simplify appellate and tax tribunal procedures, develop a system of performance
indicators to monitor improvements in tax administration and identify program slippage,
and enhance taxpayer education and better taxpayer services to improve voluntary
compliance.
Paralleling the implementation of computerization, organizational change and self
assessment, the Trade Tax Department needs to ensure that entry level staff have the
appropriate skills and senior management are able to implement change management.
The next phases of reform will entail simplification of business practices and human

resource policies of the trade tax administration and preparing for t'he adoption of a Value
Added Tax (VAT) system with the active support of the Government of India.
The technical assistance for organizational change and human resource development will
identify those changes to the Department's structure necessary to achieve greater
efficiency in tax collection through reduction in evasion, better taxpayer services, more
timely completion of assessments, audits and other procedural activities, and greater
administrative accountability. Part of modemization process will involve a review of
administrative rules established for GoUP civil servants, current staff skills and human
resource constraints, the current and future plans for computerization, and the potential
for and likely impact of establishing a large taxpayer unit.
The Tax Training Center is currently not being utilized to best advantage. The training
requirements for both newly recruited and existing staff will need to be reviewed to
prepare staff for new procedures and approaches in achieving higher levels of taxpayer
voluntary compliance and in preparing for VAT. In the area of training, there is a need to
teach tax officer to use computer systems in their day to day work. On the technical side,
it may be useful to include economics, public finance and tax policy analysis in the
curriculum to give officers a more well-rounded view of tax administration. Training in
modem techniques of auditing and in investigation of tax fraud also needs to be
strengthened. Other aspects of personnel management will need to be reviewed. They
include development of career paths for officers at all levels; development of policies and
procedures for staff rotation; and enhancement of information systems relating to human
resource development.
The authorities will wish to evaluate, with the support of technical assistance, the
proposal to establish a large taxpayer's unit(s) to process the returns of the largest
taxpayers by tumover. Staff in such a unit would be trained in all needed skills, in
particular in taxpayer auditing. It is expected that this unit would be replicated in the
major cities, and serve as training ground for staff throughout the tax administration. The
consultant would advise on the training of the carefully selected initial staff.

UTTAR PRADESH PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM AND
PRIVATIZATION
POLICY-2000
1.        The Bureau of State Enterprises was set up in 1974. The primary role assigned to the
Bureau, at the time of creation was to act as a link between various State Level Public Enterprises
(SLPEs) established under the control of different Administrative Departments. (This included
introduction of Management & Administrative Departments to modem management practices and
systems, providing assistance in implementation of these strategies and giving advice on various
managerial and technical subjects.) Another major role, which had been assigned, was to reduce
disparities between salaries, wages, allowances and perquisites of different SLPEs, and at the
same time ensuring parity in pay structures for posts involving similar nature of work. The above
objectives have been achieved by the Bureau to a considerable extent, in the last 25 years of its
existence.
2      The role, nature of work and organization of Bureau has undergone a sea change over
this period. At present the Bureau of Public Enterprises is established as a Directorate under the
administrative control of the Department of Public Enterprises and is primarily functioning as a
consultancy entity.
3     To achieve the assigned  objectives and in consonance with the changing economic
environment, several actions have beerl initiated by the Department in the last decade.
State Level Scenario
4.      U.P. is an agriculture intensive state and this sector contributes about 45% to the Gross
Domestic Product of the State and 70% of the able  work force is engaged in this sector. The
industrial sector has contributed only 20% to the States' Gross Domestic Product and only 8% of
the able work force is employed in this sector. The pace of Industrialization has been a mere
2% to 6% in the last few years.
5.        As per the last census the population of the State was around 13.93 cores or 14 crore
approximately. Out of this 21%, 0.2% & 17.3% belonged to SCs, STs and minorities
respectively. The rate of growth of population during the 81-91 period was 25.48%. The literacy
rate was only 42% and the population below the poverty line was around 40%, 29.7% of the
population was that of skilled workers of which only 7.75% were industrial workers.
6.        In the context of the increasing population, it is imperative that there is an increase in
agricultural production, rate of industrialization improvement and an overall development of
various sectors and categories takes place. There will be a continuous increase in requirements of
energy, residential accommodation, roads, related infrastructural facilities, financial institutions
and intervention assistance agencies. Thus the role of the State, & consequently that of the State
Public Sector will also be affected.
Public Sector Scenario
7.        Government has  taken several steps    to bring about improvement in the
performance of SLPEs to equip them to face the challenges of the changed economic

environment and globalization and to gradually shed those products and activities which have
proved to be unproductive and unviable. In this context, the then Chief Secretary reviewed the
performance of  each enterprise  in 1990 and suggestions for  improvement were made.
Consequently, Auto Tractors Ltd. was given in the Joint Sector and activities of the 10 Area
Development Corpns. of the plains, UPAI, HORTICO & Brassware Corpn. were closed.
Thereafter, in 1991-92, Sub-Commnittees of the Cabinet reviewed the performance of each
enterprise. Consequent to the decision of the Govt. of India to bring the Pubic Sector within the
ambit of SICA and BIFR, a detailed status of SLPEs was put up before the Cabinet, following
which G.O. No. 863/44-2-1994 dated 1st June, 94 was issued. In 1996, once again a detailed
status of every enterprise was put up before the Empowered Committee set up by the Govt.
Thereafter, in 1997, the then Chief Secretary set up a Task Force and in 1998 and 1999 a
Committee under the chairmanship   of Chief Secretary looked into the  restructuring
requirements of SLPEs and gave its recommendations.
8.        Initially, Public Enterprises were established for taking over the old and sick units
of the private sector, with a view to protect the workers' interest and to revive these units e.g.
sugar mills, CDF etc. Some Puss were created to fulfill the conditionalities of Government of
India and extemal agencies.
9.        The public sector of the state is mainly in the following sectors
*  Development of infrastructure & utilities such as Power, Transport, Sewage &
distribution of essential commodities.
*  Social Sector-e.g. development of Scheduled Castes & Tribes, Backward Classes,
Minorities, Women etc.
  A few Corporations were established in the manufacturing sector e.g. Sugar, Cement
& Textiles etc.
10.       The changing economic scenario, the liberalization process and the onset of
economic reforms has had a great impact on the Public Sector in general and the State Level
Public Enterprises(SLPEs) in particular.
11.       Consequently, where the 70's and 80's saw an increase in the number of SLPEs in
U.P., the 90's have seen a steady decline. At present there are 50 SLPEs(including UPSEB). Out
of these, at least three- U.P. Mineral Development Corporation U.P. Cement Corpn. and U.P.
Vidyut Utpadan Nigam are non-operational. The activities of Pashudhan Udyog Nigam have been
closed and U.P.Tarai Anusuchit Janjati Nigam exists only as a legal entity, as all activities and
manpower have   been transferred to another Corporation. Steps to    initiate reforms in the
Energy sector have already been undertaken.
12.       The State Govt. has invested more than Rs. 14191 crores in terms of equity and term
loans. Another Rs. 2907.69 crores has been given to these companies as grants & subsidies.
13.       These companies have a cumulative deficit  of Rs. 3257.69 crores. The major
contributor to their resources has been the State Government. The high debt-equity ratio is
because funds to UPSEB, JAL NIGAM and U.P.AWAS VIKAS PARISHAD etc. have been
made available in the form of term loans instead of equity. These 50 enterprises have incurred a
net loss of Rs. 344.20 Crores during 1997-98. Out of these, 27 companies earned profit of Rs.
159.44 Crores while 23 companies incurred a loss of Rs. 503.64 Crores in 1997-98. There are
2,41,483 employees employed in these 50 Companies. The average annual salary paid to an



Annex E

March 13, 2000
Page 4 of 18
employee in 1997-98 was Rs. 0.70 Lakhs.
14.       All the fifty enterprises have been categorized according to their nature of activities
in to nine sectors as follows:-
(a) Production Enterprises
(b) Area / Sectoral Enterprises
(c) Promotional and Financial Enterprises
(d) Uttaranchal Development Enterprises
(e) Service Enterprises
(f) Financial Enterprises
(g) Energy Enterprises
(h) Trading Enterprises
(i) Construction Enterprises
INTEGRATED OVER VIEW
15.       The sector-wise analysis indicates that more than 70% of the total investment is in
the energy sector and the rest 30% of the investment in the remaining 47 corporations.
The size of these corporations in terms.of investment and turnover is as follows:-
Rs. In crores             On the basis of total         On the basis of Total
investment                     turnover
(No of corpn.)               (No of corpn.)
>700                           04                            01
100-700                         08                            11
20-100                          10                            13
5-20                          08                             05
<5                            20                            20
16.       It is clear from the above  that there are a total no. of 20  corporations having
investment of Rs. 5 crores or less. Similarly there are 20 corporations having turnover less than
Rs. 5 crores. There are only 12 corporations which have an investment and turnover of more
than Rs. 100 crores.
17.       Thus a majority of the 50 operational corporations are very small in size, both in
terms of investment and turnover and are not capable of functioning viably and withstanding the
present competitive environment.
18.       Sector wise details show  that many corporations /Govt. Agencies under different
administrative departments are executing similar activities. On the other hand, works to be
assigned by the Govt. are also decreasing because of the paucity of funds.
19.       Thus the public enterprise sector is not only facing competition from the private
sector but there is unwanted competition from Govt. agencies also.

20.       The major elements of the PE REFORM POLICY are as follows -
*  Those activities, which are commercial in nature and in which there is private sector
presence, will be privatized through divestments and closures.
  Those PEs which are involved in activities which are not commercial in nature will
be restructured so that they cease to be dependent on Govt. budgetary support. This
will be ensured through mergers and re-organization.
.  Duplicity of activities between PEs, Govt. departments, Co-operatives and other
Govt. agencies will be minimized.
*  The small size of PEs renders them incapable of facing the onslaught of competition
following globalization and liberalization of the economy. Hence restructuring,
divestment, privatization and closure of activities will be undertaken in such a way
so as to create viable entities and eliminate unviable ones.
In the Utilities Sector, services will be provided to an expanded number of
consumers at reasonable rates and quality. To meet the requirements for greater
investment as well as quality and efficiency, steps will be taken to secure the
participation of the private sector and efforts will be made to create an independent
regulatory authority.
*  There will be a total ban on creation of new enterprises, other than the corporatization
of existing public agencies with a view of eventual privatization.
21.       A Divestment Commission has been constituted to recommend the plan of action to
facilitate restructuring, re-organization, privatization and closure of PEs. This Commission will
be manned by one part-time Chairman and two part-time Members having experience in the
fields of Economics/Public Sector management/Banking/Management /Law etc. The Special
Secretary to the Department of Public Enterprises will be the ex-offico Secretary to the
Divestment Commission. A Technical Secretariat will assist the Divestment Commission. A
Central Committee headed by the Chief Secretary will forward the names of the Enterprises for
the consideration of the Divestment Commission. On receipt of the recommendations of the
Divestment Commission, this Central Committee will re-evaluate and forward them to the
Administrative Department to seek Cabinet approval. The Administrative Department will seek
the approval of the Cabinet and will transfer all the documents together with orders of the
Cabinet to the Working Committee. The Working Committee will ensure implementation of the
orders of the Cabinet and report to the Govt. The list of enterprises closed, expected to be closed
or divested in the first phase i.e. upto March 2001 is enclosed at Annexure-1 . The future
divestment and closure of enterprises will be executed in accordance with detailed procedures to
be prepared by the Divestment Commission following the guidelines enclosed as Annexure-2,
and approved by Cabinet.
22.       The Divestment Commission will also suggest ways to minimize the impact of
Restructuring, Divestment, Privatization and Closure on the employees of the affected
enterprises, including voluntary retirement scheme and training/counseling support. The present
scheme of  voluntary retirement as well as the guidelines for its application are attached at
Annexure-3.

23.       A Transaction Manual for Environmental Liability Assessmnent and remediation will
also be prepared to enable assessment of past environmental damage and remediation costs for
the divestment and closure processes to be environmentally sound. Terms of reference for the
preparation of this manual are attached as Annexure 4.
24.       The policy for PEs issued by the Department of Public Enterprises will have an
overriding effect, irrespective of the Administrative Department's policy. It will be mandatory for
Administrative Departments to seek the opinion of the Department of Public Enterprises before
issuing any policy for their PEs in future.

Annex E
Final Copy

Page 11 of 18
14.  The different elements related to the implementation of the financial restructuring and the
VRS strategy will be the responsibility of the Board of the relevant PE and its administrative
department as applicable. VRS will be coordinated and monitored by the department of public
enterprises.
15.  The implementation of the marketing plan as well as the tendering process for the selection
of buyers will be the responsibility of the Working Committee and PICUP; they will conduct
these processes on behalf of the relevant PE and its administrative department.
16. Bids will be received and evaluated by PICUP; the Working Committee will prepare and
submit a reconmmendation for award to the relevant PE and its administrative department for
Cabinet approval.
17.  Following Cabinet approval, the relevant administrative department will execute the
transaction.
Guidelines for the selection of buyers:
18.  Selection of buyers will be based on competitive and transparent procedures. Either
tendering or auctions will be used as appropriate.
19.  Tendering and auctions will be properly publicized. For this purpose, a notice will be
published for three non-consecutive days in at least one local publication and one national
publication.
20.  The publication will clearly identify the enterprise or unit or assets to be sold or auctioned,
including a brief description of the enterprise or unit. The time, date and venue for the auction or
for the subrnission of bids will be clearly specified. In the case of auctions, the notice will
clearly identify the place and address as well as the times during which additional information
about the relevant enterprise, unit or assets may be obtained. In the case of tenders, the notice
will clearly identify the place, address and times for obtaining the tender documents.
21.  Additional information for auctions and the tender documents for tenders, will clearly
define the terms and conditions for the sale, including: (i) qualification or pre-qualification of
buyers if any; (ii) procedures for access to additional information about the assets, units or
enterprise offered for sale; (iii) procedures for site visits; (iv) procedures for clarification and for
amendment of the tender documents; (v) contents of the bid or proposal, including
documentation and qualifications if any; (vi) contracts and other documents that will be part of
the sale; (vii) criteria for evaluation of the bids or proposals and award; and (viii) forrn of
payment.
22.  The procedures for access to additional information about the sale, as well as for site visits
will be fair to all potential buyers. To facilitate the process of due diligence by potential buyers,
all information relevant to the transaction is usually kept in a data room. Two methods are used
for ensuring that all potential buyers have equal opportunity to access the information and for
visiting the sites in question. For simpler transactions, formal procedures for requesting access
to the data room and for site visits are processed on a first come first access basis, usually in



Annex E
Final Copy
March 13,2000
Page 12 of 18
conjunction with limits on the duration of the stay in the data room and the site visit. For more
complex transactions that include a pre-qualification stage, only pre-qualified buyers are granted
access to the data room and the sites. The procedure outlined above can also be utilized in this
case; alternatively, each pre-qualified bidder is allocated a certain period of time during which
only he will be able to visit the sites and the data room.
23. Notices to clarify and/or amend the tender documents will be sent by to all potential buyers
at the same time. Clarifications will either be sent in response to questions submitted by
potential buyers, or at the initiative of the Working Committee. In the first case, the clarification
notice will include the question asked by the potential buyer, but it will not identify the potential
buyer that asked the question.
24.  It is desirable that all terms and conditions for the sale are finalized prior to the receipt of
bids or offers. For simple transactions, it is recommended that award go to the highest bidder.
For more complex transactions, it is recommended that a single criterion that is objective and
quantifiable be used for evaluation and award, preferably price. In order to achieve this, all other
considerations that are important to GoUP should be defined in the terms and conditions of the
sale through contractual undertakings by the potential buyers.
25.  Some complex transactions may require one or more of the following: (i) active marketing
and promotion among potential buyers; (ii) pre-qualification of potential buyers; and (iii)
consultation with potential buyers for fiializing the terms and conditions of the sale.
26.  Active marketing for the more complex transactions, may involve the following activities
in addition to the publication of the notice of sale of the assets, units or enterprise: (i) notice
requesting formal expressions of interest from potential buyers; (ii) sending of promotional
material in the form of an information memorandum to firms that expressed interest and to firms
identified as desired potential buyers; and (iii) road show to visit interested candidates that have
received the information memorandum.
27.  Pre-qualification of potential buyers will be publicized as defined in paragraph 14 above.
Terms and conditions for pre-qualification will be made available to interested parties. The pre-
qualification terms of reference will include: (i) contents of the pre-qualification submissions,
including required documentation; (ii) criteria for evaluation of pre-qualification submissions;
(iii) date by which submissions will be evaluated and a final list of pre-qualified bidders will be
announced; and (iv) clear indication that only pre-qualified bidders will be allowed to continue
and submit a bid. It is desirable to have objective and quantifiable criteria for pre-qualification
that are evaluated on a pass/fail basis.
28.  If business plans are requested as part of the submissions for pre-qualification or bids and
proposals, they should be indicative and they should be evaluated for their suitability as
acceptable or unacceptable.
29.  More complex transactions may require consultation with potential buyers before
finalizing all the terms and conditions for the sale, in particular if GoUP will impose certain
conditions to buyers. Typically these cases will also involve a pre-qualification stage. If this is
the case, it is recormmended that consultation take place once potential buyers have been pre-
qualified. In all cases that involve a consultation process with potential buyers, it is important

that the tender documents clearly identify the procedures and deadlines to be used in the process.
The consultation process may involve the following steps: (i) one or more rounds of written
comments by potential buyers; and (ii) one on one meetings with individual potential buyers.
30. In consultation processes, draft terms and conditions of the sale usually in the form of
contracts and other undertakings are sent to all potential buyers at the same time. Formal,
written comments must be received from potential buyers by a certain date as defined in the
tender documents. The external advisors to the technical secretariat should analyze comments
only after the deadline for receipt of comments. A recommendation to modify the terms and
conditions should then be submitted to the seller for approval and issue of the final terms and
conditions.
31.  It is often desirable in consultation processes in order to maximize the potential for
successfully completing the transaction in question, to better understand the implications of the
comments received from the potential buyers, in particular those requests for modifications that
may be "deal-breakers" from the perspective of potential buyers. In these cases a formal,
structured process of meetings with individual potential buyers is often used after formal written
comments have been received. These meetings have the sole objective of understanding the
implications of the comments and requests for modification received and should not be construed
as negotiations.

GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR
VOLUNTARY RETIREMItENT SCHEME
The Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) was established in 1993 (GO No. 288/P.R.C./44-1/93-85/90)
for the employees of public sector enterprises with a view to reducing surplus manpower. The key
provisions of the scheme are as follows:
1. An employee who has completed ten years of service or 40 years of age may seek voluntary
retirement by a written request. The scheme is applicable to all officers/employees except Chief
Executives and Executive Directors.
2. Terminal benefits include: balance in the provident fund, cash equivalent of earned leave, payment of
gratuity, and termination notice of one/three months depending on the conditions of service
applicable to the employee.
3. In addition, ex-gratia payments are provided of 45 days of pay (pay and DA) per year of service, or
the monthly pay at the time of superannuation multiplied by the balance months of service left before
the normal date of retirement, whichever is less.
4. Travel allowance for the resettlement of the employee and his/her family is provided.
5. The management of the enterprise has the right not to grant VRS for reasons to be recorded in
writing.
6. Posts that are vacated will not be filled.
7. Where an enterprise is not able to bear the cost of providing VRS, the administrative department will
take a decision on implementing the scheme only after getting getting a clear perspective of the
availability of funds from the Government.
8. Government reserves the right to enhance the VRS scheme for any particular enterprise based on the
specific circumstances of the enterprise. Prior approval of the Department of Public Enterprises is
required if any exceptions are to be made.
9. Prior approval of the administrative department is required to implement the scheme.
To provide further guidance and clarification to the concerned PEs, ensure consistency in the application
of VRS, and prevent the rehiring or redeployment of employees who have taken VRS in the same
enterprise or in other parts of the public sector, additional guidelines and procedures are established.
These are as follows:
1. Temporary or casual employees and employees on a contract basis are not eligible for VRS. These
categories are dealt with under the legal provisions of the appropriate enactments under
administrative procedures of the organization.
2. Employees who take VRS cannot be reemployed in the same PE, its subsidiaries and units, other PEs,
or government departments.
3. The concerned organization prescribes a time limit for employees in exercising the VRS offer.



Annex E
Final Copy
March 13,2000
Page 15 of 18
4. Once the VRS application has been accepted by the organization and communicated to the employees
in writing, employees cannot withdraw the application.
5. Employees who are offered VRS but who do not accept the offer within the given time frame are
retrenched with payment of terminal benefits.
6. All outstanding amounts and dues payable by the employee to the organization (such as outstanding
advances and loans) are adjusted and only the net benefit amount after the adjustments is paid.
7. All amounts payable under the scheme are generally settled within 30 days from the day of
acceptance of the request for VRS.
8. Each organization prepares its VRS program and sends it to the administrative department for
approval as part of the overall strategy for divestment or closure as applicable.
9. After approval of the administrative department, the proposal is considered by the Cabinet as part of
the overall strategy for divestment or closure. Following Cabinet approval, the scheme is
communicated to the concemed organization by the administrative department.
10. Changes to the benefits are made on an exceptional basis and require full justification and prior
consultation with the administrative department and the approval of the Department of Public
Enterprises.
11. The concerned organization should first assess their own resources and decide the extent to which
they can be utilized to finance the VRS. The balance amount can be sought by the Government.
12. Government funds for VRS are maintained in the Finance Department and released to the enterprise
through the administrative department as a loan to be repaid from the proceeds realized through the
sale of assets or shares.
13. The Department of Public Enterprises is responsible for the overall coordination and monitoring of
the VRS program. The items to be monitored include: (i) number of employees who have taken
VRS; (ii) VRS payments, including statutory and ex-gratia; (iii) source of funds used (government or
enterprise); (iv) number of employees and VRS financing requirements for enterprises in the pipeline;
(iv) changes in employment and output levels in the enterprise during the program period.

Draft terms of reference for: "Environmental Liability Assessment of Divestment and
Closure of Public Enterprises in UP"
1. Background
The Govemment of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) has expressed its intention to embark on a
comprehensive reform of its Public Enterprises (PEs) that includes the divestment and closure of
several enterprises. For this purpose GoUP will issue a policy that includes the institutional
framework for implementation. This includes establishment of a Divestment Commission and
appointment of Pradeshiya Industrial Corporation of UP (PICUP) to provide technical support on
impJementation.
GoUP has identified 6 PEs listed in Annex 1 for divestment and closure in the first phase
of reform. The major issues relating to the proposed divestment or closure of PEs are: (i)
potential environmental liabilities associated with past pollution; and (ii) environmental
compliance by each PE.
In order to address the above environmental issues, GoUP is inviting consultancy offers to
assist PICUP in developing a "Transaction guidelines on environmental matters", in coherence
with its overall PE reform policy. Once finalized, these guidelines will become part of the
overall implementation procedures.
2. Obiective
To help PICUP in establishing procedures and policy guidelines in the form of a
Transaction Manual on Environmental Matters to ensure that the divestment and closure process
is environmentally sound.
3. Scope of Services
1.   Review the relevant central and state policies on divestment and closure; national and state
level environmental regulations and the guidelines prescribed in the Pollution Prevention and
Abatement Handbook (World Bank, 1998). Review the existing project appraisal and
transaction process at PICUP. This review will form the basis for defining the guidelines
principles for integrating environmental matters in the divestment and closure process.
2.  In addition, the consultant will prepare detailed process steps for carrying out
environmental liability assessments of PEs slated for divestment or closure. The process steps
may have to be separately worked out for the case of divestment and closure. In case of
divestment, these steps may have to be further customized depending on the particular
divestment model.
3.   Prepare draft "Transaction guidelines on environmental matters" for carrying out
environmental liability assessments of the proposed PEs; the key areas of these guidelines would
include:

GOVERNMENT OF UTTAR PRADESH'S STRATEGY FOR STRENGTHENING
THE SYSTEMS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to providing honest, effective,
efficient, responsive and accountable administration with strong institutions
dedicated to better accountability at various levels. With a view to achieving the
above objective. Government of Uttar Pradesh proposes to initiate and implement
institutional capacity building using participatory approaches for designing and
formulating action oriented plans for more effective Legislative scrutiny, Financial
Management and control Architecture and for Audit and Evaluation functions.
Specific steps that will be required to be taken are listed as under
I.   Facilitating More Effective Legislative Scrutiny
a)  A National level Conference on "Parliamentary Control of the Public Purse"
will be organized in consultation and with the approval of Speaker of the
Legislative Assembly so as to allow interaction among public representatives,
civil servants, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Media, Civil
Society and persons with international exposure. The purpose of this
Conference will be to formulate a national consensus and follow up measures
on wal's to strengthen legislative scrutiny. This Conference will be organized
by 30 June, 2000.
II.   More robust Financial Manarement and Control Architecture
a) Appoint a "Controller " who would provide leadership in modernizing the system of
Financial Management including intemal controls, accounting, and management
information systems across the State. It is envisaged that technical assistance will be
required for defining the role,  organizational structure, and preparing detailed
implementation plans for modernizing the Financial Management Systems. In due
course, it can be expected that, the GoUP will take over the compilation of accounts
and related work currently carried out by the Accountant General (Accounts and
Entitlements ) in consultation with Government of India and Comptroller and Auditor
General of India. The appointment of the Controller will take place in the current
fiscal year.
b) Enhance the State's treasury function by converting the treasury offices into
Integrated Pay and Accounts Offices (IPAO) who would also be responsible for
preparation of salary bills; and remitting cheques directly to the bank account of the
employees. This is expected to be completed in the fiscal year 2000/2001. As a
medium term measure, separate district level Pay and Accounts Offices for major
departments can be expected to be established as part of the IPAO.
c) The GOUP has taken a decision that all the departments shall be required to publish
an Annual Report outlining their objectives, activities, costs and actual achievements.
These reports are expected to be user friendly, timely and aimed at making available
information to all stakeholders on the performance of individual government
departments. This will be implemented from the current fiscal year.
cpnlfinanaccount3l03/1 6/00



Annex F
Final Copy
March 16,2000
Page 3 of 3
d) The GoUP has constituted a task force to recommend the form and content of
periodic financial statements to be published. This task force will finalize its
recomnmendations in the current fiscal year. The Task Force will also monitor the
progress made by the GoUP on implementing the actions listed in the strategy paper
and provide written reports to the Core Group on Governance Reforms and the Bank
on a quarterly basis.
e) Conduct a feasibility study for introducing a more results based management to assist
all departmental secretaries in achieving the intended results, manage risks and
develop sound performance measurement and reporting systems.
f) Conduct a feasibility study for introducing an appropriate form of accrual accounting
for management purposes and budgeting in the next fiscal year.
g) Initiate steps required to modernize the existing State Finance and Accounts cadre.
This will involve review and implementation of new service rules including entry
criterion and training in modem financial management.
h) Abolish the practice of year-end transfers of unspent budgetary allocations into the
Personal Ledger Account (PLA) to avoid lapse of allocation of a department.
III.  More Effective Audit and Evaluation functions
The mechanism for independent auditing of the State's accounts is defined in the
Constitution of India and is carried out by the CAG . The State Govt. also has two audit
directorates ( to cover cooperatives, local bodies and certain local funds ) as well as an
"internal audit unit" in certain line departments.
a) Appoint "State Internal Auditor" and initiate measures to strengthen and consolidate
the internal audit function across the State. The appointment of the "State Internal
Auditor" will take place in the current fiscal year.
b) Implement the rules for ensuring timely response from  heads of offices to the
observations included in the C &AG audit report. This step will be undertaken in the
current fiscal year.
c)  Initiate dialogue with the C & AG on ways by which the C & AG's audit can further
assist the GOUP's reform efforts.

Assessment of Poverty in Uttar Pradesh
Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India, as well as one of the poorest. Although the proportion
of poor households below the poverty line fell during the 1980s, progress has slowed to a virtual stop in
the years since. In 1993-94, 60.5 million persons in UP lived below the official poverty line, accounting
for 19 percent of the total poor in India.' Not only is income poverty high, but human development
indicators - literacy, school enrollment rates (particularly for girls), access to safe drinking water, life
expectancy, and infant mortality - place UP among the worst-off states in India.

Profile and Diagnostic of Poverty. A baseline study was undertaken to identify the key social and
economic factors responsible for high and sustained rates of poverty in Uttar Pradesh. The study draws
on a wide range of information - including (1) information obtained through official data sources (e.g. the
National Sample Surveys, administrative statistics from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics), (2) a
very recent survey of living conditions in poorer regions of the state that measured poverty across a range
of dimensions, and integrated conventional household and community survey methods with participatory
community-based approaches, and (3) a careful review of the existing literature in UP and India more
widely.
The work has given rise to a number of findings that have important ramifications for policy and program
design. Key findings are outlined briefly below.
First, the poor in UP comprise a heterogeneous group that can be broadly classifted into three
categories: the destitute, the structural poor, and the mobile poor. Each group faces different sets of
constraints and different options for economic and social mobility. Their needs are accordingly
different.
The poorest, best described as the destitute poor, are generally those that have experienced some
type of idiosyncratic shock that has permanently undermined their physical or hurnan resource
base. These shocks include events such as death or disability of a breadwinner, long-term and
costly illness of family members, desertion, alcoholism, mental illness, etc. Abandoned and
widowed women, particularly those with small children were prominently represented in this
category. Even dowry expenses can be a form of economic shock, in that households burdened by
dowry expenses for several daughters are said to be in danger of becoming seriously
impoverished. The destitute poor usually have no income source other than low-wage,
intermittently available casual labor or, in the worst case, foraging and begging. Their outlook
for the future is bleak.
A second group of poor households comprise the structural poor. These households tend to be
drawn from scheduled caste or tribal groups, suffer social discrimination and often live in isolated
hamlets far from public resources such as clean wells, irrigation sources, etc. As a general rule,
there is less mobility (either upward or downward) among this group than among other types of
poor households. They have inherited a stigmatized social identity that places them at a
disadvantage in interactions with higher castes, that is life-long, and that will be inherited in turn



Annex I
February 18,2000

by their own children. However, there are encouraging signs that social identity is becoming less
of a factor in determining upward mobility for the urban poor. However the structural poor in
rural areas, like the destitute poor, are usually landless, dependent on casual labor, and tend to
acquire long-term debts which they are unable to discharge. Many look outside the traditional
village economy for opportunities for social and economic advancement.
The third group can be referred to as the mobile poor in that they demonstrate the strongest
potential for moving out of poverty. They are free from chronic debt, and often own some small
assets, usually land or livestock, that can be nurtured and developed into a productive resource. In
contrast to other types of poor households, the mobile poor view education as a very critical
factor in moving out of poverty - particularly those living in urban areas. Households which are
able to produce enough food, either through agriculture or employment, to feed all family
members throughout the twelve month of the year are perceived by the poor themselves to be the
only ones with real potential for upward mobility. These families, unless derailed by a sudden
shock, can avoid the trap of falling into debt in order to meet shortfalls in basic consumption and
possibly escape poverty by dint of unstinted effort. Many of these households are members of
social groups that are slightly higher and less stigmatized than the structural poor.
These categories are important because the individuals within often face different sets of
opportunities and constraints than individuals across groups. For example, the structural poor
may be constrained within the village economy in terms of the employment opportunities
available to them, and constrained in access to social networks that help them seek employment
outside the village. Facing a narrower set of employment opportunities may in turn influence
schooling decisions; the structural poor may perceive lower returns to investments in education.
One of the most important defining characteristic of the poor in UP is low levels of incomes, combined
with low asset endowments. They lack land, they lack education, they lack skills, and they lack the
kinds of social networks that help them find betterjobs and raise incomes. Further, they lack the
means and incentives to send their children to school or to invest in productive assets, perpetuating a
vicious cycle of poverty.
The overwhelming majority of poor people in UP work in low-skill, low-paid jobs with no
permanent tenure. Many are dependent on agriculture labor and work on lands owned by others.
Women often engage in the lowest paid activities - casual labor in fields, gathering firewood and
dung to sell in nearby towns, piece-work and construction activities in urban areas. Child labor is
common among the poorest and among socially disadvantaged households. Many of the poor
aspire to jobs outside the agriculture sector and income diversification has an important role in
economic mobility. However, employment opportunities in the non-farm sector are limited, and
the fortunate few who find jobs typically work for very low wages in services or small-scale
industries, again with no permanent tenure. Low-skill jobs in the rural non-farm sector often pay
no more than causal labor in agriculture. Many of the rural poor, particularly those from socially-
disadvantaged groups, lack the contacts and social networks necessary to secure employment
outside the local economy. And infrastructure constrains mobility and discourages the private
investment that leads to creation of jobs. Some of the poor move to the cities to seek
employment, where, if they are fortunate, they may eke out a living as casual laborers or in petty
service activities. Few have the skills or education necessary to flourish in the urban labor
market.
Education has a critically important role in economic mobility. In many regions of Uttar Pradesh,
lack of opportunity combined with limited assets creates a vicious cycle of poverty and illiteracy.

The poorest are frequently unable to take advantage of the few opportunities that do exist because
they lack the knowledge, skills, and in many cases even basic literacy and nunmeracy. Education
becomes both a cause and consequence of poverty. Children of low-income families are less
likely to attend school than are their more affluent counterparts, since poor parents are less able to
purchase school supplies and because the labor of every household member is critical to the
survival of the family. In addition, low growth in the economy has depressed the job market in
recent years and many parents (especially those from socially-disadvantaged groups) question the
returns from investing in education. The situation is further exacerbated by limited access and
low quality of education, particularly in poorer and more backward regions. Current enrollment
figures indicate that not only are overall literacy levels lower in poorer regions of the state, but
current enrollments, particularly for girls and children from socially disadvantaged, are also
lower. This raises serious concerns about the persistence of poverty in the future.
Landlessness and poverty go hand in hand in India. Poverty levels fall sharply as average land
holdings increase. However, over half the rural poor own less than one-half hectare of land, and
much of what they own is of marginal quality. There is evidence that some poor households who
are slightly better off (e.g. the mobile poor) have gradually been acquiring land and are expanding
incomes through more intensive farming and livestock activities. And some are moving into
small-scale agro processing and sales of agriculture products. But for many of the poor,
acquiring more land is simply not an option; efforts by government to redistribute land have by
and large failed in Uttar Pradesh and few of the poor can hope to amass sufficient funds to
purchase land directly.
The poor in UP are realistic about the constraints and opportunities they face - including not only
economic constraints but social and political constraints as well. They realize the potential
importance of education in opening up economic opportunities, particularly in the non-farm
sector and in urban labor markets, and as well they realize the importance of land and other
productive assets. But they also see that investing in options with long term payoffs is risky and
uncertain and many are so severely constrained by the need to make ends meet each day that they
cannot afford to invest for future gains.
The poor in UP are highly vulnerable andface a range of serious risks and uncertainty. Low levels of
income, coupled with limited access to essential services and safety nets, make it particularly difficult
for the poor to weather unantcipated shocks. The destitute often became so due to idiosyncratic as
well as systemic shocks that have destroyed their earnings and asset base.
Very low levels of income, coupled with insecurity and inadequate access to formal and informal
safety nets, is the major cause of destitution in Uttar Pradesh. But even the non-destitute poor
suffer from a range of idiosyncratic shocks and remain highly vulnerable. For many of the poor,
the risks of downward mobility seem far more real than the likelihood of upward mobility and
escape from poverty. This is particularly true for the structural poor, with their limited access to
social networks of support and broader opportunities outside the local economy. While low
levels of income increase vulnerability, moderate increases in the incomes of the poor do not
always translate into reduced vulnerability. For example, recent studies have found that
unanticipated health "shocks" are a major cause of vulnerability, not only for the poor but for the
better-off as well. Children are particularly at risk, due in large part to poor sanitation, bad
drinking water, poor hygiene and health practices, and limited access to adequate health services.
Despite GOUP' s efforts to provide locally available primary health care for the rural poor, low
income households report high levels of expenditure on health care and treatment. Many public
facilities are understaffed and lack basic medicines and supplies. And government does not



Annex I
February 18,2000
Page 5 of 10
effectively regulate private sector providers who often supply services of dubious quality. In
short, in many regions adequate health care may not be available at any cost.
Concerns about violence, crime, and personal insecurity - particularly for women - are widely
acknowledged in Uttar Pradesh. Problems are particularly severe for the very poor and
individuals from socially-disadvantaged groups, who lack social status and political clout. Many
crimes go unreported, and there are numerous stories of abuse and mistreatment from police and
other local bodies. The poor are frequently victimized - by wealthy land owners, by government
officials, by thugs hired by the ruling elites. And they have little recourse to obtain justice -
grievance processes are slow and cumbersome in general, but particularly for the poor and
socially-disadvantaged. Justice is more often meted out on the street by local residents who
witness harassment or crimes than by the court system.
How do the poor protect themselves against vulnerability and risk? GOI supports a range of
formal safety net programs, including food subsidies, nutrition interventions, employment
assurance schemes, area development programs focused on basic infrastructure, and social
welfare programs. However, these programs do not operate effectively in many parts of Uttar
Pradesh. In fact, evidence suggests that formal safety nets and insurance mechanisms may be
least effective in regions where poverty is most pervasive and needs therefore greatest. When
illnesses or shocks occur, or even when dowry expenses of daughters must be met, poor
households frequently fall into chronic debt. High indebtedness is a factor that is linked to
vulnerability and to the inability of poor households to ultimately escape poverty. Low income
families have relatively few informal "social capital" relationships of mutual aid and support that
could provide emergency or longer-term relief in times of economic difficulty. They are,
therefore, the group most likely to rely upon money-lenders or members of upper-income
households for emergency assistance. This assistance often comes at high cost: members of
many indebted households are expected to labor in the fields or homes of creditor households for
wages well under market rates. In these cases, the ability of poor households to escape
indebtedness and its associated poverty is severely constrained. The real destitute often have
become so through idiosyncratic shocks: India's antipoverty programs and other formal safety
nets rarely deliver enough to ensure minimum subsistence needs are met.
NGOs have set up credit and savings schemes in some regions of the state that provide alternative
sources of funds for smoothing consumption and insuring against risk. Unfortunately coverage of
these schemes remains limited.
The poor have limited access to or influence over institutions of the state. Nor are they adequately
included in the political processes that ultimately deternine their lives.
There is widespread evidence that public spending in Uttar Pradesh is far more likely to benefit
the better off and politically powerful than the poor and socially disadvantaged. The poor take
this as a matter of course. Handpumps are located in wealthier neighborhoods; health clinics and
public hospitals are more responsive to the needs of their better off clients; access to schools and
the quality of education is far better in wealthier neighborhoods -- children from wealthier/less
socially advantaged household are more likely to be enrolled in schools, more likely to receive
special tutoring, and more likely to pass exams; development funds earmarked for antipoverty
and social welfare programs are frequently diverted to alternative uses - for example, grains
earmarked for the ICDS are siphoned off and sold in the private market, public employment
schemes are given to contractors who do not hire poor workers, over half of PDS food grains do
not even reach consumers, much less do they reach poor consumers.

Better governance - more responsive, accountable, and transparent public institutions - is an essential
component for sustained poverty reduction in UP. The poor suffer most from corruption and inept
institutions at the local level, where services are actually provided. Governance reforms that start at the
top will trickle down slowly to lower tiers of government. Parallel reforms at the local level are essential
to serve the needs of the poor - the poor need stronger voice and political influence in local political
processes, and local institutions must be made structurally more responsive and accountable to all
citizens, not just the powerful and political elites.
Govermuent's Strategy for Reducing Poverty. GOUP's strategy for the reduction of poverty is
comprised of several mutually complementary initiatives - promotion of economic growth, expansion of
economic opportunities, improvement of access to basic services, and implementation of a series of
centrally-sponsored poverty alleviation schemes (Uttar Pradesh Ninth Five Year Plan, 1997-2002).
The slow down in the state's overall rate of growth in the 1990s, a result of poor growth in the
agricultural sector, appears to be a key factor behind UP's poor progress against rural poverty in recent
years. Between 1992-96, UP's primary sector grew only at 1.5 percent per annum. Declining capital
expenditure in physical and social infrastructure both in new investments and in O&M, and low rates of
capital formation in agriculture, and low productivity of existing investments, which are clearly linked to
the fiscal crisis and to poor management and govemance, are among the main causes of stagnant growth
and the current poverty situation. The share of capital expenditure as a proportion of total state
expenditure and as a proportion of GSDP have been declining since the early 1980s. Given the
persistence of a vicious cycle of high fiscal stress, low capital expenditure and low growth in the state,
even the modest target of reducing poverty by 7.3% over the course of the State's Ninth Five Year Plan
may be difficult to achieve.
The slowdown in agricultural growth rate in the 1990s has had particularly strong implications for
poverty reduction because UP's poor still derive the bulk of their income from the agriculture sector.
However, per worker productivity and wages are higher in the non-agricultural sector and vigorous
growth in this sector is a precondition for more rapid and sustained poverty reduction. Unfortunately UP
has not been able to attract sizable industrial investment in recent years, and there is little evidence of
labor force diversification (as found in many of the faster growing Indian states). In fact, official sources
indicate a deceleration in growth of secondary sector employment while agricultural employment
increased at a faster rate.4 There also has been a shift in the composition of the workforce towards casual
employment in the informal sector and employment in the organized sector has remained stagnant since
the mid 1980s.
In addition to growth, GOUP places great emphasis on so-called direct measures to reduce poverty.
These measures are designed both to protect the vulnerable segments of the population against
destabilizing shocks and to provide them with opportunities to assist them in their struggle to escape
poverty. They include (1) centrally sponsored antipoverty and social safety net schemes; (2) subsidies
and public support services, many justified on the basis of protecting the living standards of the poor; (3)
renewed efforts to improve human development, through increased and better delivery of basic services;
(4) recent efforts to expedite decentralization, as required under the 73rd and 74f amendments to the
constitution, and increase transparency and accountability at the local level. Recent work suggests that
many of these direct measures have been ineffective at reaching the poor, in large part due to weak
governance structures, mismanagement, and overly restrictive regulations that limit the capacity of the
programs to respond to local needs. Subsidies and support services often serve the interests to the better-
4These findings relate to the period 1981-91 for the Census, and 1987-88/1993-94 for the NSS (Singh 1998).

off rather than the poor, and millions of poor people, particularly in southern and eastern regions of the
state, lack access to even the most basic of services.
Reforms and the Poor in Uttar Pradesh. In order to accelerate growth and improve economic
performance, GOUP is initiating a comprehensive program of reforms. While growth is a necessary
condition for sustained reductions in poverty, other measures are equally important to support poverty
reduction in its broader dimensions. The debate around economic reforms and poverty reduction often
focuses on potential adverse impacts of specific reform measures on the poor and other vulnerable
elements of society, particularly in the short-term. What is frequently overlooked is the wide range of
important positive benefits for the poor than can and indeed should flow from reform efforts in Uttar
Pradesh. Indeed, the success of the reform efforts in Uttar Pradesh must ultimately be judged by
achievements in terms of reducing and improving living conditions.
Fiscal reforms included under the program will enable a greater share of resources to be focused on high
priority expenditures -- for example, health and education services, as well as the basic infrastructure, so
critical for upward mobility and escape from poverty. Governance reforms should help to improve the
quality of public expenditures, and decentralization to local bodies create an enabling environment to
improve the quality of service delivery and enhance access of the poor to these services. Governance
reforms are particularly essential: priority areas for governance reforms linked to poverty reduction in UP
include (1) improvements in the delivery and quality of basic services such as health and education; (2)
more effective, better targeted anti-poverty programs and formal safety nets; (3) improving the regulatory
environment to promote private sector development and widen employment opportunities, particularly in
rural areas; (4) improving infrastructure (higher investments, better O&M) including roads,
communication, irrigation, drinking water and sanitation; (5) improving police and legislative functions to
promote greater personal security and effective dispute resolution.
Cost recovery measures in general, and more specifically increases in user charges for specific services,
that will be initiated as a part of sectoral reforms could increase the cost of key services to the poor and
other vulnerable groups, and thereby increase poverty. But user charges can be introduced selectively and
in such a way as to protect poor and vulnerable groups. And the potential benefits due to improved
availability and higher quality of services may far outweigh increases in the cost of services. Finally, the
distribution of public subsidies in high ticket items like power and education are enormously regressive:
while the poor pay relatively little, they get far less.
The question of how reforms will impact in practice on the poor and other vulnerable groups is complex.
Rather than devoting extensive resources to anticipating these impacts, a carefully designed Poverty and
Social Monitoring System (PSMS) has been developed to track actual changes in priority outcome
measures as well as key intermediate variables over the reform period. The PSMS thus provides a tool
that can be used by policy makers to monitor progress at achieving poverty and social objectives, identify
emerging positive as well as adverse impacts, and aid in the design of appropriate mitigation strategies.
UP Poverty and Social Monitoring System. The objectives of the Poverty and Social Monitoring
System (PSMS) are to
*  monitor progress in key areas related to poverty and living standards of the population in Uttar
Pradesh,
*  identify emerging problems with adverse impacts on the poor,
  keep public fully informed about progress as well as difficulties with regard to economic and
social issues, as well as
*  help GOUP in making more informed policy decisions.

Data collected through the system is expected to be made available and used by a range of different
stakeholders -- government officials in various departments as well as local governments, special interest
groups, civil society organizations, the public at large, as well as the donor community so as to better
inform all concerned about poverty outcomes and impacts of key policy and program measures under the
state's reform program.
The system has three main components:
(i)    Indicators. Identification of a set of initial performance indicators that will be used to track
progress at reducing poverty and vulnerability and promoting human development. The
indicators have been developed drawing on the findings of the baseline study of key social and
economic factors responsible for poverty in Uttar Pradesh (see above) and consultations with a
wide range of stakeholders within the state, including consultations with the poor themselves.
(ii)    Monitoring. Implementation of a system of consistent, periodic data gathering for the core set of
performance indicators. The monitoring system will build capacity within GOUP to better use
existing statistical information as well as to collect new information. Survey-based as well as
participatory methods of data collection will be utilized.
(iii)   Reporting. Analysis of information emerging from the monitoring system to learn about
emerging trends in poverty, what is and is not working for the poor, and to inform policy
decisions.
Indicators. A detailed list of core indicators is included in Annex D. The indicators broadly map to the
findings of the baseline poverty assessment and diagnostic. In addition to standard measures of income
poverty, core indicators include measures linked to (a) wages and employment; reflecting the importance
of economic opportunities for poverty reduction; (b) education outcomes, including enrollment as well as
completion rates; (c) measures of health outcomes; (d) quality of housing services and access to basic
infrastructure such as water, sanitation, roads, and electricity; (e) access to and use of formal safety net
programs; (f) access to and quality of basic services, including but not limited to health and education; (g)
awareness of social rights and responsibilities. The information will be collected across a broad range of
households and communities in order to facilitate comparisons by social group, geographic region, etc.
And efforts will be made to quantify the core set of indicators as well as to collect a wider range of
qualitative indicators linked to such concerns as livelihood security, social inclusion/exclusion, security
and violence.
System of Data Collection. Indicators will be collected using a range of instruments over a five year
period. The instruments include: (i) a baseline household survey of a wide range of welfare indicators to
be implemented throughout the state in 1999-2000, and then repeated after 3-5 years, (ii) an ongoing
community surveillance system that monitors information on key quantitative indicators as well as a
range of qualitative indicators in regions and communities with a high incidence of poverty or considered
most at risk of adverse outcomes, (iii) additional focused surveys undertaken as needed to investigate
issues of special interest as they arise.
The baseline household survey constitutes the standard Government of India National Sample Survey
Organization Consumer Expenditure Survey questionnaire administered to a sample of approximately
14,000 households drawn from throughout the state. In addition to the standard questionnaire, a specially
designed poverty monitoring module has been developed and will be canvassed for the same set of
households. The new module collects data on access and use of essential services such as health,
education, sanitation, water, electricity, and use of government programs and services (anti-poverty
programs, credit, early childhood centers, etc.), main employment and income-earning activities, as well

as asset ownership. Results from this survey will provide baseline values for tracking core monitoring
indicators, and the full survey will be repeated periodically over the course of the reforms.
The community survey is expected to be administered on an ongoing basis in a selected sample of 1000
communities in approximately 20 high priority districts located throughout the state. Changes in the
provision of infrastructure, delivery and quality of government programs and services, as well as other
intermediate indicators such as prices and wages will be monitored on a regular basis in these sentinel
villages to provide important supplementary information on changes in living conditions across the state.
Additional qualitative data collection exercises will also be launched to provide better information on risk
and vulnerability, changes in livelihood and coping strategies, as well as to reflect changes linked to
decentralization.
Additional surveys on topics of special interest will be developed and implemented over the course of the
project, as needs and issues arise. These might include (1) anticipating the impacts on specific groups of
specific policy measures and changes being considered by the government, (2) evaluation of particular
govemment programs or services, or (3) assessing the effects of unanticipated exogenous shocks or
adverse changes in the external environment. The additional surveys will be particularly useful in helping
the government investigate the effects of specific policy adjustments, as well as particular changes in the
economic environment on the poor, both from the point of view of learning as well as dissemination of
information to the wider public.
Institutional Arrangements and Reporting. The Poverty and Social Monitoring System will involve
coordinated effort from a number of different government departments and line agencies. Institutional
arrangements will play a crucial role in determining the overall success of the monitoring program.
The PSMS comprise three main sets of institutional actors; the specific roles of each are outlined below.
Under the system, it is proposed to separate the responsibility for data collection - which would be the
overall responsibility of the Department of Planning and Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) -
from the responsibility for reporting and policy analysis - which would be the primary responsibility of a
special unit set up the Chief Secretary's Branch. In addition, limited capacity would be developed in key
implementing departments - viz. Rural Development, SUDA, Rural Water and Sanitation, Panchyati Raj,
possibly others.-to track changes in the impact of essential antipoverty programs over the reform period,
drawing on information collected under the project.
(i) The Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) has an extensive network of field offices in all
districts throughout the state, and staff based in these offices will undertake most of the primary data
collection envisaged under the PSMS. All data will be consolidated at the DES head-office in Lucknow,
where a Poverty Data Unit has been established with responsibility for maintaining a comprehensive
computerized database of all the information collected. In addition, this unit will also be responsible for
servicing client needs by responding to requests for data and basic analysis, as well as for producing
standard reports on a regular basis.
In addition to the new data collection initiatives discussed above, some of the data already collected by
the Directorate of Economics and Statistics and other government departments will be computerized and
consolidated into the comprehensive database. There is tremendous variation in poverty incidence in Uttar
Pradesh, both regionally as well as among different groups. This data base will be maintained by DES at a
highly disaggregate level in order to track living conditions of different segments of society over time.
(ii) In addition to the Poverty Data Unit in DES, small monitoring cells will be set up in implementing
departments in GOUP with two specific objectives in mind. First, while implementing departments
typically track a range of physical indicators, including some input and output indicators, few have the

capacity to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs at achieving final outcomes - viz., reducing
poverty and insecurity, improving nutrition, reducing ill-health. The PSMS will help to support and
further develop this capacity. Second, many departments initiate their own independent data collection
exercises rather than drawing on the services of DES, resulting in costly duplication and inefficient use of
scarce resources. Over the course of the PSMS DES will take on greater responsibility for servicing the
data needs of implementing departments, and coordinate these efforts through the monitoring cells.
(iii) Finally, the main demand for analytic work is likely to arise from the GOUP Chief Secretary's office
in response to issues and questions of strategic import. A Poverty Monitoring and Analysis Unit will be
set up under the Chief Secretary's office to provide leadership and ensure overall coordination of the
project. The specific responsibilities of the unit include (a) monitoring changes in key indicators on a
regular basis, (b) commissioning special-studies on selected topics of policy concern, (c) ensuring that the
information being collected and reports produced by the various organizations involved in the PSMS
match the needs of policy-makers, and (d) having primary responsibility for disseminating information
and responding to queries from the public at large.
Achievements. If implemented successfully, the Poverty and Social Monitoring System should achieve
the following:
(i)    establishing a computerized database of key poverty and social indicators that is maintained and
updated regularly by DES;
(ii)   creating an environment for better informed policy and program design within GOUP,
(iii)  improving the access of the public to key information, promoting greater public participation in
policy debates, encouraging greater transparency and public accountability; and ultimately,
(iv)   promoting a more pro-poor development strategy within the state.
