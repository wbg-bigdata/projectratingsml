                    SOCIALIST REPUBLICOFVIETNAM:
             FIFTHPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

                          CreditandProgramSummary



Borrower:      The Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

Amount:        SDR 68.4 million (US$ 100.0millionequivalent).

Terms:         StandardIDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.

Description:   A fifthPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 5) for the implementation of
               Vietnam's Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS),
               approved inMay 2002 and expanded inDecember 2003.

Benefits:      The present operation provides further support to Vietnam' s reform program.
               The current cycle of PRSCs i s a vehicle for the World Bank, and the donor
               community more broadly, to stay engaged with a client that has delivered an
               outstanding performance interms of economic growth and poverty reduction.
               The reformprogrami s strengthened on several fronts:
                   Transition to a market economy. The present operation promotes greater
                   internal and external competition and improves efficiency and resource
                   allocation in the economy. Policy actions under the credit help improve
                   the regulatory framework for private sector development, and enhance
                   transparency and accountability in State-owned enterprise (SOE)
                   operations and inthe banking sector. The credit supports the initiation of
                   fundamental changes in the financial sector, designed to transform the
                   State bank of Vietnam (SBV) into a modern central bank, to strengthen
                   the commercial orientation of State-owned commercial banks (SOCBs),
                   and to develop capital markets.
                   Inclusive and sustainable development. The proposed credit also
                   promotes human development through upgrading the quality of education
                   (especially in poor zones), promoting inclusive education for children
                   with disabilities, improving the access of the poor to health services, and
                   helping secure asset ownership through the implementation of the new
                   Land Law.       The proposed credit also encourages important policy
                   measures leading to more sustainable management of natural resources,
                   including through strategic environmental assessments.

                   Building modern governance. The proposed credit supports actions to
                   implement the government' s public financial management reform agenda.
                   More effective public resource allocation i s being achieved through better
                   coordination plans and budgets and through the adoption of Medium-
                   Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). New budget allocation norms
                   increase the coherence between capital and recurrent expenditures. An
                   anti-corruption law targets greater accountability in public finance and

                  public administration. The credit also supports the ambitious agenda of
                  the legal systemdevelopment strategy (LSDS).

Risks:        At the same time, its own success confronts Vietnam with new challenges.
              Some of them entail important risks that the proposed operation alone may
              not be able to mitigate:
                  Transition to a market economy. Benefits from accession to the World
                  Trade Organization (WTO) will accrue only if complementary reforms
                  take place in areas such as trade logistics, infrastructure and financial
                  services, taxes and the investment climate. While many of these reforms
                  are in train, their pace would need to keep up with the demands of
                  international integration. Another risk relates to macroeconomic
                  management in a phase of rapid financial integration with the world
                  economy.     Increased opportunities to borrow abroad could lead to
                  increased government liabilities, whereas asset price bubbles cannot be
                  ruled    out.  A strong      implementation     drive   and    strengthened
                  macroeconomic managementare needed.
                  Inclusive and sustainable development. Disparities between urban and
                  rural areas, and between the Kinh majority and ethnic minorities, could
                  widen. Inequality could increase and new forms of urban poverty could
                  emerge. Reaching the latest group of children out of school i s proving
                  difficult. Health care remains under-funded.      The incentives given to
                  service providers to charge fees have not been matched by sufficient
                  accountability on the delivery of basic services. And an increasingly
                  sophisticated environmental legislation still needs to translate into
                  effective tools for natural resource management and pollution control.
                  However, this risk i s mitigated by the strong commitment of the
                  government of Vietnam to keep growth inclusive and sustainable.
                   Building modem governance. In a rapidly growing economy the
                  opportunities for graft could outpace improvements in anti-corruption
                  policies for some time. While there has been considerable progress on
                  enhancing budget transparency, the emerging institutional architecture for
                  managing and investing state capital faces governance risks.        Further,
                  rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds could
                  contribute to the development of infrastructure at the local level, but their
                  transparency and accountability are still matters of concern.       Policies
                  aimed at strengthening governance need to be at the center of the next
                  PRSC cycle.

Disbursement: The credit will be disbursed upon declaration of effectiveness.

Co-financing: Numerous bilateral and multilateral donors have expressed their support to the
              PRSC process in Vietnam.         Nineteen of them have participated in the
              preparation of this credit, and have been actively involved in the policy areas
              where they are stronger. Subject to confirmation, the following donors intend
              to contribute resources to the PRSC 5 operation through grant finance or

                   TO THE SOCIALISTREPUBLICOFVIETNAM FOR
                A FIFTHPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION



                                    I. INTRODUCTION



1.      The drive of the government of Vietnam towards relyingon market mechanisms,
buildinga multi-stakeholdereconomy, and enhancinginternationalintegrationaccelerated
noticeably in2001. The vision underlying this drive was endorsed by the ninthcongress of the
Communist Party. It was articulated inseveral strategic plans and documents, including the Ten-
Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2001-2010, the five-year Socio-economic
Development Plan (SEDP) 2001-2006 and the CPRGS. These strategic plans and documents
aimed at creating a market economy with a socialist orientation. They built on the successes of
the renovation process initiated in the late 198Os, with Doi Moi, while also preserving the strong
poverty focus which has characterized the reformprocess of Vietnam.

2.      The proposed credit is the last one in a five-year cycle aimed at supporting the
implementation of the reform strategy articulated in CPRGS and other key planning
documents. The focus of the policy actions under eachof the credits inthe series has broadened
over time, from the mainly structural reforms included in PRSC 1 towards increasingly
encompassing social and institutional changes, thus reflecting the comprehensive agenda of the
government of Vietnam. The proposed credit supports the policy dialogue around 46 policy
actions, selected because of their importance in implementing the reform agenda. Fifteen of
them, considered the most strategically important, are documented in the Financing Agreement
(FA). In the meantime, the number of donors co-financing each of the credits expanded
considerably, from four under PRSC 1 to possibly 11 in the proposed credit. The number of
donors involved i s actually larger, as several of themjoin the coordinated policy dialogue before
they are ina position to actually provide financial support. Overall, co-financiers are expected to
provide in excess of 120 million dollars in support of the proposed credit, of which around two-
thirds couldbe ongrant terms.

3.      Reliance on direct budget support has been made possible by the sustained
strengthening of public financialmanagement in Vietnam. Buildingon a long trajectory of
joint analytical work on public expenditures between the government of Vietnam and the World
Bank, a program to modernize public financial management was launched in 2001. It has led to
the full disclosure of the budget, greater transparency in relation to off-budget expenditures,
considerable strengthening of budget planning and execution at all levels of government, as well
as greater financial accountability and supervision. This i s being buttressed by the creation of a
single treasury account, the adoption of international public accounting standards, and the
introduction of a modem information management system. This process i s supported by the
World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) through an
investment credit, and by a large group of donors through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund(MDTF)for
public financial management modernization. In parallel, important measures were adopted to

increase the transparency of all units using budget resources, and to enhance participation in
relation to commune-level budgets, in the context of the so-called "grassroots democracy"
initiative.

4.       The performance of Vietnam during the five years covered by PRSC cycle has been
remarkably strong. The country fully recovered from the slowdown caused by the East Asian
crisis, with its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate accelerating steadily, from 6.8
percent in 2001 to 8.4 percent in 2005. Vietnam also proved itself to be a resilient economy,
having maintained impressive growth in the face of recurrent shocks stemming from commodity
price hikes, SARS, avian influenza, poor weather and antidumping suits.           Macroeconomic
balances remained at manageable levels through the period, and inflation was contained within
single digits. The poverty rate, which stood at 58 percent in 1993 and still at 37 percent at the
beginning of the East Asian crisis, fell to 29 percent in 2002 and below the 20 percent mark in
2004. With all 28 bilateral agreements signed or concluded in-prinicple, Vietnam could become a
member of the WTO before the end of 2006. Meanwhile, there was solid progress on most other
MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).

5.       However, a reform program as comprehensive as the one embraced by Vietnam
cannot be expected to deliver even progress across all fronts. Not surprisingly, public sector
reform has been slower, partlyreflecting resistance by vested interests. While the share of SOEs
in the economy keeps declining, the quality of lending by SOCBs remains a concern, due the
absence of a strong commercial interest, especially at provincial levels. More progress i s also
neededto strengthen the management of naturalresources and to buildmodern governance.

6.       The proposed credit supports important policy measures to lock-in and in some
cases accelerate reforms in the laggard areas. The commitments made by Vietnam in the
preparation to its accession to the WTO will establish a level playing field, foster competition in
areas formerly dominatedby the state sector, andlead to a rapid modernization of the institutional
foundations for business. The banking reformroadmap endorsed by the politburo inAugust 2005
should lead to the creation of a modem central bank, focused on monetary policy and banking
supervision, and the equitization of SOCBs, within the next five years. Progressi s being made on
the development of economic and administrative tools for environmental protection, strategic
environmental assessments are being piloted, and efforts are being made to strengthen rural water
supply and sanitation. The proposed credit also recognizes the adoption of an anti-corruption law
including a mechanism to monitor the assets of civil servants and their immediate families. This
measure comes at a time when two reliable diagnostic studies reveal a more nuanced (and
complex) picture of corruption than i s generally assumed. The credit supports a new procurement
law that brings greater disclosure and addresses bidders' complaints. The emphasis on laggard
reform areas i s not to the detriment of social inclusion, however. Under the proposed credit, the
mechanisms for financing the provision of health care to the poor are being strengthened. The
quality of education, especially in poor areas, i s being improved, while policies for inclusive
education for children living with disabilities are adopted. Budget allocation norms are being
revisedto enhance their pro-poor focus.

7.       The proposed credit also paves the way for the next five-year cycle of PRSCs, in
support of the SEDP 2006-2010. By now, the principles underlying the preparation of CPRGS
have been fully endorsed by the government of Vietnam. Unlike previous five-year plans, the
preparation of the SEDP 2006-2010 has involved broad-based consultations at the grassroots
level, with the business sector and with the overseas Vietnamese community. For the first time, a
monitoring and evaluation framework i s being developed to track progress in implementation.
Equally important, the SEDP represents a move away from material production targets towards


                                                  2

development objectives, with a strong poverty focus. This transformation reflects the lessons
learnedinthe process of preparing the CPRGS and, subsequently, of "rolling it out" to provinces.
The donors behind the PRSC process, as well as the CPRGS "roll out", have actively supported
the SEDP 2006-2010, which i s seen as a defensible poverty reduction strategy for the coming
years. Joint work on translating SEDP 2006-2010 into a series of strategic, well-prioritized
policy actions to be supported by PRSCs 6 to 10 will be discussed with the government of
Vietnam at the Consultative Group (CG) meeting of December 2006.



                              11.    THEREFORMPROGRAM



8.      The CPRGS, approved in 2002, represented a breakthrough compared to earlier
planning documents based on a "command and control" view of the economy. Rather than
spelling out detailed sector-by-sector production targets, the CPRGS focused on development
outcomes such as poverty reduction and other Vietnam Development Goals (VDGs). Empirical
evidence and a broad consultation process were used to identify the policies best suited to
attaining those development outcomes. Efforts were also made to "cost" these policies and to
align resources towards their attainment. A set of indicators (admittedly partial and rudimentary)
was developed to monitor progress in implementation. Broadly speaking, the reform agenda in
the CPRGS i s structured around three main pillars: completing the transition to a market
economy, ensuring social inclusion and environmental sustainability, and building modern
governance. The CPRGS was "expanded" in December 2003 so as to better address policies
relatedto large-scale infrastructure.

9.      Other important policy developments have influenced the reform agenda of Vietnam
more recently, and are bound to accelerate the pace of change inthe coming years. After several
years of hesitation and delays, by mid-2003 the government decided to aim for a rapid accession
to the WTO. In late 2003, a new anti-corruption strategy started to emerge, with the emphasis
shifting from punitive measures to increased transparency and the strengthening of the systems
through which the government operates. The year 2004 saw the coming into effect of the new
Budget Law, which makes the National Assembly and People's Councils at all levels responsible
for resource appropriations.

10.     The CPRGS, though approved by the Prime Minister, was formulated on the margins of
mainstream planning processes and coexisted with the five-year SEDP 2001-2005 which was
discussed by the Party Congress and approved by the National Assembly. But the process of
formulating the CPRGS, implementing it and monitoring its outcomes has initiated permanent
changes in the approaches to socioeconomic planning. In late 2004 it was decided that the
coming SEDP 2006-2010 would be drafted according to the same principles that had governed
the preparation of the CPRGS. The last year has seen concerted efforts to reform the planning
process and incorporate these principles. The World Bank and other donors expect to use the
new SEDP 2006-2010 as a basis for their development assistance.

11.     The implementation of the ambitious reform agenda spelled out in CPRGS and
other government strategies and plans has been supported through four PRSC operations
so far. PRSC 1, a two-tranche operation for US$250 million, was approved by the BoardinJune
2001, basedonan InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The focus of PRSC 1was
mainly on the structural reform agenda, with policies articulated around five main areas:



                                                3

liberalizing trade, reforming SOEs, strengthening the banking sector, creating an enabling
environment for the private sector, and improving management and transparency in public
finances. The secondtranche of PRSC 1was releasedinDecember 2002. PRSC2, a one-tranche
operation for US$lOO million, was approved by the Board in June 2003, based on the CPRGS.
Under PRSC 2, the range of economic reforms supported by the international community was
considerably broadened. In addition to the mainly structural reforms covered by PRSC 1, this
second credit included various policy actions aimed at keeping development inclusive and
building modern governance. Measures related to education and health sectors, environmental
sustainability, land management, legal development and public financial management, were all
part of PRSC 2. PRSC 3 and 4 were also one-tranche operations of US$lOO million each. These
were approved by the Board in June 2004 and June 2005 respectively, and had the same broad
sectoral coverage as PRSC 2.

12.      In addition to providing resourcesto the budget, PRSC operations have served as
an effective coordinationdevice, supported by an increasingly large number of donors. The
Steering Committee for PRSCs i s led by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic
reforms, and brings together representatives from more than 20 line ministries and government
agencies. On the donor side, PRSC operations have been co-financed by several bilateral and
multilateral agencies, either through grants or through parallel lending. More importantly, the
process saw a transition in the role of co-financiers, from providers of finance to partners
substantially engaged in the preparation of the operations and the policy dialogue with
government. This dialogue i s organized by policy areas, in which donors engage selectively,
basedon their interests and technical capacity on the ground. The number of donors participating
inthis process has increased from four inPRSC 1to seven inPRSC 3 to nine inPRSC 4 and to
possibly 11inthe proposedcredit. All donors who seriously consider the possibility to partner up
in this process are invited to participate in the preparation of PRSC operations, even if they
cannot commit to co-finance them in the short term. Nineteen of them have actively contributed
to the preparation of this operation.

13.      The implementation of Vietnam's ambitious reform agenda was initially supported by the
International Monetary Fund (W)as well, through a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) credit approved at the same time as PRSC 1. However, PRGF disbursements were
suspendedat the end of 2002 due to a disagreement between the IMFand the government on the
auditing of the SBV. The PRGFcredit expired inApril, 2004. The IMFhas remainedengaged in
several policy areas, and especially inthe monitoring of macroeconomic policies. Inthe absence
of an active PRGF, the IMFhas provided an assessment of the macroeconomic framework as part
of the preparation of each of the PRSCoperations.

A.       ECONOMICGROWTHAND POVERTYREDUCTION


14.      The period 2001-2005 was characterized by strong economic growth, with GDP
rising by an average of 7.6 percent per year in real terms (Table 1). Vietnam has also proven
itself to be a resilient economy, as this solid performance took place despite shocks such as avian
influenza, rising oil prices, poor weather and antidumping suits. Inper capita terms, GDP grew



                                                   4

by an annual growth rate of 6.1 percent during2001-2005. The progress accomplished is actually
bigger when measured at international prices, as opposed to constant domestic prices. This i s
becauseof the real appreciation of Vietnam's currency, as the economy develops and the price of
its non-tradable goods becomes more aligned with those of richer countries. Between 2001 and
2005, consumer prices increasedby 5.1 percent per year whereas the dong depreciated by 1.8 per
year against the dollar, resulting in a gap of 3.3 percent per year. The gap i s even wider if
domestic prices are measured through the GDP deflator. Inthis case, it can be estimated at 5.0
percent per year. The combination of rapid real growth and an inflation rate above the nominal
depreciation rate has resulted in a rapid increase of GDP per capita measured in dollar terms,
from 415 in 2001 to an estimated 635 in2005. If Vietnam were to sustain this pace over time, it
will have surpassedthe 1000dollar per capita threshold by 2010.

15.      GDP growth has been ledby a dynamic manufacturingsector which recorded an average
annual increase of 11percent during 2001-2005. While the most rapidly expanding activities,
such as garments and footwear, have been oriented mainly to the export markets, domestic sales
have also been robust. The agriculture and fisheries sectors countered poor weather and wide
fluctuations in commodity prices to grow by more than 3.5 percent per year on average. The
services sector picked up in the last two years to record an average increase of 7.2 percent over
2001-2005. Tourism-related services have been especially buoyant.

16.      Investment, as recorded in the national accounts, increased from 31 percent of GDP
in 2001 to 36 percent in 2005. Equally encouraging is the change inthe ownership pattern of
investment. The share of the domestic private sector intotal investment has risen from 23 percent
in2001to over 32 percent in2005, while that of the state-owned sector has declined from about
60 percent to 52 percent. Foreign investment has picked up strongly in the last two years. After
reaching a seven-year high of 4.2 billion dollars in 2004, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
commitments soared to 6.3 billion dollars in 2005. FDI disbursements, including domestic
borrowingbyjoint ventures, stood at 3.3 billion dollars (or 6 percent of GDP) in2005.

17.      From a slow beginning in2001, export growth accelerated to average 21 percent per
year during 2001-2005. In the same period imports grew by 23 percent per year. The trade
balance switched from a surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP to a deficit of 6.6 percent over 2001-2003,
reflecting the import needs of a rapidly expanding economy. Bulk of the rise in imports came
from capital goods and inputs for export production. In the last two years, however, the trade
deficit has narrowed. Strong remittance flows have also been a feature of this period. Those
operating through formal channels rose from a little over 1billion dollars in 2001 to nearly 3
billion in 2005. As a result the current account deficit has been narrower than the trade deficit,
declining from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to around 0.3 percent in 2005. Importantly, the
current account deficit has been mainly financed by FDIinflows and concessional lending. As a
result Vietnam's external debt stood at a manageable 33 percent in 2005, with debt service at
around 5 percent of exports. External reserves rose to 8.6 billion dollars (about 11 weeks of
imports of goods and services) compared with 3.4 billion at the end of 2001.

18.      Vietnam successfully issued its first international bond in October, 2005.          The
government had decided to raise 500 million dollars, but given a stronger than expected market
interest, the amount was increased to 750 million dollars. The ten-year dollar-denominated bonds
were priced at 7.125 percent or 256 basis points above comparable ten-year US Treasuries. Since
then the spreads have tightened with the yield coming down to 6.416 percent inmid-May.

19.      Inflation, which stood below 4 percent per year upto 2003, rose sharply to 9.5 percent by
the end of 2004. This was mainly due to supply shocks, stemming from the outbreak of avian
influenza outbreaks, bad weather conditions, and hardened international commodity prices. The
result was a sharp spike in food prices, which account for nearly 50 percent of the consumption
basket. The effects of the supply shocks abated somewhat in 2005, while demand pressures
possibly emerged due to wage hikes. The difficult task of macroeconomic policy was to support
the government's ambitious growth target of 8.5 percent without overly exacerbating inflationary
pressures. The final outcome of 8.4 percent growth in 2005, and an inflation rate which had
fallen to 7.3 percent by April 2006, suggests a measure of success.

20.       The fiscal deficit, including Official Development Assistance (ODA) on-lending, stood
at 1.7 and 2.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005 respectively, and was financed entirely through
public debt. In both 2004 and 2005 revenue collection exceeded budgeted amounts owing to
buoyant oil revenues. As a result, despite higher expenditures, the deficit remained below the


                                                  6

budgeted levels. However, to get a fuller picture of the level of public expenditure, extra
budgetary outlays need to be considered. Off-budget investment expenditures represented 1and
2 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Such expenditures, chiefly related to roads,
irrigation, and upgrading of education facilities, have been presented alongwith the government
budget, and are approved by the National Assembly. In addition, they include bonds issued
mainly by H o Chi Minh City and Hanoi to fund municipal infrastructure. The Development
Assistance Fund (DAF) on-lends resources raised domestically for investment purposes. Such
on-lending amounted to 1.0 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Public debt,
including realized contingent liabilities from banking sector reform, off-budget and guaranteed
items, stood at around 43 percent of GDP at the end of 2005. Innet present value (NPV)terms, it
only amounted to 33 percent of GDP, as a large fraction of public debt i s on concessional terms.

21.      A joint Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) placed Vietnam at a low
risk of external debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, the stock of total external debt is
expected to rise modestly to about 40 percent of GDP by around 2015 before declining to about
32 percent in 2025.      This scenario assumes a gradually narrowing current account deficit,
reflecting a steady deceleration in the growth of exports and imports from the current high levels
and continued buoyant remittances and tourism receipts.        It also assumes a slight increase,
followed by a gradual decline, in ODA inflows, as well as an increase in FDI and commercial
borrowing. Under the scenario the ratio between the NPV of public debt and exports falls from
28 percent in 2005 to 18 percent in 2025. The ratio of debt service to exports falls from 5.3
percent in 2005 to 4.7 percent in 2025. The main risks on the external front are a significant
deterioration inthe terms of financing and a weaker-than-projected export performance.

22.      Under the baseline scenario of the DSA, public and publicly-guaranteed debt increases
slightly from about 41 percent of GDP in 2004 to around 43 percent in 2009, before stabilizing.
InNPV terms, the debt increases from 28 percent of GDP in 2004 to about 29 percent of GDP
and stabilizes at that level over the long-term. The main risk to medium-term debt sustainability
stems from contingent liabilities associated with SOCB reform. Given the uncertainty
surrounding bank balance sheets, two alternative reform scenarios were considered in the DSA,
associatedwith contingent liabilities of 8 percent and 20 percent of GDP. Inthese two scenarios,
the NPV of public debt reaches peaks of 35 percent and 49 of GDPrespectively, before declining
to 30 percent and 33 percent over the long term. The DSA, which was completed in August
2005, will be updated for the forthcoming CAS for Vietnam. It will reflect the impact of the
investment program contemplated in the SEDP 2006-10, which may be more expansionary than
the above baseline scenario. I t will also incorporate the effects of a somewhat higher overall
deficit inthe period since the DSA was conducted.

23.      The rapid pace of credit growth, which became a concern in 2004, has slowed. The
high credit growth in part reflects a rapidly monetizing economy. It is not the result of faster
growth in base money but rather of a better mobilization of resources by commercial banks.
From this perspective, credit growth should not be seen as the main factor behind inflation. Its
pace has slowed from about 42 percent year-on-year at end-2004 to around 24 percent in
February 2006. But the ability of large SOCBs to allocate the rapidly growing credit volume in
an efficient way i s a concern, and the quality of bank portfolios might have suffered, adding to
the contingent liabilities of the government.

24.      Broad-based growth has been accompanied by a continuation of Vietnam's
remarkable record in poverty reduction. Data collected through the Vietnam Household
Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) shows that general poverty rate has fallen from 58.1 percent in
1993 to 19.5 percent in 2004, implying an average decline of 3.5 percentage points per year


                                                  7

(Table 2). The proportion of poor people now i sjust above one-third of what it was 11years ago.
Measures used to track inequality suggest that there has been only a modest increase ininequality
over time. The Gini index stands now at 0.37, compared to 0.34 in 1993, 0.35 in 1998 and 0.37
in 2002. Admittedly, the Gini index is not very sensitive to substantive increases inincome or
expenditures at the very top of the distribution, and this i s a relatively visible trend in Vietnam.
However, the ratio of per capita expenditures between the richest and the poorest quintile has not
increased dramatically. This ratio stands at 6.27 in 2004, compared to 4.97 in 1993, 5.49 in 1998
and 6.03 in2002. This inclusive growth pattern explains the unusual speed at which Vietnam has
managed to reduce poverty.

                   the food and non-food consumption bundle needed to sustain an intake of
                   2100 calories per personper day. The food poverty rate refers to expenditures
                   belowthe value of the food component of that bundle.



25.     These impressive achievements sit alongside slower progress for ethnic minorities.
Poverty reduction has been more rapid for the Kinhand Chinese population, even inremote and
mountainous areas. In 2004, only 14 percent of the majority group was living in poverty,
compared to 61 percent of the ethnic minorities. Though the latter account for only 13 percent of
the total population, they now constitute 39 percent of the poor. Their level of deprivation i s also
more severe than for other groups. As of 2004, the poverty gap for ethnic minorities was 19.2
percent, while that for poor Kinh people was only 2.6 percent. Uneven progress in poverty
reduction between the Kinh majority and the ethnic minorities translates into important gaps in
the extent and depth of poverty across regions. While there has been progress across all eight of
them, poverty remains much higher in some. For instance, the poverty gap inthe North West i s
19.1percent, or nine times larger than inthe Red River delta.


                                                   8

26.       Poverty reduction has accelerated in the past two years, a feature consistent with
other developments during the period. This acceleration could be amplified by a quirk of the
data. The household survey for 2002 was much larger in scale then the previous ones, but was
conducted with less supervision and training of enumerators. However, the faster reduction in
poverty i s in line with the acceleration ineconomic growth during 2002-2004 compared with the
period 1998-2002. The sharper reduction in poverty might actually reflect the increasing size of
budget transfers to poorer provinces, especially since tax-revenue sharing arrangements and
equalization grants were introduced inthis period. The public investment program (PIP), with its
greater emphasis in remote areas during the current five-year plan, might have contributed as
well.   Rural infrastructure development has benefited farmers by increasing their access to
markets. The proportion of the population living within two kilometers of an all-weather road
increased to 83 percent in2004, from 76 percent in2002. Rapidpoverty reduction inrecent years
i s also likely to reflect the rise in the world prices of agricultural export commodities such as
coffee and rice, which are important sources of income for many among the ruralpoor.



B.        OTHER DEVELOPMENTOUTCOMES


27.       Progress under the PRSC processcan be measured against the specific development
objectives spelled out in the CPRGS and other plans and strategies of the government.
Unfortunately, a comprehensive system of indicators to monitor and evaluate the impact of
economic reforms was not yet in place at the beginning of the PRSC process. The focus varied
across government plans and strategies, and the definition of goals and targets was not always
precise, or totally pertinent. This i s not surprising at a time when the "command and control"
view of the economy was more entrenched, and the statistical system was only starting to
develop. In spite of these limitations, based on the CPRGS and other planning documents of the
government it was possible to assemble a set of development objectives covering the three main
areas of the reform program. Inpractice, these indicators were compiled gradually, as the scope
of PRSCs expanded to cover an ever-increasing number of policy areas. Because of the five-year
planning cycle of Vietnam, most of those objectives were spelled out for end-2006 (Table 3).
Progress against each outcome i s given one of the following ratings: Highly Satisfactory (HS),
Satisfactory (S), Partially Satisfactory (PS) or Unsatisfactory (U). The rating utilizes the latest
available data to assess the progress to date. And based on recent trends, it also includes a
judgment as to the outcome expected by end-2006. For those development outcomes where a
quantitativetarget had been specified, a rating of HS reflects meeting or surpassing the target. On
the other hand no improvement or backsliding would have resulted in a U rating.                 The
intermediate ratings of PS and S do reflect a level of judgement about associated policies,
exogenous constraints, and sustainability of the progress achieved.

28.      Progress under the first four PRSC operations has been strong, though
achievements across policy areas are uneven. Given the comprehensive nature of Vietnam's
reform agenda some areas are bound to register faster progress than others. The assessment i s
also affected by differences in the quality and frequency of the available indicators. However,
substantive progress has occurred in the structural, the social and the governance pillars of the
reform agenda, making it difficult to identify any of them as a systematic laggard. The speed at
which progress is made towards the attainment development outcomes within each of these
pillars crucially depends on the political will to implement the reforms. The contrast between
rapid progress in the integration with the world economy on the one hand, and the reform of
SOEs and SOCBs on the other hand, is revealinginthis respect.

29.      Vietnam's transition to a market economy has gone hand in hand with growing
international integration. Export growth has exceeded 21 percent per year over the period
2001-2005, and exports now account for 61 percent of GDP. While rising commodity prices,
especially oil, have boosted export values over the last two years, key manufactured products
(chiefly garments and footwear) now account about 48 percent of non-oil exports, compared with
41 percent in 2001. FDI recovered from the slump related to the East Asian crisis, with new
commitments reaching 12 percent of GDP in 2005. Progress in integrating with the world
economy has been faster than in other reformareas. But to a certain extent, this contrast reflects a
strategy, whereby political effort was initially directed at gaining a consensus onWTO accession.
Integration with the world economy i s now being used as a mechanism to "lock-in" the reforms,
and gradually create the incentive for changes inareas where the inertia i s stronger. Accordingly,
as WTO accessionnearsthe final stage, a much bolder approach to reformthe banking sector has
finally been adopted, and a new approach to SOE reform i s emerging.

30.      The number of SOEs has declined steadily over the period, from 5,600 in 2001 to
around 3,000 at the end of 2005, guided by master plans for each line ministry and province,
approved by the Prime Minister. From an initially slow start, transformations picked up in the
second half of 2003 and through 2004. The reduction in SOEs has been mainly through
equitization, whereby the SOE after a sale of shares i s converted to a joint stock company that
operates under the Enterprise Law, rather than the SOE Law. Other forms of SOE transformation
have been mergers, conversions to limited liability companies, outright sales, and liquidation.
Initially, the focus of equitization hadbeen on smaller SOEs, but in2004 the list of sectors where
100percent state ownership i s to beretained was substantially shortened. Since then, the average
size of the SOEs transformed has been rising. The equitization process has itself undergone
major improvements with appraisals being conducted by outside evaluators, and the share sales
taking place at market values through auctions at the securities trading centers. The percentageof
shares sold to non-employees or to outsiders (including foreigners) has also been increasing. The
percentage of SOEs that did not sell any shares to outsiders has come down from 52 percent in
2003 to 29 percent in 2005. In 2004, the proportion of equity sold to outsiders amounted to no
more than 9 percent of the total equity inthese enterprises, but it rose to 14percent in2005.

31.      A survey of 550 equitized SOEs was conducted in 2005, following a similar one
undertaken two years earlier. Almost 90 percent of those sampled reported an improvement in
their financial performance, starting promptly on equitization. Although tax incentives available
to equitized SOEs tend to inflate post-tax profits, there i s sufficient evidence that actual
performance improved. Turnover increased by 13 percent on average and pre-tax profits by 9
percent. These gains are higher than those observed among non-equitized SOEs. Investments and
salaries increased as well. Most equitized SOEs continue to be managed by the same individuals
as in the past, though with greater autonomy from supervising ministries or agencies. The survey
results also suggest that performance improved faster when the reduction in the state share of
capital was larger.

32.      The flip side of SOE reform, and a key aspect of the transition to a market economy,
has beenthe rising role of the private sector. Between 2000 and 2005, the share of the private
sector in non-oil exports rose from about 50 percent to over 70 percent, while its share in
manufacturing production rose from 57 to 65 percent. Over the same period private investment
increased from 14 percent of GDP to over 18 percent, with the domestic private sector being
especially buoyant in recent years. In the last five years about 146 thousand new domestic
enterprises were registered, with the number being nearly 40 thousand alone in 2005. The
average capital of these enterprises, at around 160 thousand dollars in 2005, remains small by
international standards.     But it has more than doubled in comparison with 2001.           Private


                                                   16

enterprises, excluding farmers and non-farm self-employment, now account for about 22 percent
of the employed labor force, compared with 13 percent in 1998.

33.      Progressalongall areas of banking reformhasbeensignificant,especially inthe last
two years. In2001, the bankingreformprogramaimed at restructuringjoint-stock banks (JSBs)
and making them comply with regulatory standards. As for SOCBs, it involved phasing out their
policy lending, resolving their existing non-performing loans (NPLs), conducting International
Accounting Standard (IAS) audits of all of them, and re-capitalizing them. The pace of reform
along all these areas has picked up after an initially slow start. The NPLs identified as of end-
2000 were resolved, but mainly through write-offs. SOCBs received phased recapitalization
payments totaling 10.8 trillion dongs. By 2006, at least five I A S audits have been conducted for
each large SOCB. Audit quality, though initially weak, has improved considerably over time.
Policy lending was separated from the commercial banking system but it initially continued to
expand rapidly through the DAF. However, the introduction of sounder regulation of DAF in
2004 has led to a slow down in such lending. The share of credit to the private sector has risen to
67 percent, from 58 percent in2001.

34.       SOCBs compliance with banking regulations, though having improved since 2001, i s still
short of requirements. But the regulations for prudential ratios and asset classification were
strengthened, and are to be complied with in a phased manner over the next three years. There
has already been measurableprogress towards their attainment. An important benchmark was the
production of a first estimate of NPLs basedon criteria which are close to international standards,
inearly 2006. This estimate, which after large write-offs is inthe range of 8 to 10percent of total
credit, i s lower than many observers expected. But it is more than twice as high as previous
estimates based on local accounting standards. While questions still surround the accuracy of the
new loan classification, the public announcement of more credible figures on a regular basis
shouldmarka change from the past. Inaddition, as part of their equitization plans the SOCBs are
taking steps to help market participants obtain a better picture of their worth. Vietcombank and
Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) are in the final stages of hiring external consultants to value the
banks, while the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) has already obtained
a rating from Moodys.

35.       Vietnam continues to make impressive improvements in access to education at all
levels, while improving the quality of its primary schools. Net enrolment rates reached 94
percent for primary, 80 percent for lower secondary and 45 percent for upper secondary in the
school year ending in 2004. More importantly, the gap between the rich and the poor continues
to narrow. Between the school years finishing in 1993 and in 2004, the net primary enrollment
rate for the poorest income quintile increased from 70.5 percent to 90.7 percent. For children
from ethnic minorities, it increased from 61.8 percent to 87.7 percent. Fundamental School
Quality Level (FSQL) standards have been adopted as a key tool for monitor the performance of
the education sector and link resources to needs. FSQL standards combine indicators related to
the management of a school, the training of its teachers, the quality of its infrastructure and the
availability of classroom material, among others. An annual audit of primary schools nationwide
was launched in2004 to assess progress inthe quality of education. By 2005 the average FSQL
index hadincreased substantially, especially inpoorer districts.

36.       Considerable gains have also been made towards achieving the MDGs on health,
especially in relation to infant and child mortality. The Vietnam Demographic and Health
Survey for 2002 reports infant mortality to have declined to 18 per thousand live births, compared
with 30 at the time of the 1997 survey. The corresponding numbers for under-five child mortality
are 40 per thousand and 24 per thousand. While these estimates are subject to large measurement


                                                17

errors, the hypothesis of rapid declines cannot be rejected. Gains have also occurredinrelation to
communicable diseases. There has been progress with regard to malaria, and successes in
diagnosingand curing a highproportion of new TB cases.

37.      The setting up of Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFPs) in all provinces significantly
increased the level of funding provided by the central government to support the health care
expenditures of the poor.      A survey conducted in two provinces found an increase in the
utilization of health services after the implementationof the HCFF's, especially for inpatient care.
A significant increase in health services sought at the commune health stations was reported as
well. Although average out-of-pocket expenditures on outpatient and inpatient care were still
substantial, they fell considerably among the poor.

38.      Land tenure is being made secure through a rapid increase in the allocation of
Land-Use Right Certificates (LUCs). For agricultural land, LUCs hadbeen issued for nearly 76
percent of all plots as of 2004, compared with 42 percent in 1998. For urban land, the
corresponding figures were 68 percent and 34 percent respectively. As of 2004, 18 of agricultural
land titles were in the name of women, and an additional 12 percent had the names of both
spouses on them. Inspite of these developments, the role of land rental markets in agriculture
remains relatively minor. In2004, 10.7 percent of rural households had rented-in land, compared
with 7.9 percent in 1998. The development of land sales i s limited too, with only 2.7 percent of
households reporting that they had sold land in2004. While interpreting the above numbers it is
important to note that 2004 was the first year of the new land law, so it i s unlikely that the above
numbers reflect its impact.

39.      Forest cover, including both natural forest and plantations, has risen from about 35
percent of the total land area of the country in2001 to 37 percent in2005, but i s quality has been
problematic. About 18 percent of the total area i s plantations. Of the natural forests, over two-
thirds are considered low quality or regenerating. While the share of rich and closed-canopy
forests was only about 4.6 percent in 2004, it did record an increase from 3.4 percent in 2000.
Efforts to stabilize the area under mangrove forests appear to be bearing results. The last
comprehensive national inventory of mangroves was conducted in 1999, but a range of site-
specific data suggests that combined control and replanting programs have slowed their decline.
The preventionof degradation of wetlands and coral reefs has not been equally successful.

40.      The planning process itself has been substantially improved during the CPRGS
period, moving away from a "command and control" approach towards a more strategic
approach, involving strengthened policy analysis and broader consultation. Both at the national
and subnational levels, participatory workshops on the draft SEDP for 2006-2010 have drawn in
stakeholders from inside and outside the government.          Over a period of several months,
consultations were conducted with officials from local governments, the domestic private sector,
local associations, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and development
partners, researchers and representatives of the overseas Vietnamese. There was a particular
effort to solicit the views of women. And teams of local researchers have gathered feedback at
the grassrootslevel.

41.      The implementation of the revised Law on the State Budget, which became effective
in2004,is oneofthe cornerstonesofthe publicfinancialmanagementreformprogram. The
law clearly delineates the roles of the National Assembly and the Provincial People's Councils in
budget approval and streamlines budget execution. It also assigns the Treasury Department as the
lead agency responsible for budget execution and for financial management information. In2005
the entire State Budget Plan was disclosed for the first time, including an aggregate amount for



                                                 18

defense expenditures. In November 2004, the trend towards disclosure was reinforced by the
Prime Minister's Decision 192, which mandatesthat details of budgets at all levels of government
be published within a stipulated time period. Importantly, the Decision introduces financial
transparency in capital projects that use state budget resources. Allocation of funds to such
projects must be based on approved investment plans, and details of the bidding process need to
be made publicly available.      Decision 192 also covers the disclosure of information on the
financial situation of SOEs. A related development was the transformation of the State Audit of
Vietnam (SAV) into an independent institution reporting the National Assembly, rather than to
the government. The Auditor General will be appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly
and audit reports will be made public. The SBV will also be subject to annual auditing and the
disclosure of the audit reports.

42.      To help strengthen medium-term expenditure planning, the government has piloted the
development of MTEFs in four sectors and four provinces. The first MTEFs, covering the
ministries of education, health, transport, and agriculture and rural development, have been
submitted. These contain scenarios for sectoral spending and its allocation over a period of three
years. Estimates for the capital and recurrent sides of the budget have been prepared in an
integrated way, with reference to the development goals of the sectors. These MTEFs have been
developed within the context of a sustainablemedium-termfiscal envelope.

43.      A diagnostic study of corruption and its modalities was recently completed and its
results were presented publicly. The independently conducted Investment Climate Assessment
(ICA) survey corroborates the results of the study. Both sourcesidentify the same set of agencies
as being the most corrupt ones; land administration, customs, traffic police and tax offices come
at the top of the list. But it also appears that some of the key agencies businesses need to deal
with (in particular, district level people's committees) tend to be relatively "clean".   Average
bribes to each of the most corrupt agencies are in the order on 100 dollars. Given that this i s
close to an average salary in manufacturing, this finding i s not comforting from a social and
moral point of view. It makes it clear why the Vietnamese society i s so outraged at corruption.
At the same time, the cost of corruption for the conduct of business, estimated at 0.4 percent of
sales, i s low by international standards. The ICA also suggests that corruption i s a less severe
constraint for businesses inVietnam than inmost other countries inthe region, bar Malaysia. The
drafting of implementing decrees for the anti-corruption law could benefit greatly from the results
of these newly available diagnostic studies. The main initiatives for fighting and controlling
corruption include increased public disclosure and transparency in areas such as public
procurement, civil works, management and equitization of SOEs, auditing of the state budget,
management and use of land, and personnel management.

44.       The adoption of the One Stop Shop (OSS) model nationwide has been an important
step towards simplifying administrative procedures and enhancing their transparency. In
general, the OSSs have provided an accessible and recognizable entry point for people inneed of
administrative services.    Procedures have been published and fees have been made more
transparent. B y now, 63 out of 64 provinces have established OSSs in the four compulsory
departments, namely Labor and Social Affairs, Natural Resources and Environment, Planning and
Investment, and Construction. Overall, 98 percent of all districts and 65 percent of all communes
have set up their OSS.

45.       Legal transparency has improved with the issuance of a Decree stipulating that the
sanction for non-publication of legal normative documents in the Official Gazette is non-
effectiveness. While the requirement to publishinthe official Gazette hadbeen made inthe Law
on the Promulgation of Legal Documents, the implications of non-publication were not explicit


                                                 19

untilnow. Moreover, this new Decree, passedin2005, sets clear guidelines for the collection of
comments from stakeholdersdirectly affected by legal normative documents. A minimumperiod
of 20 working days i s stipulated for consultation. The latter can take place through mass media or
through the internet.



                            IV.     THE CONTRIBUTIONOFPRsCs



A.       PROCESSAND CONTENT


46.      PRSCs are a well-suited aid instrument in the case of Vietnam, given the strong
government ownership of the reform agenda and its capacity to deliver in practice.
Conditionality has not been a central feature of PRSCs in Vietnam, except at their inception.
PRSC 1included a series of conditions for the release of the second tranche (one of them had to
be waived) and PRSC 2 had a limited number of effectiveness conditions. As the policy dialogue
around PRSCs matured, however, incentive mechanisms were softened, with the assessment of a
set of forward-looking triggers being used to launch the preparation of the next operation in the
series. It was agreed that progress towards meeting all triggers would lead to a higher volume of
lending (high-case scenario), progress towards most and no backtracking in any to the stability of
lending (base case) and serious backtracking to the halting of the process (low case). Since the
introduction of triggers, all the operations inthe series actually fell inthe base-case scenario. On
the other hand, each of the operations was backward-looking, inthe sense of reckoning the actual
progress accomplished inthe implementation of the reformagenda up to that point.

47.      Over time, PRSC operations in Vietnam have become broader undertakings, both
in terms of the number of policy areas covered and in terms of the number of donors
involved. PRSC 1 supported economic reforms in five policy areas, all but one related to
structural adjustment. A considerable expansion incoverage took place under PRSC 2, as a result
of the adoption of the CPRGS, which tackles growth and poverty from the structural, social and
institutional angles at once. The expansion of CPRGS to address large-scale infrastructure issues
further broadened the scope of the policy dialogue under the umbrella of PRSCs. Meanwhile, the
number of donors involved expanded from four in the case of PRSC 1, to nine for PRSC 4.
Nineteen of them participate by now in the preparation of PRSC operations. This number
includes donors who are considering joining the process, either for this operation or during the
next PRSCcycle. As more donors joined, it also became possible to tap the technical expertise of
several of them on specific issues, thus bringing more line ministries and government agencies
into the policy dialogue supported by the PRSC process. The current operation in the series
covers 19policy areas, involvingmore than 20 line ministries and government agencies.

48.      The increasingly broader scope of the policy dialogue raises important logistic
challenges. PRSCs require an effective coordination mechanismif they are to be delivered on an
annual basis. One of the potential strengths of direct budget support i s to provide a predictable
flow of aid resources to the government. But the predictability would be lost if operations were
to slip as a result of their administrative complexity. The institutional arrangement established at
the onset of the process, whereby PRSCs fall under the direct responsibility of the first Deputy
Prime Minister, proved effective in this respect. Inpractice, a PRSC secretariat operating in the
SBV, under the leadership of one of its Deputy Governors, has been instrumental in translating



                                                  20

this empowerment into a workable schedule of meetings and exchanges of documents between
line ministries and government agencies on the one hand, and donors on the other.

49.     PRSCshave also becomean important donor coordinationmechanism, inthe spirit
of the harmonization agenda. Discussions with government in each of the policy areas are
jointly conducted with all the co-financiers and potential co-financiers with an interest in them.
Fromthe government's perspective, this arrangement reduces transaction costs. Fromthe donor's
perspective, it increases the coherence of the support to economic reforms. Donors jointly make
key decisions, including whether a policy action satisfies the criteria required to be addressed
through the PRSC process, whether triggers are met, and how satisfactory i s the progress towards
attaining each of the development outcomes. PRSCs also allow a better coordination of technical
assistance and analytical work in support of the reform agenda of the government. At the same
time, there i s a scale effect, allowing each the participating donors to be involved in the policy
dialogue to a larger extent than they could individually. Since PRSC 3, donors have jointly
contributed more resources than the World Bank. The gap i s actually larger than it appears, as
more than two thirds of donor co-financing i s under the form of grants.

50.     On the other hand, the broadening scope of PRSC operations has created some overlap
between the teams involved in each of the policy areas and pre-existing partnership or
international support groups. The overlap is not perfect, given that not all donors active in
Vietnam participate in the PRSC process.          Moreover, arrangements differ between those
partnership groups and the PRSC teams. The former tend to have a leading line ministry,
government agency or donor, whereas all PRSC teams have the SBV Secretariat as the
coordinator on the government side and the World Bank as the coordinator on the donor side.
Effective coordination on both sides has been instrumental in delivering complex operations,
supporting substantive reforms, under tight deadlines. Because of these differences, pre-existing
partnership groups and PRSC teams by policy area might co-exist inthe foreseeable future.

51.     PRSCs also complement, rather than replace, other initiatives of the World Bank
and other donors, including the analytical program, the policy dialogue and investment
credits (Figure 1). A relatively efficient division of labor has been achieved in this respect,
whereby PRSCs carry through high-level policy reforms, whereas investment credits and
technical assistance focus on their implementation.        There i s also a clear complementarity
between PRSCs and the analytical program. The annual Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs)
are joint donor documents presented at the year-end CG meeting. They update government and
donors on the assessment of the development challenges faced by Vietnam. The VDR released at
the end of 2002 helped translate the CPRGS into recommendations for action ineach policy area.
The VDRs of end 2003,2004 and 2005 provided a more comprehensive diagnosis of the situation
ineachof the three pillars covered by CPRGS.



B.      RESOURCES MOBILIZED AND COST OFREFORMS


52.     The PRSC processhas led to disbursements to the budget on an annual basis, thus
meeting the objective of aligning aid to domestic budget cycles. Since PRSC 2, commitments
are made in June of each year, which i s the time when the preparation of the state budget starts.
The state budget i s approved by the National Assembly towards November, for the following
calendar year. The submission to the National Assembly already factors in the amount of
resourcesexpected from PRSCs. Because such credits are disbursed fully within a few months of



                                                 21

their signature, PRSCs have been a relatively predictable source of funds. Disbursements by co-
financiers, either under the form of grants or parallel lending, take place over a longer period of
time. But there has been progress in speeding up those disbursements. Combined with the
increasingnumber of co-financiers, and the regularity of PRSCoperations, the result has been an
increasingly smooth transfer of aid resources to the government (Table 4). At present, there i s
almost no gap between the volume of resources jointly committed by donors when a PRSC i s
approved, and the volume of resources disbursed to the budget in the corresponding calendar
year.

    Note: World Bank staffestimates.



53.      Inspite of the increasingly large volume of aid resourcesdisbursed through PRSC
operations, the combined contribution of the World Bank and donors is modest compared
to the financing needsof Vietnam (Table 5). Some of the reforms supported through the PRSC
process entail substantial costs to the budget. The restructuring of SOCBs initiated under PRSC 1
led to a phased-in re-capitalizationfinanced by government bonds. The social safety net (SSN) to
assist workers who become redundant as a result of SOE equitization and restructuring has
became more active over time, and has provided by now a reasonable compensation package to
some 120,000 workers. The PRSCprocess also supported additional spending inthe social areas,
under the form of HCFPat the provincial level, and a steady increase inthe budget for education.
Even if all other actions under the PRSC process were budget-neutral, the additional cost of the
reforms would be in the order of US$400 million per year. The total resource contribution by
PRSCsduringthis five-year cycle representsless than half of this amount. Fromthis perspective,
the PRSCprocess can be seen as an effective cost-sharing arrangement between the government
of Vietnam and the donor community.

54.      The contribution of PRSCsi s even more modest when compared to government spending
at the aggregate level. The total amount of resources contributed represents less than a quarter of
the total budget deficit, and less than 2 percent of total government spending in Vietnam. It i s
therefore clear that the donor community plays a supporting role, one that the government of
Vietnam can afford to do without. This real possibility of opting out sustains a healthy policy
dialogue, as donors are not in a position to "buy" any economic reforms. Building consensus
between the two sides, often on the basis of high-quality analytical work, i s necessary to
successfully bring new policy initiatives into the process. The main contribution o f PRSCs has
been their ability to serve as a platform for a continued policy dialogue on a broadrange of issues
with key government counterparts.

C.       DEVELOPMENT IMPACT


55.      The solid performance of Vietnam in terms of economic growth, poverty reduction
and the attainment of other development objectives, suggests that the policy actions
supported through the PRSC process so far have beeneffective. Rapid development i s taking
place, and i s accompanied by reforms which will contribute to sustain it over time. The annual
growth rate of GDP increased by almost two percentage points between the beginning and the
end of the five-year period covered by this PRSC cycle. Growth i s leading to higher government
revenues, which are in turn being used to provide social services and assist laggard areas.
Poverty reduction could have been expected to slow down after the easier gains had been made,
but it actually accelerated in the second half of this period. Moreover, these impressive gains
appear to be sustainable. A current account deficit emerged, but it was financed mainly through
ODA and FDI. Inequality in expenditures has increased only modestly. While environmental
degradation i s a concern, sound policies are being put in place to manage natural resources and
control pollution. The fiduciary environment i s improving and a program i s inplace to bringit up
to international standards. A strong governance agenda i s leading to better planning processes,
more transparent public financial management, a simplification of administrative procedures and,
for the first time, a clear strategy inthe fight against corruption. Inmost of these areas, important
challenges remain. But it i s difficult to claim that Vietnam's progress i s "borrowed" on its future.

56.      While it is difficult to attribute success in the attainment of specific development
outcomes to particular policy actions under the PRSC process, the latter is likely making an
important contribution. A truly rigorous impact evaluation analysis cannot be conducted in
circumstances where no obvious counter-factual exists. While it is possible to describe what
happened in Vietnam during this period, assessments of what would have happened in the
absence of the policy actions supported through the PRSC process are to some extent
hypothetical.    However, an independent evaluation of budget support operations in seven
countries, conducted by a team at the University of Birmingham, was very positive in Vietnam's
case.   And a closer look at the mechanisms through which economic growth and poverty
reduction took place during this period suggests that those actions did play an important role in
practice. The evidence i s especially compelling inrelation to poverty reduction.


                                                   24

57.     Policy actions under the PRSC process contributed to the generalizationof market
mechanisms, a massive creation of wage employment and a strengthened delivery of public
services. These have been identified as the main drivers of poverty reduction inVietnam. Most
of the poor live in rural areas. The distribution of farm land to rural households, in the early
1990s, combined with stronger incentives for the commercialization of agricultural products,
rapidly raised incomes among the poor. While only 48 percent of the output by household farms
was sold to the market in 1998, the fraction had increased to 70 percent in2002. Integration with
the world economy, the development of banking credit, and the declining role of SOEs
contributed to this trend. The move from farming and self-employment to wage employment
represented another major contributionto household incomes. Wage employment increasedfrom
21 percent of total employment in 1998 to 32 percent in 2004. A more conducive environment
for the creation and formalization of domestic private enterprises and the attraction of massive
FDIinflows have made it possible to createjobs in a large scale and absorb large number of
entrants into the labor market.     Service delivery has also contributed to better health and
education outcomes, while local infrastructure has developed rapidly. By 2004, 93 percent of the
populationhad access to electricity, compared to 77 percent in 1998. These outcomes have been
made possible through sustained investment programs and increasingly effective inter-
government transfer mechanisms favoring the poorest provinces.

58.     The PRSC process has had a direct influence on the adoption of policy actions
conducive to higher economic growth and poverty reduction, rather than simply rewarding
policies that would have been adopted anyway.                While PRSCs have involved little
conditionality, and only inthe initial stages, it can be argued that the process followed to support
their preparation has contributed to the quality of economic policies. There has been agreement
among donors that this dialogue should focus on government actions meeting four criteria: they
have to be part of nationally-owned strategies and plans, including CPRGS; they have to be
grounded on solid economic analysis; they have to be strategic inimportance; and they have to be
defined in an unambiguous way. This focus has allowed to prioritize and to sequence the wide
range of policy initiatives considered inVietnamese development strategies and plans. The tight
deadlines resulting from the annual cycle for the delivery of PRSCs have also established an
incentive to complete the key policy actions in time. The discussion of those actions with the
relevant line ministries and government agencies has also nurtured a more systematic exchange of
draft documents for consultation and comments, and fostered a increased openness in the policy
makingprocess.

A.      ASSESSMENTOF TRIGGERS


59.     The assessment of triggers for the current operation points towards base-case lending.
The 15 triggers chosen for the preparation of PRSC 5, spelled out in the PRSC 4 program
document, were evenly distributed across the structural, social and governance areas of the
reform program (Table 6). These triggers should not be interpreted as conditions, and their
evaluation involves an element ofjudgment, inthe spirit of a "bottom-line" assessment.

60.      The proposed operation, while following up on policy measures and development
outcomes related to the triggers, also supports other actions in key policy areas (Table 7).
These actions further the reforms that had been implemented under previous PRSCs (Annex 2).
All of the 46 actions recognized by the proposed credit have been completed. Those taking the
form of policy measures have effectively been adopted, whereas those reflecting development
outcomes have been attained. Engaging in the policy dialogue around a relatively large number
of actions is justified in a reform program as comprehensive as that of Vietnam, covering 19
policy areas at once. However, as in the previous operation in the series, only a critically
strategic subset of actions (highlighted in bold) i s detailed in the FA. Fourteen of the critically
strategic prior actions were triggers for PRSC 5 or are directly related to those triggers. The one
trigger that did not translate into a prior action relates to the regulatory framework for provincial
infrastructure funds. Even though satisfactory progress has been achieved on this trigger, it was
felt that it could be further refined through continued policy dialogue and that it should be
includedas a prior action only after the regulations are finalized.



B.       TRANSITIONTO A MARKET ECONOMY


61.      A new Intellectual Property Law was passed by the National Assembly, consistent
with WTO requirements.             A number of Vietnam's trading partners have identified
strengthening the protection of intellectual property as a key factor for enhancing trade and
investment relations. Vietnam has stated that it will be incompliance with the TRIPS agreement
of the WTO upon accession. While the WT.0 requirements could have been met through
amending existing pieces of legislation, this approach would have had the disadvantage of
scattering the changes over many legal documents. The government i s currently taking steps to
remove overlaps between the responsibilities of different agencies in order to smooth the
implementation of the law and ensure its effective enforcement.

62.      A comprehensive roadmap for banking sector reform was issued through Prime
Minister's decision 112 of May 2006. The reform of the banking system entails fundamentally
re-writing the Law on Credit Institutions and the Law on the SBV. The issuance of the revised
laws, initially planned for 2010, has been brought forward to 2008 or earlier. The new laws will
be designed to transform the SBV into a modern central bank charged with executing monetary
policy and supervising the banking system.          They will also be shaped by the international
commitments that Vietnam takes on as part of WTO accession.                  At present, the SBV is
responsible for exercising the ownership (or shareholding) rights of the state in the SOCBs, a
function which conflicts with its role as supervisor of the same banks. Under the proposed
changes to the legal framework, the ownership role of the SBV i s to be eliminated. The
supervision functions of SBV will be separated from its management functions in relation to
SOCBs, and the operation of SOCBs on a commercialbasis will be ensured.

63.      The planned restructuring of the SBV will also see a reduction in the number of its
branches. Key functions of provincial offices will gradually be transferred to regional ones,
thereby containing the interference of provincial governments in the operations of the banking
system at the branch level. Such interference has limited the effectiveness of banking supervision
and rendered the control of policy lending less effective. The reformprogramwill also include a
transformation of central bank governance to clarify and enhance management and accountability
structures.

64.      The strengthening of banking supervision i s expected to happen intwo phases. Inthe first
one the banking supervision department of SBV will be upgraded. The focus of its activities will
mainly be on banks as they are likely to remain dominant players in the financial sector in the
medium term. In the second and longer-tern phase, an independent financial supervision board
will be established. The SBV has already undertakenmeasuresto begin upgrading its supervision
functions.    In October 2005, it initiated an assessment of its supervision practices against
international standards, the Base1Core Principles. The assessment i s scheduled for completion in
the first half of 2006 with the production of a comprehensive supervision development plan. It
has been stressed that the pace of reform will be tailored to the human resource capacities within
the SBV and the SOCBs. As the envisaged changes are fundamental in nature, they will need to
be accompanied by an equally major development of human resources and a realignment of the
incentives structure to the objectives of the institutions.

65.      The organizational and financial restructuring of SOCBs to support their
commercial orientation is to happen alongside the opening up of their capital. All SOCBs
are due to be equitized by 2010.         The process has been set in motion for two of them.
Vietcombank has already sold convertible bonds worth 1.36 trillion dong to boost its capital
before equitization. Share sales are to take place through auction at the securities exchange and
will begin towards the end of 2006 or in early 2007. MHB will be equitized with a strategic
investor. The state's shareholding in these two banks i s to be gradually reduced: to no less than
70 percent by end-2006 and eventually to 51 percent by 2010. Under current regulations total
foreign holding of shares will be limited to 30 percent with a single institutional investor allowed
to hold a maximum of 10percent. But these limits, especially the latter may be revised upwards
to accommodate strategic investors. The valuation of both banks i s to be conducted through
reputedexternal advisors selectedthrough a competitive process. The external advisors will also
help in selecting strategic investors.

66.      SOEs have been classified according to their performance. Decision 271 set up a
mechanism to monitor SOE performance and apply sanctions in the case of consistently poor
performance. SOEs are to be classified into one of three groups (A, B, or C) based on four
criteria: turnover, profitability, solvency and compliance with laws and regulations. For the first
three criteria, quantitative benchmarks are established, so that SOEs with a strong performance
are classified as A whereas those with a weak performance are rated C. These four criteria are
combined into a single ranking. Only those SOEs with a strong performance in all four criteria
are ranked as A, whereas weak performance on any single indicator leads to a C ranking.
Enterprises ranked as C for two consecutive years are in principle subject to reorganization,
including changes in management. Until recently, few SOEs had complied with the reporting
requirements under Decision 271 and government agencies in charge had not made serious
enforcement efforts.      But over 2005 and early 2006, the MOF compiled reports on the
performance of most SOEs during 2004, and i s now conducting an in-depth evaluation of the
reliability of those reports (Table 8). Meanwhile, an application of the three quantitative criteria
of Decision 271 to individual SOE records from the enterprise census yields a similar ranking.
More SOEs are classified as B when usingcensus data, compared to Decision 271. But few large
SOEs fall inthe C category, and overall solvency appears better than i s usually assumed, in spite
of cautious assumptions regardingthe valuation of assets. While the implementation of Decision
271needs to be strengthened, preliminary results for 2004 are encouraging.

67.      The new Enterprise Law paves the way for equal treatment of firms, regardless of
ownership. Under the new Law which will be effective from July 1, 2006, domestic and foreign
enterprises will be governed by the same corporate legislation. Foreign enterprises will be
subject to the same registrationprocedures as domestic firms, and will be able to choose the form


                                                  33

of corporate entity that i s most suitable on businessgrounds. At present, they are only allowed to
operate as limited liability companies. Foreignenterprises will be allowed to restructure, expand,
or diversify their business rather than being limited to the specific lines in which their business
was initiated. Alongside the Enterprise Law a new Investment Law has also been issued which
introduces a common investment regime for domestic and foreign investors.                     It opens the
possibility of foreign investment into a wider range of sectors, and also makes Vietnam's
investment policies consistent with current and prospective international commitments.

Note:    MOF for Decision 271 and World Bank staff estimates based on GSO data for the enterprise
         census. The census does not allow implementing the fourth criterion in Decision 271, related to     I


         compliance with laws and regulations. The solvency criterion is implemented by comparing total
         liabilities with the sum of liquidassets and the present value of future profits (assuming constant
         profits over time and a real interest rate of 10.7 percent per year). Some of the largest General
         Corporations (GCs) are not included inthe census data.




68.      The new Enterprise Law also requires that all SOEs be transformed into limited liability
companies or joint stock companies within a period of four years. Under these corporate forms
the SOEs will move under the corporate governance models of the new law alongside private
enterprises, rather than be governed by a separate law as at present. The law also provides for
principles to guide the exercise of ownership rights by the state. These should provide
significantly greater autonomy to the transformed enterprises indefining their business strategies,
and making investment and personnel-related decisions. At present business decisions are often
directed by line ministries or provinces, often ininconsistent ways.

69.      Seven decrees are currently being drafted to provide guidelines for implementing the two
laws. The content of these decrees will greatly shape the investment climate in Vietnam in the
coming years. For the Enterprise Law these include regulations governing the re-registration of
foreign investedenterprises, as well as for SOE transformations. Under the Investment Law, one
of the decrees being drafted governs build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, considered crucial for
attracting private participation inthe infrastructure sectors. As with the two laws themselves, the
government has followed a consultative drafting process involving domestic and foreign
businesses, as well as donors.



C.       SOCIALINCLUSIONAND ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITY


70.      Regulations for inclusive education for children living with disabilities have been
issued, aimingfor equal access to education services. The regulations apply to all educational
institutions in the public education system. The preparation of these regulations i s the result of
effective coordination among ministries such as the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET),
Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA),
and agencies dealing with child protection. The regulations address the special needs of children
living with disabilities in terms of classrooms, school facilities, equipment, and textbooks.
Individual education plans will be prepared with materials and methodological designs tailored to
their special requirements. The regulations allow for educational institutions to hire specialized
staff and helpers, and entitle them to make investments infacilities and equipment which meet the
special needs of children living with disabilities. Inclusive education staff will be entitled to
training and refresher courses and to reduced norms for teaching hours. Early intervention is
promoted by the regulations in order to minimize disability-caused constraints. People living
with disabilities will also be given priority in entrance exams for vocational secondary schools
and institutions providing continuing and higher education services.

71.      A sustained effort is under way to raise the quality of primary schools nationwide,
with an emphasis on schools inpoorer areas. A baseline assessment of compliance with FSQL
standards, nationwide, had been compiled at the end of the school year ending in 2004. The
annual audit conducted one year later allowed assessing the progress accomplished.             The
comparison, finalized at the end of 2005, showed that the average FSQL ratio, across all the
quality indicators considered, had increased from 62.1 to 66.1, out of a maximum of 100. This
represents an annual increase by 6.4 percent inthe average FSQL index. A subsequent analysis,
combining the results of the FSQL audits with a poverty map, showed that gains were more
important inpoorer districts (Table 9).

72.      A larger, increasingly diversified and decentralized education system has made sector
governance, planning and budgeting more complex. The on-going work on the education sector
MTEF and provincial planning is aimed at rationalizing the planning and budgeting processes.
These tools reinforce the roles of different stakeholders in sector governance: the Ministry of
Planning and Investment (MPI) for the provision of a clear economic framework for planning;
MOF for integrating planning and deployment of resources, and balancing sectoral spending;
MOET for a sector stewardship role in setting and guaranteeing service quality and facilitating
provinces to achieve national objectives; the provinces for integrating investment and recurrent
fundingfor school systemoperations, andbeingaccountable for sector output and outcomes.

73.      The financing of healthcare for the poor and near-poor has been considerably
strengthened. Politburo Resolution 46 of February 2005 urged the government to finance
curative care for the poor, children under the age of six and other social policy beneficiaries, in
order to create a "springboard" for upgrading health care andto advance towards universal health
insuranceby 2010. These aspects of the Resolution were operationalizedby Decree63 on health
insurance, in effect from July 1, 2005. The Decree represents a key step in shifting from the
direct funding of health care providers to demand-side funding. It mandates compulsory health
insurance(HI)for several groups, including workers on fixed term contracts of three months and
above, pensioners, children under the age of six and beneficiaries under Decision 139 on the
provision of health care to the poor. Health services can be received from public or private
providers as long as they are contracted by Vietnam Social Insurance (VSI). Compulsory HI
holders will be entitled to both in-patient and out-patient services. Transportation costs will be
covered incase of referral for the poor and those inremote areas. Voluntary HIi s available to all,
including those under compulsory HIwho wish to obtain a higher coverage. VSI is the agency
in-charge of the implementation of the health insurance policy. M O H will issue technical
standards against which VSI will assess and contract providers. MOH and MOF will provide
guidance on the management of insurance funds. M O H will deal with complaints relating to
healthcare, while MOF will deal with complaints on fundmanagement.

74.      At the same time Decision 139 is beingrevised to expandthe number of householdswho
are eligible for benefits. The new, substantially higher poverty line will be employed to define
poor households. Such households will be entitled to compulsory HIwith a premium of 60,000
dong provided by the state budget. Near-poor householdswith an income levelof up to 1.5 times
the poverty line will be provided a subsidy to enroll in the voluntary HIscheme. In addition to
these budgetary outlays, provincial HCFPs will support treatment costs, not covered by
compulsory HI, up to a maximum of 10 million dong per hospital stay. For the near poor these
funds will provide supportto cover catastrophic illnesses.

75.      Program 135 has been revised to more effectively support the development of
communes facing extreme hardshipinethnic minority and mountainous areas. Program 135
i s one of the National Targeted Programs (NTPs) that Vietnam employs to ensure that national



                                                   36

goals are met in the context of increasing decentralization. Under the program, which was first
approved in 1998, communes receive a resource allocation that i s most often used to develop
local infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation systems, schools and health centers. Seven years of
implementation have seen both successes and shortcomings of the program. The revision to the
design, components, and procedures of the program builds on the success and addresses the
shortcomings. The main objective of the program i s to eliminate food poverty and achieve a
poverty rate of less than 30 percent in the selectedcommunes by 2010, thereby also reducing the
widening poverty gap between ethnic minorities living inremote areas and the rest of the country.
Inits secondphase the program is better targeted. Inthe past only the poorest communes were
targeted, but now the aim i s to reach the poorest and most remote villages within the poorest
(Zone 3) and less poor (Zone 2) communes. This should also help inreaching a higher proportion
of remote ethnic minority communities.        The budget allocation for agriculture and forestry
extension and support has been considerably increased, from around 3-4 percent to around 20
percent. This reflects the recognition that infrastructure investments alone were not enough to
reduce poverty among ethnic minorities and that greater effort was needed to improve their
livelihood opportunities. The allocation for operation and maintenance of infrastructure has also
been raised to about 10percent. This will enable a reduction inthe burden of local contributions
borne by already poor communes. The revised program will devolve greater control over
investment decisions to commune (and even village) level, with measures to increase
participation and capacity in scheme selection, siting, technical design and construction
supervision. Increased effort will be devoted to promoting public access to information as a key
tool inachieving greater transparency and accountability.

76.      Land registration offices (LROs) have been set up in nearly all provinces in
compliance with the 2003 Land Law. A major shortcoming of land management in Vietnam
has been the lack of an effective land registration system. One of the significant changes
introduced by the new LandLaw i s to address this deficiency through the creation of LROs. The
law requires such offices are to be set up at the provincial level and, if deemed necessary on the
basis of demand, at district level as well. B y April 2006 LROs had been set up in 62 out of 64
provinces, and in 20 percent of the high-demand districts. Fifty of the 62 offices have received
land records that were previously maintained by the Departments of Natural Resources and the
Environment (DONRE), and the process of transferring the records i s to be completed by June
2006. LROs are responsible for registering all land transactions, managing land files, and
carrying out land-related administrative formalities. Decree 181empowers the offices to provide
information on land to any land user to promote transparency inland transactions.

77.      The second National Targeted Program (NTP 11) on Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (2006-2010) has been submitted for approval, assigning clearer responsibilities
for its implementation. Perhaps the only MDGwhere Vietnam has not advanced well relates to
rural water and sanitation, with weaker progress on the sanitation front. A recent joint
government-donor review pointed to a fragmentation and a lack of coordination betweendifferent
ministries involved in the sector. Among other objectives, the new NTP seeks to address this
shortcoming, by assigning clearer responsibilities.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD)will performthe state management functions and will be the main agency
inchargeof coordinating, monitoring and supervising the implementation of the NTP11. Within
MARD the lead will be taken by the Department of Water Resources. MOH will produce
guidelines for the provision of clean water, the construction of household level sanitation
facilities, and personal hygiene. It will also be in-charge of monitoring water quality in rural
areas. MOET will monitor water supply, sanitation, and hygiene in schools. MONRE will be
responsible for addressing issues related to the pollution of water resources, including in craft
villages. NTP I1improves upon the earlier program by strengthening community participation


                                                  37

and upgrading the mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. Specific indicators have been
defined and responsibilities have been allocated at the commune, district, provincial, and central
levels for collecting and managing information. The program also seeks to accelerate the
decentralization process to ensure a more active role for provinces in planning, implementation,
and management of water supply and sanitation facilities. NTP I1also recognizes the weaker
achievement on sanitation, and proposes both technological solutions as well as an enhanced role
for households and communities inthe provision of sanitation facilities.

78.     Economic tools for environmental protection have been developed and strategic
environmental assessments have been piloted. The Law on Environmental Protection (LEP)
will take effect from July 1, 2006. The law includes provisions for adoption of "polluter pays"
measures; for instance for waste discharge into water bodies and the disposal of hazardous
wastes. The law also foresees payments for natural resources use and rehabilitation, and reliance
on environmental protection funds. The LEP also improves the requirements for Environmental
Impact Assessments (EIA) and introduces a requirement for Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment
(SEA) of sectoral andregional development plans.

79.     The first decree to guide the implementation of the LEPhas been prepared. It focuses on
the application of national environmental standards, responsibilities for hazardous waste
management, and the procedures for EIA and SEA application. MONRE has also further
developed the regulations to implement Decree 67, on Environmental Protection Charges for
Waste Water, which will enable improved control of water pollution. The draft Circular on
Wastewater Pollution Coefficients, identifying the volume of pollutants in industrial waste water
as a basis for fees to be levied under Decree 67, was submitted inApril 2006, and i s expected to
come into force inearly July 2006.

80.     The government has also adopted provisions for undertaking SEAS to improve the
integration of measures for environment protection into strategies, plans, and programs. Such
"upstream" environmental analyses take place "above" the project level. They represent an
important step for Vietnam, at a stage of rapid economic growthand massive public investment in
infrastructure, when large cumulative impacts at the regional and landscape levels can be
expected. Two SEA pilots were carried out on socio-economic development plans, one for H a
Tay province and the other for Dai Tu District, to promote sustainable development and
management of the Tam Dao National Park and its buffer zone. Two additional SEA pilots are
underway, one for the Vung Tau port development plan, and the other for EVN's hydropower
masterplan, focusing on biodiversity impacts and programlevelmitigation.

81.     The National Council on Sustainable Development was established in September 2005
pursuant to Decision 1032. The Council will assist the Prime Minister in implementing the
Strategic Orientation for Sustainable Development. Among other tasks, the Council will organize
cross-sectoral and cross-regional activities related to sustainable development programs, and
support line ministries to develop such programs.



D.      BUILDINGMODERNGOVERNANCE


82.     The government has issuedits SEDP 2006-2010 based on broad consultation, with a
poverty focus, and is developing a mechanism to monitor its implementation. The SEDP has
been built on extensive consultations not only within government but also with a broader range of



                                                38

stakeholders (including mass organizations, academics, the private sector, civil society and
development partners). The National Assembly discussed the draft SEDP in its November 2005
session and will formally adopt it duringits current session. The SEDP received the endorsement
of the Party Congress in April 2006.         The document represents considerable progress in
developing an outcome-focused, medium-term plan, which combines the twin objectives of
economic growth and social inclusion, and describes the reforms that will ensure sustainability in
the long run. Importantly, the document explicitly recognizes the institutional and regulatory
challenges associated with completing the transition to a market economy. It describes a large
number of planned legislative actions which, together with the reform agenda implied in the
accession to WTO, will strongly support this transition. The SEDP should thus serve as a
framework to allocate public resources over the medium term and as a mechanism to align donor
support to national priorities. A monitoring and evaluation system for the implementation of
SEDP has also beendeveloped, and i s being finalized.

83.     New regulations have been issued to strengthen the delivery of public services
through improved monitoring, the introduction of user feedback, and limits on salary
expenditure. B y allowing public service delivery unitsto charge fees, the earlier Decree 10, had
introduced powerful incentives to improve quality. However, there were indications that the
provision of basic services to be provided free of charge, or at low prices established by
government regulations, had suffered as a result of such incentives. Moreover, many service
delivery units face limited competition at the local level.          Because Decree 10 allowed
considerable flexibility to use revenue from fees to pay higher salaries, there was also an
incentive to charge excessively highprices for services. The new regulation, Decree 43, makes it
compulsory for service delivery units to set aside 25 percent of their net revenues to improve
service quality, thereby limiting the amount available for salary increments. Decree 43 also
includes salary caps that are inversely related to amount of financial support received from the
government budget. The decree requires that performance standards be set for service delivery
unitsunder guidelines provided by the responsible line ministry. The criteria to evaluate service
delivery units will include workload, quality of the service, time taken to provide the service, and
compliance with relevant regulations. Monitoring and evaluation i s to be conducted not only by
the line ministries, but also by relevant state inspection and audit agencies. The decree also
introduces mechanisms for eliciting feedback from service users that go beyond "mailboxes" to
potentially include instruments such as "citizens' report card" surveys.

84.     The circular guiding the preparation of the 2006 budget took an important step
towards preparing the government budget within a medium-term framework. While the
submission and approval of the budget by the National Assembly will continue to be done on an
annual basis, line ministries and provincial governments were asked to prepare a budget
framework for the period 2006-2010, based on the SEDP. The reference to a five-year period
should be conducive to a better integration between capital and recurrent budgets. It should also
help ministries and provinces to prepare more realistic plans, to better prioritize their spending,
and to improve the overall efficiency of public expenditures. The draft circular for the 2007
budget also includes instructions to line ministries and provinces to align budget submissions to
the SEDP over the next three-year period.

85.     Action plans for simplification and greater transparency of administrative
procedures are being implemented by several ministries and provinces. Prime Minister's
Directive 09 instructed ministries, government agencies, and provinces to conduct a review of
existing procedures with a view towards reducing bureaucracy and red tape. By the end of 2005,
17 ministries, five government agencies and 26 provincial people's committees had submitted
actions plans to implement new, simplified administrative procedures. Progress has been made in


                                                 39

areas such as birth, death, and marriage records; notary services; residential registration permits;
business registration and related licenses; LUCs; and customs and tax procedures. Inthe case of
business registration, investment licenses, and construction permits processing times have
generally come down to 7-to-10 days and even 3-to-5 days in some cases.

86.     A law oncorruption preventionandcontrol was passedby the National Assemblyin
November 2005, and will take effect inJune 2006. InFebruary 2006 the Prime Minister issued
an action plan delineating the roles of various ministries and agencies in ensuring its effective
implementation of the law. The law was drafted in parallel with the preparation of the first
comprehensive diagnostic study on corruption in Vietnam. It includes chapters on corruption
prevention and detection, handling of corruption, organizations and mechanisms for investigation,
prosecution andjudicial agencies in anti-corruption, role of society and media inanti-corruption,
international cooperation in anti-corruption, and implementation provisions. The law i s thus
more comprehensive than a typical anti-corruption legislation.      This comprehensiveness also
translates into implementationchallenges.

87.     The main initiatives introduced for fighting and controlling corruption include increased
public disclosure and transparency in areas such as public procurement, civil works, management
and equitization of SOEs, auditing of the state budget, management and use of land, and
personnel management. The law specifies the contents and modalities of such disclosure. It also
provides individuals with the right to request for information from specified bodies, such as
People's Committees. The law strengthens the accountability of heads of organizations and
agencies by specifying that they shall be responsible for corruption occurring inside the entities
under their management and authority.        Greater simplification of administrative procedures,
including increased reliance on electronic interfaces, i s another tool for preventing corruption.
The government will also specify and regulate transactions that must be settled through the
banking system. The law encourages "whistle-blowing" by the public and other agencies, and the
rewarding of such actions.

88.     A key provision of the law relates to the compulsory declaration of assets and income of
state employees. The broader definition of the "declarer", so as to include "spouses and children
in the same residential certificate", is commendable. A separate decree will be prepared by the
Government Inspectorate to guide the implementation of this provision.               A widespread
application of asset declaration in the initial period could risk overwhelming the capacity of
inspectors, thereby diluting its efficacy. To ensure its effectiveness a phased approach could be
employed, for instance, by piloting asset declaration inthe most corruption-prone agencies or for
high-ranking public officials. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), in coordination with
MOF and SBV, has beentasked to prepare a plan on monitoring incomes of officials of high-rank
or holding a position of power.

89.     Strategies for strengthening the legal andjudiciary systems have been approved by
the Politburo. Both strategies have been made public and shared widely. The LSDS i s a broad-
ranging document which seeks to build legal institutions and systems that will ensure the rule of
law. The Judicial Reform Strategy (JRS) to 2020 i s regarded as an important complement to the
LSDS. The JRS seeks to improve criminal and civil policy and legislation in line with the
transition to a market economy. It aims at reducing prison sentences considered excessively high,
as well as increasing the use of financial penalties and non-custodial measures rather than
imprisonment. The categories of officials who have the authority to make decisions on the
application of detention measures will be narrowed. The court system will be reorganized to
make courts jurisdiction-based compared to their existinggeographicalaffiliations.

                          VI.     POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS



90.      Special attention was devoted by the PRSC process to the mitigation of potentially
adverse effects of economic reforms. While these reforms hold the key to foster economic
growth and accelerate poverty reduction, adverse effects are possible in at least three areas. A
more developed land market should increase agricultural efficiency, but could also make it easier
for poor farmers to lose their land in the event of a bad shock. Similarly, in a more open
economy, the least competitive sectors (and especially SOEs) could be forced to shed workers in
large numbers. And even perfect markets could be unable to address environmental externalities,
so that rapid growth could lead to increasing pollution and degradation. To assess the risks in
these areas, and design possible counter-measures, the PRSC process was supplemented, since its
inception, by a series of analytical activities ineach of these three areas.

91.      The initial allocation of agricultural land to rural households, in the late 1980s and early
199Os, was remarkably egalitarian. A privatization process of such a massive scale could have
been vulnerable to capture by local authorities, especially given that land was Vietnam's most
valuable asset at the time. And yet, there i s evidence that the annual land allocated by communes
was distributed quite uniformly across households.          Even in the case of residential land,
allocations were conducted fairly, on the basis of need. Only inthe case of perennial and forestry
land was the initial allocation unequal. But distributing land on an egalitarian basis i s not
necessarily good for efficiency. If more of it had gone to the most productive (presumably
wealthier) households, the overall productivity of agriculture would have been higher. B y one
estimate, total household income ended up being 5 percent lower than an efficiency-oriented
allocation of land would have allowed.

92.      As a land market develops, less productive (presumably poorer) households could
gradually be forced to sell some of the land they received, while more productive households
would stand a chance to acquire more land. So far, however, the total volume of land
transactions remains relatively small. Based on household survey data, only 8.3 percent of
households have bought land during the last decade, and a meager 2.7 percent sold any.
Moreover, landlessness i s not necessarily associated with poverty. InVietnam the poor are the
least likely to be landless, and households at middle levels of consumption are the most likely.
This is becausemany families moving out of poverty also moved out of farming. It is estimated
that roughly three quarters of the overall increase in landlessness over the last decade was due to
falling poverty. The trend appears to become stronger over time.

93.      There are notable regional differences, however, with the Mekong delta standing out as
the exception to the general pattern. There, signs of polarization are emerging, with higher
landlessness being more common among the poor. The Central Highlands display a different
pattern too, due to the policies adopted after reunification, to facilitate the migration of people of
the Kinh ethnic majority into the region. In the process the native hill-tribe people became a
minority group. Rapid creation of wage employment i s necessary for the involuntarily landless
households in the Mekong delta to protect their living standards. In the Central Highlands, the
main policy responsei s to protect ethnic minorities from the encroachment of their land.

94.      The restructuringand equitization of SOEs could lead to large job losses, especially
as economic integration faces them with increased competition. In preparation for the first



                                                  41

  PRSC operation inthe cycle, a series of studies were conducted on the extent of labor redundancy
  inthe state sector, andthe overall loss inwellbeing SOEworkers couldexperience inthe event of
  job loss. Based on the findings of these studies, a SSN for redundant SOE workers was set up
  under PRSC 1. This fund has been in operation for three years, with its size being scaled up as
  the equitization process accelerated. The fundhas assistedmore than 120,000 workers so far, and
  will have helped a quarter of million of them over its life span. The severance pay package made
  available to those who lose their jobs i s roughly commensurate with the loss in earning and
  wellbeing they experience. Its design has paid particular attention to female workers, who stand
  to lose more from separation. This has resulted in relatively high levels of satisfaction with the
  assistance received, as revealed by two tracer surveys of retrenched workers. Satisfaction has
  been higher among female and old workers. The tracer surveys have also revealed a relatively
  successful re-insertion in the labor market over time, although unemployment rates remain
  higher, and salariedjobs less common, than among comparable workers.

  95.      Changes in the sectoral composition of output as Vietnam further integrates with
  the world economy could also have adverse effects on employment. At an aggregate level,
  global integration should lead to faster economic growth and an overall increase in labor demand.
  But the process may entail bothjob creation inthe sectors expanding andjob destruction in the
  ones contracting. A flexible labor market, like that of Vietnam, should reduce the social cost of
  this kindofjob churning. Indeed, workers who are retrenchedby one employer can hope to get
  work with a different one within a short period of time. Butjobs are not all equal; for instance in
  terms of their access to social insurance. Churningmight thus be associated with some workers
  losing "good" formal sectorjobs and ending up inthe informal sector.

  96.     Unfortunately, knowing in advance which sectors may contract i s not easy. Consider
  accession to the WTO. The commitments made throughout the process involve an array of
  changes in the level of trade barriers, the extent of competition in services, and the overall
  operation of markets. A recent assessment of the potential impacts of WTO accession pooled the
  findings of two dozen studies conducted on Vietnam's integration process, to infer the common
  patterns. Such studies were based on either computable general equilibrium models or sectoral
  analyses. Some regularities emerged from this exercise, especially under the form of a strong
  expansion in textile and garments, in trade and freight, in petroleum and lubricants, and in paper
~ products. However, the regularities were not really robust. And the predicted impacts onpoverty
  and inequality were both small inmagnitude and ambiguous insign.

  97.      The reform of the state sector could potentially lead to the emergence of hidden
  environmental liabilities. As SOEs are gradually equitized, restructured, or managed more
  efficiently, their older ways of handling pollution and natural resource degradation are bound to
  become more "visible", and increasingly more unacceptable. Who will bear responsibility to
  control such pollution and redress the inherited misdoings i s an open question. The second
  important issue i s related to the growth pattern of an economy that becomes more globally
  integrated. The comparative advantages of Vietnam could favor the growth of sectors which are
  more intensive in water or toxic pollution. And low environmental standards could also attract
  foreign investors to those sectors, inthe expectationof operating at lower costs than elsewhere.

  98.     The sector with potentially largest environmental liabilities i s coal. An operational review
  of four SOEs affiliated with Vinacoal, reveals poor standards in areas such as mine water
  discharge, dust emissions, and waste dump rehabilitation inopen-cut mines. Two mines discharge
  water that is clearly in the acid range. And their waste dump areas, some of them directly facing
  Halong bay, have been subject to little or no rehabilitation work. The quality of dust management
  i s uneven too. Near major buildings, around the coal preparation plants and on major internal



                                                  42

roads, the level of housekeeping i s good, with these areas generally being clear of dust and
rubbish. Trucks and fixed sprays are used to apply water to internal roadways and stockpiles,
thus limiting the amount of dust. But a build-upof fine coal, which can be a significant source of
dust, is noticeable around train tracks androads.

99.      However, there are also indications of good practice.          In one mine, a wastewater
management system was introducedin2000. It includes 16settling ponds, where water i s treated
to remove all solids, to be then returned with make-up water for re-use in the coal preparation
facility. Thanks to this system, water i s now re-circulated in a closed circuit and no longer
discharged to sea. Environmental monitoring i s conducted at 27 nominated sites. Weather, dust
levels and noise are recorded at most locations; vibration, water quality and hazardous gases are
checked only at selectedones. Monitoring i s conducted four times per year, as a spot check, by a
Hanoi-based privatecompany.

100.     As for the environmental impacts of global integration, and of economic reforms more
broadly, they can be divided into three main components. The first one refers to the way trade
patterns affect the overall scale of the economy; the second one, to the way they influence the
techniques of production; and the third one, to their impact on the sectoral composition of output.
Experience elsewhere suggests that the third effect i s in practice the most important one.
Integration into the world economy can substantially modify the specialization pattern of a
country.     Expanding the production of more pollution-intensive goods leads to dirtier
environments. Whether this i s actually happening in Vietnam i s unclear. This calls for a
strengthening of environmental policies across the board, a direction the PRSC process has
strongly supported, especially through the most recent operations.

101.     Based on a systematic review of the available evidence, the foreseeable adverse
effects do not appear to be large; except maybe for the environment. This calls for a more
systematic use of enforceable environmental standards. But potentially larger social impacts
might simply be unforeseeable with the relatively rudimentary analytical tools at hand. It is
therefore important to put in place effective mechanisms to rapidly cope with the unforeseen.
Assistance to ailing firms shouldnot be one of them. Notjust because it i s restrictedunder WTO
rules, but also because it could lead to rent seeking and disguised protectionism. Assistance to
workers who lose their jobs bears more potential, as shown by the successful safety net for
redundant SOE workers. But large-scale mitigation policies will require budget transfers, from
the provinces benefitingthe most from economic reforms to those adversely hit. Transfers of this
sort would not damage efficiency, and could do much to protect social inclusion in a context of
rapid economic growth.

102.     To address the risks from further integration with the world economy, and rapidly adopt
complementary measures if needed, the government i s currently preparing to set up a technical
unitincharge of coordinating all activities relatedto WTO accession. This unit is expected to be
located under the Office of Government (OOG) and i s to be backed up by the authority of senior
leadership.   The Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences (VASS), which coordinated the
technical studies conducted in support of the WTO negotiations, i s actively contributing to spell
out the analytical and policy agenda of this technical unit. VASS has also been the focal point for
the studies on possible social impacts of WTO accession. Its participation in the set up of this
technical unit ensures a welcome continuity between the negotiation and the implementation
phases, ensuring that the lessons learned and risks identified are not lost to policy makers.

                             VII.   OTHERCREDITFEATURES



A.       STEERINGAND MONITORING


103.     The National Steering Committee for the implementation of the CPRGS and PRSCs
(NSC) was established in 2002. It i s chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister, Nguyen Tan
Dung, and brings together the heads of all the relevant line ministries and government agencies.
SBV i s assigned as the agency responsible, in close collaboration with the World Bank, for
preparation and implementation of PRSCs. A Deputy Governor of SBV acts as Standing Vice
Chairman of the NSC. This quasi-advisory body has several representatives from key economic
ministries and agencies, such as MOF, the Ministry of Trade (MOT), SBV, MOLISA, the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), MARD,MOET and MOH, among others. Members of the NSC thus
have authority over the entire range of policy areas covered by the PRSC process.           The
participation of OOG and the Party's Economic Commission (PEC) in the NSC also allow for a
better coordination of policy decisions, and to elicit sufficient support for the most critical
reforms. Representatives from a total of more than 20 line ministries and government agencies
participatedinthe preparation of the proposed credit.

104.     Given the intensive and cbmplex coordination that i s required to manage this very
comprehensive reform program, SBV has created a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) with
dedicated staff from SBV. The PCU has helped facilitate the policy dialogue of the World Bank
and donors with line ministries. The DFIDand Switzerland (seco) provided financial support for
the PCUduringthe preparation of PRSC 4 and 5.

105.    An inter-ministerial working group and a secretariat to implement and monitor the
CPRGS have also been established at MPI. The inter-ministerial working group includes
representatives from key economic ministries, such as MOF, MOT, SBV, OOG, PEC, MOLISA,
MOJ, MARD, MOET, and MOH, among others.                 Three Annual Progress Reports on the
implementation of the CPRGS have been prepared by the CPRGS secretariat under the guidance
of the inter-ministerial working group. Among the goals of the inter-ministerial working group i s
the implementation of CPRGS at sub-national levels. The CPRGS Secretariat at MPI supports
provincial governments inadapting the CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans and
budgets accordingly. Since 2003, 20 provinces have initiated this process, with financial support
from donors. The integration of the CPRGS approach into the preparationof the next SEDP at all
levels amounts to scaling up the process nationwide, this time under clear planning guidelines
fromMPI.

106.    The use of reliable information and analysis in policy making has improved steadily over
the PRSC process. Over the current cycle of PRSCs, the government has made efforts to improve
the quality of data that can be used for monitoring PRSC outcomes. Key sources of monitoring
information for poverty and program outcomes include the biennial VHLSSs, periodic
participatory poverty assessments and local consultations, enterprise surveys, public expenditure
tracking surveys, as well as the progress reports from the relevant sector ministries and
committees implementing the reform program. In addition, the strengthening of management
information systems for SOEs and for all public spending, both led by MOF, i s an integral part of
the PRSC program. Effortsto implement CPRGS at the provincial level rely on the development
of appropriate monitoring indicators as well. While the number of indicators presented in the
CPRGS i s much larger, these have been reduced to about 40 for monitoring PRSC outcomes at
the provincial level. Many of the indicators in this narrower set will be generated using the


                                               44

household living standard surveys that are being conducted biennially from 2002 onwards. At
present, work i s underway to define a set of indicators needed to monitor progress in the
implementation of the next SEDP.



B.      ADMINISTRATION


107.    Borrowerand Credit Amount. The Borrower is the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and
this operation is a one-tranche Credit of US$ 100millionequivalent that would be made available
upon credit effectiveness.

108.    Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA). The recent integrated Public
Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-FA) reviewed the accounting and
reporting processesinthe public sector, the oversight functions inthe public sector, and financial
reporting and auditing in SOEs. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management
budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing systems of government are assessedas moderate.

109.    The PER-FA identifies areas for continued improvement. Key areas to be addressed
include unifying budget classification and accounting to ensure effective and consistent
budgeting, accounting and reporting across all sectors of government; streamlining the internal
control framework and public expenditure accounting processes,                 strengthening asset
management, establishing public sector accounting standards inline with international standards,
improving financial management reporting and use of reporting for management control,
establishing an effective internal audit review function as part of the internal control regime, and
strengthening the effectiveness of the SAV.             The implementation of the PER-FA
recommendations i s being supported by the PRSCprogramand grant funds.

110.    The PER-IFA also recognizes the recent changes to improve transparency and
accountability in Vietnam.     Among the most recent ones are the audit law and new anti-
corruption law passed by the National Assembly in May and December 2005 respectively. The
audit law significantly enhances oversight by the National Assembly and the provincialPeople's
Councils over public finances, and also increases public access to information on government
finances. The new Anti-Corruption Law reflects strong commitment to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency in using budgetary funds, including ODA. The MOF and MPI are working with
other ministries to review and strengthen management and use of budgetary and other funds. The
data management, financial reporting, and internal control system of the SBV are also expected to
be further improved through a planned IDA credit, inFY08. The preparationfor implementation
of the Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS) over the next few years
will improve public financial management and will assist in establishing an integrated financial
management system in Vietnam.        Implementation of the computerized system i s planned for
2008-2009.

111.    Public Procurement. Nationwide open competitive biddinginpublic procurement was
introduced in 1996. This system was improved in 1999, by the introduction of the concept of the
"responsive lowest evaluated bid." Decree 66/2003/CP of June 2003, adopted under PRSC 3,
established a department of public procurement and strengthened the procurement process by
mandating standard bidding documents (SBDs) and publication of bidding opportunities in the
Public Procurement Bulletin. The SBDs for procurement of goods were issued in September
2005. The SBDs will promote consistency in the application of procurement regulations. In



                                                 45

April 2005, the government also put into use the paper version of a Public Procurement Bulletin,
which i s now proposed to be upgraded to the level of a Procurement Newspaper, and an e-
procurement bulletidwebsite has also been established. The Government has substantially
unified and elevated the legislative framework for public procurement by passing a new
Procurement Law instead of the originally expected Procurement Ordinance. A decree for
implementing the new law i s at an advanced stage of preparation and i s planned to be issued
shortly.    The Procurement Law, which became effective on April 1, 2006, retains the
improvements of the earlier decrees and introduces some further improvements over previous
legislation, most notably the establishment of a complaint handling mechanism, albeit not yet
fully independent, provisions against conflicts of interest, clearer remedies for dealing with fraud
and corruption and removing the previous requirement for mandatory joint ventures between
foreign and local firms biddingon public contracts. However, it will be important to restrict the
use of lesser competitive methods such as direct contracting and limited bidding, as well as the
use of merit point systems in the evaluation of bids for goods and works. Another area to be
addressed i s the prevention of collusive practices in public procurement, particularly common
place at the local level.

112.     Fiduciaryarrangements. Since the IMFdoes not currently have a program inVietnam
it is not possible to rely on its assessment of the control environment of the SBV. However, the
enactment of the Audit Law of 2005 will assist in addressing the issues related to audit and
accounting arrangements. The audit law has established the SAV as an independent institution
reporting the National Assembly with the Auditor General being appointed and dismissed by the
National Assembly. Audit reports will be made public. The SBV will also be subject to annual
auditing and disclosure of the audit reports..

113.     To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control environment, the Borrower
will maintain a dedicated foreign currency deposit account (DA) for the proceeds of the Credit,
and will report on the funds flow of the dedicated DA. The Government will, if considered
necessary by the International Development Association (IDA), allow an independent external
audit of the dedicated foreign currency DA.

114.     Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The Credit will follow the
IDAdisbursement procedures for development policy lending operations, and the Credit proceeds
will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions. Various measures have
been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to proceed
with support from IDA and other development partners. The analytical underpinnings for the
operation are complete: (i)    the cross-cutting assessment of the country's development policies
(social, structural and sectoral) covering the policy reforms and institutional development
priorities for sustainable growth and poverty reduction has been discussed with the government in
a number of recentjoint reports; (ii) assessment of the CFAA has been made inthe 2005 PER-
                                       an
F A which updated the 2001CFAA and 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).
Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurementrequirements will
have to be satisfied.

115.     Deposit Account. The Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated DA in US dollars
for the Borrower's use once the Credit i s approved by the Board. The DA will form part of the
country's official foreign reserves. An equivalent amount will be credited to an account of the
government available to finance budgeted expenditures. If after deposit in the DA the proceeds
of the Credit or any part thereof are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the FA, the Bank
will require the Borrower to either return that amount to the DA to be used for eligible purposes,
or refund the amount directly to IDA.


                                                  46

116.    Through SBV, the Borrower will report the exact sum received into the DA, ensure that
all withdrawals are for "eligible" expenditures, indicate to IDA details of the Treasury account to
which the Vietnamese Dong equivalent of the Credit proceeds will be credited, and submit a
report on receipts and disbursements for the DA. IDA will maintain the right to request an audit
of the DA. These processes and controls are intended to provide assurancethat IDA funds have
arrived at their intended destination to be used for their intended purposes, and are subject to the
Borrower's rules and regulations.

117.    EnvironmentalAspects. The proposed PRSC 5 supports a number of diverse reform
and policy activities and some of them may cause significant effects (both positive and negative)
on Vietnam's environment, forests and other natural resources. Initiatives in private sector
development, SOE reform, trade integration, and public sector management have potential
implications for environmental quality as well as government's capacity to address future
environmental risks.    To address these issues, the government i s undertaking a substantial
program of environmental capacity building. This program includes institutional strengthening,
environmental and land use planning, and physical investment projects addressing environmental
issues. Donor assistance to Vietnam i s strong in these areas, particularly for some of the issues
addressed through the PRSC process, such as improvements in environmental policies and their
implementation, pollution prevention and control, and sustainable management of forest and
water resources.

118.    Vietnam has shown strong, pro-poor economic growth, but with weak attention to its
environmental sustainability.     To continuously support Vietnam in its efforts to improve
environmental sustainability, environmental objectives have been steadily mainstreamed in the
PRSC process. These actions have related to the adoption and implementation of a legal
framework for new forest use rights of households and communities and the transfer of small-
scale irrigation systems to water user groups. Improving environmental management i s also
addressed in this and previous PRSCs, particularly as it relates to advances in environmental
assessment procedures, regulations that address pollution control (on "polluter pays" fees and
regulations on pollution hotspots) and the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. The
amended LEP has been supported under the PRSC process. This Law which takes effect in July
2006, contains wide ranging improvements in environmental management in Vietnam, among
them new policy tools and remedies for pollution prevention and cleanup, adjustments to cover
the private sector, improved financial mechanisms for environmental protection, and raising
public awarenessand support for environmentalprotection.

119.    The proposed credit continues to recognize the links between some of its proposed policy
actions and their potential impacts on the environment.         Hence it maintains inclusive and
sustainable development as one of its pillars, the aim of which i s to address social inclusion and
environmental sustainability inan integrative way.

120.    As additional due diligence and to ensure that gaps in the existing institutional
arrangements and incentives necessary for improved environmental governance are adequately
identified and addressed, the World Bank i s engaged in supporting analytical work in
collaboration with the government of Vietnam which includes the ongoing country environmental
analysis (CEA), Poverty-Environment Nexus analysis, and an annual environmental monitoring
series, among other analytical work. The CEA specifically targets pollution management issues
within the broader context of industrial development and urbanization (including equitization of
SOEs), environmental aspects of trade liberalization, public participationand public awareness on
environmental issues, policy and institutional capacity development regarding addressing
environmental issues. The study on the Poverty-Environment Nexus targets the direct interaction


                                                 47

between environmental issues and poverty specifically as it relates primarily to natural resource
management (e.g. deforestation and fragile lands), and to health (e.g. indoor and outdoor air
pollution and lack of access to appropriate water and sanitation).        Finally, the environment
monitor series provides a snap shot of the state of environment primarily as it relates to specific
thematic areas. Inthe recent past, thematic areas included water and solid waste, and the current
monitor i s on biodiversity.



C.       BENEFITSAND RISKS


121.     The proposed operation provides further support to Vietnam's policy and institutional
reforms to maintain high growth and poverty reduction. It promotes greater internal and external
competition and improves efficiency and resource allocation in the economy. Policy actions
under the credit help strengthen the regulatory framework for private sector development, and
enhance transparency and accountability in SOE operations and inthe banking sector. It supports
the initiation of fundamental changes inthe financial sector, designed to transform the SBV into a
modem central bank, strengthen the commercial orientation of SOCBs, and develop capital
markets. Overall, the increasedefficiency should be reflectedinincreased private investment and
exports.    This economic expansion should be associated with additional job creation, thus
providing employment opportunities for the young and growing labor force.

122.     The proposed credit also promotes human development through upgrading the quality of
education (especially inpoor zones), promoting inclusive education for children with disabilities,
improving the access of the poor to health services, and helping secure asset ownership through
the implementation of the new Land Law. Analytical work carried out as part of the preparation
of the CPRGS emphasizes the importance of addressing inequalities in health and education
outcomes across regions and population groups. The actions undertaken in PRSC 5 tackle an
underlying problem of resource allocation mechanisms in the social sectors to ensure a stronger
pro-poor focus. The proposed credit also encourages important policy measures leading to more
sustainable management of natural resources, including through SEAS.

123.     The proposed credit will continue to increase transparency and accountability of public
finances, as well as improve legal transparency and accessibility.           Lack of transparency
undermines effective resource allocation and service delivery at national and local levels of
government. To address these issues the credit supports actions to implement the government's
public financial management reform agenda. More effective public resource allocation i s being
achieved through better coordination between five-year plans and budget formulation. And
MTEFs are being employed to improve the coordination between capital and recurrent
expenditures. The new Anti-Conuption Law targets greater accountability in public finance and
public administration. Inthe legal reformarea, the PRSC 5 operation supports the government's
comprehensive and ambitious agenda of the LSDS.

124.     Some of the most important risks accompanying the proposed credit relate to slippage in
areas related to structural reform. These assume greater importance in light of WTO accession.
Benefits fromWTO accessionwill accrue only if complementary reforms take place inareas such
as trade logistics, infrastructureand financial services, tax policy and administration, and reforms
targeted at improving the investment climate. While many of these reforms are in train, their
pace would need to keep up with the demands of international integration. Several new laws that
support these reforms have been issued over the last two years, such as, those covering



                                                 48

intellectual property, competition, investment, and enterprise regulation. It will be important that
the guidelines and institutional changes that accompany these laws are completed in a manner
that preserves the intent of the laws and ensures their effective implementation.

125.     The government's ambitious objectives in terms of economic growth could conflict with
its efforts to increase transparency and contain the growth of contingent liabilities. While some
stakeholders emphasize the quality of growth, the drive towards increasingits quantity may result
in pressures to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure development.           These
pressures could reduce the overall quality of lending, thus undermining the banking reform
agenda, and resulting insubstantial contingent liabilities for the government inthe medium-term.

126.     Another risk relates to macroeconomic management in a phase of rapid financial
integration with the world economy. In this respect, Vietnam could become a victim of its own
success. The strong performance of the economy coupled with greater international exposure,
may lead to excessive and potentially volatile foreign capital inflows. Such volatile capital is
expected to flow into Vietnam's nascent securities market, and the still formalizing real estate
sector, perhaps leading to irrational asset price bubbles. The ultimate deflation of these bubbles
could easily dent the confidence of investors thereby stuntingthe development of much needed
modern capital markets.

127.     The ambitious reformagenda supported by the PRSC process, while improving economic
efficiency, could also lead to increased inequality and environmental degradation.           Rising
inequality could result from differential returns to educational attainment at the household level.
But this problemwill likely be dwarfed by increasingrural-urban disparities, leadingto migration
and possibly to increased urban poverty. The government of Vietnam remains committed to
social inclusion, with policies in health and education aimed at channeling more resources to the
poor and improving the quality of the services delivered. However, some key programs are under-
funded. The incentives given to service providers to charge fees have not been matched by
sufficient accountability on the delivery of basic services to be provided at low or no fee.
Regarding sustainability, an increasingly sophisticated legislation still needs to translate into
effective administrative, economic and information tools to protect the environment.

128.      Improvements in data availability and analytical work on issues arising from rural-urban
disparities, included as part of the PRSC process, should help strengthen government policies to
address these problems. Similarly, the CEA as well as the policy actions on land, water, and
environmental protection under the current series of PRSCs should help address threats to
sustainable resource use and environmentalquality.

129.     Finally, there i s a riskthat ina rapidly growing economy the opportunities for graft could
outpace improvements in anti-corruption policies for some time.             While there has been
considerable progress on enhancing budget transparency, the management of state assets and
liabilities remains weak. The emerginginstitutional architecture for managing and investing state
capital faces governance risks. An important component of such architecture i s the State Capital
Investment Corporation (SCIC) which will absorb state ownership rights in equitized SOEs from
line ministries and government agencies. By moving ownership rights out of ministries it will
alleviate a conflict of interest between ownership and regulation. However, the risk i s that
insufficient attention may be paid to the transparency of its dealings and its overall accountability
as a government agency. Further, rapidly emergingand fast-growing provincial investment funds
could contribute to the development of infrastructure at the local level, but their transparency and
accountability are still matters of concern.




                                                   49

130.    Initiatives are underway to provide effective counter mechanisms, however.              A
comprehensive diagnostic of corruption and its modalities has been completed and its findings
publicly disclosed. An Anti-corruption Law was passedby the National Assembly in December
2005 which introduces strongeraccountability requirementsfor heads of agencies, the monitoring
of assets of senior government officials and their families, and the introduction of a more
effective whistle-blowing mechanism. The government and the Party have also asked the media
to apply a more proactive approach in detecting and reporting on corruption issues.          This
promising anti-corruption agenda, including the wider efforts to buildmodem governance, would
benefit greatly from continued donor engagement. A second cycle of PRSCs would be a key
instrument for coordinating suchdonor support inaneffective manner.



D.      TOWARDSPRSCs6 TO 10


131.    The SEDP 2006-2010 could be used as the document of reference for the
implementation of economic reforms and the alignment of donor support over the next five-
year period. The adoption of the CPRGS principles in the preparationof the new SEDP signals
a departure from the traditional "command and control" approach. Broad-basedconsultation, a
strong poverty focus, the identification of the most appropriate policies to attain the chosen
development objectives, and the use of a monitoring and evaluation framework, make it possible
to rely on a government planning document as the next poverty reduction strategy. Vietnam
would be one of the first countries making this move. The SEDP 2006-10 will be formally
approved by the National Assembly in its May-June, 2006 session. The final version is unlikely
to be very different from the previous ones, which servedas the basis for consultations.The Joint
Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) for the latest CPRGS annual progressreport notes that staffs of the
Bank and IMF are supportive of government efforts to bring these positive reforms to the
planning process. This JSAN i s to be presented to the Board at the same time as the current
credit. The staffs also expect to submit SEDP 2006-2010 to the Boards of IDA and the IMF for
discussionas Vietnam's nextPRS once approvedby the National Assembly.

132.    Because of its broad coverage of policy areas and the multiplicity of decisions
reflected in it, the SEDP 2006-2010 needs to be "translated" into a workable action plan.
This requires clearly assessing the level expected for key development outcomes in each of the
policy areas, as of 2011. It also requires that the key policy actions needed to attain those
outcomes be identified, and their budgetary implications be evaluated. Prioritization and
sequencing will be essentialinthis respect. For instance, the latest version of the SEDP includes
three main pillars: economic, social and environmental; but the cross-cutting reforms associated
with modern governance are somewhat subsumed in each of these pillars, and need to be given
clear prominence. Without those cross-cutting reforms, progress in each of the three pillars i s
bound to be partial. Finally, there is also a need to select the most appropriate indicators, from
the monitoring and evaluationframework but possibly from the broader statistical system as well,
inorder to assessprogressinthe implementation ofthereformagenda.

 133.   This "translation" of the SEDP 2006-2010 into a workable action plan should serve
as the basisfor the discussionof the next PRSC cycle and its contents with the government.
Indeed, the SEDP will only be approvedby the time this proposedcredit i s negotiated. And even
then, a considerable amount of analytical work will be neededto derive a broad policy matrix in
each of the main policy areas. It is expected that the "translation" of SEDP into an outline of
PRSCs6 to 10will bejointly done by the World Bankand the donors co-financing PRSCsduring



                                                50

the second half of 2006. This exercise will be conducted in close collaboration with policy
makers and academic researchers, and the outcome will be brought to the CG meeting of end-
2006. Agreement on the possiblecontents of the proposedPRSCs 6 to 10will then play a similar
role to that of assessingtriggers under the current PRSCcycle. After PRSC 6, however, it would
be possible to move back to the usage of annualtriggers as the instrument of choice to decide the
preparationof the next operation(Figure 2).

134.     The design of the next cycle of PRSCs will also be informed by an evaluation of the
current PRSC cycle. It is planned that such an evaluation will be conductedby an independent
party, and will seek views from the government as well as from all donors involved inthe PRSC
process. A similar evaluation covering the previous PRSCs had been completed in 2005 with
funding from a group of donors. That study employed the standard evaluation criteria of the
OECD's Development Assistance Committee namely, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
impacts, and sustainablility. The proposed evaluation could employ a similar methodology to
updatethe findings of the previous study andcover the entire cycle fromPRSC 1-5.

135.     While it is still too early to spell out the contents of the next cycle of PRSCs, the
benefits and risks identified for the current operation provide some guidance. Inrelation to
the transition to a market economy, the focus should be on implementation. Vietnam has made a
large number of commitmentsinthe context of WTO accession, andneeds to follow through with
them.    Implementing the ambitious banking reform roadmap will be an equally important
challenge. The announced transformation of DAF into a development bank will need to be
closely monitored. As for SOEs, the establishment of SCIC opens the prospect of a more
efficient and transparent management of state assets, with a clear separation of ownership and
regulation functions and reliance on credible performance indicators to allocate capital.
However, the large economic groups being createdare bound to be powerful global players, and
achieving an unambiguous delimitation of responsibilities and liabilities between these groups
and the government is boundto be challenging. Meanwhile, the enormous infrastructure needs of
the coming period call for an effective regulation of access to networks and pricing of services.
Strong incentivesfor private participation andtransparentregulation will beneeded.

136.     On the social front, enabling the ethnic minorities to lift themselves out of poverty will
remain one of the most important objectives.          Issues related to urban migration and the
consequences of the registration system in relation to access to services are bound to become
increasingly important. Inparallel, there will be a need to buildthe foundations for more modem
social protection systems, combining the coverage of universal programs with reliance on strong
economic incentives. The model being adoptedfor the health sector is promising inthis respect,
as it involves various access modalities to the same services, from compulsory but not subsidized
coverage for the formal sector, to compulsory but fully subsidized for the poor, to voluntary for
the rest of the population, with partial subsidies for the near poor. A similar model could be
adoptedinrelation to old-age, survivor and disability pensions. The passage of the first-ever Law
on Social Insurance, in2006, offers an opportunity to establish a systemthat is financially viable
anddoes not distort incentives. But implementing anddesigningsuch system will be challenging.
Preventing the degradation of natural resources and increasing the efficiency of the tools for
pollutioncontrol will be the mainchallenge inrelation to the environmental pillar.

137.     Last but not least, the governance area i s bound to be central in the next PRSC cycle.
The relationship between planning and budgets will have to be strengthened further, and the
modernization of the management of public revenues and public expenditures will need to be
completed. The fight against corruption will involve better and more accountable systems to

system to monitor progress in the fight against corruption, building on the strengths of the first
diagnostic study while extending its coverage, could be set up. Streamlined administrative
procedures, increasedreliance on e-government and more transparent public procurement are also
bound to feature prominently in the next PRSC cycle. Some of the most difficult challenges
mightbe associatedwithjudiciary reform, especially inrelation to the reorganizationof courts by
jurisdiction and the revampingof processesso as to enhance access tojustice.



             VIII. COORDINATIONWITH DONORSAND STAKEHOLDERS



A.       THE IMF


 138.    The IMF has not had a lending arrangement in Vietnam since the expiry of its PRGF in
April 2004. However, the IMF remains fully committed to continuing an effective partnership
with the government of Vietnam to support the implementation of the CPRGS.               The IMF
maintains a regular policy dialogue with the government through Article IV consultations, interim
staff visits, and its resident representative office in Hanoi, and seeks to build capacity through
training activities inVietnam and abroad. It supplements this dialogue with technical assistance
in areas of core Fund expertise, including tax policy and administration, budget management,
monetary and financial sector policy, and macroeconomic statistics. The IMF continues to
cooperate closely with the World Bank in Vietnam, and to contribute actively to the broader
dialogue between the government and its development partners. In relation to the proposed
credit, the IMFhas provided a Letter of Assessment presented in Annex 1. A joint Bank-Fund
debt sustainability assessment was completed inAugust 2005 and will be updated shortly.

 139.    Under the framework of enhanced collaboration, the staffs of the two institutions have
consulted closely with one another across a broad range of issues, and have sought to maintain
appropriately-aligned positions in their areas of policy engagement. While the World Bank has
taken the lead in supporting the government's structural and institutional reforms in a number of
sectors, the IMFhas taken the lead inthe policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies. It has also
assumedresponsibility for advising on the monetary policy functions of the SBV.



B.       OTHER MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL DONORS


 140.    As many as 11bilateral and multilateral donors are expected to co-finance PRSC 5, and
 15 or more of them could support the next cycle of the PRSC process (see Table 10). The first
two PRSC operations were co-financed by thee bilateral donors, namely Denmark, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These co-financiers together with Sweden contributed a
total of US$43 million to PRSC 1. For PRSC 2, a total of US$31 million was provided as grant
finance by these donors to supplement the World Bank's US$lOO million. Inaddition to these
three, ADB, Canada, the EC and Japan supported PRSC 3, mobilizing the equivalent of US$122
million. ADB and Japan contributed through parallel lending, whereas all other co-financiers
have relied on grants. Other bilateral donors actively participated in the preparation of this
preparation, with a view tojoin the process at some point.



                                                  53

141.     Apart from cofinancing PRSC operations, bilateral and multilateral donors have played
an important role through their involvement inthe policy dialogue with the government. Donors
participating in the process contributed human and financial resources to assess the policy
challenges, coordinate their approaches, and discuss the options with government, across a range
of policy areas. These were chosen inaccordance with their priorities and comparative strengths.
The preparation of this credit was conducted in a joint manner since its inception, with regular
donor meetings taking place to reach consensus on how to proceed. Bilateral meetings between
the World Bank and specific donors have also proved useful to share information and put to good
use the combined insights and knowledge of all the parties involved. These meetings provided
the common ground on sectoral priorities and broad timetables for the present operation.

142.     Preparations for PRSC 5 have built on the foundations of the existing strong donor
commitment to support Vietnam's reformagenda ina coordinated manner. This commitment has
been re-asserted, most recently, inthe Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness. It i s reflected
in the intense meeting frequency of the different working groups that were established to
coordinate the views of co-financiers and share information pertaining to the PRSC process.
Joint working groups of donors, government and internationalNGOs that meet on a regular basis
have helped carry the discussions on government's plans for reforms to a wide group of
stakeholders. With the formation of working groups organized by policy area, donors have had
the opportunity to engage in discussions on reform with government counterparts on an ongoing
basis. Such an arrangement i s also helping to ensure coherence across donors' programs of
support, and to mobilize fundingfor highpriority tasks ineachpolicy area.



C.       CIVILSOCIETY


143.     The nature and contents of the proposed credit, as well as initial ideas for the next cycle
of PRSCs, were discussed with civil society organizations. With the support and cooperation of
the NGO Resource Centre, a meeting was held with both international and local NGOs. The
discussion revealed a diverse agenda across organizations, although with a common focus on
poverty alleviation, human development and community participation. The NGOs participating
in this meetingendorsed several of the policy actions supported by the proposed credit. It was
felt that the mechanism to elicit their feedback be more intensive for the next cycle of PRSCs.
There were suggestions to appoint one or two contact persons from the NGO side for the sectors
covered under the PRSCs, who will act as coordinators for the views of different NGOs. Issues
and measures related to community participation and accountability at local levels were also
discussed, and were seen as areas where the NGO could contribute more in designing policy
actions to be covered under PRSCs.

144.     A well-functioning mechanism is in place in Vietnam to conduct consultations with
business associations. Prior to both the year-end CG meeting between government and donors
and the informal mid-year CG meeting, the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) gathers to discuss
the issues of concern to a range of chambers and associations representing the interests of
enterprises.   The discussion i s organized around topics such as investment promotion,
transparency, tax, labor and land. Ineach of these areas, a list of main concerns i s assembled, and
the focus i s on assessingprogress towards solving them. Many of those concerns are addressed
through policy actions supported by the PRSC process. At the last VBF, in December 2005, the
current cycle of PRSC operations was discussed, and feedback from the participating chambers
and associationswas sought.

                                            STAFF STATEMENT

                                    Nha Trang, June 9-10,2006

  1.     This statementprovides an updateof the assessmentof Vietnam's macroeconomic
 conditions contained inthe staff statement to the Vietnam Consultative Group (CG) Meeting
 heldinHanoi duringDecember 6-7,2005, which was basedon the conclusions of the 2005
 Article IV Consultation.'

                             I.RECENT     ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

 2.      Overallmacroeconomicperformancewas strongin2005 andhasremained
 broadlyfavorable so far in2006.Real GDP growth pickedup to 8.4 percent in2005, ledby
 strong consumption and investment. Although non-oil export growth slowed in2005, exports
 rebounded inthe second half of the year. With non-oil import growth slowing significantly,
 an improving current account, together with strong ODA and FDI,helped increase gross
 official reservesby more than US$2 billion in2005. These trends continuedinrecent
 months, with reservesrisingby another US$1.3 billion inthe first two months of 2006.

 3.      Inflationremainedabove8 percentin2005 and appearsto be moredemand-
 driventhaninthe recentpast. Although food price increasesthat accounted for the sharp
 acceleration of inflation in2004 have subsided, risingnonfuel commodity prices have kept
import prices under pressure. Inaddition, the major increases inpublic sector wages enacted
inthe last two years, together with expansionary macroeconomic policies, have spurred
demand and ledto second-round effects on private sector wages. Adjustments in
administered prices, which need to be introduced soon, are likely to put further upward
pressure on inflation inthe period ahead.

4.       Credit growthhasdeceleratedconsiderablyover the lastyear, butmonetary
policywill needto remainvigilant inlightof recentsigns of demand-pullinflation.
Credit growth fell from 41% percent in 2004 to 31% percent in2005, and to 24 percent as of
February 2006, consistent with the SBV's monetary programthat sets this year's credit
growth target at 25 percent. However, reserve money growth pickedup in early 2006 due to
the sharp increase in reserves. While the SBV raised its discount and refinancingrates three
times since end-2004, most recently inDecember, by a cumulative 150basis points, these
rates are still negative in real terms, and real deposit and loan rates have remainedlow by
recent historical standards. Even at 25 percent, credit growth i s still very buoyant, and the
quality of bank credit continues to be a major source of risk.

  The 2005 Article IV Consultation was concluded on October 7,2005 and the staff papers
for the consultation were publishedon the Fund's external web site inJanuary 2006.

                                               - 2 -


 5.      Fiscalpolicy was eased in2005, and is set to be further loosenedinthe period
 ahead. The narrowly-defined official budget deficit edged up to 1%percent of GDP in2005,
 as the large increases inpublic sector wages and oil subsidies more than offset reductions in
 other expenditures. An increase in off-budget investment and net lending widenedthe overall
 deficit from less than 4 percent of GDP in2004 to about 6% percent of GDP in2005. The
 2006 budget implies a further expansion of the overall deficit, with the total stock of public
 debt projected to rise from 43% percent of GDP in2005 to about 47 percent of GDPin2006.
 Implementationof the ambitious state sector investment objectives of the draft Socio-
 Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010, which i s currently under discussion by
 the National Assembly, would likely keep public sector debt (excluding contingent liabilities)
 on a rising path over the mediumterm. The pressures on the debt burden would be increased
 by any contingent liabilities from the SOCB and SOE sectors that the government may
 eventually have to absorb. The amount of such liabilities i s critically dependent on the
 progress of reforms inthese sectors incoming years, but i s potentially quite large.

 6.      Vietnam has made good progress over the last year inadopting legislation and
 market opening measures required for WTO compliance. The UnifiedEnterprise Law
 approved inNovember 2005, which i s to take effect from July 1,2006, has set the stage for a
 leveling of the playing field between domestic and foreign firms, irrespective of their
 ownership structures. Inaddition, a new Common Investment Law, also approved in
November 2005, i s expected to introduce a common investment regime for domestic and
foreign investors, and shouldmake Vietnam's investment regime consistent with its
international commitments. Inthe trade system, the recent signingof a bilateral market
access agreement with the U.S. should clear the way for the last stage of negotiations on
Vietnam's WTO accession. With the accession, Vietnam i s expected to lower its trade
barriersto a wide range of industrial and agriculturalproducts and services.

7.      However, SOCB and SOE reforms have recorded mixed performance. Inthe
banking sector, Decision 493 issued inApril 2005 was a major step forward in the SBV's
efforts to bring its prudentialregulations closer into line with international standards. To
enable the authorities to assess the true size of banks' non-perfonning loans (NPLs),banks
were requiredto report their NPLs based on the new standards by end-March 2006. On that
basis, the SBV plannedto prepare a comprehensive strategy to resolveNPLs and recapitalize
SOCBs for submission to the government by end-June. However, difficulties inthe proper
application of Decision 493 appear to have delayed this process. The authorities' announced
plans to equitize all SOCBs by 2010 are another important component intheir bank reform
strategy. However, the state i s to retain a controlling ownership share, andthe existing
equitization plans provide insufficient room for participation by strategic foreign investors. In
the SOE sector, the government issued a new duective in2005 to step up equitization,
established a new State Corporation of Investment Capital (SCIC) to manage its stakes in
equitized SOEs, and instructed SOEs to submit to the MoF audited financial reports to be
usedas the basis of a performance-based ratingexercise. These have all beenwelcome steps,
which should help move the SOEreform process forward inthe period ahead. However,
progress towards equitizing larger SOEs has remainedslow to date, and the recent formation
of eight "economic groups" that are to remain wholly state-owned has probably strengthened
state control over key industries.

 11. OUTLOOKAND POLICY CHALLENGESFORTHEPERIODCOVEREDBYTHESEDP

  8.       The near-termoutlook i s broadly positive, but subject to risks.The favorable
 external environment can be expected to spur a sustained pick-up of Vietnam's exports inthe
 period ahead. With domestic demand growth remainingbuoyant, GDP growth could reach a
 robust 7% to 8 percent in 2006. The current account deficit would be more than fully
 financed by ODA and FDIinflows, and reserves would increase at a brisk pace. However,
 expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could fuel sustained highinflation and increase the
 vulnerability of the fiscal and external positions. Inthis context, a domestic or regional
 supply shock or a rapid worsening of the external environment could expose these
 vulnerabilities, and trigger costly adjustments, which couldjeopardize the new SEDP's
 poverty reduction objectives.

 9.      The favorable external outlook makes this a propitious time for the adoption of
 an appropriatepolicy mix to mitigate the risksto the SEDP's objectives. To promote a
 higher-quality pattern of private sector-led growth, we encourage the authorities to interpret
 the SEDPin a flexible manner, with the main targets viewed as indicative, andpolicies
 geared to strengthening macroeconomic discipline and speeding up market-oriented reforms.

 Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

 10.     The risksto inflation and the uncertainquality of SOCB lending call for a
 prudent monetary policy. The staff supports the SBV's objective to further scale back
 credit growth in2006. To meet that objective, we encourage the authorities to make more
 active use of liquidity-absorbing open market operations. At the same time, banks that are
 rapidly increasing their lending should be requiredto buildup prudentially adequate
 provisions and/or capital buffers to cover future losses and risks. Inorder to be effective, the
 SBV's efforts to slow liquidity andcredit growth will need to be coupled with
 discontinuationof the mandate given to the SOCBs to finance government-supported SOE
projects, and a broader-based bankingsystem reform.

 11.    A more flexible exchange rate policy is also warranted. While the recent practice
of limiting the dong's fluctuations vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar does not seem to have led to any
significant exchange rate misalignment, a more flexible policy would serve to protect
competitiveness and contain exchange rate risks as Vietnam progressively opens up its trade
and financial systems. To cushion the impact of external shocks, the authorities may want to
consider widening the trading bandfor the dong inthe interbankmarket, and allowing banks
to set customer rates freely, while limitinginterventionto smoothingexcessive fluctuations.

Fiscal Policy

12.     T o ensure that the SEDP's growth objectives can be attained on an enduring
basis, fiscal policy needs to be streamlined and refocused on long-run sustainability.
According to the staff's preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA), continuation of the
recent loose stance of fiscal policy, which couldresult, for example, if the SEDP's public
investment plan i s fully implemented, would probably leadto a rapid increase of the public
debt stock inrelationto GDP over the medium term, and a significant expansion inthe share

                                               - 4 -


 of government revenues absorbed by debt service payments. To ensure that the costs that
 may be incurred down the road to fund SOE and SOCB reform will not crowd out more
 productive outlays on essential infrastructure and poverty-reduction programs, public
 investment should be focused on the highest-priorityinfrastructure projects. Projects that
 couldbe commercially viable should be increasingly opened to private participation.

 13.      More specifically, the fiscal stance will need to be significantly tightened over the
 medium term to anticipate the pressures on the revenue base associated with the
 levelingoff of oil-related receipts. Inlight of highinflation, a good part of the large oil
 windfall should be saved in 2006, and measures taken to curb expenditure growth, with a
 view to placingthe non-oil balance on a declining path. Further increases inpublic wages
 should be phasedinonly inconjunction with civil service reforms, and oil subsidies scaled
 down by fully passing through increases ininternational oil prices. There should also be
 room to curtail some investment expenditures by tightening selection criteria for new
 projects, especially under the programs of off-budget investment andnon-ODA on-lending.

 Structural Reforms

 14.     Financialsector reform is key to medium-term debt sustainability, and to a more
 productive use of loanable funds. Prompt measuresneed to be taken to value existing NPLs
 realistically, so that any existing capital gaps and costs to the budget can be estimated, and
 credible SOCB reform plans developed. At the same time, it will be important to guard
 against a renewed buildup of N P L s by eliminating residual policy lending and strictly
 enforcing the SOCBs' mandate to operate on a commercialbasis. Implementationof the
 SOCB equitizationplans could help improve SOCB governance, especially if there i s
participationby strategic foreign investors. More effective bank supervision will be an
important complement to SOCB reforms. Inthis context, the staff supports plans to push
aheadfor greater SBV independence, and encourages the authorities to speed up introduction
of legislationto grant the SBV a clear mandate to operate as a modern central bank.

 15.     Faster and more market-oriented SOE reform will also be essential. We
welcome the recent completion of the first round of a performance-based SOE rating exercise
and urgethe authorities to use its results as a basis for early equitization of larger SOEs. We
also support the authorities' plans to adjust key administered prices, and encourage them to
effect the needed adjustments soon. Looking ahead, more incentives will need to be given to
SOEmanagersto move operations onto a commercialbasis. Reported plans to link the new
SOEgroups with SOCBs raise concerns inthis regard, as such moves could further soften
SOEs' budget constraints. Additional concerns have stemmed from announced plans for
other government-facilitated financing of large SOE projects, whose viability may be
uncertain inthe context of increasing global competition.

16.      Continuingimprovements inthe legaland regulatory framework and increased
policy transparency and accountability would be key to improving the quality of
investment and bolstering donor and investor confidence. Inthis regard, the staff support
the government's efforts to pursue a full investigation of the illegal activities associated with
the misappropriation of ODA funds inthe Mnistry of Transport's Public Management Unit
(PMU) 18 andlook forwardto the presentation of the government's anti-comption summary

                                           - 5 -


at this mid-year CG meeting. To set the stage for a more generalized improvement inpublic
sector financial management, all government-funded investment and net lending should be
brought on-budget andpresented to the NationalAssembly on a consolidated basis. Further
improvements inthe quality and dissemination of data on the monetary and external sectors
and the SOCBs' and SOEs' accounts would also be desirable.

                                111. CONCLUDINGREMARKS

17.     Vietnam hasmadegreat stridesinitspursuitof growthandpovertyreduction
since the launchingof doi moi twenty years ago, and it is well-placedto continueto do
so inthe periodahead, providedthat it pursuesits SEDP targets with flexibility, care,
andpragmatism.The outward-oriented reforms andprudent external debt management
policies adopted under previous SEDPs have clearly served the economy well, and should be
continued. The staff welcomes Vietnam's recent acceptanceof Article VI11of the Fund's
Articles of Agreement andit supports the authorities' efforts to secure WTO accession.
Continuing boldliberalization of trade and investment flows, coupled with a more prudent
mix of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies and faster-paced and refocused reforms in
the banlung and SOE sectors, would be the surest way to meet the new SEDP's poverty
reduction goal. While the challenges ahead may be large, and the buildingof political
consensusinfavor of needed measures difficult, we are confident that the government and
the Vietnamese people will rise to the occasion. We wish the authorities every success in
these endeavors.

Mr.Paul Wolfowitz
President
The World Bank
Washington, DC


Dear Mr.Wolfowitz,

       It has been two decades now since Vietnam launched Doi Moi, an ambitious
economic renovation program. The objective of Doi Moi was to rely more systematically
on market mechanisms, while maintaining the poverty alleviation focus which has
characterized the economic policies of Vietnam since its independence. This combination
of economic incentives and social inclusion reflects Vietnam's determination to build a
market economy for the goal of a powerful country with a prosperous population and an
equal, democratic and civilized society. While much remains to be done, economic
developments have confirmed the wisdom o f the reform agenda initiated with Doi Moi.
The economy has grown by 7.7 percent per year since 1991, in real terms, with GDP per
capita attaining $640 in 2005, compared to $143 in 1991. The poverty rate, measuredin
internationally comparable terms, declined from 58 percent o f the population in 1993 to
less than 20 percent in 2004. Other social indicators, like those monitored under the
Millenium Development Goals, have also improved steadily. These accomplishments took
place without the major turmoil experienced by several transition economies in the initial
stages of their reform process, in the early 1990s. Vietnam also managed to avoid a
recessionduringthe EastAsia crisis, inthe late 1990s.

       The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), is the last one in a series
of five operations, fully aligned with our own planning cycle. The Doi Moi agenda for
economic renovation has been articulated through a series o f Government strategies and
plans. In recent times, the broadest statement was provided by the Ten-Year Socio-
Economic Development Strategy 2001-2010.        Key planning documents for the period
covered by the current cycle o f PRSCs are the five-year Socio-Economic Development
Plan (SEDP) 2001-2005, and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
(CPRGS). The CPRGS, approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002, was presented in
July 2002 to the Board of Executive Directors of the International Development
Association, as the strategy to implement the SEDP 2001-2005. The policy actions
supported by the proposed credit reflect the reform directions set out in our planning
documents and inthe CPRGS inparticular.

       Important developments and policy breakthroughs have also contributed to further
shaping the reform agenda along this five-year cycle.        In 2003, the CPRGS was
"expanded" to include a development policy for large-scale infrastructure and review its

role in promotingeconomic growth and poverty reduction. Inthat same year, the decision
was made to accelerate Vietnam's accessionto the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
this, in turn, has influenced policy actions related to international trade and the legal
framework.     There has also been considerable progress regarding public financial
management. The Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment of 2005,
jointly prepared by the Ministry o f Finance and the World Bank with support from several
donors, is charting the way to increase the efficiency and transparency of public financial
management. Since 2004, the Government Inspectoratehas beenleadingaprocessto make
anti-corruption policies and tools more effective. And starting in early 2005, the State
Bank o f Vietnam prepared a strategy to substantially accelerate the reform of the banking
system.

        The proposed credit also supports some of the policy orientations being developed
in view of the next planningcycle. As Vietnam emerges from massive poverty, the focus
is moving in the direction of becoming a middle-income country towards the end of the
decade. Without downplaying the importance of a continued and effective fight against
poverty, the new orientations highlight the need for institutionaldevelopment, with more
appropriate mechanisms to support an increasingly sophisticated economy and modem
social protection arrangements to keep development inclusive. These new orientations
include the strengthening of the legal foundations for business, a transparent financing and
efficient regulation of infrastructure, a drivetowards universalsystems in the social sectors,
a much stronger protection of the environment, a more transparent public administration
and reduced corruption.      While rapid economic growth remains a priority, the next
planningcycle will also focus onthe quality of growth.

        The preparation of the SEDP 2006-2010 has actually built on the strengths of the
CPRGS. The decision to integratethe CPRGS principlesandthe Millennium Development
Goals into the SEDP was made in late 2004. Since then, there has been a large-scale
consultation process with stakeholders in and out of Government, and an active
involvement of the donor community. The new SEDP, discussed by the tenth Party
Congress last monthand submitted to the NationalAssembly for approval this month, pays
greater attention to the attainment of development outcomes, over productiontargets. A
system to monitor and evaluate the progress in attainingthose outcomes is currently being
set up. And for the first time, forward-lookingexercises are being conducted at aggregate
and sectoral levels to translate the broad orientations of the SEDP into the preparation of
annual budgets. The integrationof the CPRGS approach into the SEDP removes the need
for two separateplanningdocuments.

        One of the main objectives of Vietnam's development strategy under the current
five-year cycle is to complete the transition to a market economy, as reflected in Part 111
sections Iand 11, and Part IV of the CPRGS. In this respect, over the last twelve months
we have come close to concluding WTO negotiations, and several important laws and
regulations have been issued in preparation for accession. A level playing field is being
attained, with all firms and investors being treated equally, regardless of whether they are
privately owned, foreign-owned or state-owned, After having equitizeda large number of
State-OwnedEnterprises (SOEs), including increasingly large ones, the decisionhas been
made to transfer the management of state shareholder rights out of line ministries and

agencies, so as to avoid a conflict between ownership and regulation. In the financial
sector, an ambitious reformroadmaphas been adoptedat the highest level of Government.
Its objective is to separate the management of State-Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs)
from their supervision, to create a modem central bank, and to strengthen the commercial
orientationof SOCBsthrough their equitization.

        Another important policy objective is to ensure that growth remains socially
inclusiveand environmentally sustainable. Inthis respect, the proposed credit is grounded
on Part 111 sections Iand 111, Part IV section IV and Part V section Iof the CPRGS. The
credit also builds on recent decisions to combine universal systems in the social sectors,
with contributions by beneficiaries towards defraying the cost of service provision, and
mechanisms to finance the participationof the poor. A sustained effort is under way to
increase the quality of education, with an emphasis on primary schools in poorer districts.
The financingof healthcare is beingrevamped, with the introductionof health insuranceto
separate finding from service provision. Resources are allocated to cover the health
insurancepremium ofthe poor and to improveinfrastructure andeconomic opportunities in
the communes facing the greatest hardship. An effort is also under way to complete the
issuanceof land-useright certificates andto strengthenthe managementofwater resources.
While not as fast as it could be desired, economic and information tools to protect the
environment are beingdeveloped.

        Success in promoting economic growth, and in ensuring the social and
environmental sustainability of development, crucially depends on building modern
governance. This area is covered in Part I11 sections Iand I1 and Part VI1 section Iin the
CPRGS. The much strengthened process followed to prepare the SEDP 2006-2010, with
its emphasis on stakeholders' consultationand its reliance on development outcomes, is in
itself an illustration of the drive towards modern governance. Equally important are the
actions aimed at bridgingthe gap betweenplanningand budgeting, through the preparation
of medium-ternframeworks, and between capital and recurrent expenditures, through the
development of budget allocationnorms. A strategy has been adopted to develop the legal
system and reform thejudicial system. Its implementationwill entail a substantial change
in the way courts operate and will strengthen accessto justice. Among the policy actions
supported by this credit is the first-ever anti-corruption law in Vietnam, including a
mechanismto monitorthe assets ofcivilservants andtheir close families.

        The speech of DeputyPrime MinisterNguyenTan Dungat the openingofthe ninth
session of the National Assembly, on May 16, 2006, articulated the same themes and
reviewedsome ofthe same actions coveredby the proposedcredit. Deputy PrimeMinister
Nguyen Tan Dung is also the Chairman o f the Steering Committee for the PRSC process.
Hisspeechto the NationalAssembly confirmsthat the proposedcredit is fully alignedwith
the reformagenda ofVietnam.

       Over this planning cycle, the Government of Vietnam has regularly assessed the
progress accomplished, and identified the implementation challenges faced, sharing its
findings and views with the donor community. The annual CPRGS Progress Reports,
presentedat the Consultative Group meetingsin December of each year, have beenone of
the main communication channels in this respect. The latest of these reports, produced in

November 2005, is currently beingcirculatedto the ExecutiveDirectorsof the World Bank
andthe InternationalMonetary Fund, alongside an advisory notejointly written by the staff
ofthe two organizations.

        The proposed credit, and the five-year series of PRSCs more broadly, have also
been an effective tool for harmonization. In the spirit of the Paris Declarationon Aid
Effectiveness and the associated Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness: Ownership,
Harmonization, Alignment, Result, PRSCs have allowed a coordinated policy dialogue
between line ministries and Government agencies on the one hand and an increasingly
large number of donors on the other hand. The Government of Vietnam appreciates this
increased coherence of the policy dialogue, and the considerable reductionin transactions
costs resultingfrom the PRSC approach.

        In developing and implementing our strategy for economic growth and poverty
reduction, we have benefited from assistance from the Association and a broadening range
of bilateral and multilateral donors. The Association supported earlier stages of this
process through the first four PRSCs. We request the Association's assistance through a
fifth PRSC, in recognitionofthe steady progress inthe implementation of our development
strategy. While recognizing that many difficulties remain, we will pursue our reform
agenda and plan on key actions to complete the transition to a market economy, keep
development inclusive, better protect the environment, and build modern governance. We
hope that we will count with the support o f the Association as we enter the next five-year
cycle, with the ambition of substantially reducingpoverty and becoming a middle-income
country by the endofthe decade.

        In this connection, at the Consultative Group meeting of end-2006 we will hrnish
to the Association, for its review and comment, an updated CPRGS Progress Report on
achievements and challenges in carrying out the program, We will also discuss with the
donor community the specific development outcomes, policy actions and monitoring
indicators in each of the areas of the reformprogram over the next five years. We expect
that this discussion will lead to the preparation of a new cycle of PRSCs in support of our
povertyreduction and growth strategy.

        We request the Association's assistance with the proposedcredit and look forward
to its continued support beyondthisplanningcycle.
