Description        The proposed loan would be the third in a series o f three Programmatic
                   Development Policy Loans (PDPLs) designed to support the
                   Government's economic reform program over a period of three-four
                   years. The program aims to promote economic growth andjob creation
                   through reforms to improve the investment climate and strengthen the
                   governance and efficiency o fthe public sector.

Benefits           The PDPLs support the Government's medium-term reform program
                   aimed at promotinggrowth andjob creation through improvements in
                   the investment climate and strengtheningthe governance and efficiency
                   of the public sector. The reform program is consistent with the
                   Government's aspiration for EU integration and eventual EU
                   membership.

Risks              The current capacity o f some public sector institutions to implement an
                   ambitious reform agenda sustained over severalyears remains relatively
                   weak. However, the risk is mitigated through the use of three donor-
                   financed grants providing technical assistance in key areas of the
                   reform program and from Bank investment projects in the areas of
                   health, social protection, judiciary, and the business environment. The

                                          iv

                        risk is further mitigated through close cooperation with other donors
                        working in these reformareas.

                        There are political risks. While the threat of renewed ethnic violence is
                        modest, political polarizationstill constrains the policy dialogue. There
                         is uncertainty related to the situation in neighboring Kosovo.
                        Mitigating factors to these political risks include the broad popular
                        consensusin favor of EUaccession, andthe realizationamong all major
                        political parties that continued implementation o f economic reforms is
                        an essential step on the path to EU membership.                Moreover,
                         implementation of the 2001 Ohrid Agreement that ended the 2001
                        hostilitieshas beenadvanced.

                        The country also faces macroeconomic risks. Real GDP growth picked
                         in 2007, but still remains moderate compared with other countries in
                        the region and could be negatively affected by ongoing turmoil in
                         international financial markets and projected slowdown in the EU.
                        Inflation has begun rising, in part due to higher prices for food and
                         imported energy, and stronger expansion in domestic demand. The
                        current account deficit is projected to widen measurably from one of
                        the lowest levels in the region.        Mitigating factors include the
                        possibility that structural reforms, including those supported by the
                        PDPL series, would help stimulate growth in productivity and exports
                        and increase domestic saving. Further, ultimate improvements in the
                        political dialogue should speed EU integration and, along with it,
                        investor confidence.      To the extent that the improved investor
                        confidence helps attract larger inflows of foreign direct investment,
                        even a larger current account deficit could be financed without reliance
                        on foreign borrowing.

          INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                                    PROGRAMDOCUMENT FOR A
            PROPOSED THIRD PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENTPOLICY LOAN
                  TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA



                                         I. INTRODUCTION


1.      The program document is for the proposed third and final in a series of three
Programmatic DevelopmentPolicy Loans (PDPLs) to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(FYR Macedonia) to support the Government's structural reform program. The proposed PDPL3
will be in the amount of US$25 million, equivalent in euros, and would represent one-third of the policy-
based lendingenvisaged in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY07-10. The PDPLs have been
complementedby investment loans supportingkey reformsand by analyticaland advisory services.

2.      The objective of the PDPLs is to promote economic growth and job creation in FYR
Macedonia by supporting reforms to improve the investment climate and strengthen governance
and efficiency of the public sector. The PDPLs are designed to support the Government in advancing
EU integrationand eventual EU accession. This PDPL series builds on the reforms initiated under the
completed Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC), Public Management Adjustment
Loan (PSMAL) and the Second Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL2), as well as
the reforms identified in the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and in the 2005 Legal
and Judicial Assessment. The proposed reform program has been developed in close cooperation with
other development partners, in particular with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure
consistency with the three-year standby arrangementapproved on August 31,2005.


                                     11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

                            A.       RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

3.      Macroeconomicstabilitywas quickly restored and economic growth recoveredfollowingthe
2001 conflict. Stabilizationwas underpinned by tighter fiscal policy, adherenceto the defacto peg o fthe
currency to the euro, and progress in restartingstructural reforms interruptedby the conflict. After years
of modest real GDP growth, averaging 4 percent during 2004-2006 (one of the lowest in the broader
regionof Eastern Europe and CentralAsia, ECA), the economy expanded more vigorously in 2007. Real
GDP is estimated to have increasedby about 5 percent for 2007 as a whole, reflectingongoingstructural
reforms, includingthose supported by the PDPLs. Inflation has been low since the start of the decade, but
has risen sharply in early 2008, in part due to higherprices for food and importedenergy (Table 1).

4.      Ongoing reform efforts to tackle obstacles to businessdevelopment have helped strengthen
investmentrates of late, with gross investment risingto an estimated 23.1 percent of GDP in 2007 from
21 percent on average in 2002-2006. Investmentrates in FYR Macedoniastill lag the new EU member
states (average of 29 percent), with a negative impact on economic growth. Business climate surveys
indicate that the most serious obstacles to private sector development (and, correspondingly, investment)
include an inefficient and opaquejudicial system, poor access to credit, heavy regulation, political risks,
corruption, and policy unpredictability.

5.      The balance of payments has improved substantially over the last several years, reflectinga
narrower merchandise trade deficit, increased remittances and improved statistical coverage. The
current account deficit is officially reported to have decreased from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to

current account deficit is officially reported to have decreased from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to
0.9 percent in 2006, before widening to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2007. In 2006, the authorities prepaid fully
London Club creditors, and in 2007 prepaid fully the IMF, most obligations to the Paris Club and
obligations under five loans to the World Bank. Prepayments in 2007 amounted to $283 million, or
4.6 percent of GDP.' Despite the prepayments and the larger external deficit in 2007, net capital inflows
exceeded the current account deficit and helped boost foreign exchange reserves. Reserves rose to 4.6
months' imports of goods and services by the end of 2007.

6.       Larger capital inflows of late have reflected stronger inflows of foreign direct investment
(FDI), which averaged 5 percent in 2006-07, thanks to both accelerated privatization to foreign
investors and larger greenfield inflows. Even at these levels, however, inflows of FDI are modest
compared to a large number of other ECA countries, an outcome that has hindereda stronger growth in
output and exports. Exports grew 7 percent a year on average during the last decade, with a pickup over
the last several years. The country's share in world exports has been recovering since 2005, but remains
below the levels of the mid-1990s.

7.       The recent improvements in growth and the balance of payments notwithstanding, the
underlying challenge motivating the program remains unchanged: economic growth and formal
sector job creation have been slow. Even if expanding at 5 percent a year, real GDP growth is among
the slowest in ECA. Moreover, growth remains narrowly based on a few key sectors and at its present
pace is yet to reduce measurably overly high unemployment and poverty. Unemployment is oversized at
about 34.5 percent, one of the highest in the region. Informality is pervasive, estimated at about

' These pre-paymentsnotwithstanding, the Government considersthat the PDPL series not only supportscrucial
reforms, but also helps to strengthen fiscal and financialdiscipline.


                                                               2

40 percent of GDP, and has reflected in part a restrictive labor market and high social security
contribution rates, although the Government is beginning to address these issues.* The poor corporate
governance which emerged following privatization (carried largely through management and employee
buyouts) has also contributedto sluggishformaljob creation.

8.       There are signs that the reformssupported by the PDPL have begun to make a dent in these
rigidities. Efforts by the Governmentto improvethe business and regulatory environmenthave begunto
bear fruit, with the 2008 Doing Business report rankingthe country among the top ten reformers in the
world. More time and persistencewill be neededbeforethese bottlenecks are fully eliminatedand growth
prospects more substantially enhanced. Improvements in the political dialogue and continued decisive
strides in advancingEU integrationwill also be important factors in strengtheninginvestorconfidence.

9.       The above assessment of the macroeconomic policy environment is similar to that of the
IMF, as articulated in the Fund's documents following the completion in February 2008 of the third
review of the three-year stand-by arrangement that expires in August 2008. The Fund staff report
concludes that economic growth has been robust last year, the fiscal position has strengthened, and
foreign direct investment and internationalreserves have increased. The Government has also continued
to make progress in reducing its external debt. Despite these successes, economic challenges remain,
including containingthe recent rise in inflation, achieving a sustained higher economic growth rate, and
reducingunemployment.

10.      On balance, the macroeconomic framework is appropriate for developmentpolicy lending.
Challenges remain, as describedabove, and these warrant continuedpolicy efforts and monitoring.


                                         B       POVERTYPROFILE

11.      The Bank is carrying out a programmatic Poverty Assessment which will allow for a close
monitoring of the impact of PDPL supported reforms on poverty and may be supplemented by specific
poverty and social impact analyses. Moderate economic growth during 2002-2004 kept poverty
broadly unchanged, with an estimated 21 percent of the population living below the absolute
poverty line (indicating that they are unable to meet their basic food and nonfood needs). About one-
third o f the poor were unable to acquire even the minimum level of calories. The stagnation o f poverty
until 2004 was accompanied with changes in its composition, with urban poverty rising in smaljer
secondary towns and rural poverty falling. The poor have a higher rate of unemployment (about
50 percent compared with about 30 percent among the non-poor). Moreover, the poor tend to be
disproportionately employed in informal jobs that tend to pay less than formal jobs and have fewer
benefits. Poverty tends to be substantiallyhigher among minoritiesminority groups (many of which also
suffer from lower levels of educationand skills as well), an outcome that creates social exclusion.

12.      Employment and wage growth remained modest during 2004-2006 and indications are that
poverty remained broadly unchanged. There was a stronger pickup in employment in 2007, with the
employment rate rising to 41 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 35 percent in 2006 on average
and 33 percent in 2004, suggesting some, albeit modest decrease in poverty may have occurred in 2007.
Unemploymentfell to 34.5 percent in 2007 from 36 percent in 2006 and 37.2 percent in 2004.

13.      Nonmonetary dimensions of poverty (in particular, poor housing conditions and low
education) affect another 30 percentof the population. Health indicators,school enrollment rates and
access to and reliability o f infrastructureservices appear to be in line with nationalincome per capita. In


  The Labor Law adopted in July 2005 helped significantly ease labor market restrictions. With Fund and Bank
support, the Government is working to harmonizebases for social security contributions and eliminating minimum
thresholdsfor paying contributionsthat boostthe tax wedge on low-wageearners.


                                                       3

particular,there have been large improvements in access to secondary and tertiary education over the last
15 years. This being said, access and quality of the services receivedby the poor or less affluent people
lagconsiderably behindthe non-poor.

                   c.        MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                                      OUTLOOK

14.      The Government's ambitious program, supported by the PDPL series, should help reduce
the rigidities holding back stronger expansion of the economy's productive capacity. Assuming
continued regional stability and limited impact from the ongoing turmoil in international financial
markets, improvement in the domestic political dialogue and further progress toward EU and NATO
accession, the macroeconomic outlook is positive. Real GDP growth is likely to remain broadly
unchangedat about 5 percent in2008 and strengthento about 6 percent a year over the mediumterm.

15.      Under the IMF-supported program, the Government is committed to sustain fiscal and
monetaryprudence and accelerate progress in advancingstructural reforms. The Government plans
to limit the fiscal deficit to 1-1.5 percent o f GDP over the mediumterm, with the shift from a surplus in
2007 reflecting further cuts in personal and corporate income tax rates, larger capital outlays and
increased current transfers, wages and pensions. The Government is committedthat the modest deficit be
accompanied by improved budget quality, including harmonized bases for collecting social security
contributions, elimination of minimum thresholds for paying contributions and higher relative share of
investment. The proposeddeficit target is consistent with public debt remainingbroadly stable relativeto
GDP at about 30 percenta3

16.      Improvements in the investment climate should help boost imports of machinery and other
investment goods and contribute to widening the current account deficit to about 5-6 percent of
GDP over the medium term from 3.1 percent in 2007; the wider deficit should be readily
financeable, nonetheless. Export growth should strengthen, as structural reforms (both those supported
under the PDPL and others outside its scope) help expand export capacity and strengthen
competitiveness. Privatization receipts and inflows of greenfield FDI should help finance the current
account deficit and limit gross external debt to about 35 percent of GDP. Gross external financing
requirements are projectedto amount to about $1.1-1.2 billion a year over the mediumterm. In addition
to a modest build-up in foreign exchange reserves, these will finance he current account deficit and
principal repayments. Debtsustainabilityis not likely to be a concern duringthe currentCPS period.


                                 111.      THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

17.      The current Government was elected on the basis of an ambitious reform agenda in July
2006 and took office in August 2006. The Government's program is based on an election manifesto
entitled "Rebirth in 100 Steps" and was prepared in consultation with local governments, trade unions,
nongovernment organizations, academia and the business community. The main goal of the manifesto is
to boost economic growth to 6-8 percent over the next few years, helping reduce high unemployment.
The program focuses on increasing investment, attracting larger inflows of foreign direct investment,
fighting corruption, and acceleratingthe country's EU and NATO accession. The key elements of the
programinclude:




3 These ratios are relative to GDP that is not fully adjusted for the size of the large non-observedeconomy (NOE).
Current official estimates o fNOE amount to about 15-20 percent of the observed economy; unofficial estimates are
twice as large.

        Fiscal policy reform: Reducing public expenditures by 2 percent of GDP by 2010 from about
        34 percent in 2006 while increasingthe share of investment, education, and health expenditures;
        radical reformof tax policy and administration; and overhaulof customs.

        Infrastructure development: Expansion of the road, electricity generation, and irrigation
        networks, including through concessions and public-private partnerships; reduction of
        telecommunication costs by increasing competition and stimulating internet penetration; and
        railwaymodernization.

        Overhaulof market institutions: Simplifying company and property registration, and licensing
        requirements; increasing labor market flexibility; completing the land cadastre and real estate
        registry; granting greater rights to minority shareholders and creditors; facilitating execution of
        commercial contracts; simplifying bankruptcy procedures, and stimulating growth of private
        credit bureaus.

        Improving governance: Raising FYR Macedonia's ranking in Transparency International's
        corruption perception index from the bottom third to the top half by 2010, by reducing
        discretionary rights of public employees, adopting a legal framework for regulating conflict o f
        interest; strengthening transparency of public procurement, and establishing an agency for
        fighting organized crime.


                   IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

                                         A.      LINKTOTHE CPS

18.     The Bank and the Government prepared jointly the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY07-10 to ensure that Bank operations support the most important elements of the
Government program. The CPS aims to support the Government in advancing EU integration. The
CPS has two complementary pillars: (i)foster economic growth and job creation, increase living
standards for all, and (ii)public service delivery and supportinggood governance.

19.     The PDPLZ and the proposed PDPL3 form the core of the CPS, accountingfor one-fourthof
the proposed lending under the CPS's base case. A new DPL ($20 million), planned to build on the
existingPDPL series, is targetedfor FY10. To maximizethe impact o fthe PDPLseries, the Bank already
complemented it by investment loans and analytical and advisory services in the last CAS. The Health
project, the Business EnvironmentReformand InstitutionalStrengthening project(BERIS), and the Legal
and Judicial Implementation and Institutional Support project (LJIIS) have been designed and
implementedin many respects to support the PDPL-supportedprogram. All of these investment loans
have an implementationperiodwhich will carry them throughthe new CPS.

                     B.      COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

20.     The IMF standby arrangement has a heavy structural component reinforcing several
reforms supported under the PDPLs. The Bank and Fund teams have coordinatedto ensure consistent
policy advice, with areas o f overlap in support of politically challengingand importantreformswhere the
weight of both institutions would be needed. Coordination has included participation in each other's
preparation missions and extensive intra-mission meetings between the two teams. In areas also
supported by the PDPL, since 2005 the IMF has provided technical assistance on the banking law and
banking reform and supported a resident central bank advisor. The Fund and Bank carriedjointly the
FSAPin 2003 and are working on an FSAPupdate in 2008.




                                                      5

21.      The PDPL team has worked closely with other donors active in FYR Macedonia, and
program components are designed in close consultationwith donors active in the particular areas
of support. Team members have exchangedviews with the European Commissionon the reformagenda.
Other active donors and the key areas o f involvement supported by the PDPL3 include the Dutch
Government (private sector development,judicial reformsand decentralization),the EuropeanAgency for
Reconstruction(judicial reform and decentralization), and the USAID (reforms of the judiciary and the
business environment, and decentralization). The Dutch Government has also provided trust funds to
provide importanttechnical assistance to several institutionsimplementingthe PDPLprogram.


                                 C.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNING

22.      The proposed PDPL is based on a series of recent economic and sector work. The Country
Economic Memorandumof September 2003 focused on reforms of the labor market and the investment
climate to helptackle high unemployment. The FSAP focused on issues of corporate and financial sector
governance, bank and insurance regulationand supervision, the legalandjudicial framework. The CFAA
(2003) and CPAR (2003) built on the analysis o f the 2000 PER to form the basis for PSMAL-supported
reforms in public expenditure management, includinginternal and externalaudit, public procurement, and
budget formulation and execution. The 2007 PEIR focused on issues related to the structure and
outcomes of public spending and helped sharpen the reform efforts in the health sector. The Judicial
Reform Assessment (2005) informed PDPL preparation in judicial reform. A ROSC on corporate
governance, a study on financial sector governanceand a diagnostic on financial sector supervision(all in
2005) helped prepare the PDPL2 and the proposed PDPL3, including the comprehensive supervisory
development planand improvements to the legalframework for corporate and bank governance.


                      V.       THE PROPOSEDPDPL REFORMPROGRAM

                             A.       OVERVIEW OF THE PDPLPROGRAM

23.      Several factors have historicallydiscouraged growth in output, exports and employment in
FYR Macedonia. These have includedan inefficient and opaquejudicial system that obstructs creditor,
contract and property rights and has hampered the effectiveness of key government agencies and
supervisory bodies from enforcing administrative sanctions. Inflexible product and labor markets, high
payroll taxes, a burdensomeregulatory environment, and poor corporate and financial sector governance
have also impeded employment and business creation. A poorly functioning bankruptcy regime has
hinderedfirm exit. These flaws in the investment climate have been compounded by weak public sector
governanceto further undermine investorsentiment.

24.      The objective of the PDPLs is to support the Government in tackling this interconnected
agenda through improving: (i)the investment climate and (ii)governance and efficiency of the public
sector. The PDPLl was approved by the Bank Board in October 2005 and the PDPL2 in February 2007.
Reforms supported by the proposed PDPL3 are well underway. A comprehensive judicial reform has
been launched to firmly establish the rule of law includingcreditor, contract and propertyrights. Reforms
aimed at simplifying regulatory formalities have been accelerated, and are complementing efforts to
facilitate efficient entry and exit o f firms. Banking supervision and governance are also being
strengthened.    Reforms initiated under the PSMAC and PSMAL to build a meritocratic, rules-based,
transparent public sector through the continuation of public administrationreforms, health care reforms,
and decentralizationas envisagedunder the Ohrid agreement are carriedout.

25.      Sustained improvements in the investment climate would also require a reduction in
perceivedpolitical and regionalrisk. Suchreductionsshould result from the continuedimplementation
of the Ohrid Agreement, steady progress toward eventual EU accession, and the successful
implementationof a final status arrangement in neighboringKosovo.

26.     Table 2 summarizes the reform areas the issues and actions supported under each of the
two pillars of the PDPL program. The attached policy matrix provides more detail. The investment
climate pillar includes reform of the judiciary, labor markets, the financial sector and the business
regulatory environment. The public sector pillar includes public administration reform, health care
reform and decentralization.     The team has followed good practice principles on conditionality in
agreeing and preparing the policy matrix with the Government (Box 1).

27.     All eight prior actions have been done. Annex 13 compares the prior actions as currently
formulated with the wording in the PDPL2 program document. The trigger (indicative prior action) at
PDPL2 stage on the Health Provider Law has been converted into a benchmark, reflectingthe longer time
the Government needed to prepare the law; the law is now prepared and is awaiting Government and
Parliament approval. The wording on three other prior -actionshas been slightly amended.

                             Box 1:Good Practice Principleson Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The PDPL program is in line with both the previous Government's May 2005 reform agenda (and December 2004
Judicial Reform Strategy) and the current Government's 100 steps program which lay out FYR Macedonia's
comprehensive economic policy. The Bank's analytic work (the JudicialReformAssessment, PEIR, CFAA, CPAR,
and Corporate GovernanceROSC) has contributed substantiallyto the design ofthe Government's program.
Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The PDPL series is summarized in an agreed policy matrix which outlines actions over the medium-term with clear
outcome goals. The agreed matrix has been modified slightly as the program evolved. The Deputy Prime Minister
for Economic Affairs coordinates the program for the Government and assigns specific responsibility for
implementing and monitoring the program to various Government agencies. The Government and the Bank have
also closely coordinated the reform program with other development partners (the EAR, the EuropeanCommission,
the IMF, the USAID, the DFID, and the Dutch Government).           Several of the donors have financed technical
assistance to supportthe design and implementation of the reforms.
Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The reform program is based on, and is part of the Government's strategies and programs. It reflects the intensive
structural and institutionalreforms needed across sectors for successful EU integrationfor completing the transition
to a well functioning market economy. At the start of each operation in the series, the Cabinet has reviewed and
endorsed the reform program at a formal Government session. The PDPL program is part of a larger Government
reform program aimed at EU integration which has had broad support across the political spectrum. Several
measures of this broader program have required two-thirds majority support in Parliament (such as the amendments
to the Constitutionand organic laws essential for judicial reform).
Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The PDPL program focuses on actions that are critical in terms o f achieving the set outcome goals. The PDPLl
program consisted of six prior actions and 18 benchmarks. The PDPL 2 program consists of nine prior actions and
20 benchmarks. The PDPL3 program consists o f eight prior actions and 17 benchmarks.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
Progress made with the implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals is monitored on a regular
basis: a progress matrix, which outlines the status of reforms and outcome indicators, is updated periodically and
circulated among ministriesand agencies. The proposedPDPL3 has beentaken into account in the 2008 budget and
the Government's macroeconomicframework.


                         B.      PILLAR 1:IMPROVING THE INVESTMENTCLIMATE

Judicial Reform

28.      Outcome Goals: The efficient, effective and fair enforcement of creditor, contract and property
rights is crucial for building an investor-friendly business climate. The EC has also made the proper,
efficient functioning of independentjudicial institutions a key criterion in its annual assessment of FYR
Macedonia. Two indicators are: EC assessment o f the judicial sector showing annual progress in adapting
to EU standards and best practices; and a 10 percent decrease in the civil case workload by June 30, 2007
over the June 2005 baseline of 6101 civil cases as measured by the USAID Court Modernization
Program's (CMP) for seven pilot courts.




                                                          8

29.     Progress towards Goal: On the first indicator, the November2007 EC assessment of thejudicial
sector noted progress in implementingthejudicial reform strategy, with the new court structure gradually
introducedand implementationof the Laws on Civil Procedure and Enforcementimproving enforcement
of court judgments.       The assessment noted that delays were encountered and that sustained
implementationhas not taken hold and will requirea broader consensus. As the reforms supported by the
PDPLs will have their full impact only over time, they will be reflected more fully in later EC
assessments. On progress toward reduction of the civil case workload, USAID's CMP performance
measures reveal a steady decrease in the civil case backlog. The backlog decreased by 9.4 percent
(576 cases) from June 2005 to June 2007. This is very close to the targeted 10percent reduction,with the
modest difference reflectingthe continuedstable inflow of new civil cases intothe pilot courts.

30.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: In December 2004, the Government adopted a
comprehensive Strategy on the Reform of the Judicial Sector (Reform Strategy) as a first step in
modernizingFYR Macedonia'sjudicial institutions. In mid-2005, the Government adopted a new Law
on Civil Procedure, Law on Enforcement and Law on General Administrative Procedureswhich aimed at
removingproceduralobstacles to reachingand enforcingjudicial decisions and improvingthe fairness of
administrative decision making. Amendments to the Constitution in December 2005 were an essential
element o f the Reform Strategy and helped facilitate restructuring of the judiciary and the courts.
Revision of key legislation took place in May 2006 with the adoption of new Laws on Courts,
Administrative Disputesand Misdemeanors, each of which addressed issues to improve the organization,
efficiency and effectiveness of the court system.

3 1.    While each of these laws continues to require a sustained effort and additional resources to
be fully implemented, their impact is starting to be felt. Court procedures have been shortened and
judges have taken more controlover the course of trials. A system o f regulatedand licensedenforcement
agents outside the courts beganoperatingmid-2006and has hadthe effect o f removingenforcement cases
from the workload of the courts. The removal o f misdemeanor cases from the courts required the
amendment o f numerous laws. The transfer o f administrative disputes from the Supreme Court to the
Administrative Court awaited the formationofthe Judicial Council.

32.     FYR Macedonia's bankruptcy procedures have been open to delay and abuse. A new
BankruptcyLaw was adopted in May 2006, and amendmentspassedin July 2007 to remove a limit on the
number of cases new trustees can handle (a PDPL3 prior action). New professionaltrustees are trained,
examined and licensed. The lack of understanding of the role and purpose of bankruptcy in a market
economy, both within and outside the judiciary, will be addressed through training programs for judges
and other bankruptcyactors (supported by the Bank's LJIIS project).

33.     The Government will need to provide sufficient financial and human resources to ensure
effective institutional mechanisms for the supervision, coordination and implementation of the
reform process. Both the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and Ministry of Economy (MOE) are staffing key
supervisory offices necessary to oversee the effective implementation of the recently passed laws. The
Court Administration Office increased its staff and can now conduct functional analyses of court
operations and provide analytical reports necessary for improved court management and administration.
However, as noted by the EC 2007 Assessment, the judicial system continues to lack sufficient financial
resources to meet its operationalneeds and meet the demands of ongoing reforms. The Bank's ongoing
LJIIS project should help provide some o f these resources and expertise. Box 2 presents a more detailed
account o fthe reforms supportedunder the PDPL series.

                                            Box 2: Judicial Reform

Reduce backlog and delays in court proceedings:
o     Progress under PDPLI: A new Law on Civil Procedurewas adoptedto streamline court procedures and provide
judges with greater control over case processing. Salaries for judges were increased.
o     Progress under PDPLZ: A new Law on Courts was adopted to create courts with enhanced and specialized
jurisdiction and specialized divisions within courts. Implementation was delayed while a new Judicial Council has
been formed.
o     Progress under PDPL3: Following the creation of the Judicial Council in October 2007, implementation o f the
Law on Courts began with the creation and staffing of specialized divisions in first instance and enhancedjurisdiction
courts. Implementation o f the new Law on Misdemeanors began with the amendment of several laws, including the
Laws on Public Peace and Order and on Safety in Traffic and on Roads. These amendments will allow agencies to
issue misdemeanor sanctions without court action.

Improve enforcement of court judgments:
o     Progress under PDPLI:        A Law on Enforcement was adopted to remove enforcement cases from court
jurisdiction and create professionalprivate enforcementagents (bailiffs).
o     Progress under PDPLZ: With USAID support, regulations, by-laws and rules were adopted and enforcement
agents trained and licensedfollowing passage of competitive examinations. A self-regulating Chamber o f Enforcement
Agents was created and a public awareness campaignbegun.
o     Progress under PDPL3: The MOJ has created and staffed a supervisory body to oversee the operation of the
enforcement agents and their Chamber. Training for this office will be provided through the Dutch Trust Funds. The
MOJ and the Chamber conducted a review of enforcement operations and identified needs to benefit from continued
USAID support.

Improve regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases:
o     Progress under PDPLI:        A new Bankruptcy Law creating a trustee profession and framework for close
supervisionby the MOE was drafted and introducedto Parliament.
o     Progress under PDPLZ: The Bankruptcy Law was adopted in a different version from the one agreed with the
Bank by including a limit on the number of cases that can be assigned to a trustee. The Government proposed an
amendment to remove this limit but Parliament adopted a limited revision that removes the case limit only until June
30, 2007.
o     Progress under PDPL3: In July 2007, the Governmentamended the Bankruptcy Law to permanentlyremove the
case limit (a PDPL3 prior action). Implementing regulations and rulebookshave been reviewed by the Bank team and
adopted by the MOE. Ninety-two new trustees have been trained and all previoustrustees removed from the register.

Increase speed, transparency and fairness of administrative decisions:
 o    Progress under PDPLI: A Law on General Administrative Procedure providing for international standards o f
transparency, fairness, and due processwas adopted.
o     Progress under PDPLZ: A new Law on Administrative Disputes adopted to movejurisdiction over these cases
from the Supreme Court to a new Administrative Court (AC).
o     Progress under PDPL3: Creation of the new AC was delayed from May to December 2007 due to political
 impasse over the composition of the Judicial Council which appoints it. (The AC will continue to be supportedby the
Bank's LJIIS project.).

Increase institutional capacity to implement and monitor reforms Strategy:
 o    Progress under PDPLI: A disagreement between the Judiciary and Ministry of Finance (MOF) delayed the
permanent staffing of the Court Administrative Office (AO) although USAID funds were used to provide consultant
staffing in the interim. An Advisory Council was created to monitor the implementation of the new Civil Procedure
Law.
o     Progress under PDPLZ: Agreement was reached and the A 0 hired full-time staff, The A 0 has begun to use
automated management and budgeting systems. The Judicial Reform Council has issued bi-annual reports on the
 implementation of the Reform Strategy.
 o    Progress under PDPL3:        The use of the automated management and budget systems has improved the
monitoring, analytical and reporting capacities o f the Court Budget Council.

Labor Market Reform

34.      Outcome Goals: The PDPLs support the Government in creating a more conducive environment
for job creation and enhancementof social dialogue. Short-term monitoring indicators include: the share
of workforce with formal labor contracts, the share of employed youth, the share of workers with part-
time and fixed term contracts, and an increase in the number of contributors to payroll taxes.

35.      Progress towards Goal: The employment rate rose from 35 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004
to 41 percent in the third quarter o f 2007, while youth employment increased from 13.4 percent to
20.4 percent over the same period. The number of registeredjob contracts concluded rose by 34 percent
and fixed-term contracts increased by 64 percent in January-November 2006 from a year earlier. The
share of fixed-term contracts rose from 44 percent of new contractsto 53 percent over the same period.

36.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: A new Labor Relations Law enacted in 2005
balances protection of workers' rights with increased labor market flexibility. The Law on Employment
and Insurance in Case of Unemployment was amended in 2005 and in 2006 to help reinforce incentives
for job seekers to re-enter the labor market. The maximum duration o f unemployment benefit payment
was reduced from 14 months to 12 months, and the maximum benefit amount was cut from 100 percent
of the average wage inthe economy to 80 percent.The Law on Employment Incentives (2006) has helped
improve the employability of older workers by offering to pay the pension and disability insurance
contribution ifan employer hires workers from a group of eligible individuals.

37.      Enforcement of labor legislationand protection of workers' rights are serious issues in FYR
Macedonia. In2007, almost 3,000 cases were submitted to the Labor Inspectorate. The Confederation of
Trade Unions received numerous complaints on violations of workers' rights, with most complaints
related to wage arrears, unpaid annual leave, and unpaid social contributions. The work load of various
institutions in resolution of complaints on labor issues is enormous, and legal costs for claimants are high.
Alternative dispute resolution (particularly mediation) is widely accepted internationally as an important
mechanism to resolve labor disputes. Box 3 presents a more detailed account of the reforms supported
underthe PDPL series.


                                         Box 3: Labor Market Reform


0    Enhancelabor market flexibility:
     o    Progress under PDPLI: A new Labor Relations Law was enacted which: (i) promotes more diversified
     employment contracts, by ending restrictions on the use o f fixed-term, temporary and part-time employment
     contracts while allowingfor a provisionwhereby the cumulativeduration of fixed-termcontracts cannot exceed
     4 years; (ii) relaxes pre-conditions for valid dismissal and limit severance pay to a maximum o f 6 individual
     monthly salaries; (iii) increasesthe scope for overtime work by increasing the yearly limit on overtime to 190
     hours, with lower levels for minors; (iv) redefines the collective bargaining framework. The law stipulates that
     membership intrade unions and employers' associationsis strictly voluntary. The law sets rules for determining
     which parties may represent employers and employees in negotiatingcollective agreements.
     o    Progress under PDPLZ:        A legislative framework establishing alternative labor dispute resolutions
     mechanismswas drafted.
     o    Progress under PDPL3: The Law on Peaceful Resolution o f Labor Disputes was adopted in July 2007.
     The 2008 budgetenvisages that the Council for PeacefulResolution of Disputeswill be set up.

StrengtheningFinancialSector Regulationand Supervision

38.      Outcome Goals: The PDPLs supported the authorities in strengthening banking sector regulation
and supervision and enhancing bank transparency and governance. Indicators include strengthened
supervisory capacity of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM), with migration toward
increasedtransparency, disclosure, and a risk based supervisory approach leading to improved regulatory
compliance and concrete corrective actions with specific banks.

39.      Progress towards Goal: The NBRM has expended meaningful effort in strengthening banking
supervision and promoting a more risk-based approach. Progress in the implementation of the objectives
set in the Supervisory Development Plan (SDP) prepared with World Bank support, is generally good.
The Banking Law and the NBRM law have been strengthened and the accounting framework brought
closer to international financial reporting standards. Fit and proper screening procedures have been
strengthened in compliance with the new Banking Law. The NBRM is in the process of re-licensingbank
activities, shareholders and bank administrators. Recent changes in the ownership structure of banks are
expectedto further strengthen bank governanceand foster competition.

40.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: Informed by the 2003 FSAP and with technical
assistance from the Bank, IMF and other donors, the NBRM's SDP is guiding reform implementation.
The new legal framework has provided the NBRM with the tools to require transparent ownership
structures and to apply rigorous fit and proper screening procedures to assess banks' compliance with
anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorism financing (CTF).                The NBRM has adequate
authority to address board members, hold significant shareholders, boards and management responsible
and accountable for the prudent operation of banks, and take remedial actions based on breach of duty or
lack of effective internal control and monitoring mechanisms (including risk management systems). The
new legislative framework has also provided the NBRM with powers to enforce accurate financial
statement and corporate transparency. Box 4 presents a more detailed account of the reforms supported
under the PDPL series.


                      Box 4: StrengtheningFinancial Sector Regulation and Supervision

  Strengthen banking supervisionand regulation:
  o     Progress under PDPLl: The Supervision Department of the NBRM undertook a diagnostic o f its supervisory
  process in parallel with an assessment o f the governance framework for banks. The recommendations from the
  diagnostic were embedded in the SDP. The SDP maps a set of reforms to help the supervisor migrate towards a more
  risk-based supervisory approach to supervision and further strengthen bank governance. Other recommendationsof
  the diagnostic were integratedinto draft revisions ofthe NBRM Law and the BankingLaw.
  o     Progress under PDPLZ: The SDP is being implemented with the help o f an IMF-sponsored resident advisor.
  Progress in the implementation of the SDP was generally good although delayedrelativeto the originaltime frames, in
  part due to efforts neededto focus on the new BankingLaw and the amendedNBRM Law enacted in mid-2007.
  o     Progress under PDPL 3: Implementation of the SDP continues to be substantially on track. The development of
  the new risk-based methodology has been completed and the formal adoption of the related operational manual is
  expectedfor January 2008.

  Strengthening compliance of banks with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing
  (CTF) requirements.

  o     Progress under PDPLZ: To strengthen the AML/CFT regulatory framework for banks, the NBRM reviewed the
  NBRM manual on assessing banks' compliance with AML and CFT requirements. Following the review, in January
  2006 the NBRM approvedstronger AML/CFT policiesand proceduresfor institutionslicensedby the NBRM.
  o     Progress under PDPL 3. Following the approval o f the new bankinglaw, the NBRM adopted new fit and proper
  screeningprocedures in July 2007.

Improvingthe BusinessEnvironment

41.     Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the Government goal of improving the business
environment. Indicators include the improved perception of foreign and domestic investors of the
investment climate and reducedadministrativeand regulatory barriersto investment.

42.     Progress towards Goal: FYR Macedoniawas ranked among the top ten reformers in the world
according to the 2008 Doing Business survey, reflecting Government efforts in improving the business
environment. Business registrationhas been revamped, with the time to registerreduced from 48 days to
5 days (3 days after the survey); the cost decreased by a third to 7.4 percent of GDP per capita, and the
steps requiredfrom 13 to 7. Together with the introductionof the one-stop system and the attendant cut
in fees and unnecessary procedures, simplified registration has boosted business creation, from 7,500
businesses in 2005 under the old court-based system, to 8,726 in 2006 and to 9,852 in 2007. Additional
improvements, such as the eliminationof the needto submit a letter indicatingthe intentionof the bank to
open an account, the control of the uniquenessof the proposedname and the registrationwith the Agency
for Employmentand PensionFund, will be reflectedinthe 2009 DoingBusiness Survey.

43.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPL has supported regulatory reforms to
reduce administrative and regulatorybarriersthrough: (i) the establishment of regulatory capacities at the
Sector for EconomicPolicies and RegulatoryReforms (SER) in the centre of the Government to advance
regulatory reforms; (ii) the design and implementation of regulatory actions and processes aimed at
streamlining regulatory regimes, and (iii) improved access to information on regulations affecting
business activity. In this framework, the SER has been given the mandate to improve the quality o f
regulations affecting business activity. With support from the SER, the Government launched a
"regulatory guillotine" to streamline all the laws and bylaws and eliminate unnecessary requirements
affectinglegalentities and individuals.

44.     The Government is committed to completing the "regulatory guillotine" during 2008. The
"regulatory guillotine" will affect 65 laws and 481 bylaws. By the end of March 2008, the Government
approved amendments to 37 laws, of which 16 were adopted by Parliament and 21 are pending
Parliament approval. The Government has also eliminated 346 bylaws and amended 28. An additional
97 bylaws will also be eliminated.

45.     The PDPL is supporting the creation of a "Unique National Electronic Registry of
Regulations." The Register is operational. It contains all the laws, bylaws, regulations and forms that
have met the criteriafor retentionand are in force. It will also contain new laws and bylaws, including in
draft form. The Government has also decided to subsequently enhance this register by including all
formalities (certificates, permits, statements and other forms) in order to have a comprehensive list of all
the requirements and proceduresnecessary for doingbusiness in FYR Macedonia.

46.     I n parallel, the Government has decided to implement a RIA system to ensure that future
business regulationsare clear, transparent and business-friendly. The RIA was introduced in March
2008 through amendments to the rules of procedures of the government and a methodology for the
introduction of the RIA, and will be tested through pilots during the first nine months of 2008. This
transition period will helpthe Government improvethe RIA, includingby deciding whether to apply it to
all lawdbylawsor just a subset.

47.     The Government is committed to further strengthenthe corporate governance framework.
To this end, the Company Law has been amended to incorporate some recommendations of the 2005
Reporton Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on CorporateGovernance. Other amendments




                                                     13

                               Box 5: Improving the Business Environment

    Strengthen the corporate governance of the enterprise sector.
    o     Progress under PDPLI: The Government undertook an assessment (ROSC, finalized in 2005) o f the
    corporate governance policy framework and enforcement and compliance practices against OECD principles.
    In parallel, an assessment of the bank governance framework was carried out to identify policy actions to
    promote stronger bank governance. The ROSC provided recommendations to further improve the legal,
    regulatory and institutionalframework for corporate governance. Recommendationsarising from the banking
    governanceassessment were incorporated in the Supervisory Development Plan adopted by the NBRM and/or
    are plannedto be addressedthrough the new draft BankingLaw.
    o     Progress under PDPLZ: Most key ROSC recommendationswere implemented. The new Securities Law
    (November 2005) strengthened the framework for information and ownership disclosure. SEC adopted all
    major by-laws for implementing the new legislative framework for securities. In consultation with relevant
    stakeholders, a new Corporate Governance Code was prepared and adopted by the Macedonia Stock Exchange
    (MSE). The new SEO-NET system of the MSE was introducedto improve disclosure dissemination. The SEC
    prepared and adopteda comprehensive enforcement strategy to reinforce implementation of the new legislative
    framework.
    o     Progress under PDPL 3: The SEC has recently adopted an action plan for implementation o f the
    enforcement strategy. The Government has submitted a package of amendments to the Company Law to the
    Parliament for approval, with the goal to strengthen the overall legal framework for corporate governance and
    bring it closer to the EUacquis.

    Adopt a quality-oriented approach to regulatory reforms to improve the quality of existing and new
    regulations affecting businessactivity.
    o     Progress under PDPL2: In July 2005, the SER was established within the General Secretariat to
    implement regulatory reforms in a systematic manner. The Government launched a "regulatory guillotine" for
    all the laws and bylaws affectingbusinessactivity.
    o     Progress under PDPL3: The "guillotine" process is reaching its final stage. By the end of March 2008,
    the Government approved most of the amendments/regulatory changes and to finalize the package of many
    amendments for which parliamentary approval is required. A "Unique National Electronic Registry" was
    established in March 2008. The Government adopted the rules of procedures of the government to introduce
    the RIA system.

    Implement a business-friendly system for business registration.
    o     Progress under PDPLZ; The Business Registration Law became effective in October 2005. Fifteen laws
    and regulations were amended to allow for the implementation of the new business registration system. The
    "one-stop-shop'' system was introduced on January 1, 2006. The decision upon the business registration
    application mustbe done within 5 days from the day of submissionofthe registrationform.
    o     Progress under PDPL 3: In the framework o f the "regulatory guillotine", the legislative framework for
    business registration, including the law on the "one-stop-shop" was amended to further simplify business
    registrationprocedures and requirements. The Government also approved a simplification of the fee structure
    for business registrationand cut fees in half.

    Enhance the quality of corporate financial reporting.
    o     Progress under PDPLI: A new Audit Law was adopted.
    o     Progress under PDPL2: The implementation o f the law is underway. The Institute o f Certified Auditors
    was established in May 2006 and the Oversight Council in December 2005. The Council is fully operationaland
    is financed by the budget.The Council endorsed the Charter, its Annual Programand Rules of Procedureso f the
    Council, as well as comprehensive overviews of responsibilities. The Council independently oversees the
    regulation of the auditing and accounting professions and monitors the quality of auditing in line with EU
    Directives.

are planned for 2008 to strengthenthe framework for liquidation and address issues related to companies
with blocked accounts. In line with the ROSC recommendations,these amendments will also re-instate
pre-emptive rights and introduce right offers. Following the ROSC recommendations, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) adopteda broad enforcement strategy together with an action plan to guide

                   C.     PILLAR2: STRENGTHENING        PUBLICSECTOR GOVERNANCE

Public Administration Reform

Strategic Management

48.     Outcome Goals: (i) More strategic budget allocations (for priorities under the Government
program) and (ii)more disciplined budget planningand execution. Better discipline o f budget planning
and execution are reflected in: (i) modest differences between budget ceilings established in annual
Budget Circular (BC) and Budget User's (BU's) initial proposed budgets; and (ii)modest average
deviations of BU's actual expendituresfrom budgeted.

49.     Progress towards Goal: Progress is being made towards achieving the goal o f more strategic
budget allocations. On the budget formulation side, the 2006 Budget allocated 15.1 percent of budgeted
resources to priorities identified in the Government Program, compared to 14.1 percent in the 2005
budget, although this share dropped to 10.0 percent in the 2007 Budget. The decline in the 2007 budget
allocationto these programpriorities reflectedthe uncertainty at the time of the mid-2006parliamentary
elections. On the budget execution side, actual outlays on Government Program priorities rose from
5.6 percent of spending in 2005 to 7.1 percent in 2006. Data for the 2007 outcome is not yet available.
Progress is less steady on improving budgetary discipline. The average difference between budget
ceilings established in the annual BC and BU's initial proposed budgets was 9.3 percent in 2007, down
from 13.1 percent in 2006 but still much higherthan the 3.4 percent in 2005. Actual expendituresdeviated
from the budgetedby 3.5 percent in 2006, up from 1.3 percent in 2005, and 3.0 percent in 2004.

50.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals:                 The Government's ambitious public
administration reform agenda addresses two interlinked public administration functions: strategic
management and human resource management. The strategic management reforms aim to: (i)enhance
the capacity of the Government to align policies and broad programmatic expenditure patterns with its
policy priorities, as reflected in the Government Program, and (ii)improve budget discipline to keep
budgeted and actual expenditures in line with Government's strategic priorities and ensure cost-effective
use of budget resources by Budget Users.

51.     The Government has improved its capacity to make difficult policy choices. From 2003 the
Government implementedseveral improvements of the budget formulation process, includingthree-year
medium term fiscal strategies and hard budget ceilings for each of the first-line budget entities. The
General Secretariat (GS) and the MOF preparedstrategic plansto ensure that their organizations would be
equippedto deliver on the stronger policy and fiscal managementrole envisioned by new legislation.The
issuance in September 2003 of a Government Decision on the "Adoption o f the Methodology for
Strategic Planning and Preparation of an Annual Work Program of the Government o f the Republic o f
Macedonia" was a milestone. Box 6 presentsin detail the reforms supportedunder the PDPL series.

Human Resource Management

52.     Outcome Goals: The human resource management reforms aim to: (i) develop a professional,
politically neutralcivil service, managed on the basis of merit, rather than political loyalty, and capable of
attracting, retainingand motivating required human capital skills; (ii)expand salary reforms beyondthe
civil service to encompass the rest of the central public administration; and (iii)ensure fiscal
sustainability o f the wage bill. Some indicators include: (i) a more decompressed civil service salary



                                                    15

structure; (ii)more effective civil service establishment control; (iii)increased attractiveness of civil
service employment; (iv) salary structures within the public administration that ensure a more consistent,
yet affordable, relationship between public and relevant private sector remuneration for given sets of
human capital; (v) a fiscally sustainable wage bill; and (vi) improved tracking and reporting of the results
of human resource managementreform efforts inthe public administration.


                                          Box 6: Strategic Management

    Develop institutional arrangements and capacitiesthat permit more effective strategic prioritization.
    o     Progress under PDPLI: All ministries except the Ministry o f Interior completed this full strategic
    planning process as part of the 2005 budgetprocess(for the 2006 budget).
    o     Progress under PDPL2: All ministries and state administration bodies complied with this strategic
    planning processas part of the 2007 budget preparation. The legal framework governing strategic prioritization
    and budget processes is appropriately designed to align Government priorities and budget allocations; i.e. to
    institutionalize the strategic prioritization process. Over the next two years, the Government will continue
    implementation of the strategic planning methodology. This effort will continue to be closely linked with
    budget formulation improvements and Acts of Systematization process to ensure that staff redeployment
    challenges are effectively addressed. The Government will also improve monitoringof the costs and impacts of
    key programs and policies and ensure that such information is widely and publicly available to foster debate
    about their effectiveness.
    o     Progress under PDPL3: There has been solid progress on advancing strategic prioritization. All
    ministries are required to prepare and submit Strategic Plans (SPs), and to use those as the basis for preparing
    annual budget proposals. Training of civil servants throughout the central administration on SP requirements
    and issues has continued. The GS completed its planned strategic planning training to more than 200 civil
    servants by the end of June 2007. SP technical assistance being mobilized. The GS has undertaken an
    assessment o f capacities in all lineministries with assistancefrom SIGMA.

53.      Progress towards Goal: The compression ratio increased from 3.6 (end of 2004) to 4.2 (2005)
and 4.4 (2006). More effective civil service establishment control was achieved by requiring clearance of
the Civil Servants Agency (CSA) for all new civil servant hires.                Attractiveness of civil service
employment has improved, with the average number of qualified applicants per advertised position rising
from 4.5 in 2004 to 5.3 in 2005 and 33.1 in 2006. Initial steps toward a broader public sector salary
setting reform have been undertaken. An initial publidprivate sector salary survey was completed and
will be undertaken biannually by the State Statistics Office (SSO) starting in 2008. A draft Law on Public
Sector Salaries has been prepared and will be further revised, with the help of technical assistance and
advice from the World Bank. A fiscally sustainable wage bill has been achieved with expenditures on
wages and salaries falling from 8.0 percent in 2003 to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2006.

54.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The 2000 Law on Civil Servants (LCS) provided
the legislative framework for a meritocratically managed civil service system. The Law provided for a
uniform, rule-based and less compressed salary structure; uniform definitions of the types of positions
encompassed by the civil service; and the establishment of the CSA responsible for establishing and
enforcing civil service management policies and procedures. Implementation of the LCS has proven
challenging, but those challenges continue to be met. A new salary structure was phased in during April
2004-March 2006. Despite the provisions of the law and its subsidiary legislation, sectoral ministries
were initially able to bypass the CSA, recruiting staff for civil service positions without competitive
exams or review by the CSA. These shortcomings were addressed under the PDPL2. That mechanism
continues to function. The remaining challenges include the need to ensure continued implementation of
the LCS to create a depoliticized, meritocratically managed civil service by attracting and retaining the
human capital skills needed; continuously improving that legal framework to reflect lessons learned; and
addressing pay reform issues for those public employees who are not civil servants in a fiscally
sustainable way. Box 7 presents a more detailed account of the reforms supported by the PDPL program.

                                 Box 7: HumanResourceManagement

    Develop a professional, politically neutral civil service, managed on the basis of merit, rather than
    political loyalty.
    o     Progress under PDPLI: The civil service recruitment enforcement mechanism was solidified by
    embeddingit inthe new Organic Budget Law.
    o     Progress under PDPLZ: The legal framework governing the civil service has been reviewedto document
    lessons learned from its implementation and appropriate revisions have been made in that legal framework. The
    Civil ServiceAgency has reviewed LCS implementation, and preparedboth a Strategic Plan and an Operational
    Programconsistent with that plan. Under PDPL3, the plan will be implementedand the LCS will be revised.
    o     Progress under PDPL3; The CSA completed its SP and a review of implementationof the LCS in August
    2007. Significant recent accomplishments identified in that report include the adoption by Government of a
    new Regulation on Internal Organization and a new Regulation on Job Title Descriptions within the civil
    service. The former regulation imposes minimum staffing sizes for most organizational units and mandates
    standardized structures for key common fhctions (including HRM and strategic prioritization). The latter
    expands the descriptors for CSjob titles to include the role of the positionand to whom the position reports, the
    purposes/objectiveso fthe positionand the primaryduties and tasks or activities

    Revise salary structures within FYR Macedonia's public administration to ensure consistently
    competitive yet fiscally sustainable remuneration across required types of human capital.
    o     Progress under PDPLI: The civil service salary decompressioncontinuedto be implementedas planned.
    o     Progress under PDPLZ:        The civil service salary decompression was implemented as agreed and
    completed as of 31 March 2006. The Government has taken a phased approach to reforming the legal
    framework governing salaries within the broader public administration (beyond the civil service). As a basisfor
    a broader salary reform in the public sector an initial survey o f public and private sector salaries was completed
    in June 2006. The State Statistical Office (SSO) has committed to repeatingsuch a survey on a regular basis. A
    draft Law on Public Wages was prepared in September 2004, followed by a revised version in June 2006. The
    Government has also begun monitoring and publishingsystematic data to help evaluate whether core objectives
    o f the Government's human resource management efforts are being achieved. Monitoring was launched under
    earlier Bank-financedoperationscontinued underthe PDPLs.
    o     Progress under PDPL3: Institutionalization of the public/private sector salary survey is proceeding
    satisfactorily, and the SSO will start the survey in 2010. Regarding the preparation of a legal framework to
    govern salary setting in the central public administration, progress has been difficult. The Bank provided
    extensive feedback on both the initial draft law and the criteria such a law should satisfy. The Government's
    working group on this law is now mobilizing technical assistance. A consultant has been selected, financed
    through a Dutch Trust Fund to assist the working group. The institutionalizationof the salary survey provides
    complementsthe work on the legal framework.

Health Reform

55.      Outcome Coals: The PDPLs support Government efforts to improve the transparency and
governance of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). Indicators include: (i)no new HIF arrears to the five
largest Health Care Institutions (HCIs); (ii)no new HIF arrears to suppliers; (iii)no new health sector
arrears in 2007; (iv) improved access and quality of care improved in HCIs implementing budget ceilings
(10 percent increase in hospital admission rate, 15 percent decline in average length of hospital stay,
30 percent reduction in the number of re-admissions for the same condition during a 3 month period,
reduction in the number of referrals to outpatient specialists and hospitals by 10 percent, improved patient
satisfaction measuredby surveys).

56.      Progress towards Goals: As of September 30, 2007 (the last available HIF quarterly financial
report), no new arrears to HCIs, suppliers or within the health sector were recorded. The stock of HIF
arrears decreased by a third from MKD 2.45 billion in December 2006 to MKD 1.63 billion in September
2007. These results do not take into account the impact of the salary increase for health personnel which



                                                          17

became effective in September 2007. The fourth quarter report will provide information on this. Contracts
signed between the HIF and the HCIs in 2007 envisage linking 10 percent of HCI budgets to regular
reporting on five performance indicators (hospital admission rate, average length of hospital stay, number
of re-admissions for the same condition during a three-month period, the number of referrals to outpatient
specialists and hospitals by 10 percent, improvedpatient satisfaction measuredby surveys).

57.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: Improving governance and management of the
health sector is critical for improving the efficiency of spending and the delivery of health services.
Several studies have identified significant public financial management risks associated with the HIF. The
2004 CFAA identified many weaknesses in the HIF managementof health expenditures as contributing to
the chronic build-up o f arrears among HCIs and suppliers. The 2007 Public Expenditure Review notes
that in addition to the fiscal and corruption risks posed by poor financial management within HIF, there
are also concerns with the quality, fiscal sustainability, efficiency and accessibility of health services in
FYR Macedonia. Public opinion polls have consistently rated health services as "poor or very poor."
The fiscal sustainability challenge in the health sector in FYR Macedonia has stemmed from several
institutional weaknesses, including the absence of essential budgetary functions and spending controls,
contracting practices that do not generate hard budget constraints for HCIs, a weak HIF governance
framework and an unsustainable benefits package.


                                              Box 8: Health Reform

    Strengthen HIFGovernance and the health policy making environment.
    o     Progress under PDPLI; The Health Insurance Law (HIL) was drafted and submitted to Parliament. The
    draft focused on changes in the HIF Board. The number o f members was reduced from 13 to 7; the criteria and
    process for selecting Board members were changed and made free of political influence. To promote strong
    oversightby the MOH and MOF, and until such time as the Boardproved its effectiveness, veto power was granted
    to MOH and MOF representativeson the Board, and results of HIF Board meetings were required to be published
    on the HIF website, thereby increasingpublic scrutiny and accountability.
    o     Progress under PDPL2: The changes to the HIL were adopted by Parliament. The new HIF Board was
    appointedwithin five months of adoption of the HIL.The results of HIF Board meetings are publishedon the HIF
    website. A National Health Strategy outlining reforms (e.g. benefits package, rightsizing the health sector,
    adopting improved contractingand payment mechanisms for providers) was adopted by the Government, thereby
    layingthe foundation of structural policy reformsto be completedunder PDPL3.
    o     Progress under PDPL3; The HIF Benefits Package is revised and "special programs" were included to help
    improve fiscal sustainability and streamline planning for the health sector. A Health Provider Law has been
    prepared and is set to be adopted by the Government. The law aims to help ensure improved and fiscally
    sustainable service delivery.

    Building Capacity in Budget Planning and Control, Financial Management and Procurement in HIF, MOH,
    and HCIs.
    o     Progress under PDPLI; HCIs began monthly financial reporting to the HIF. The HIF started preparing
    quarterly consolidated HCI financial reports posted on the HIF website. This has helped strengthen HIF and HCI
    capacity in financial reportingand monitoringand improvedtransparency.
    o     Progress under PDPL2: A plan for addressingHIF/HCI arrears was developed and implementation begun.
    In 2006 hardbudget ceilingswere introducedfor all HCIs, internal audits were conducted of the three largest HCIs
    and baselinedata for performance monitoringamong pilot HCIs was collected. Financialreports of HIF and HCIs
    are regularlypublished on the HIF website and the SA0 conducted external audits o f selectedHCIs.
    o     Progress under PDPL3; The Government will continue implementation o f the plan to address validated
    HIF/HCI arrears and achieve agreed targets, and will continue implementing performance-basedbudgetswith hard
    budget constraints. An international tender will be completed for all drugs on the positive list. With Bank
    assistance, the Government will further pursue these reforms through the adoption of output-based payment
    mechanisms (payments based on Diagnostic Related Groups or DRGs), encouraging all general hospitals to
    implement rationalizationplans; and implementingreference-basedpricing for drugs.

58.     The Government enacted a new Health Insurance Law that helped revamp the HIF
governance structure. Efforts thereafter focused on the preparationo f a medical map to help formulate
a hospitalrationalizationplan. The medicalmap has been prepared, but more work is neededto draft the
plan. Work has started on preparationof a new Health Provider Law. The Law will provide the legal
framework for HCIs. Box 8 presentsa more detailedaccount of the reformsthe PDPLs have supported.

Decentralization

59.      Outcome Goals:        The decentralization component of the PDPL program supports the
Government's efforts to produce a stable, financially viable system of local government consistent with
its obligationsunder the Ohrid Agreement. Indicators include a stable and transparent revenue structure
of local governments and a reductionin municipalliabilities to sustainable levels.

60.     Progress towards Goals; A stable and transparent revenue structure has been established and
implementedsince July 2005. The Government has maintaineda strict `no-bailout' policy with respectto
municipalarrears. The ratio of arrears to revenues has been reduced to sustainable levels in all but seven
relativelysmalljurisdictions.

61.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: The Ohrid Agreement called for a significant
decentralizationof central government powers. It specifically required Parliament to adopt a new Law on
Local Self Government `reinforcing the powers of elected local officials and substantially enlargingtheir
competencies' (approved in January 2002); a new Law on Local Government Finance to ensure a stable
and transparent source of local revenues (enacted in July 2004); and a new system of territorial
organization based on a new census. The enactment of the Law on Territorial Reorganization(August
2004) was subsequently endorsed in a nationalreferendum in November 2004. Municipal elections were
held in the spring of 2005 on the basis of the new boundaries. The basic legal framework for
decentralizationis now in place. Much remains to be done in terms of implementation. Box 9 presents a
more detailedaccount ofthe reformssupported underthe PDPL series.




                              VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                  A.     POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

62.      The policies supported by the PDPL are expected to contribute substantially to a long-term
reductionin poverty by helpingengender a virtuous cycle of growth in output and employment. As
discussed above, reduction in poverty and unemployment has been slow during 2002-2006, and
unemploymentis a pressing issue. The PDPL-supportedreforms are designed to help reduce obstacles to
business and employment creation (business creationhas accelerated, in part thanks to improvements in
the regulatory environment, as recognized in the 2008 Doing Business report and recent surveys that
indicate that unemployment has begun to decline), reduce the informality in the economy (and thus
helpingworkers gain social protection), improve labor market flexibility (so that it is workers rather than
the positions they hold that are protected). The PDPL is also helping improve the sustainability of the
health system to benefit all citizens. The second phase of decentralizationwill pose risks to the equitable
delivery of social services if not well designed. With that in mind, the PDPL program includesmeasures
to ensure that the design o f Phase 2 of decentralizationwill safeguard equal access to quality education,
an adequate supply of qualifiedteachers and non-teachingstafffor ethnic minorities.

                                                    Box 9: Decentralization

The PDPLshave supportedthe following actions to support the Government's decentralization strategy:


    Adopt a stable and transparent mechanism for financing municipal government.
    0      Progress under PDPLl and PDPLZ: The new Law on Local Government Finance maintained existing local taxes and
    allowed municipalities to retain three percent of the personal income taxes collected within their jurisdictions. The Law
    provided for a revenue sharing system in which three percent of VAT would be distributed among municipalities on a formula
    basis. It did not, however, specify a formula for distributing these funds. Supported by the PDPLl the Government adopted a
    formula largely based on population for the first six months of the reform period (July-December 2005) and for 2006. The
    PDPL2 supported its extension into 2007.
    0      Progress under PDPL3: The formula has been extended to the 2008 budget.

    Reduce municipal arrears.
    0      Progress under PDPLI: At the time the PDPLI was appraised, the total stock of municipal arrears was estimated at
    MKD 2.7 billion (1 percent of GDP). Despiteconsiderable pressure to assume some of the debt, the Government recognized
    that such a move would have created a dangerous precedent and adopted a `no-bailout' policy. Municipalities were encouraged
    to reach individual workout agreements with their creditorsunder court supervision.
    0      Progress under PDPLZ and PDPL3: The `no-bailout' policy has worked well, helping reduce the stock of adjudicated
    debt to MKD 1.8 billion in late 2007. The size of arrears relative to revenueshas been reduced in all but seven relatively small
    jurisdictions.

    Decentralization Strategy.
    0      Progress under PDPLI and PDPLZ: The Law on Local Government Finance sets out a two-phase approach to
    functional decentralization to municipalities. Phase 1 focused on revenue increases and was essentially implemented in all
    municipalities simultaneously.No municipality could graduate to Phase 1 until at least 90 percent of municipalities comprising
    at least 90 percent of the country's population met minimum staffing requirements for financial management and revenue
    collection. Phase 2 is being implemented on a case-by-case basis. This approach has raised two concerns. First, the resulting
    two tier system may complicatereform. Second, the specific criteria for graduation assess compliance with fiscal and financial
    reporting requirements and do not measure readinessto take on additional management responsibilities.
    o      Progress under PDPL3; By the end of 2007, 51 municipalities graduated to Phase 2. Concerns over the two-tier strategy
    have been ameliorated in two ways. First, the threshold for graduation has been set in a way that makes it likely that all
    municipalities will be eligible for Phase 2 by late 2008. Second, key central government controls over responsibilities to be
    decentralized remain in place. Further, the centralizedtreasury system ensures that funds assignedto decentralized functions in
    municipal budgets will be spent accordingly. Given these ameliorating measures, PDPL3 supports the Government strategy.

    Adopt a plan for financing teachers' salaries.
    0      Progress under PDPL3: A key component of the Government's decentralization strategy concerns education. Under
    Phase 1, responsibility for paying the bulk of non-wage operating costs of schools was transferred to the municipalities.
    Starting in 2006, intergovernmentaltransfers for this purpose were distributed to municipalities on the basis of a formula in
    which enrollment was the dominant factor. Under Phase 2, municipalities will obtain direct responsibility for paying teachers'
    salaries, with funding distributed on the basis of block grants earmarked for education. As provided in recent decrees, the
    grants will be distributed largely on the basis of enrollment. Over time, this will substantially improve equity in the allocation
    of education funding. To avoid sudden changes in funding, the decree for primary educationprovides for buffers, i.e., limits on
    the amount of change in funding for any one jurisdiction from one year to the next. (No buffers are required for secondary
    education given that unit costs in secondary educationdo not different significantly from the unit costs implied in the formula.)
    PDPL3 supports this strategy. Over time, as the impact of the buffers dissipates, municipalities with declining enrollments
    will find themselves with insufficient funds to meet existing payrolls and will need to reduce the number of teachers. While
    municipalities have the legal authority to do so, they may still be constrained by the ongoing controls by the Ministry of
    Education and Science (MOES) over the number of teaching positions,restrictionsunder collective bargaining agreements and
    national labor legislation. Over time, the MOES will have to liberalize these controls and/or adopt more systematic criteria for
    exercisingthem.
    o      Decentralization will increase local autonomy over resources but key safeguards remain in place against the
    misappropriation of funds. All municipalities must keeptheir cash balances in the treasury's single account. All disbursements
    from the account are controlled by the treasury, at a sufficient level of detail to ensure that funds are spent as budgeted. In
    addition, the Law on Municipal Finance requires local governments to establish internal auditing policies and procedures in
    accordance with international standards and to submit final accountsto the State Audit Office. Ifthe Chief State Auditor finds
    substantial irregularities in the financial operations of any municipality, the law calls for a modified form of receivership.




                                                                 20

                                     B.        FIDUCIARYASPECTS

63.     The fiduciaryenvironment is suitable for developmentpolicy lending.Thisjudgment is based
on the 2007 Country FiduciaryAssessment (CFA), which in turn builds on the earlier Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2004) and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR,
2002). The Government is working on several of the major weaknesses identified in the CFA. Many of
the recommendations inthe earlier reports have been implementedand others are in progress.

64.      Public procurement: Improvements have taken place after the 2002 CPAR noted several
deficienciesin the Law on Public Procurement (LPP). A new LPP in line with internationalstandards and
best practices was enacted in March 2004 as part of the PSMAL. The Government adopted
comprehensive implementing regulations, promulgated standard procurement documents and forms o f
contract, and establisheda state administrative body for public procurement within the MOF (made fully
operational with staff, resources and terms of reference). The law was amended in 2005 to introduce
electronic procurement, a "one-stop-shop" system for central registrationof tenderers' qualifications,and
the requirement for publishingall contract notices onthe website ofthe Public Procurement Bureau.

65.      Budgeting, accounting and reporting: The Government has made significant progress in
improving central budgetingprocesses. Improvements include the implementationof a multiyear fiscal
plan, the preparation o f government prioritiesand expenditure ceilings for the coming fiscal year, and the
introduction of functional budget classification coding. Extrabudgetary funds (EBFs) and agency
accounts have been integrated under the Treasury single account (TSA). Improved ex-ante controls
resulting from the TSA now apply to all budget entities and EBFs. Financial controls o f the HIF have
been strengthened, and HIF arrears to creditors other than the healthcare institutions have been cleared
and have not resurfaced. Budgetreportinghas improved, with MOF producingcomprehensive reports for
the centralgovernment usingthe TSA within 40 days from the end of the month.

66.      Internal controls and internalaudit: Following the adoption of the Law on Internal Audit in
2004, the MOF implementedinternalaudit units across the government and the municipalities (supported
by the PDPL1). The number of trained staff increased from 57 in 2005 to 79 in 2006. Internal auditors
conductedabout 100 audits, about half o f which were performedby the MOF centralinternalaudit unit.

67.      External audit: There has been substantial progress in strengtheningthe Supreme Audit Office
(SAO). The SA0 is independent from the executive branch and its mandate covers all public sector
activities.The government increasedresourcesfor the SA0 and amended legislationto: requirean annual
audit opinion on the government's annual financial statements; require the auditor to summarize the audit
findings for the year into common themes on high-riskareas for the government to address; adopt a risk-
based audit approach to the annual audit planning process; report on the government's progress in
implementingcurrent and all outstanding audit recommendations; performperformance-basedaudits; and
implement internationalauditing standards covering all aspects of its work. The SA0 implemented the
changes required by law; in 2005, 10 performance audits were undertaken. Twinning arrangements with
the Dutch Court of Accounts were established, and further audit reforms and auditor training are pursued
Assistance in capacity development was providedby the DutchGovernment, the EAR and the Bank.

68.      Further improvements in several areas of procurement and public finance management
could be necessary including: (i) improved reporting on state-owned enterprises; (ii)improved legal
framework for public procurement in line with EU requirements and establishing an effective and
independent complaints review body; (iii) strengthened internal financial controls in the MOES and
consolidationo f progress on financial managementin the HIF; and (iii) improvedSA0 public reporting.

69.      Anticorruptionmeasures:Several anticorruptionmeasures have been put in place, includingthe
internaland externalaudit functions, anticorruptionlaws and amendments. The fight against corruptionis
an important feature o f the new government's program. Institution building and improvements of


                                                   21

standards in the areas o f thejudiciary, police, health, and customs is targeted as well as strengthening of
controls andpunishments for those who do not respect laws and regulations.The areas mentioned are also
supported by the Bank, the EAR and other donors. Even if more transparency is introduced and civil
society engaged in this fight as planned by the Government, the level of corruption will remain a
challenge. The ongoing improvements in the areas of public procurement, internal audit, and
strengtheningof the role of the SA0 contributeto the fight against corruption.

70.     The latest IMF update of the safeguards assessment was completedin February 2006. (The
previous assessment was done in 2003). The update found that the NBRM had taken steps to strengthen
its safeguards framework, and recommendations from the earlier assessmenthad been implemented. This
progress notwithstanding,the report made recommendations in the reporting and audit areas, including:
(i) reviewby the NBRM internalaudit unit of processesfor compilingmonetary data reportedto the IMF
under the program; and (ii)completion of annual external audits on a timely basis as prescribed by the
NBRMLaw. The NBRMhas startedto act on these recommendations.

                                  c.      DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                           AND

71.      The proposed PDPL3 will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy lending. The untied budget support will be disbursed in compliance with the agreed prior actions
and will not be tied to specific purchases.No procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval of
the Loan and notification by the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal
application. At the request of the Government, the Bank will disburse the Loan, less the amount of the
front-end fee, and the net proceeds of the Loan will be deposited in the Treasury's Euro account in the
NBRM, this account being available for budget financing. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit
of the net proceeds o f the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited inthe Borrower's
budget managementsystem, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.The Borrower will reportto the Bank on
the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and creditedto the budget managementsystem. If
after the proceeds are deposited in the NBRM account the proceeds of the Loan are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the LoanAgreement, the Bank will requirethe Borrower to promptly, upon notice
from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to the Bank. Amounts refundedto
the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

72.     The administration and accountingof the loan will be the responsibility of the MOF. The
standard country rules will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The MOF will
maintain accounts and records, showing that disbursements were in accordance with provision of the
Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. The
MOF will provide the Bank within 30 days with a confirmation letter stating that the DPL funds have
been received and deposited into the deposit account designated by the borrower. Consideringthe Bank's
knowledge of the public finance management systems, the ongoing improvements of these systems and
the assessmentofthe NBRMmade by the IMF, no audit will be necessaryofthe deposit account.

                                    D.      ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

73.     The team has reviewed the possible effects of the PDPL-supported policies on the
environment, natural resources,and forests and concluded that the policies are unlikely to have any
significant effects. An area that may requirefurther attentionwith respect to the environment and will be
followed up includes Government efforts to remove regulatory and administrative barriers through the
"regulatory guillotine" and the RIA. Such reforms involve a comprehensivereview o f regulations to help
identify those that are unnecessary or without a sufficient legal basis, includingthose that do not offer
sufficientsafeguards, including with respect to the environment, safety, health and the consumer interest.
The Bank's BERIS project is providing assistance in implementing the reforms of the business
environment and monitoringtheir effects. Further, ongoingefforts by the Government in EU integration


                                                     22

should help align environmental legislation with the EU acquis and, as a result, international best
practices inthis area and help mitigatepotentialrisks.


                            E.      LESSONSLEARNED       FROMPREVIOUS OPERATIONS

74.      The preparation of the proposed PDPL has benefited from important lessons learned from
previouspolicy-based lending. One key lesson is that complex institutionalchanges involve an iterative
process o f "learning while doing" and take time to gain momentum. Continued follow through is
essential to ensure results. In this regard, a series of single-tranche operations designed within a multi-
year program is likely to be more appropriate than a traditional multi-tranche operation due to the
flexibility inherent inthis instrument. With follow-through in mind, the PDPL program in part reflects a
continuation of several institutional reforms initiated under the PSMAL. The PDPL team has also
worked closely with government bodies in establishing institutional arrangements and capacities to
monitor a rich array of indicators designed to measure the impact of the public expenditure and human
resource management reforms begun under the PSMAL supported program. The evaluation of these
indicators has helped determine to what extent and where alterations of the reform program has been
advisable. Reforms in the health sector supported by the PDPLs grew directly out of a comprehensive
external audit andaction planwhich were key features ofthe PSMAL program.

75.      Another lesson learned is that reforms supported by policy-based lending tend to be more
effectively implemented when also supported by critical technical assistance and investment projects,
whether by the Bank or other donors. The PDPL program is reinforcedby the Bank's health, education,
judicial reform, and business environment projects. Technical assistance provided by the EU, the EAR,
the Dutch government, the DFID, and the USAID. The IMF standby is also complementary to the
reforms in public finance.


                                 G.       MONITORING EVALUATION
                                                         AND

76.      The Government recognizes the importance of monitoring and evaluation in ensuring the
successful implementationof the PDPL-supported program. The reform program sets out qualitative
and quantitativebenchmarks and targets embedded in the PDPL policy matrix. Some of these indicators
are produced in regular surveys conducted by the Bank and other internationalorganizations, while others
are regularly produced by the Government. The Government recognizes that the proposed PDPL3 is
subject to the approval of the Bank's Boardof ExecutiveDirectors and that adequate progress in reform
implementation would be required. The Bank and the Government, in consultation with other
stakeholders, civil society, and internationaldonors, are fully utilizing the flexibility inherent inthe PDPL
instrument to determine what adjustments might be needed to the indicative policy actions stipulated in
the Policy Matrix during the preparation of the proposed PDPL3. The goal of such changes will be to
ensure effective implementationwithout compromisingprogramoutcomes.


                                  H.       RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

77.      Implementation risks are moderate. The institutional changes that the PDPL supports are a
medium-term endeavor. The current capacity o f some public institutions to implement an ambitious
reform agenda, while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively weak. The risk is
mitigated by the use o f two donor-financed grants providing technical assistance in key areas of the
reform program and by the Bank projects in health, social protection, judiciary, and business
environment. The risk is hrther mitigatedby close cooperation with other donors supportingreforms in
these areas.




                                                     23

78.     Political risks have affected foreign investor confidence and constrained inflows of foreign
direct investment. While the threat of renewed ethnic violence is modest, political polarization still
constrains the policy dialogue. There is continueduncertainty relatedto neighboringKosovo. The broad
popular consensus in favor of further EU integration and ultimate EU accession is overwhelming and
serves as a mitigating factor, with continuedimplementationof economic reforms widely recognized as
an essential step on the path to EUmembership. Moreover, implementationo f the 2001 Ohrid Agreement
that endedthe 2001 hostilities has been advancedand is a mitigating factor.

79.     There are also macroeconomic risks. Ongoing turbulence in international financial
markets and slower growth inthe EU could weaken capital inflows and the expansionof exports
and output in FYR Macedonia.             While the country has an impressive track record o f
macroeconomic stability and prudent macroeconomic policies, supported by a three-year
precautionarystandby arrangementwith the IMF, real GDP growth is still one of the lowest in
the region. Inflation and the current account deficit have begunincreasing, albeit from very low
levels; inflation has risen to high single digits in2008. The Government plans substantial fiscal
easing in 2008, targeting increases in investment spending, wages and pensions, inter alia.
Whether the plannedincrease ininvestmentspendingcan be carriedout is unclear, leavingroom
for further increases in current spending that will likely add to imports and the current account
deficit. The authorities' commitment, backedby all mainstreampolitical parties, of the need to
maintain macroeconomic stability and advance reforms as key to EU accession is a crucial
mitigatingfactor. Additional mitigatingfactors could reflect the possibilitythat PDPL-supported
reforms help stimulate growth inproductivity and exports and help increase domestic saving. To
the extent that the improved investment climate helps attract larger inflows of foreign direct
investment, even a larger current account deficit could be financed without reliance on foreign
borrowing.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third review
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's economic performance under a Stand-By
Arrangement. The three-year Arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 51.7 million (about
US$82.2 million) was approved on August 31, 2005 (see Press Release No. 05/196). The
authorities are treating the arrangement as precautionary.
Following the Executive Board discussion of Macedonia, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
"Economic performance of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under the Fund-supported
program continues to improve. Economic growth has been robust, the fiscal position has
strengthened, and foreign direct investment and international reserves have increased. The
Government has also continued to make progress in reducing its external debt. Despite these
successes, economic challenges remain, including containing the recent rise in inflation,
achieving a sustained higher economic growth rate, and reducing unemployment.
"The authorities' record of fiscal discipline has underpinned Macedonia's strong macroeconomic
performance. Substantial improvements in revenue administration and tax collections have
made possible ambitious cuts in personal and corporate income tax rates, and increases in
investment. At the same time, the Government expects to contain its fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent
of GDP in 2008. However, substantial pension and public sector wage increases, the latter pre-
announced for three years, will limit the flexibility of the budget.
"A key near term policy challenge will be to contain inflation. The central bank's interest rate
increase is expected to help ensure that recent food and energy price pressures only have a
temporary impact on inflation. The government should stand ready to tighten fiscal policy in
case inflation pressures persist or the current account deficit widens beyond projection. By
strengthening central bank governance and independence, the new central bank law should also
help safeguard price stability.
"The recent increase in forelgn direct investment is positive, but continued structural reform is
needed to further improve the business environment and boost growth. The authorities'
commitment to link health contributions to hours actually worked is commendable: this should
increase part-time employment and reduce the unemployment rate. The next step should be to
reduce quickly minimum social insurance contributions, as these remain a substantial
impediment to job creation in the formal sector, particularly for low wage earners," Mr. Kat0
said.
