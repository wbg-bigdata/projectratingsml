MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF ThE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A SECOND SMALLHOLDER RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following Memorandum and Recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for
SDR 17.0 million (US$23.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years of maturity and
would help finance a second smallholder rubber rehabilitation project.
2.        Background.  Rubber is the second most important tree crop after
tea, accounting for about 11% of export earnings, 8% of agricultural employ-
ment and 4% of GOSL budgetary revenue. Rubber smallholdings generally occupy
land with little prospects of alternative use and the majority are very small,
supporting families with per capita incomes of about US$120 per year-only one
third of the national average. Future prospects for natural rubber are
satisfactory, except where production costs are very high. Sri Lanka accounts
for only 4% of the world market in natural rubber and is a low-cost rubber
producer, and thus has a comparative advantage in rubber production vis-a-vis
some major producers.
3.        Traditionally, the major tree c'ops (tea, rubber and coconut) have
been mainstays of Sri Lanka's economy. Their importance, however, has
diminished since the 1960s primarily due to the emergence of new industries,
as well as past government policies regarding nationalization, land reform,
and taxation which adversely affected tree crop producers. In the case of
rubber, this led to a lack of interest in replanting, resulting in over-aged
and derelict stands which must be replanted to sustain and improve small-
holders' incomes and rubber's contribution to the economy. IDA has focussed
on rehabilitating the tree crop sector through provision of finance and
through policy interventions. There are two ongoing tree crop projects, a
public sector-oriented Fourth Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE for $55 million,
closing June 1990) and a Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project
(Cr. 1017-CE for $16 million, closing June 1988). Both projects are
performin-g satisfactorily. The Fourth Tree Crops Project launched a
comprehensive program geared at revitalizing public sector estates and
provided for the establishment of a Working Group to monitor and advise on
government taxation policies and producer incentives. The Working Group has
become an effective policy advisory instrument and its recommendations for
reducing taxation on tree crops have been implemented by GOSL. The Small-
holder Rubber Rehabilitation Project fosters the development of institutions
serving smallholdings which account for about 70% of total rubber area, and
supports rubber replanting by smallholders in three districts (covering about
two-thirds of Sri Lanka's rubber area). The proposed Project would extend
coverage to all rubber growing districts and would further strengthen institu-
tions serving smallholders. Smallholder rubber replanting, and limited new
planting to replace rubber-land lost to other uses, is largely self-financed
by the industry through the Rubber Replanting Fund (RRF).



4.        The smallholder rubber sector is served by agencies of the Ministry
of Plantation Industries. The Rubber Control Department manages the RRF,
which is financed by a cess on rubber exports, and makes supervisory
inspections of the replanting activities. It also has a number of regulatory
functions. The Rubber Research Board is responsible for the Advisory Services
Department, which undertakes the extension support of smallholders.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The participation of the Association
is necessary to continue the Bank's sector development strategy, implementa-
tion of which commenced with the Fourth Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE),
which addressed the public sector estates. The Bank's worldwide experience in
the sector would benefit Sri Lanka's objectives of introducing better planting
material, up-to-date agronomic and technical practices, and efficient adaptive
research, and extension services to support them. Although the RRF is
financed by a cess on rubber exports and the farmers' own contributions meet
much of the cost of replanting, external finance is still required to permit
the program to accelerate, to avoid the disincentive effect of an early
substantial increase in the cess and to provide time for an orderly transition
of the RRF to a self-sustaining position. Bank experience would also assist
in reorganizing GOSL's rubber-related agencies to ensure their relevance and
the efficiency of both adaptive research and the extension support for the
smallholders.
.        Project Objectives.  The proposed Project would seek to increase
both smallholders' incomes and Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings by
stimulating improvements in the quantity and value of smallholder rubber by
accelerating the replanting of over-aged trees, planting new areas to partly
offset the loss of rubber land to urbanization, and establishing group latex
collecting ard processing centers to provide the advantages of higher value
products and volume sales to the smallest farmers. The Project would also
assist the Government to rationalize and improve the efficiency of its
institutional support--notably the extension service and adaptive research.
The negative impact on a minority of smallholders of a recent disease outbreak
would also be alleviated.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed Project would support:
(a) replanting of about 35,550 ha of over-aged rubber on smallholdings;
(b) planting of 3,200 ha of new rubber on smallholdings; (c) rehabilitation of
disease-affected holdings; (d) provision of credit facilities for private nur-
series and of small grants and loans to upgrade 80 and establish 20 new latex
collecting and processing centers. At the institutional level, the Project
would: (a) consolidate and improve the control of rubber nurseries; (b) sig-
nificantly strengthen and rationalize the extension advisory service and the
supervision of participating smallholdings; (c) establish three adaptive
research and demonstration sub-centers and an additional large nursery; and,
(d) set-up a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Sri Lanka is given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map,
IBRD No. 19987, is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7055A-CE dated
May 2, 1988, is being distributed separately.

8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) establish the Monitoring Committee and determine the procedure and
responsibility for replanting certification as conditions of effectiveness;
(b) issue directives for the establishment of latex collecting and processing
centers; (c) provide funds through the Advising Services Department to make
loans and grants for 20 new processing centers and the upgrading of 80 exist-
ing ones; (d) provide funds through the Rubber Control Department for loans to
private nurseries and to Rubber Planting Aides; (d) provide loans for exten-
sion field staff to purchase motorcycles; (e) complete the transfer of the
nursery inspection unit from the Rubber Research Institute to the Rubber
Control Department; (f) recruit additional extension staff; (g) give priority
to the testing of proven advanced clones; and (h) study the implications of
the subsidies for rubber processing machinery and implement the resultant
findings.
9.        Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed Project are expected
from: (a) enhanced production through replacement of worn-out trees and new
planting; (b) improved returns from upgrading of group processing centers and
establishing of latex collecting and processing centers; (c) improved effec-
tiveness of the extension service and (d) maintenance of economic activity in
rubber growing areas which would become depressed without a rubber replanting
program since there are rarely any viable alternative cropping opportunities
for the land on which rubber would be replanted. The economic rate of return
of the proposed Project is 19Z.
10.       Risks.  There are no significant implementation risks as the project
is relatively insensitive to quite substantial decreases in the assumed price
of rubber, and in the yield estimates. In addition valuable experience was
gained from implementing the ongoing Project and further rationalization and
improvement of the institutional support are incorporated in the proposed
project. Corynespora Leaf Spot Disease poses a threat to the industry, but
the Project would support eradication of susceptible trees and rehabilitation
of affected holdings.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

/a    The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate
report on all Bank/IDA-financed projects in execution, which is updated
twice yearly and circulated to the Executive Directors on April 30 and
October 31.
/b    As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI),
undisbursed SDR credit balances are converted to dollars at the current
exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR. In some cases, therefore,
the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
