SECOND SMALLHOLDER RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Susmary
Borrower:                Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
Beneficiaries:           Smallholders, RCD, ASD. RRI.
Amount:                  SDR 17.0 million (US$23.5 million).
Terms:                   Standard
Project Description:    The proposed project would be the Association's second
operation in the specific subsector and the fifth in
the tree crops sector. It would assure and increase
the income of rubber-growing smallholders and increase
Sri Lanka's export earnings by improving che quantity
and relative value of smallholder rubber. This would
be achieved by replanting 35,550 ha of overaged trees
and planting an additional 3,200 ha of rubber on un-
productive land. The efficiency of institutional sup-
port available to smallholders would be enhanced
through the rationalization and strengthening of the
Covernment agencies directly involved. The negative
effect of a recent disease outbreak would be minimized
by providing compensation for the removal of suscep-
tible trees.
Benefits and Risks:      The principal benefits would be incremental production
and revenues from the production of rubber and
improved farm incomes and employment for some 35,000
households including a large number of small farmers
previously earning under the poverty level. There are
no significant implementation risks. Corynespora Leaf
Spot Disease could pose a threat to the industry, but
the project would support eradication of susceptible
trees.

SECOND SKALLHOLDER RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Sri Lanka covers an area of sbout S5,600 km2 of which 22,400 km2
(34Z) is classified as agricultural land. It has a populati In of more than
16 million, and the population density averages about 240/km , with 75% living
in the rural areas. Net population growth has averaged about 1.6% p.a. since
1970, but without the substantial emigration of recent years it would be about
2.1% p.a. About 75% of the population live in the Wet Zone in the southwest
quadrant, which contains 23% of total land area but 42Z of tll cultivated
land, and population density there exceeds 730 per km .
1.2       GNP per capita averages about US$380 and grew at an average annual
rate of 2.9% between 1965 and 1985. Sri Lanka compares favorably with neigh-
boring countries in providing social amenities to its population.
1.3       Although its achievements, particularly since 1978, have been signi-
ficant, they have been accompanied by severe financial imbalances in both the
budget and the balance of payments. High expenditure on internal security-
related activities and growing interest payments on public debt have put
strains on the Government of Sri Lanka's (GOSL) finances. The budget deficit
averaged the equivalent of 15% of GDP during 1978-85, and public sector
savings were on average negative. The deficit recorded in the current account
of the balance of payments was also large, about 11% of GDP.
1.4       The principal factors contributing to this unfavorable position have
been the decline in earnings from tourism as a result of the ethnic conflict
and the lower revenue from agriculture (particularly in the tree crop sub-
sector), which is attributable to a number of disincentives (para. 2.2).
1.5       The proposed project would be a follow-up to the on-going
Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project (CR. 1017-CE), here-in-after
referred to as the first project.
II. BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
General
2.1       Traditionally agriculture has played the preeminent role in the
economy but its relative importance has been declining steadily. Although the
value-added from agriculture rose by 60% between 1970 and 1985, its contribu-
tion to GDP actually fell from 29% to 26%. Agricultural employment has
slipped from 53% to about 46%, and between 1974 and 1985 its share of export



- 2-
earnings fell from about 80Z to 53Z. This decline in the relative role of
agriculture is due mainly to deterioration in the performance of the tree crop
subsector, for much of the real growth in agriculture since 1977 has been due
to rice production. Paddy is now the single most important crop in terms of
value-added, acreage, and employment.
The Tree Crop Subsector
2.2       Historically the major tree crops (tea, rubber, and coconut) have
dominated the economy. But this dominance has steadily diminished since the
1960s, primarily because of a sequence of detrimental circumstances: the pro-
longed threat of nationalization; actual nationalization and land reform; and
subsequently, years .f Government neglect, during which the lack of proper
planning and unfavorable policies created an environment in which neither the
private nor the public sector was motivated to perform well. Between 1973 and
1982 the tree crop subsector's value-added as a percentage of GDP had fallen
from 152 to 112; its share of export earnings had fallen from 872 to V5t-, and
its share of employment from 272 to 152.
2.3       The first major initiative to reverse the deterioration in th'  er-
formance of the subsector as a whole was the launching in 1985 of the Fourth
Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE) partly financed by IDA, ADB, and other
donors. This project supported a Medium-Term Investment Program (MTIP) for
public sector estates. Particularly important were the policy initiatives
associated with the project, notably the establishment within the Ministry of
Finance and Planning in 1984 of the Working Group on Tree Crops Taxation and
Producer Margins to monitor and report on factors affecting producer incomes,
such as taxes, cesses, subsidies, cost of production, and commodity prices.
Government has accepted and implemented all substantive recommendations made
by the Working Group, including changes in the structure and level of taxa-
tion. Rubber and tea exports are subject to both cesses and an export duty.
Historically, export duties have been high--as much as 45-502 of export prices
for rubber prior to 1982. However, in 1984 a major restructuring led to a
significant reduction in duties on rubber exports, with the result that
average export duty per kg was decreased by about 652 in 1985. As a
percentage of average unit value of exports, the total of duty and cesses has
been reduced from 462 in 1983 to less than 202 in 1987. Tea taxes have been
similarly reduced in the same period.
The Role of Rubber
2.4       Rubber is the second most important tree crop after tea, accounting
for about 112 of total export earnings, 82 of agricultural employment, and 4Z
of GOSL budgetary revenue. The total area of rubber is about 197,000 ha.
Smallholdings occupy about 722 of this and the balance (55,000 ha) is operated
as estates under two state corporations. In the mid-1950s Sri Lanka's rubber
output was 100,000 tons, or 52 of the total world output. In 1970, production
reached a peak of 150,000 tons, then fell to 125,000 tons in 1982, but
steadily rose to 139,000 tons in 1986. Most rubber is sold as ribbed, smoked
sheet (RSS), although crepe rubber, particularly sole crepe, is a Sri Lankan
speciality.



- 3 -
2.5       There are abou; 160,000 smallholders.  About 50% of the total
smallholder area consists of holdings up to 1.6 ha, 15% are between 1.6-4 ha
and the remaining 351 are holdings of 4-20 ha. Most of the smallholdings
practice mixed cropping, although intercropping of rubber is minimal. With
the exception of rice cultivation in the valley bottoms, rubber is almost
always the sole successful main crop in the areas in which it is grown. Only
in the high rainfall locations can tea be considered a3 an alternative crop.
2.6       While the standard of husbandry on the public ,ector estates is
generally good, the conditions of smallholdings are variable but generally
poor.  The average yield in the smallholder sector is about 50% of that on the
estates, but the national yield average is less than that obtained by more
progressive rubber growing countries such as Malaysia. This is largely due to
two main factors--replanting was neglected between 1959 and 1979, and the
industry is dominated by the reliable but low-yielding clone, PB 86. The
introduction of new clones has been far from successful. Those recommended to
the industry by the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka (RRI) have been
almost exclusively its own creations which have unfortunately suffered a
series of mishaps. When two new clones (RRIC 45 and RRIC 52) were introduced,
they proved to be very disappointing, with the result that growers became
reluctant to accept any new clones. This resistance was only gradually over-
come and other RRIC clones (100 series) began to be accepted. However, within
the past year RRIC 103 has succumbed to Corynespora, a fungal leaf disease,
and all plantings made with it have to be eliminated, which has resulted in
new problems for the industry. Despite these problems, the cost of rubber
production in Sri Lanka is low in comparison with Malaysia, the major rubber
producer. This comparative advantage could be further increased if
productivity can be improved. Given its limited share of world output (4Z),
the resulting small increase in total production will have a no detrimental
impact on world rubber prices.
B. Agroclimatic Conditions
Cl:mate
2.7       Rubber is grown in four agroclimatic zones:  the low country wet
zone (administrative districts of Colombo, Galle, Gampaha, Kalutara, and
Ratnapura); mid-country wet zone (Kandy and Kegalle); mid-country intermediate
zone (Kurunegala and Matale); and mid-country dry zone (Badulla and
?'oneragala). The rubber growing districts, which would constitute the project
area, are shown in Map IBRD 19987.
2.8       The climate is monsoonal with an annual rainfall of 2,000-4,000 mm,
which is associated largely with the southwest monsoon (April-June) and the
northeast monsoon (October-December). In general there are two to four rela-
tively dry months each year, but on most soils this does not significantly
affect mature rubber, for which the rainfall is more than adequate. However,
the more prolonged droughts experienced from time to time do interfere with
planting programs and cause setbacks to the development of young rubber. The
main adverse effect of the normally abundant rain is that the number of days
suitable for tapping is restricted to 160-200 per year and fungal diseases
more readily develop. Mean temperatures in the range of 26°-30°C are appro-
priate for rubber cultivation, and wind damage is not a serious hazard.

Physical Characteristics
2.9       In Sri Lanka, rubber grows below 370 m elevation on terrain which
ranges from flat or rolling land to steep slopes, which occur mainly in the
Kegalle and Ratnapura districts. The crop is most easily managed on fat land
or moderate slopes, but can be grown satisfactorily on slopes up to 20
provided that suitable soil and moisture conservation measures, such as the
construction of platforms or terraces, are taken. More than half of the area
under rubber is on terrain requiring such measures. The widely grown legumi-
nous cover crops provide adequate protection on the more moderate slopes.
2.10      The soils of the rubber-growing areas vary in texture from silty to
gravelley ioams, but are generally stony, often with rock outcrops, and even
the better loamy soils cintain many rocks. These conditions do not adversely
affect the growth of rubber, but can complicate the layout of the plantations
and the tapping rounds. The soils of Sri Lanka have been mapped at the recon-
naissance level and the rubber-growing soils provisionally classified into six
series. RRI has developed specific fertilizer recomendations for each soil
series, but in practice, one broadly based fertilizer mixture is used success-
fully on all of the soils. Despite the steep terrain and high rainfall over
much of the project area, soil erosion is not a major problem because of the
tree canopy provided by the crop and the widespread recognition of the need
for soil conservation measures.
C. Socioeconomic Aspects
2.11      The land reform laws of 1972 and 1975 limited the size of private
tree crop holdings to a maximum of 20 ha. (A newly announced increase to
40 ha is too recent to have had any effect.) The smallholder rubber sector is
characterized by small areas of rubber and a skewed distribution of holding
size (para. 2.4) with miniholdings being a dominant feature. Such mini-
holdings are estimated to yield a per capita income of about US$120, only one
third of the national average.
2.12      The predominant land tenure pattern is sole ownership, which
accounts for between 75-90Z of the holdings in the major districts. The
majority of rubber farmers grow several crops. Generally, the flat-bottom
valleys are planted to paddy, whereas the upland areas are planted to rubber,
and possibly tea, coconut or cinnamon, and mixed home garden crops. Rubber is
a popular crop with smallholders. Is is st#table for steep land, easy to
maintain, free from weather risks, easy to market, and provides a steady
income. However, on the very small holding income from rubber is low and
smallholders depend on nonagricultural income as an important source of family
earnings. This mixed cropping pattern and the need for off-farm income on
smaller holdings has a great influence on rubber husbandry practices. Fur-
thermore, due to the small sized holdings, most individual smallholders are
unable to produce high-quality RSS and hence cannot sell their produce at the
highest prices.
2.13      The project area is adequately served by all-veather roads, although
their maintenance has deteriorated to some extent. Rail service also exists
in many locations and there is a comprehensive bus service, with frequent



- 5 -
schedules, even to remote villages. There is an efficient postal service even
in the rural areas. The literacy rate is high and health and education facil-
ities are adequate.
D. Institutional Environment
2.14      The key institutions serving the smallholder rubber sector are under
Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI) (Figure 1). These include the Rubber
Control Department (RCD) and the Rubber Research Board (RRB), which is
responsible for the acti ities of the Advisory Services Department (ASD) and
RRI. A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was established under the Smallholder
Rubber Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1017-CE) within MPI (para. 2.46), which
also subsequently set up the Smallholder Rubber Policy and Planning Unit
(RPPU) to look into all aspects of smallholder rubber cultivation, production,
and marketing. The RCD and ASD are directly involved with the smallholders,
respectively running the rubber replanting scheme (RRS) and the extension
support.
Rubber Control Department
2.15      RCD is GOSL's principal rubber regulatory agency, and as a depart-
ment of MPI, has been responsible since its establishment in 1934 for control
of the production and planting of rubber. Other than managing the RSS (para.
2.26), the main functions of R.CD include: registration of rubber holdings and
producers; licensing of dealers, manufacturers, and nurseries; issue of export
licenses for rubber seed and plants; and collection of all industry related
statistics. Administration of the RRS constitutes the major activity of the
department. Accordingly, RCD invites replanting and new planting
applications, checks them for land registration, and issues permits for both
replanting and new planting. The procedure for issuing of replanting permits
has been streamlined through computerization, the dispersal of registration
records to the regions, and the provisions of modern regional office buildings
and facilities.  RCD is responsible for inspecting field work (seven times
over a period of six years), on the basis of which the releases of the Rubber
Replanting Fund (RRF) benefits are authorized and made to the smallholders.
Originally RCD provided inputs in kind (planting material and fertilizers) to
all smallholders supported under RRS. However, since 1980, RCD has been
supplying these inputs only to rubber replanters in the districts not included
in the first project, as well as for all new rubber plantings (inputs to areas
replanted in the first project districts are supplied by ASD).
2.16      RCD is headed by a Rubber Controller, and its field operations are
undertaken through five regional offices. It has a total staff of 576,
including 75 rubber inspectors and 314 clerks (most of whom work on the files
of replanters and new planters). RCD operations are being computerized. Once
the computerized system is fully operational (around 1990), it should be pos-
sible to redeploy some office staff to other Government departments. RCD is
wholly financed from funds raised through the rubber replanting and rubber
control cesses.
2.17      RCD has taken two important initiatives to improve its accessibility
to smaller farmers, and those having unregistered rubber holdings. First, RCD
has deployed mobile offices in isolated areas so that smallholders' problems



can be attended to in the field, thus reducing correspondence. Second, a
campaign is in progress to register 32,750 ha of rubber lands that were found
to be unregistered in the 1984 census and therefore are ineligible for RRS
assistance; 25% of this area was registered in 1985 and 1986.
Rubber Research Board
2.18      RRB is a statutory board, established under MPI, with membership
representing the planting community and some relevant government departments.
Initially created to supervise the RRI, it now also oversees the separate
ASD. The board is highly motivated to further the development of the rubber
industry, but there is a lack of adequate focus on the identification of
appropriate research and extension objectives and of efficient means to
achieve them. A proposal to improve the board's supervision of ASD and RRI is
made in para. 5.13.
Advisory Services Department
2.19      Since being elevated to the de facto status of an independent
department under the first project, ASD has been responsible for extension and
related activities to improve the quantity and quality of rubber produced by
smallholders. Field extension work on rubber cultivation is carried out under
the Development Division, through 17 Divisional Rubber Extension Officers
(DREO) and 108 Rubber Extension Officers (REO). A Processing Advisory Divi-
sion (PAD), with 15 processing advisors, is responsible for extension to pri-
vate sheet-processing units and for promoting and supervising Group Processing
Centers (GPC). AS-D also operates a training center and publicity unit. The
field operations are managed from five regional offices at Colombo, Galle,
Kulutara, Kegalle, and Ratnapura, each headed by a Regional Advisory Officer.
2.20      Under the first project, ASD was responsible for the supplying
planting material (budded stumps) and fertilizer to all farmers replanting
rubber in the three project districts. At the request of RCD, REOs also made
some of the mandatory inspections required for release of payments from the
RRF. These activities, although unavoidable under the prevailing circum-
stances, are not necessarily appropriate for extension staff as they divert
them from their primary function which is to motivate and give advice to the
smallholders. This is particularly a problem because ASD is seriously under-
staffed for the tasks it faces.
2.21      Experience in the first project, for example instances of poor main-
tenance and premature tapping, clearly indicates the need for a more intensive
approach to extension. This would mean supervising both replanting activities
and the early stages of exploitation more closely through a systematic program
of visits to the holdings involved. Among other things, this implies a signi-
ficant increase in extension staff, which the proposed projert would address
(para. 3.32).
2.22      The activities of PAD have been largely concerned with supervising a
number of GPCs. Little attention has been devoted to advising small-scale,
private sheet rubber processing units, and there is probably only limited
scope for such activity. Consequently, it has been suggested that there is



-7-
little justification for having a separate processing division as the simple
technologies involved could be handled by the general rubber extension offi-
cers. PAD staff and facilities could be better utilized in general extension
work.
2.23      ASD established a training center with residential facilities in
1982. The emphasis is on a high throughput, with 47-48 one-week courses per
year, the majority for smallholders. This heavy worK program for training
smallholders leaves little time for identifying staff training needs, planning
and course design and follow-up evaluation. Consequently, the center has been
less effective than hoped for in upgrading the skills of field staff in rubber
technology and extension methods, although inductior raining has been pro-
vided for all new recruits.  The situation should ii. rove under the proposed
project, as most routine farmer training would take place at the planned
adaptive research centers (ARC) (para. 3.37).
Rubber Research Institute
2.24      RRI, with its headquarters and main research facilities located at
Agalawatta, is responsible for all aspects of research into rubber breeding,
husbandry, exploitation, and processing, and for issuing technical recommenda-
tions to the industry. Its operations are funded by a special cess on rubber
exports, which has recently been increased from Rs 0.15 to Rs 0.25/kg to
produce about Rs 28 million (US$0.9 million) per year. There are five
research and three service departments with a total staff of 280, including 13
research officers and 18 assistant research officers.
2.25      The current research programs have been perceived as being dominated
by estate conditions, but this is perhaps inevitable as the Institute relies
on estates for most of its experimental sites. A more serious issue may be
that RI appears to have become too academically oriented and does not seem to
recognize that, as an institute directly financed by the farmers, its role
should be to identify the different technologies that farmers need and to test
or develop solutions that are appropriate to the various categories of hold-
ings. This clearly implies a need to test and adapt existing technology from
all sources in the differing agroclimatic conditions in which rubber is grown,
as well as to undertake research when knowledge is lacking or inadequate. The
ARCs proposed under the project (para. 3.37) would greatly facilitate this
change of emphasis.
The Rubber Replanting Scheme
2.26      Replanting of overaged rubber first received direct Government
attention in 1953, when GOSL initiated a Rubber Replanting Scheme with an
annual targer of about 6,000 ha based on replacement of 3% per year of the
then current rubber area. The scheme was initially financed by GOSL budget
allocations supplemented by a cess on rubber exports. The export cess was
suspended in 1957 owing to low world prices for rubber; the scheme was funded
from general revenue until 1975, when the cess was reintroduced. The scheme
now continues to be financed (albeit inadequately) by the rubber growers
through a cess without any direct contribution from GOSL revenues. Under the
scheme, replanters receive advice, replanting inputs, and some financial



- 8 -
assistance to purchase other inputs, including labor during the immature
period. Replanting benefits for smallholders have increased in nominal terms
from Rs 2,470/ha in 1953 to the current level of Rs 24,710 (para. 2.28).
2.27      During its first ten years, the scheme was highly successful and
76,000 ha were replanted island-wide. From 1963 to 1976, the area replanted
each year declined continuously from 6,400 ha to 2,550. With this decline in
replanting rates the national stand has become overaged which has reduced
rubber production and the future production potential. The fail'tre to replant
rubber at a rate sufficient to maintain an even age distribution reflects the
disruption of the land reform era and the lack of producer incentives, partic-
ularly inadequate levels of replanting benefits, for there is a very strong
correlation between the replanting rates and the proportion of the cost
covered by the scheme.
2.28      The Rubber Replanting Fund (RRF) is financed by a cess--at present
set at Rs 1.15 per kg of rubber exported (about 5% of FOB value)--collected by
the Customs Department. The RRF is managed by RCD. The scheme currently pro-
vides smallholders replanting with benefits valued at Rs 24,710/ha, released
in seven installments and for smallholders planting new rubber with benefits
valued at Rs 22,856/ha in six installments. These benefits are periodically
adjusted with the objective of meeting 60-65% of the costs involved. The
assumption is that the smallholder can contribute (or finance) much of the
labor, which constitutes most of the remainder. GOSL proposes to increase the
benefits to RS 29,652/ha to cover the increased costs of establishment. This
sum would represent about 63Z of the cost of replanting and would cover the
full cost of physical inputs plus about 30% of the cost of labor. RRF is also
used to pay 33% subsidies on approved equipment for rubber factories. This
latter was introduced to encourage the production of higher value-added ex-
ports such as latex and sole crepe and technically specified rubber (TSR).
There is now reason to believe that the value of such processes has been ade-
quately demonstrated and that their profitability is sufficient for factory
owners to obtain commercial credit or loans provided through the Small and
Medium Scale Industries Project (CR 1182-CE). GOSL has confirmed its
agreement to undertake a study of the implications of the use of the RRF for
machinery subsidies and to implement the findings and recommendations by
September 30, 1989. The study team, with membership acceptable to IDA, would
commence its work not later than October 1, 1988 and submit its report through
MPI to the Ministry of Finance and Planning by March 31, 1989.
2.29      The RRS and its associated RRF are practical solutions to the
intractable problem of financing rubber replanting on smallholdings. Replant-
ing must take place every 30 years when the bark of the trees is exhausted,
yet it is inconceivable that smallholders, many of whom exist below the
poverty line, can make financial provision for this "once in a (working)
lifetime" activity. Neither have they access to credit, which would in any
event be more cumbersome, difficult to recover, and expensive due to the six
or seven years delay before any recovery would be possible. The system is
equitable in that all smallholders can participate, and experience has shown
that even the smallest farmers do take advantage of the program. The program
is managed by RCD with reasonable efficiency and the automatic deduction of
the cess at the time of export ensures that the funds for replanting are



- 9 -
available when needed. The self-financed portion and certification process
being sufficient to deter irresponsible replanting. The RRS support of new
planting is in line with GOSL policy to avoid any significant decrease in the
area under rubber (para. 3.10) and is justified as many of the new plantings
involved expansion of the area under rubber on existing holdings and, in any
case, the planters will contribute to the cess when their rubber trees are in
production.
2.30      Prior to 1985 the public sector plantation corporations were also
eligible for replanting and planting benefits. They have been excluded from
these benefits on financial grounds since 1985 (when they were temporarily
very profitable due to high tea prices), but this is distortive as they
contribute to the fund through the cess and thus in effect subsidize the
smallholders. For administrative reasons, it is impracticable to not levy the
cess, but GOSL has agreed to refund their contributions to the corporations,
thus effectively excluding them from RRS, which will then be exclusively a
smallholder scheme.
2.31      The current financial status of RRF indicates a fairly healthy esti-
mated cash balance at the end of 1987. However, expend_tures exceed cess
income owing to the accelerated rate of replanting and new planting required
to catch up on the backlog (para. 2.27) and thus restore a balanced national
rubber stand. The cess income will be further reduced by repayment of the
public sector corporations' contributions (para. 2.30).
2.32      In the absence of financial support or an unacceptably large
increase in the cess, the fund will have a negative balance by the end of
1992, as shown in the table below.

The proposed project will interalia help to finance the RRF so that the fund
may evolve to a self sustaining basis (Annex 1).
E. Supporting Services
Rubber Processing
2.33      Smallholder latex in Sri Lanka is most commonly processed into and
marketed in the form of RSS, but a small proportion (around 20x) is sold as



- 10 -
liquid latex and processed mainly into latex crepe and sole crepe, and some
into TSR and centrifuged latex. Smallholders account for about 951 of Sri
Lanka's RSS production (65,900 tons in 1985). Although reliable data on
grades produced by smallholders are not available, recent field surveys show
that most of the production, i.e., 60-65X is graded as RSS 3, and that RSS 2
represents about 15X. The poor average quality of RSS produced is the result
of using old worn-out equipment and smokehouses, as well as poor processing
methods.
2.34      Smallholder latex is processed into RSS either on the holding, at a
larger neighbor's facilities (for which a service fee is paid), or in a GPC.
Most smallholders do some of the processing operations themselves and use
commercial facilities for the other stages. Overall, there is a wide varia-
tion in the type and scale of operations, with very small, largely home-based
processors (less than 1,500 kg throughput per year) coexisting with larger,
more commercial operations (over 50,000 kg per year). It is estimated that
there are 9,000 smokehouses, but this excludes in-house smoking of sheets over
kitchen fires.
2.35      Group processing of smallholder latex was promoted in the 1970s,
primarily to improve RSS quality. At present there are about 90 GPCs in
operation. Capacity utilization is often low, variously estimated at 10-40Z
of installed capacity, and the advantages of bulk sales are hardly realized.
This situation is the result of factors, including wea- management, high cost
of operations, and lack of arrangements for providing short-term consumption
credit to farmers. Because the registration requirements of the Cooperative
Department are complex and difficult to meet, many GPCs are unregistered and
thus lack the legal basis to borrow from institutional sources. Despite these
shortcomings, the concept underlying a GPC still remains valid and GOSL sup-
ports their establishment through the provision of a 50Z grant and a loan for
the remainder at an interest rate of 101. The operations of a few well-
managed centers have indicated that they have the potential to make high-
quality RSS. However, in the program to set up 50 new GPCs, only 15 have been
established so far (paras. 2.47 and 2.49). This is due to the difficulties
encountered in organizing groups and raising funds to meet the other costs.
2.36      GPCs also lack the flexibility to respond to the alternative market
for latex (for crepe production). A pilot latex collecting center promoted by
ASD demonstrated the advantage of that market when crepe prices are high. The
addition of simple bulk latex-handling facilities would provide many GPCs with
the ability to enter the alternative market. Another innovation that has been
tested and could be usefully extended to most GPCs is the inclusion of a
Savings and Loan facility. This makes the use of a GPC more attractive to the
smallest farmers who frequently depend on short-term credit for essential pur-
chases when rubber production is suspended owing to wet weather or wintering.



- 11 -
2.37      To upgrade the quality of RSS produced by smallholders, the Export
Development Board embarked on a pilot program in 1982 to encourage the reha-
bilitation of private sheet-processing units. Subsidies are provided at the
rate of 50X of the cost of rollers, and two-thirds of the cost of smokehouse
(up to a maximum of Rs 11,250) and processing shed repairs (maximum of
Rs 7,500). Farmers owning less than 10 ha of rubber are eligible to partici-
pate. The program, which has cost Rs 4.0 million during 1982-86, is at pre-
sent financed out of funds generated from a cess on the import of luxury
goods. To eliminate overlapping between departments, GOSL has decided to
transfer the operation of the scheme to ASD. However, as credit facilities
are available in rural areas for this type of investment, whether the scheme
remains justified is open to question. Furthermore, the Ministry of
Cooperative Development also has a program to establish subsidized rubber
processing centers. GOSL has agreed to include a review of both programs in
the study of machinery subsidies (para. 2.28).
Rubber Marketing
2.38      Smallholder RSS is marketed through an extensive network of private
dealers. In 1984 there were an estimated 2,500 rubber purchase dealers li-
censed by RCD in the various districts. Village-level dealers buy sheets and
scrap from smallholders for spot cash, and sell to the middle level dealers in
towns. The latter sell directly to the shippers. Because of the the low vol-
ume sales by individual smaller farmers, the village level dealers are unable
to grade effectively and sales are priced on an average grade basis.
2.39      In addition, the Commodity Purchase Department (CPD), which earlier
held a monopoly over exports of sheet rubber, operates 51 purchasing depots.
With the introduction of a liberalized trade policy, its role in the market
has been significantly reduced and it is now handling less than 32 of the
total RSS marketed. However, the private market chain is now well developed
and sufficiently competitive to provide responsive pricing. Consequently
there is no justification for the continued existence of CPD, which operates
at a substantial loss, and it is understood that the Administrative Reform
Committee will recommend that it be closed down.
2.40      As mentioned earlier (para. 2.33), an estimated 20Z of total small-
holder production is sold as latex to private or public sector factories. The
quantities depend to a large extent on the price differential between RSS and
crepe. Latex is sold by smallholders either directly to the factories or
through buying agents.
2.41      In addition to export duty (para. 2.3) the cesses levied on rubber
exports now total Rs 1.46 per kg, which is distributed as follows:
Rubber Replanting Fund                Rs 1.1500      (79.0)
Rubber research, to RRI               Rs 0.2500      (17.2)
Rubber control, to RCD                Rs 0.0400       (2.7)
Estate workers' medical costs         Rs 0.0165       (1.1)
Total                             Rs 1.4565    (100.0%)



- 12 -
Rural Credit
2.42      Private sector investment for agricultural and industrial develop-
ment has attracted institutional credit from a variety of financial institu-
tions. The combined branch offices of the domestic commercial banks, Regional
Rural Development Banks (RRDBs), and the Cooperative Rural Banks number over
1,600 and geographically provide a good spread of branches across the country.
However, very little credit has so far been disbursed for the development of
the smallholder rubber subsector.
2.43      Because of the high risks and costs of lending to the small farm
sector, banks have confined themselves' primarily to activities covered under
various credit schemes, supported by the Central Bank through concessional
refinance facilities. Some loans have been made by commercial banks and
RRDBs, on normal terms, to finance certain aspects of rubber cultivation (such
as nurseries and bridging loans for expenses, prior to qualifying for RRF pay-
ments). However, these have been very few in number and experience has shown
that most private nurseries would be unable to qualify for commercial credit
for either equipment or working capital (para. 3.13). Indications are that as
the RRDBs become more established, they will be in a position to make medium-
term loans that are suitable for improving farmers' sheet-processing facili-
ties. At present the main constraint is lack of demand. Owners of small
sheet-processing facilities are reluctant to seek loans to upgrade their
equipment--possibly because of the difficulty in increasing the fee charged to
neighboring farmers to recover their investment. In any event, lack of funds
does not appear to be inhibiting lending by the banks.
F. Bank Involvement
Bank Role and Strategy in the Tree Crop Subsector
2.44      A central element in the Bank's current strategy for Sri Lanka is
the achievement of a more sustainable balance of payments position through
export promotion and import substitution in viable economic activities.
Accordingly, the Bank's lending program has been concentrating resources on
directly productive sectors such as agriculture and industry and on energy and
transport infrastructure. In agriculture, Bank strategy has given the highest
priority to the expansion of rice production and the rehabilitation of the
vital tree crops subsector.
2.45      IDA credits to Sri Lanka since 1970 supported eight projects that
focused totally or partly on the tree crop sector. The first project, Tree
Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project (Cr. 818-CE), promoted the rehabilitation of
High-Country public sector tea estates, while a Tree Crop Diversification
(Tea) Project (Cr. 819-CE) supported the replacement of unprofitable public
sector estate-grown Mid-Country tea with minor export crops (including pepper,
cardamom, and cloves), fuelwood, and a range of local fruit trees. Two
further projects, Kurunegala Rural Development Project (Cr. 891-CE) and the
Second Rural Development Project (Cr. 1079-CE) in the Matale and Puttalam
areas, provide extension services for smallholders for minor crop production,
as part of rural infrastructure development. The fifth project, the first
Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation (Cr. 1017-CE), supports rubber replanting



- 13 -
and improvement of the associated in3titutions and infrastructure. The sixth
project, Tea Rehabilitation and Diversification (Cr. 1240-CE), is expected to
reduce tea production costs while improving overall tea quality by increasing
the productivity of existing tea lands in areas with high potential, by reha-
bilitating factories and improving leaf transport and by diversifying out of
tea into minor export crops and fuelwood in unprofitable low-yielding tea land
in the Mid Country. Another component of this project was designed to
strengthen management and financial control of the two state corporations.
The seventh project, the Fourth Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE), supports a
Medium-Term Investment Program (MTIP) for public tea, rubber, and coconut
estates. It constitutes a five-year program for increasing output, upgrading
product quality, improving management, rehabilitating processing facilities,
strengthening research and extension, and establishing an institution to
monitor producer margins. It also provides funds for the preparation of a
smallholder MTIP for the private tree crop sector. The objective of the
eighth project, the Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1770-CE) is to
strengthen agricultural research including the three tree crop research insti-
tutes.
Bank Experience with the First Rubber Project
2.46      The first Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1017-CE)
was approved by the Board on June 6, 1980, and became effective September 10,
1980. The goal of this project was to accelerate smallholder rubber replant-
ing (target of 18,800 ha over a six-year project period) in the major rubber-
growing districts of Kegalle, Kalutara, and Ratnapura. Provisions were
included for strengthening the three implementing agencies: RCD, ASD, RRI.
It also established a PCU within MPI.
2.47      Under the project, ASD, which had previously been a division of RRI,
gained similar status to RRI under RRB and became the principal extension
agency for rubber smallholders. PAD was set up within ASD to support private
processors and existing GPCs. The other major component provided for the
rehabilitation of 67 existing GPCs and for setting up 50 new ones to process
smallholder latex into RSS.
2.48      The Credit Closing Date was extended for two years to June 1988 to
facilitate completion of the replanting program, which had been affected by
unseasonable drought in 1982 and 1984, and to complete civil works. The
credit was reduced from US$16 million to US$12 million because of the effect
of devaluation of the local currency.
2.49      Overall, the performance of the project has been good, and it led to
an acceleration in rubber replanting (the target having been met by August
1987). However, certain constraints emerged during implementation, including:
(a) the failure of public sector estates to supply adequate planting material,
particularly stumps budded with RRIC clones (which resulted in lower adoption
rates of these new clones by smallholders than originally envisaged); (b) dif-
ficulties in organizing new CPCs (para. 2.35), so that only 15 were completed
by April 1988; (c) lack of an effective extension strategy to serve the
smallest farmers; (d) the concentration of RRI's research program on estates
and absence of socioeconomic research on smallholdings; (e) overlapping func-



- 14 -
tional responsibilities, particularly with regard to RCD and ASD activities in
project districts; (f) that GOSL did not employ an additional 44 REOs; and
(g) little support by processing advisors to existing sheet processing units
other than GPCs.
Project Formulation
2.50      The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are the principal
external co-financiers of the Fourth Tree Crops Project, which supports field
and factory rehabilitation for public sector estates. Provision in that
project for studies and preparation of a project with a similar program for
smallholders resulted in background reports on tea, rubber, and coconut pre-
pared by local consultants in association with the MPI and the Ministry of
Coconut Industries.
2.51   The proposed second smallholder rubber project would continue the
activities of the present project (para. 2.46) in Kalutara, Kegalle and
Ratnapura (the main rubber growing districts, which account for 70Z of the
total rubber smallholdings), and extend those activities to all the other
districts in the rubber growing areas in the southern part of Sri Lanka (Map
IBRD 19987).
2.52      An FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program mission visited Sri Lanka in
February 1987 to assist GOSL in finalizing the Preparation Report for the
proposed project. The project was appraised in September 1987.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives, Rationale, and Main Features
Objectives
3.1       The proposed project would increase the incomes of smallholders and
Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings by stimulating improvements in the quan-
tity and relative value of smallholder rubber in all rubber growing districts
in the country. This would be achieved through the following measures:
accelerating the replanting of overaged trees, planting new areas, establish-
ing group latex collection and processing facilities, enhancing the efficiency
of the institutional support available to the smallholders, and minimizing the
negative impact of a disease outbreak.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.2       The participation of the Association is necessary to continue the
sector development strategy defined in the Bank's 1984 Tree Crop Sector Review
(Report No. 4890-CE), implementation of which coumenced with the Fourth Tree
Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE), which addressed the public sector estates. The
Bank's worldwide experience in the sector would benefit Sri Lanka's objectives
of introducing better planting material, up-to-date agronomic and technical
practices, and efficient adaptive research, and extension services to support.
them. Although the RRF is financed by a cess on rubber exports and the



- 15 -
farmers' own contributions meet much of the cost of replanting, external
finance is still required to permit the program to accelerate, to avoid the
disincentive effect of an early substantial increase in the cess and to pro-
vide time for an orderly transition of the RRF to a self-sustaining position.
Bank experience would also assist in strengthening and reorganizing GOSL's
rubber-related agencies to ensure their relevance and the efficiency of both
adaptive research and the extension support for the smallhde':Q=-
Main Features
3.3       The project would be implemented over a period of eight-year period
by RCD, ASD, and RRI. Disbursement would be spread over nine years. The
principal components are as follows:
(a) Field Development
(i) Replanting--35,550 ha of overaged rubber on smallholdings.
(ii) New planting--3,200 ha on smallholdings.
(iii) Private nurseries and Rubber Planting Aides--provision of loans
through a revolving fund.
(iv) Corynespora Disease--compensation for about 4,400 ha of
affected plantings.
(b)  Processing
Latex Collecting and Processing Centers (LCPC)--provision of grants
and loans for the establishment of 20 new LCPCs and the upgrading of
80 existing GPCs to LCPC standards.
(c)  Institutional Development
(i) Strengthen RCD's role in rubber nursery control and enhance its
capability to manage the RRF.
(ii) Strengthen ASD by increasing the number of extension officers
to 254, with appropriate supporting facilities, to provide a
more comprehensive service to farmers.
(iii) Establish three RRI adaptive research subcenters and enhance
the Institute's capacity to support rubber smallholders.
(iv) Continue support for the PCU.
(v)  Create a small Monitoring and Evaluation Committee within MPI.

B. Detailed Features
Replanting
3.4       During the first project, institutional support for replanting
improved to enable an annual average replanting rate of 4,100 ha to be
achieved during the last three years. Consequently, with the enhanced geo-
graphical scope and further institutional strengthening provided in the
proposed project, an annual replanting rate of 4,650 ha has been set. This
represents 4.25% of the registered smallholder rubber (about 3.3% of the total
area) which will allow progress to be made in catching up on the backlog of
overaged trees.
3.5       Unfortunatelv, because of the recent outbreak of Corynespora Leaf
Spot Disease (CLSD) and the consequent elimination of RRIC 103 there would be
a shortage of planting material in the first year of the project, so that only
3,000 ha could be replanted. Incidentally, much of that area would involve
replacing uprooted RRIC 103 stands. The situation has also further con-
strained the limited range .f clones available for the program, which is now
reduced to the popular, but low-yielding PB 86, and the higher-yielding
RRIC 100 and 102, although the latter is not suitable for holdings where the
sale of latex for crepe production is contemplated. Moreover, the failure of
RRIC 103 may be expected to have rekindled farmers' earlier reluctance to
plant RRIC clones. Thus the adaptive research component of the project
(para. 3.39), would give high priority to the testing of all internationally
available advanced clones of proven merit.
3.6       Although all rubber growing districts will be inAluded in the
project, it is estimated that about 75% of the replanting would be located in
the three most important districts which were served by the first project
(Kalutara, Kegalle, and Ratnapura) (Annex 3, Table 1).
3.7       The management of the routine inspections of replanting and release
of relevant payments is being improved and expedited by the use of
computers. Nevertheless, some inefficiencies due to overlapped functions
remain and a committee to be appointed by MPI (para. 5.4) would determine
responsibility for inspection and certification.
3.8       Extension support to smallholders participating in the program would
be enhanced (para. 3.32). In particular, a program of scheduled farm visits
would be established and supervision and advice would be extended to the
eighth year to ensure that proper tapping techniques and tapping intervals are
being practiced. To discourage premature tapping, an eighth payment would be
introdtced that would be based on certification that 60% of the trees have
reached a girth of 50 cm prior to tapping being started.
3.9       Input supplies would be fur .er streamlined.  Better control of
planting material legitimacy and quality would result from placing sole
responsibility for it with RCD (para. 5.6). A pilot program to test a
computer-generated voucher qystem for fertilizer supply through Agrarian
Service Centers and private traders would be launched. If successful, this
arrangement would enable extension officers who presently distribute
fertilizer to spend more time in the field.



- 17 -
New Planting
3.10      To partly offset the loss of an average of about 500 ha of rubber
land per year to urbanization and through diversion to other crops, notably
tea (in the wetter areas), smallholder rubber planting is encouraged. Most
new rubber is planted to replace derelict coconuts, or on uncultivated land,
particularly in suitable areas in the dry zone. New plantings qualify for
benefits from the RRF and would receive the same input and advisory support as
replanting. A target of 400 ha of new planting per year through the project
implementation period has been assumed.
Nurseries
3.11      RCD is responsible for providing planting material to the smallhold-
ers. Unfortunately, the arrangement under which the two public-sector corpo-
rations were to produce budded stumps under contract proved unsatisfactory
(para. 2.49) in that the material produced by the corporations was frequently
deficient in quantity, quality, and the clones made available. Consequently,
private nurseries have been encouraged to supply stumps for the smallholder
program, and in addition RCD has recently established two large nurseries of
its own.
3.12      A limited amount of technical supervision of the nurseries has been
provided by the Nursery Inspection Unit of RRI, while licensing of private
nurseries and procurement of stumps for the program is an RCD function. The
CLSD outbreak revealed serious mislabeling and mixing of planting material and
it became clear that more frequent supervision would be essential and that a
single entity should be responsible (para. 3.9).
3.13      The CLSD outbreak also necessitates the introduction of routine
weekly spraying of nurseries--an innovation in Sri Lanka--which would require
not only advice and supervision, but also the purchase of equipment. As
discussed in para. 2.43, commercial credit is rarely available for small
agricultural enterprises like nurseries. In view of the vital need for the
nurseries to be properly equipped, GOSL would make loan finance available [in
a similar manner to that already provided to GPCs (para. 2.35)1. A revolving
fund of Rs 2.1 million would be established by RCD, from which loans would be
made to licensed private nursery owners for nursery infrastructure, equipment,
and working capital. The loans would carry an interest rate of 12.5% with
repayment periods of up to five years. As RCD would contract to purchase the
planting material produced by the nurseries, loan recovery can be made at
source. It is assumed that most nurseries would require loans of about
Rs 15,000 to acquire spraying equipment, and that about 25 would see' larger
loans of around Rs 80,000. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that
GOSL would make a budgetary allocation to fully finance the revolving fund by
December 31, 1988, and would ensure that an adequate balance is maintained in
the fund throughout the project period.
3.14      RCD would establish an additional large nursery in the Galle region,
for which suitable land has already been obtained. It is envisaged that the
RCD nurseries would concentrate progressively on budwood supply to private
nurseries, to ensure the legitimacy of the planting material produced.  They



- 18 -
would also spearhead the introduction of the green-budding system of propaga-
tion (para. 6.2) as soon as adequate extension capacity is available to ensure
successful utilization by the farmers.
Corynespora Disease
3.15      An outbreak of CLSD, which hitherto had not been known to afflict
rubber in Sri Lanka, comnenced in 1986 and rapidly spread to attack RRIC 103
and its parent clone RRIC 52, both of which were highly susceptible.
3.16      It was quickly realized that the disease would inevitably kill
almost all the trees of those clones and some others which are closely rela-
ted. In the process, very high levels of disease spores would be generated.
As such heavy inoculum pressure would threaten the resistance of the few other
clones, there was clearly a major risk to the entire rubber industry. Fur-
thermore, on the basis of expert advice, it was recognized that any spread of
the disease into PB 86, the main clone of the industry, could only be com-
batted by helicopter spraying, which would be prohibitively expensive.
3.17      Consequently, GOSL reached decision to require the uprooting of the
susceptible clones to avoid an inoculum buildup. This decision is technically
correct and, in any case, only hastens the inevitable loss of the trees
involved. Nevertheless, the loss is a severe blow to the growers--be it the
estates which pioneered the planting of these officially recommended clones,
or the more receptive and enterprising smallholders who were persuaded to
plant RRIC 103 under the first project.
3.18      Although replanting of the affected areas would qualify for normal
RRF benefits, it is clear that severe financial losses have been incurred
resulting from lost or extremely delayed production, and additional costs.
Two thousand four hundred fifty smallholders have planted about 1,700 ha of
CLSD susceptible clones and would face the hardship of an additional six or
seven years before their rubber income resumes, plus the cost of their
contribution to the new replanting. GOSL recognizes that in order to restore
confidence in official recommendations and to avoid hostility to advanced
clones, which must be introduced in the future, it is essential that the
smallholders involved receive financial support. Likewise the estate
corporations which are already in serious financial difficulty require
assistance to overcome the losses incurred on the approximately 2,700 ha of
susceptible clones which they have planted.
3.19      Under the circumstances, GOSL, in spite of constrained finances,
finds it appropriate to provide incentives to those affected by the disease so
that they will remain in the rubber industry. Thus assistance for the
identifiable financial losses incurred would be provided under the RRF. A
careful analysis by GOSL has indicated that the total cost, to be entirely met
from the RRF would be approximately Rs 198 million.



- 19 -
Latex Collection and Processing
3.20      In spite of the obvious difficulties in establishing viable CPCs,
the advantages that they offer to smallholders when successful, through the
production of higher-value RSS, justify further limited development. It has
been demonstrated on a pilot scale that when Savings and Loan facilities are
included smallholder enthusiasm for participating in GPCs is greatly enhance
(para 2.36). Therefore the 20 new GPCs to be established under the project,
and the existing ones would be encouraged to set up Savings and Loan
services. An accounts clerk would be assigned to each ASD Regional Office to
assist GPCs in the maintenance of their financial records and in their
relationships with rural banks.
3.21      The major fluctuations in the prices for RSS and crepe that occur
fairly frequently naturally result in significant changes in the relative
value of latex destined for either end-use. So that GPCs can direct their
members' latex to the more profitable end-use, the LCPCs to be established
under the project would have, where appropriate, bulk latex-handling
facilities to enable them to sell latex directly to crepe factories when the
price offered exceeded the equivalent value of RSS. Provision would also be
made to retrofit existing GPCs with latex tanks where justified by proximity
to crepe factories.
3.22      New LCPCs are estimated to cost Rs 110,000; while approximately
80 existing GPCs would be rehabilitated and upgraded at a cost of about
Rs 15,000 each. In continuation of existing practice (para. 2.35), which is
justified by the need to assist impoverished small farmers and by the lack of
credit facilities available to them (para. 2.43), GOSL has agreed to establish
by December 31, 1988 a fund in ASD through project financing which would make
available grants of 50% of the cost, and loans for the remainder at 10%
repayable over 12 years. The provision of these small grants and of loans at
minimal interest is justified because the poor farmers could never provide or
attract finance required for the investment which would benefit both them and
the State. Government investment would amount to approximately US$57,000
which may be compared with the revenue from export tax on rubber of about
US$11 million per year. To ensure sound and viable operation, assurances have
been obtained chat: (i) GOSL would make arrangements by December 31, 1988 for
the Coopsrative Department to undertake the registration of exiting GPCs and
new LCPCs, so as to provide qualified processing centers with a legal entity;
(ii) no new LCPC would be established in the project area until rubber growers
owning between them not less than 100 acres of productive rubber pledge to
joir -he LCPC and to deliver their latex to it; and (iii) comce.ncing in 1989,
GOSL would make annual budgetary allocations to ASD sufficient to finance the
establishment of five LCPCs and the upgrading of 20 GPCs per year for four
years.
3.23      When latex is sold to crepe factories, the factory, or in some cases
buying agents, would provide Lransport. In the case of public sector crepe
factories, funds for the necessary vehicles are available under the ongoing
Fourth Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE), while private factories would have
access to credit under the Second Small and Medium Industries Project
(Cr. 1182-CE).



- 20 -
Institutional Development
3.24      A number of unsatisfactory interfaces of institutional responsibil-
ity would be addressed in order to improve the performance of the institutions
involved in the proposed project. The respective roles of RCD and ASD in
field inspection and certification and in input supply are major issues due to
the present overlapping of functions.  At the same time, elements of "under-
lap" exist in the supervision of private nurseries, where both RRI and RCD
provide insufficient support.
3.25      The inspection and certification of field d3velopment has been a
particularly difficult issue, but must be resolved to avoid confusion among
the farmers and delay in grant payments. Consequently, MPI has agreed to set
up a committee to determine the appropriate role(s) of ASD and/or RCD in the
certification of rubber planting and replanting activities for RRF benefit
pay'-z-t-s (para. 5.4).
3.6 &     Rubber Control Department.  RCD would be stretgthened so that it
coulI 'l 'fectively perform its functions of procuring planting material and
licensing private nurseries. To this end, an agreement was reached chat the
nursery inspection unit of RRI would be transferred to RCD by December 31,
1988. The unit would then be built up to provide quarterly visits to all
participating nurseries. Additional staff, equipment, training, and technical
assistance would be provided to ensure the effectiveness of the nursery
inspection and advisory activities. RCD would also set up and manage the
revolving fund for loans to private nurseries (para. 3.13). For convenience,
the fund would also be utilized to provide loans to Rubber Planting Aides
(RPA) for the purchase of survey equipment (para. 3.33).
3.27      RCD would establish a new nursery in Galle District (para. 3.14),
which would supply stumps for smallholders and budwood for private nurseries.
The nursery would be provided with the necessary buildings, sprinkler irriga-
tion system, and equipment.
3.28      Great strides have been made in the computerized management of the
RRF on a regional basis (para. 2.15). However, it is now necessary to orga-
nize the mass of documentary records associated with rubber registration and
replanting certification. Under the project the files would be transferred to
microfilm by contract, and the equipment needed to manage the system would be
obtained.
3.29      A regional office and associated staff quarters would be constructed
and equipped at Galle, and a new suboffice would be established in rented
premises in Moneragala. The computer system would be further enharced and
much of the proposed training program would be devoted to computer operations
and to management. Local technical assistance would be provided to advise on
further improvements in the management of the rubber replanting scheme.
Internationally recruited technical assistance would advise on the management
of the RCD nurseries.



- 21 -
3.30      Advisory Services Department.  In view of its critical role in the
success of the project, ASD would be strengthened both physically and
institutionally. Experience under the first project has shown that more
intensive extension support is necessary if smallholder replanting is to
achieve its objectives. Furthermore, it would be necessary to continue that
support for up to eight years to ensure that early tapping is properly done
and that good tapping habits are adopted. ASD would assume full
responsibility for extension services to smallholders planting new areas to
rubber, who would also benefit from the same input supply arrangements as
replanters.
3.31      A careful review of the extension input required to ensure that the
results of the smallholder rubber program fully benefit the farmers and the
State, and that they are commensurate with the investments made, indicates
that a holding requires a series of 36 extension visits during the replanting
and early tapping period. This in turn means that ASD requires 254 Rubber
Extension Officers to support the program, together with the necessary super-
visory grades, facilities, and logistics, giving a ratio of 1 REO to 630
smallholders (1 per 128 ha of planting/replanting activity).
3.32      There are currently 122 extension workers at post (including proces-
sing advisers, who would become part of a unified extension force), and a GOSL
commitment to employ an additional 44 (para. 2.49). Thus 88 REOs would be
actually incremental and their posts, together with associated supervisory and
support staff, would be financed under the project on a declining basis. An
assurance was obtained that all the additional staff would be recruited
progressively by December 31, 1990. The necessary civil works, vehicles
(mainly motorcycles), and equipment for the entire service would also be
financed. Motorcycles are essential for REO's mobility. An assurance was
therefore obtained that they would abe sold to them through a loan on the same
concessional. terms as are available to field staff in other Ministries. The
policy is considered acceptable as: (a) there are major advantage to GOSL in
REOs owning their own motorcycles; (b) in the course of their duties, the REOs
will have to use them on very rough tracks, which would limit their useful
life to about five years; and, (c) GOSL's established mileage rates are
inadequate to cover costs so that REOs would not be prepared to procure
machines on a full cost basis. Motorcycles would be replaced on the same
basis after five years. Although pilot schemes for fertilizer supply through
local outlets should indeed be tested (para. 5.8), it is assumed for now that
ASD will continue to undertake the task of fertilizer distribution. Appropri-
ate equipment would therefore be provided.
3.33      The number of extension visits stated in para. 3.31 is based on the
assumption that ASD would implement their proposal to encourage adequately
educated village youth to undertake for a fee the task of establishing con-
tours and marking the planting points. The use of such private Rubber Plant-
ing Aides would involve a campaign to select and train interested young
persons and the provisions of loans for their basic equipment (abney levels
and measuring tapes). Moreover, this initiative would increase rural employ-
ment and eliminate the need for an additional 21 REOs. ASD would select and
train candidates, and those passing the course would be licensed by RCD
(para. 5.9) and be eligible for loans for survey equipment. Up to Rs 1,500



- 22 -
would be made available from the RCD revolving fund (para. 3.26) at 12.5%
interest, repayable over two years. The fee for the survey work would be paid
by the smallholder, who would be compensated by an equivalent increase in the
replanting grant. In the event that the RPAs' performance proves satis-
factory, they could be trained in tree measurement and panel marking to effect
further savings in the number of REOs required. The ultimate aim would be to
have village-based private specialists providing the routine, but time-
consuming support to the replanting program on   commercial basis, thus
allowing the ASD staff to concentrate on agro.  hnical aspects and problem
cases.
3.34      ASD's Training Center would receive additional support so that it
could play a full role in the induction training of the additional staff and
could undertake in-service courses for REOs and newly selected supervisors.
Much of the routine training of farmers would be transferred to the ARCs
(para. 3.36), which would be provided with appropriate facilities and
equipment.
3.35      Training to be provided to ASD staff would emphasize extension
methodology, communications skills, and training methods. In addition to
appropriate study tours, an internationally recruited consultant would advise
on the effective implementation of the new extension strategy.
3.36      Adaptive Research.  RI would establish three small ARCs (of three
ha each) that would be located so as to give broad coverage of the main rubber
growing districts. The centers would have a dual purpose, in that they would
provide a base for on-farm, smallholder related trials and investigations and
facilities for farmer training and demonstrations. Provisions of suitable
land for the centers has already been arranged.
3.37      Each substation would be provided with buildings to accommodate an
office, a simple field laboratory, a lecture hall and a store. Accommodation
for staff would be constructed and would include guest facilities for visiting
staff. The substation would have limited agricultural and technical equip-
ment, as most trials would be conducted on smallholdings. Each station would
be headed by a Research Assistant supported by two Technical Officers and
would be visited by scientists responsible for the trials and by ASD staff
conducting training courses for farmers.
3.38      To ensure that RRI has the capacity to provide more detailed advice
on fertilizer applications, provision would be made to replace the main equip-
ment in the analytical laboratory, which is nearing the end of its useful
life. Major items would be an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and an auto
analyzer. The substations would have simple facilities for preparing and
drying soil and leaf samples, which would then be sent to RRI for analysis.
3.39      The most important adaptive research activity would be the testing
of all internationally available, proven, advanced clones in simple trials
located in each agroclimatic zone (Annex 5). Such testing is essential in
view of the serious lack of modern planting material available to the
industry. An assurance was obtained that priority would be given to
establishing these clone trials. Other adaptive research would cover investi-



- 23 -
gation of suitable tapping system, i cluding "slaughter" tapping, tests to
determine the best method of introducing more advanced plant propagation
systems to smallholdings and intercropping trials.
3.40      Project Coordinating Unit.  The PCU, established in MPI during the
first project has performed very satisfactorily and would continue its
activities in the proposed project. Provision would be made to replace the
units' vehicles and to augment the staff by a bookkeeper and a stenotypist.
3.41      Monitoring Committee.  In order to enhance the effectiveness of
monitoring and evaluation of the program, MPI would establish a small
Monitoring Committee to be modeled on the highly effective Investment
Monitoring Board created for the estate sector under the Fourth Tree Crops
Project (Cr. 1562-CE). The Committee would be composed of a few eminent and
independent persons with relevant experience to monitor the progress of the
project and to evaluate the results obtained, in particular the quality of the
field work. The Committee would require limited administrative and clerical
input, to be provided by the PCU, and would engage local consultants to report
on field activities. The Committee would report to the Secretary and to IDA
every six months. Operating costs of the Committee would be financed under
the project and its establishment, with membership and terms of reference
acceptable to IDA would be a Condition of Effectiveness of the credit.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
4.1       Total project cost is estimated at Rs 2,485 M (US$73.1 M), which
would include duties and taxes (US$0.6 M), smallholders' labor contribution
(US$17.1 M), and the existing fertilizer subsidies (US$3.0 M). The foreign
exchange component is US$15.8 M, 22% of total project cost. Physical
contingencies are estimated at 10% for field development and civil works
account for 9% of total base costs, which are calculated in end-1987 prices.
Price contingencies, 20Z of base costs, have been applied in accordance with

- 25 -
4.3       The proposed IDA credit of US$23.5 M would finance about 32% of
project costs excluding duties and taxes. It would cover full foreign
exchange costs (US$15.8 M) and 13% of local costs (US$7.7 M). A major element
would be the provision of $19.4 M to support the RRF (Annex 1). The
equivalent of US$27.5 M would be met from the RRF generated by the cess on
rubber exports (para. 2.23). Smallholders would contribute the equivalent of
US$17.1 in labor. GOSL would finance the balance of project costs (US$5 M)
including fertilizer subsidies, duties, and taxes.
4.4       GOSL would allocate funds to provide credit to private commercial
nurseries (para. 3.13), RPAs (para. 3.33), and LCPCs (para. 3.22).
4.5       Funds would be made available to the implementing agencies in the
form of normal budgetary allocations.
C. Procurement
4.(       The main items to be supported by the IDA credit are field
operations, civil works, laboratory and office equipment, vehicles, training
and technical assistance, and incremental operating costs. Procurement
arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.

4.7       Field Operations.  Field operations (US$67.1 M) accounting for 92%
of total costs, entail replanting, new planting, nursery establishment and



- 26 -
compensation for CLSD affected holdings. Replanting and new planting would be
carried out by individual smallholders using family or hired labor. Private
nurseries would be eligibie for loans from a revolving fund to be established
by GOSL. Planting materials and other inputs would be supplied by RCD, state
plantations, private nurseries and other traditional sources of supply.
4.8       Works.  Contracts for civil works (US$0.7 M), which account for
about 1% of total base costs, would be small and widely dispersed and not
likely to interest foreign bidders. These works would be procured through
local competitive bidding procedures that were found at appraisal to be
satisfactory to the IDA.
4.9       Goods.  Equipment and vehicles totaling US$2 M equivalent would be
grouped to the extent practicable to increase competition in bidding, and
packages of US$50,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of ICB
in accordanze with the IDA Procurement Guidelines. Qualifying domestic
manufacturers would receive a 15Z preference in bid evaluation. RCD and ASD
field staff would be provided with motorcycles at reduced prices (para. 3.32).
Bulk orders would be assembled for procurement through ICB. GOSL would extend
loans to these officers to finance their purchases, using an existing
government loan scheme under which ioan repayments are automatically deducted
from their salaries. Miscellaneous items of equipment and furniture in
packages less than US$50,000 and totaling about US$0.5 M would be procured
under local competitive bidding procedures, which were found at appraisal to
be satisfactory to IDA. Item costing less than US$200, to a total of
US$50,000, would be procured by prudent shopping.
4.10      Services.  Consultants would be selected in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. Incremental operating costs would not be subject to procurement
guidelines.
4.11      Contract Review.  With the usual threshold of US$100,000 for prior
IDA review of procurement documentation, few, if any, of the contracts would
be liable to contract review.
D. Disbursements
4.12      Disbursements under the credit would be completed in nine years.
This profile is based on the experience of the ongoing Smallholder Rubber
Rehabilitation Project (Cr 1017-CE), which is to be disbursed in eight
years. Allowance is made for an additional year because of the larger and
more scattered replanting area.
4.13      The credit would be disbursed on the following basis:

cashflow (Annex 1)).

1990 70% until June 30, 1992; 50% until June 30, 1994; and 30%
thereafter.
4.14      For expenditures relating to categories (1), (2), and (5), under
contracts each costing less than US $100,000 equivalent, reimbursements would
be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements
against all other items would be fully documented. The SOEs would be
certified by the Project Coordinator and the Head of the implementing
agency. Supporting documentation would be retained by the project imple-
menting agencies and made available for review by supervision missions. They
would be audited by the Auditor General. In the case of new planting and
replanting the SOEs would be supported by progress reports showing physical
quantities and unit prices agreed by the Association.
4.15      The estimated schedule of disbursements by IDA fiscal year on a
semester and cumulative basis is shown in Annex 2, Table 7. The project would
be completed by June 30, 1996 and the closing date of the credit would be
June 30, 1997.



- 28 -
E. Special Account
4.16      In order to facilitate prefinancing of project expenditures under
different categories, a special account would be opened by COSL in the Central
Bank of Sri Lanka. An initial deposit of US$800,000 equivalent, representing
4 mortths estimated average project expenditure would be made in the special
account by IDA upon receipt of a direct payment application from GOSL,
supported by appropriate evidence that such an account has been opened. GOSL
would furnish to IDA requests for replenishment of the special account at
specific intervals. On the basis of such requests, IDA would withdraw from
the Credit and deposit in the special account such amounts as requir-d to
replenish the special account, but not exceeding the amount of payments made
for eligible expenditures. Each such deposit would be withdrawn by IDA from
the Credit un-'er the respective categories and in respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by the evidence supporting the request
for such a deposit. GOSL would furnish to IDA such evidence showing that
payment was made for eligible expenditures.
F. Accounts and Audits
4.17      Participating agencies (RCD, ASD, and RRI) would be subject to
normal government control and auditing procedures that are satisfactory to the
Bank.  Assurances were obtained that participating agencies would keep
separate accounts of expenditure made under the project irrespective of
whether these would be eligible for IDA reimbursement. The Project
Coordinating Unit in the Ministry of Plantation Industries would consolidate
the individual accounts prepared by the participating agencies. These
accounts would be audited annually for each fiscal year in accordance with
sound auditing principles consistently applied. Accounts would be submitted
to the Auditor General, considered as an independent government auditor
acceptable to IDA, within 4 months of the end of the financial year, and would
be audited not later than 10 months after the end of such year. The audit
report would be submitted to IDA within 12 months after the end of each
year. The audit report would include inter alia, a separate opinion that
funds disbursed agains. statements of expenditure had been used for the
purpose for which they were provided.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Implementation
5.1       The proposed project would be implemented over eight years by RCD,
ASD, and RRI under the overall responsibility of MPI. MPI would ensure proper
planning and coordination through the existing RPPU (which performs the
functions of a Steering Committee, and is composed of senior staff of MPI and
the project entities, and of the Department of External Resources of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning), and through the PCU. The organization of
MPI is shown in Figure 1.



- 29 -
5.2       Because of the physical time-slice nature of the project, it would
inevitably overlaps with the first project, which has already established
planting material in the nurseries for use in the first year. Likewise,
maintenance of much of the rubber planted during the first project would be
undertaken under the proposed project (see Annex 1). The Project
Implementation Schedule is presented in Annex 6.
5.3       The roles of the respective entities in implementing the project
(described below) are by and large clear-cut. An exception, however, is the
respective roles of RCD and ASD in the inspection and certification of
smallholders' plantations for authorization of release of replanting
benefits. The present arrangement of shar?d inspection responsibility is
unsatisfactory, but the two organizatiotas .re unable to agree on a revised
arrangement.
5.4       In view of the importance of resolving this problem, MPI has
appointed a small committee to determine  le appropriate role(s) of ASD and/or
RCD in the certification of rubber planting and replanting activities for
benefit payments. Determination by the comnri ttee of the procedure and
responsibilities for certification for RRF pkv'ments, acceptable to IDA, and
their implementation by MPI, would be a Cond.tion of Effectiveness.
B.  Rubber Control Department
5.5       RCD would relinquish operational re.4ponsibility for, and direct
input supply to, new planting and for replent:ng in the areas not served by
the first project. However, legal respons.bil.ity for all expenditure from RRF
would be retained as would the responsibility for issuing planting and
replanting licenses.
5.6       With the transfer of the nursery inspection unit from RRI
(para. 3.26), the unit would then be appropriately strengthened and RCD would
be fully responsible for the supply of planting material. It would license
and technically supervise private nurseries, providing them with loans, if
necessary, from a revolving fund established under the project. In the case
of the smaller private nurseries, RCD would provide their budwood. It would
place contracts with state and private nurseries for the supply of budded
stumps for RRS, would inspect the material produced, and ensure that all
stumps are distributed with labels and documentation indicating the source
nursery and the clone with which the stumps are budded. Nurseries found to
misbud or mislabel stumps would be liable to lose their licenses.
5.7       RCD would operate its own nurseries to provide a supply of
legitimate budwood and to augment the limited planting material available from
the private sector. The RCD nurseries should be models of proper nursery
practice, but full costing would be maintained to allow valid comparison with
other sources of planting material.
5.8       The computer facilities installed in RCD allow much more detailed
management of the RRS and afford an opportunity to automate some aspects of
input supply. Thus it is proposed that pilot trials of fertilizer supply be
undertaken, using Agrarian Service Centers in one district and private traders



- 30 -
in another to release fertilizer to farmers against computer-generated
vouchers. This scheme would ensure timely availability of fertilizer and
effect important savings in extension staff time, as well as avoid the high
cost of transport and storage facilities. If successful, the arrangement
would be extended to all other districts.
5.9       RCD would license the RPAs trained by ASD and make small loans
available to them for basic survey equipment (para. 3.33). In consultation
with ASD, it would also set the scale of fees that RPAs could charge farmers
for their services.
5.10      Refund of RRF cess levied on rubber produced by the State
corporations would be made by RCD (para. 2.30). Payments would be made
quarterly on the basis of 90% of certified estate rubber sales. The assump-
tion being that 10% is utilized in the domestic market which currently pays no
cess (para. 2.32).
5.11      RCD would be responsible for disbursing compensation from the RRF to
holdings that had planted RRIC 103 and other CLSD susceptible clones after
they have been uprooted (para 3.19). It would also ensure that such holdings
have priority for replanting in 1988.
C. Rubber Research Board
5.12      The Board's two institutions--RRI and ASD, are of particular
importance, but while the institutional status of the former is well defined,
that of ASD has yet to be fully formalized. However, as the committee (para
5.4) determining the respective roles of ASD and RCD may propose changes in
the functions and status of both Departments, institutional action at this
time would be premature. Consequently, agreement was reached that any
administrative or legislative actions needed to formalize the status of ASD
will be taken on the basis of the committee's report.
5.13      In order to improve the Board's supervision of ASD and RRI and to
enhance its ability to increase the relevance and efficiency of their work,
RRB has established two permanent subcommittees for Extension and Research,
composed of the members with the most relevant experience. Responsibilities
of the subcommittees would include approval of work programs and review of
performance and achievements.
D. Advisory Services Department
5.14      ASD would assume full responsibility for all smallholder rubber
extension activities, but would of necessity concentrate its resources on
supporting farmers engaged in replanting and planting and on promoting and
providing technical support for LCPCs. ASD would take the initiative in
contacting these groups, but would assist farmers with mature rubber or
individual processing problems if requested.



- 31 -
5.15      There is an obvious need for a high degree of success in replanting
and planting, commensurate with the heavy investment of time and finances
involved. However, for most farmers, the activity is a once-in-a-lifetime
event of which they have no previous personal experience and from which they
will gain knowledge of no further personal use. ASD would therefore provide a
supervisory form of extension, based on a program of visits to each individual
holding involved. The number and frequency of the visits would vary with the
stage of field activity. Each REO would have a schedule of farm visits agreed
with his supervisor, the DREO, who would periodically make simultaneous visits
to the holdings to observe the work of the REOs. Special attention would be
given tc checking the quality of the work of the RPAs until experience
confirms their competence. The organization of ASD is shown in Figure 2.
5.16      DREOs would coordinate the supply of planting material by RCD to
ensure timely delivery. Pending the results of the pilot trials of fertilizer
supply through computer-generated vouchers (para. 5.8), ASD would retain
responsibility for fertilizer distribution.
5.17      With the absorption of PAD staff into general extension activities,
REOs would be responsible for advising on RSS-processing techniques. Where
appropriate, they would also support LCPCs or CPCs with advice and
encouragement.
5.18      Greater emphasis would be placed on staff training, which would
become the primary role of the Training Center. Expansion of the extension
staff and of their range of activities would ..ecessitate the provision of
courses for new recruits, existing staff, and RPAs. Most farmer training
would be transferred to the Adaptive Research Centers. The Training Center
facilities would continue to be made available to RCD for courses for nursery
staff.
E.  Rubber Research Institute
5.19      RRI's direct activity under the project would be to establish,
staff, and operate the three Adaptive Research Stations (para. 3.36) and to
carry out the trials programs, including the testing of advanced clones in the
various agroclimatic zones and the various on-farm trials. These activities
would be under the overall control of the Director, who would assign
appropriate specialists to undertake responsibility for specific trial
programs.
5.20      Among RRI services that would benefit the project would be the
analysis of soils and leaves to resolve nutrient problems, the provision of
nucleus budwood, the identification of clones, and the investigation of and
provision of advice on pests and diseases.  RRI scientists would continue to
participate in training courses as resource persons.



- 32 -
F. Extension/Research Linkages
5.21      There would be three levels of linkage.  The 4daptive Research
Centers constitute the first and most important level. At this level research
staff would confront on-farm problems and interface directly with REOs and
farmers. Their participation in the training courses for the latter would
further heighten their appreciation of real problems that require study.
5.22      The respective ASD and RRI Directors are in frequent contact and
would evaluate the views of their staffs on the priorities foc research and
the technical responses to field problems. Finally, the creation of the
Extension and Research subcommittees within RRB is expected to increase the
Board's awareness of the need for responsive and relevant research and for the
development of extendable packages to improve smallholder performance.
G.  Project Coordinating Unit
5.23      PCU would continue to coordinate all aspects of project imple-
mentation and to serve as the point of contact between the implementing
agencies and IDA. Specific responsibilities of the unit would be to: help
the agencies prepare their annual project work plans and budgets; undertake
procurement procedures; carryout reporting and monitoring; submit disbursement
applications; and prepare progress reports and project accounts. PCU would be
responsible for collating these reports and accounts and submitting them to
IDA. Quarterly reports on project progress would be submitted to IDA within 2
months of the end of each quarter. Senior staff of the unit would prepare the
Project Completion Report.
5.24      PCU would provide the staff and secretarial support for the
Monitoring Committee.
5.25      PCU is headed by a satisfactory Project Coordinator and is
performing its duties well. However, in view of the enlarged scale of the
proposed project, an assurance was obtained that the position of Project
Coordinator would at all times be filled on a fulltime basis by a person whose
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA.
H. Smallholder Rubber Policy Planning Unit
5.26      RPPU consists of a working group of senior MPI and implementing
agency officials, and is supported by a planning secretariat headed by tho
Project Coordinator. It addresses all aspects of smallholder and marketing
and advises GOSL accordingly. RPPU would continue those functions, as well as
interact with IDA supervision missions.
I. Monitoring Committee
5.27      The Committee would meet at regular intervals to program the studies
to be made, approve the consultants, and consider and report on their
findings. The chairman would make all necessary arrangements thrcugh the PCU
staff.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Technical Aspects
6.1       The planting program involves the production or acquisition of
planting material, land clearing and preparation, crop establishment, and
maintenance operations.
6.2       Planting material would be supplied by RCD, initially as bare root
budded stumps, about 20 months old. As the project progressed, there would be
a changeover to green budding to reduce nursery costs and improve the rate of
saccessful establishment. PB 86 would be the most frequently used clone in
the early years.
6.3       Land clearing is by manual methods, and often old rubber trees are
sold to contractors, who dispose of them for firewood, timber, and pit
props. Hand powered winches and chainsaws are used to remove the trees. Use
of the former allows diseased roots to be identified and burnt.
6.4       After all necessary erosion control and drainage works are completed
the plants are established on the contour to achieve a density of 445 trees
per ha. Fertilizer is applied as standard mixtures, and intercropping of
young rubber is permitted. It is assumed that this activity would become more
popular as a result of on-fsrm research to be conducted under the project
(para. 3.39).
6.5       Tapping, mainly carried out by family labor, should commence in the
sixth year after planting. The tapping schedule currently recommended for
mallholders in given in Annex 3, Table 2. With greater extension emphasis on
early tapping technique, the tapping performance of smallholders benefiting
from the project is expected to improve significantly.
B. Yield and Production
6.6       Yield estimates take into account the yield potential of the
planting material and the possibility of a degree of mismanagement on the part
of some smallholders, who often suspend tapping during periods of high labor
demand for rice. Thus, as ran be seen in Annex 3, Table 2, the average annual
yield for the 24 years of tapping is assumed to be 875 kg/ha. During the 15
years of mature production, peak yield is 1,100 kg/ha and the average is 980
kg/ha.
6.7       Total production of a hectare of replanted, or newly planted
smallholder rubber during the 24 years of tapping would be almost 21 tons;
thus the total output of the 38,750 ha established under the proposed project
would be almost 813,000 tons. Peak annual production resulting from the
project would be 42,300 tons in 2006, and annual production would exceed
35,000 tons from 2002 to 2011. Production estimates for the project
replanting and new planting are shown in Annex 3, Table 3.



- 34 -
C. Marketing
6.8       Sri Lanka accounts for about 4% of the world market for natural
rubber (KR). In Sri Lanka itself local consumption has been rising steadily,
from negligible proportions prior to 1970 to the present level of about 13% of
production. Production is expected to rise by about 11% between 1986 and
2000, to about 152,000 MT, but the share of exports is expected to remain
constant at about 87%. About 54% of Sri Lanka's rubber is processed into RSS,
34Z into crepes, and the balance into TSR, block rubber, and latex
concentrate. Sri Lanka is renowned for its premium quality sole crepe.
6.9       World consumption of rubber is determined largely by international
industrial growth, which is expected to average about 2.6% per annum up to
2000. Throughout the 1970s world consumption of NR grew more slowly than
synthetic rubber, with a consequent decline in NR market share. Since 1980,
however, there has been a modest recovery, and NR market share has stabilized
at about 32%.
6.10      Global production potential of NR for the next few years is
considered adequate to meet the expected growth in demand.  However, NR outt:4t
may eventual decline due to an expected reduction in the area under rubber i:;
Malaysia, the biggest NR producing and exporting country, where labor is
becoming to expensive for marginal producers and where competition for land
from other tree crops, particularly oil palm, is increasingly strong. As a
result, relatively low-cost producers like Sri Lanka will continue to have a
comparative advantage in NR production. Moreover, as Sri Lanka accounts for
only about 4% of world exports and has its own niche in the crepe market, the
incremental output from the project will have little impact on the world
market and should be easily disposed of at a remunerative price.
D. Prices
6.11      In the short-run, NR prices are liable to fluctuate widely because
both demand and supply are relatively price inelastic. The long-term price
trend of NR showed a steady decline through the mid-1980s, falling from
US$1,230/MT in 1983 to a low of US$800/MT in 1986. NR price have risen again
to US$1200/MT in 1988. It is projected to fall again to US$730/MT in 1989 and
then to rise steadily to US$950/MT by the year 2000.
6.12      The price projections used for the analysis of the project are shown
in Annex 4, Table 5.
E. Producer Margins
6.13      Even though rubber yields in Sri Lanka have been lower than those
for the more advanced producers, like Malaysia, costs of production are lower
and Sri Lanka smallholders receive an acceptable margin. The farm gate price
is determined by the free market and is roughly derived from the Singapore
price for RSS. The average farm gate price in current values between 1984 and
1986 was Rs 14.36/kg (Annex 4 Table 1). Costs of production, for smallholders
using family labor averaged Rs 4.86/kg, leaving a profit of Rs 9.50/kg,
roughly equivalent to Rs 53/work day, which compares with the average agricul-



- 35 -
tural wage of Rs 35/day. In the case of srallholdings employing labor, the
cost of production averages Rs 10.84/kg, leaving a profit of Rs 3.52/kg.
F. Financial Analysis
6.14      Cash flows have been prepared for smalliolders under two scenarios:
(a)  using only family labor (Annex 4, Table 3).
(b)  using only hired labor (Annex 4, Table 4).
The analysis incorporates the projected increases in the price of rubber,
which are based on Bank forecasts, and the replanting payments made to small-
holders out of the RRF (para. 2.28). The analysis shows that the financial
rate of return on the smallholders' own investment would be 31Z for small-
holders relying entirely on family labor and 18X for smallholders relying
entirely on an hired labor. These results indicate that replanting would be
attractive to smallholders.
G. Cost Recovery
6.15      Rubber exports are presently taxed at about 15% of export value.
These taxes account for about 4% of GOSL budgetary revenue (para. 2.4).
6.16      Finance of RRF.  The RRF would be financed by (i) the RRF cess
(para. 2.41) and (ii) project funding (1988-1995). Estimates of RRF long term
cash inflow/outflow (Annex 1) indicate that after 1995 the RRF support of
replanting operatiors will be sustainable by the RRF cess. This is based on
the following assumptions for which assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions: (a) that the RRF cess would be extended to rubber used by domestic
industries not later than January 1, 1996; (b) that the rate of cess would be
gradually adjusted to keep the overall finances of RRF in positive balance;
and (c) that COSL would consult with the Working Group on Tree Crops Producer
Margins to ensure that specific increases in the cess do not adversely affect
minimum producer margins.
6.17      Revolving fund loans made to private nurseries (para. 3.13), RPAs
(para. 3.33), and LPCPs (para. 8.22) would be fully recovered.
VII. BENEFITS, COSTS, AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
7.1       Under the project, Sri Lanka would obtain direct benefits from the
increased production of better quality rubber, 87% of which would be exported
to earn foreign exchange equivalent to about US$870 million, valued at export
parity prices in constant 1987 U.S. dollars. The Government benefits would
also accrue from export taxes. The project would maintain economic activity
in rubber growing areas that would become depressed without a rubber
replanting program as there are rarely any viable alternative cropping
opportunities for the land on which rubber would be replanted.



- 36 -
7.2       During project implementation, about 2,300 man-years of incremental
employment would be created annually in the rural areas. When the rubber came
into production, about 35,000 households would benefit from productive
employment and an enhanced farm income.
B. Environmental Effects
7.3       The replacement of overaged and generally very depleted stands of
rubber with a new full canopy of trees would be beneficial to the
environment. The benefit is even more pronounced when unused land or areas
with scattered, derelict coconut palms are planted with rubber. Much steep
land is involved, but the soil conservation works required for rubber planting
and the leguminous cover crops that are routinely established and inspected
under the RRS, have the advantage of reducing run-off and preventing soil
loss. In addition ownership of profitable tree crops help to stabilize the
population and reduce the drift into new lands.
7.4       Smallholders do not use agricultural chemicals apart from limited
quantities of inorganic fertilizer applied during the immature period. Rubber
nurseries would be routinely sprayed with fungicides approved by GOSL, but
these would be alternated to avoid inducing the development of resistant
strains of the pathogens.
7.5       Effluent from rubber processing on an industrial scale can harm the
environment by polluting streams and swamps. Most of the rubber produced by
the proposed project would be processed by individual smallholders, or at
small LCPCs. These operations are too small and scattered for the latex-
contaminated wastewater to reach or harm waterways. Some latex will be sold
to crepe rubber factories belonging to the state plantation corporations.
Conditionality exists under the Fourth Tree Crops Project (Cr. 1562-CE) for
the installation of effluent treatment facilities at those factories and the
RRI is assisting the corporations in complying.
C.  Impact on Women
7.6       The principal impact of the project would be to improve the welfare
of the smallholder family as a whole. The increased income from more
productive rubber would raise the standard of living of the household.
Smallholder women may participate in rubber cultivation and processing, but
there is no specific role reserved for them.
7.7       Some women are employed in GPCs and in nurseries, but these
employment opportunities are limited. They would increase somewhat under the
project, but not to any significant degree.
D. Economic Analysis
7.8       The economic analysis is carried out in constant Sri Lanka Rupees.
The analysis covers a total of 37 years, since implementation is phased over
8 years, the immature period for rubber is 6 years, and trees would be tapped
for 24 years before the next cycle of replanting.



- 37 -
Economic Benefits
7.9       The primary benefit of the project would be the incremental
production of 773,837 tons of rubber over a span of 31 years. The price of
rubber is based on the average of the Colombo FOB price for all types of
rubber from 1984 to 1986, projected according to IBRD price trends for RSS#1
in 1987 constant prices (Annex 4, Table 5.) Project benefits consist of the
incremental rubber output above the "without project" situation. In the
absence of replanting, yields are expected to decline aaid become negligible
after five years "without project" due to excessive bark consumption and
virtually no regeneration. Yields "with" and "without" the project are shown
in Annex 3, Table 2.
Economic Costs
7.10      The cost streams used in estimating the economic rate of return
(ERR) include (a) all investment and incremental recurrent costs (including
farmers' costs) during the project implementation period; and (b) costs of
agricultural inputs over the 24-year productive life of the rubber tree.
Economic costs include physical contingencies and exclude price
contingencies. Economic costs are calculated on the basis of financial prices
adjusted for taxes and subaidies.
7.11      Project inputs consist mostly of tradeables and labor.  The price of
local inputs is shadow-priced through the application of a standard conversion
factor (SCF) of 0.75 (Annex 4, Table 6). Following IDA guidelines, the
opportunity cost of labor is taken as 80% of the market wage rate. In line
with commodity forecasts, the price of fertilizer is projected to increase
over time.
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.12      The ERR for the project is estimated at 19%.  This rate is
reasonable for a project of this nature, where field development costs account
for 92% of baseline costs.
7.13      Sensitivity tests were carried out to test the stability of the
ERR. The major sensitivity tests are sunmmarized in Table 7.1.



- 38 -
Table 7.1: SENSITIVITY TESTS
Test                                               ERR (X)
Base case                                                       19
Benefits down by 20%                                            17
Benefits lagged by 2 years                                      16
Cost overruns of 20%                                            17
Benefits down by 2,% with costs up by 20X                       i5
Benefits lagged by 2 years with costs up by 20%                 14
7.14      The sensitivity analysis shows that the project is quite robust.
Even with a two-year lag in benefits coupled with a 20% increase in cost, the
project would yield an ERR of 14Z. With a 20% decrease in benefits coupled
with a 20% increase in cost, the ERR would be 15%.
7.15      Switching values at an opportunity cost of capital of 10% (the rate
applicable for Sri Lanka) were calculated to test the percentage change in the
cost or benefit streams that would reduce the Net Present Value of the project
to zero. The results are summarized in Table 7.2.
Table 7.2: SWITCHING VALUES
Appraisal          Switching
Stream            Value              Value          % change

Benefits          3,801              1,733          -  54
Total costs       1,733              3,801          + 119
7.16      These results also indicate that the project would be economically
sound.  Either rubber prices or rubber yie.ds, or a combination of these
factors, would have to fall by 54% or total costs would have to increase by
119% for the rate of return to fall to 10%. The probability of the occurrence
of such extreme circumstances is low. The Net Present Value at 10% would be
Rs 2,068 million.
E. Project Risk
7.17      Three identifiable risks could impede the success of the project:
(a) a major decline in world rubber prices; (b) failure of the implementing
agencies to adequately motivate and guide smallholders; and (c) further
spread of CLSD to other clones. Neither of the first two possibilities are



- 39 -
considered likely. The long term prospects for rubber prices are satisfactory
for low-cost producers like Sri Lanka (para. 6.10). Also, the performance of
the implementing agencies has steadily improved throughout the first
project. They would be further strengthened and their functional
responsibilities more clearly defined.
7.18      The spread of CLSD to PB 86, the main clone, would be
catastrophic. However, this is considered to be technically unlikely and
appropriate measures are being taken to reduce the risks. As these involve
destroying susceptible trees, compensation would be provided to CLSD affected
holdings.
VIII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
8.1       During negotiations, assurances and agreements were obtained on the
following:
(a) GOSL would undertake a study of the implications of the use of RRF
funds for machinery subsidies and of subsidies for RSS equipment and
processing centers funded by the Export Development Board and the
Ministry of Cooperative Development. The study team, with member-
ship acceptable to IDA, would commence its work not later than
October 1, 1988 and submit its report through MPI to the Ministry of
Finance and Planning by March 31, 1989. The findings of the study
would be implemented by September 31, 1989 (paras. 2.28 and 2.37);
(b) GOSL would make budgetary allocation to fully finance the RCD
revolving fund by December 31, 1988, and would ensure an adequate
balance is maintained, in the fund throughout the project period
(para. 3.13);
(c)  Funds for new LCPCs and the upgrading of GPCs would be provided from
a fund, to be established in ASD by December 31, 1988, on the basis
of a grant of 50% of the cost and a loan for the remainder at 10%
repayable over 12 years (para. 3.22);
(d) GOSL would establish by December 31, 1988, a legal basis for the
operation of LCPCs satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.22);
(e) No new LCPC would be established in the project area until rubber
growers, owning between them not less than 100 acres of productive
rubber, pledge to join the LCPC and to deliver their latex to it
(para. 3.22);
(f)  Commencing in 1989, GOSL would make annual budgetary allocations to
ASD sufficient to finance the establishment of 5 LCPCs and the
upgrading of 20 GPCs per year for four years (para. 3.22);
(g) The Nursery Inspection Unit of RRI would be transferred to RCD by
December 31, 1988 (para. 3.26);



- 40 -
(h) All additional staff required for ASD to field 255 REOs would be
recruited progressively by December 31, 1990 (para. 3.32);
(i) Motorcycles would be sold to REOs through a loan on the same
concessional terms as are available to field staff in other
ministries (para. 3.32);
(j) RRI's adaptive research program would give priority to testing all
internationally available proven clones in simple trials located in
each agroclimatic zone in the project area (para. 3.39);
(k) Participating agencies would (i) maintain separate project accounts
which would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA; (ii) submit audited accounts to IDA within 12 months of the
end of the financial year, together with certification that funds
disbursed under SOEs had been used for the purposes for which they
were provided (para. 4.17);
(1) The position of Project Coordinator would at all times be filled on
a fulltime basis by a person whose qualifications and experience are
satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.25).
(m)  The RRF cess would be extended to rubber used by domestic industries
no later than January 1, 1996 (para. 6.16);
(n) The rate of RRF cess would be gradually adjusted to keep the overall
finances of RRF in positive balance (para. 6.16); and,
(o) GOSL would consult with the Working Group on Tree Crops Producer
Margins to ensure that specific increases in the RRF cess do not
adversely affect minimum producer margins (para. 6.16).
8.2       Conditions of project effectiveness would be:
(a) Establishment by MPI of the Monitoring Committee, with membership
and terms of reference acceptable to IDA (para. 3.41);
(b)  Determination by the committee (para. 7.1(a)) of the procedure and
responsibility for certification of RRF payments, acceptable to IDA,
and their implementation by MPI (para. 5.4); and
8.3       With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA credit to Sri Lanka of SDRs 17.0 million (US$23.5
million) on standard IDA terms.

SRI IANKA
SECOND SMALLHOLDER RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Guidelines for Testing Advanced Clones of Proven High Yield
Background
1.       The recent outbreak of Corvnsprora Leaf Spot Disease and the
susceptibility to it of the recommended clone RRIC 103, not only resulted
in the loss of 4,600 ha of newly planted rubber, but also highlighted the
serious lack of advanced clones available to the rubber growers of Sri
Lanka.
2.       This is a critical situation which has to be resolved as rapidly
as possible, to avoid the risks inherent in having the rubber industry
dependent on only three clones, one of which (PB 86) predominates inspite
of its low yield potential, and another (RRIC 102) is limited, because of
the color of its latex, to non-crepe end uses. Furtbermore, there ia a
clear need to terminate the use of PB 86 as soon as possible as the
planting of obsolete material should not be supported any longer than
absolutely necessary, for the farmers involved will be at a serious
disadvantage for a further 30 years.
3.      '-nder the circumstances, exceptional measures are required to make
available a wider range of proven, advanced clones suitable for the
different agroclimatic zones in Sri Lanka.
Advanced Clone %.tsting
4.       The basic concept will be to accept as given the production
potential of advanced clones already widely utilized in other countries and
to concentrate on determining their response to the conditions in the main
agroclimatic situations in the rubber growing areas of Sri Lanka and their
tolerance of the disease environment. It therefore follows that: (i) only
proven clones would be included in this series of tests -- NOT newly
developed clones whose performance in commercial use is not fully
established (these should be routinely included in conventional trials in
Sri Lanka); and that (ii) disease resistance and girth increment would be
determinates of suitability for distribution in Sri Lanka and no attempt
would be made in these tests to determine actual yield.

ANNEX5
Page 2
5.       Test plots should be established close to RRI, the three Adaptive
Research Centers, and in a dryer location. Approximately 1 ha of land
would be required at each site.
6.       It is assumed that six clones would be tested at each site.
plot size of 25 points and 3 replicates per site would be adequate. Inter-
plot guard rows would not be needed, but boundary guard rows should be
used.
7.       Standard RRI fertilizer recommendations should be followed and the
plants should be assessed for disease resistance and girth increment.
These parameters should be used to issue recommendations not later than the
end of the fifth year of the trials.
