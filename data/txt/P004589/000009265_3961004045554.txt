MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND IRRIGATION OPERATIONS SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of
US$51.3 million to help finance a Second Irrigation Operations Support Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 20 years, including five years of grace.
2.        Backgrou.  Rice self-sufficiency has been the most important goal
in the food security program of the Philippine Government.    Irrigation
development has been the main instrument to achieve this goal.   Irrigation
systems now serve about 1.5 million ha and produce 70 percent of all the rice in
the Philippines.
3.        The Philippines has three types of irrigation systems:  165 national
systems built and operated by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA); 6,200
communal systems, owned and operated by farmer groups, and often built with
financial and technical assistance from NIA; and several privately owned and
operated pump systems. The national systems account for about 431 of the total
irrigated area. NIA manages the facilities and charges farmers an irrigation
service fee (ISF). The communal systems account for about 471 of the irrigated
area. NIA helps organize and train irrigators' associations (IAs) to manage and
operate the systems. The privately-owned pump systems account for about 101 of
the irrigated area.
4.        Though ETA is an autonomous corporate entity, it does not finance
investment projects from its own resources or loans. All investment programs are
financed by the Government. However, NIA is responsible for the operation and
maintenance (06M) of national irrigation systems. The O&M is covered by NIA's
ope'rating budget, which is financed principally from ISF collections, management
fees charged to the Government for the design and construction supervision of
irrigation projects, and rentals of construction equipment. Any change in ISF
rates is approved by the Government, and management fees depend on the level of
the investment program, which has declined in recent years due to the
Government's financial constraints.
5.        Because of inadequate maintenance resulting from a shortage of funds,
irrigation infrastructure and the quality of irrigation services provided to
farmers on the national systems has deteriorated. This, in turn, has adversely
affected NIA's fee collection performance. To address this problem in a cost
effective manner, NIA adopted the same beneficiary participation approach as on
communal systems, that is, to develop the IAs and provide them with the training
and incentives to assume an increased level of responsibility for system ON.
6.        NIA formulated a nine-year Irrigation O&M Improvement Program in 1986.
In mid-1988, the Bank helped finance the first phase of this program through the
First Irrigation Operations Support Project (IOSP I, Loan 2948-PH) with a $45.0
million loan (this was later reduced to $23.5 million when concessional financing
from USAID and OECF became available). The project has been completed and has
yielded measurable benefits: (i) the average cropping intensity rose from 134X
in 1987 to 1401 in 1991; and (ii) ISF collection improved from 481 of current



- 2 -
billings in 1987 to 60X in 1991.  The economic rate of return (ERR) of the
project is re-estimated at completion at about 21 percent.
7.        Lessons Learned and Incorporated. The project design incorporates the
following important lessons learned from the IOSP I: (a) some lower-priority
rehabilitation works could have been avoided if a strategy of cost-effective
rehabilitation and greater participation of water users had been adopted; (b)
increased ISF collection indicates that improved services induce water users to
pay ISF dues more readily; (c) system components operated by the IAs appear to
be generally in better shape than those operated by NIA without beneficiary
participation; (d) training in water management should be continued; and (e) the
system for monitoring improvements in water deliveries was deficient and needs
close attention.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been actively involved
in the development of irrigation in the Philippines to increase rice production
and alleviate rural poverty. Support for a follow-up second phase to IOSP I is
essential to consolidate the progress made so far and to ensure sustainability
of the improved irrigation O&N services. Bank support would also be invaluable
in sustaining NIA's pioneering approach to participatory irrigation development
which has drawn considerable international attention. The project would greatly
assist in implementing the Bank's country assistance strategy for the
Philippines.
9.        Country Assistance Strategy.  The Bank's country assistance strategy
for the Philippines revolves around five themes: (a) maintaining the
stabilization program; (b) deepening the structural adjustment program; (c)
deepening the sectoral reform programs; (d) alleviating poverty; and (e)
obtaining greater effectiveness in utilizing existing aid commitments.   The
Bank's investment lending emphasizes infrastructure (including irrigation),
poverty-alleviation and environmental protection and conservation projects. With
regards to agriculture, the Bank's strategy focuses broadly on sustainable rural
development, including improving support services, rural finance, irrigation
operations, and natural resource management. Expansion of irrigated area coupled
with rehabilitation and improvement of existing systems are considered keys to
growth in crop production. The project supports this strategy.
10.       Project Objectives.  The  project  aims  to  achieve  sustainable
improvement in the operational efficiency of the national irrigation systems
(NIS), thereby increasing agricultural production (mainly rice), expanding small
farmer income and rural employment opportunities, and contributing to rural
poverty alleviation.
11.       Proiect Description.  The project would finance, over five and a half
years, the second phase of the program launched under IOSP I (para. 6) and
benefit about 640,000 ha of NIS area through:
(a) Systems Improvement and ReDair (501 of project costs): improvement of
18 NIS, urgent structural repairs in another 14 NIS, construction of
three sediment exclusion and a few improved water control structures
on a pilot basis, and erosion prevention measures in critical areas;
(b)  Imroved O&.M (36% of project costs): continued support of the improved
system-level O&N services and of measures to ensure the sustainability
of these services: (i) maintenance in 1992 real terms of the annual



- 3 -
O&N expenditure of P 822/ha on NISs; (ii) increase in ISF collection
from 60X of current billings at present to a target 70% by the end of
the project; and (iii) generation of savings by NIA through increasing
participation of the irrigators' associations (IAs) in system O&M;
(c)  Inatitutional DeveloRment (131 of project costs): (i) strengthening
of existing IAs, establishment of new lAs, and enhanced financial and
management training of the IAs to facilitate progressive turnover of
system O61 to them; (ii) strengthening of NIA through improvements in
the ISF collection process; (iii) staff training in O&, appropriate
engineering design techniques, farmer training techniques, etc.; (iv)
technical assistance for studies, IA development work and staff
training; and (v) provision of high priority O&M equipment and
materials; and
(d)  Strengthened 4fricultural SupDort Services (1X of project costs):
research and extension, farmer training in integrated pest management,
and promotion of IA-based seed production.
12.       Prolect ImRlementation.  NIA will be principally responsible  for
project implementation. Its Systems Management Department will handle project
activities  through  a  full-time project  coordinator.    The  Department of
Agriculture will be responsible for the agricultural support services component.
The total project cost, including physical contingencies and expected price
increases, is estimated at about US$ 69.6 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$ 16.5 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 51.3 million would
finance about 75X of total cost excluding taxes, including 1001 of the foreign
exchange requirement and about 661 of local costs. The remaining project cost
of US$ 18.3 million would be funded by NIA (USS 13.5 million) and the Government
(US$ 4.8 million).   To ensure continuity of the improved O&,  eligible
incremental O&M expenditures of up to US$ 3.0 million, incurred after January 1,
1993, would be financed retroactively.   A summary of project costs and the
financing plan is given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 11603-PH, dated April 22, 1993, is being distributed
separately.
13.       Project Sustainability.  The  improved  irrigation  services  to be
achieved under the project would be sustainable (entirely financed by NIA) if the
ISF collection and beneficiary participation in O&  increase as envisaged.  In
1991, ISF collections financed about 671 of the total O&M expenses of NIS of
P 471 million.   In 1999, after the end of the project, ISF collections are
expected to cover at least 951 of the projected OM expenses of P 795 million in
current terms.   Savings generated by NIA through  increasing beneficiary
participation in O&M and income from equipment rental would be sufficieu.t to
cover the gap of 5X in financing of O&. An increase in ISF rates to cover the
gap is not considered feasible at this stage since about 701 of farmers in
irrigated areas are at or below the rural poverty threshold. The substantial
scope for improvement in ISF collection efficiency should first be utilized, as
is envisaged under the proJect. However, a review of and dialogue on ISF rates
and efforts to reduce NIA overhead costs would be continued during the project
period to further improve project sustainability. The long-term objective is to
finance the improved O&M services entirely from ISF collections. Taking into



- 4 -
account recent improvements in ISF collection performance and the current 60X
collection level, an annual increase of about 1.5X during the next few years was
judged to be realistic and achievable. Accordingly, the target ISP collection
level, to be achieved under the project, has been set at 70X.  NIA would,
however, make every endeavor to achieve a co'lection level close to 752, which
would provide full O&K financing by the year 1999.
14.       Asreed Actions.  Prior to loan negotiations NIA furnished to the Bank
for review the Work Program for the first twelve months of the project, with
detailed engineering, System Operation Plans in respect of systems to be improved
during the first twelve months, cost estimates, sources of funds, draft bid
documents for all equipment procurement, and draft terms of reference for all
consultancies.  These were found to be satisfactory.  During negotiations,
Government and NIA confirmed that: (a) NIA will apply agreed selection criteria
and prepare improvement and operation plans for participating NIS, in
consultation with beneficiaries, and will submit detailed annual work programs
and operation plans for Bank review; (b) NIA will budget severance/retirement
costs for workers affected by IA takeover of O&M responsibilities; (c) the Bank
will review the proposed criteria for NLA's incentive scheme for its staff; (d)
lIA will prepare a plan by end 1993 to improve ISF collection efficiencies; (e)
NIA will submit a proposal by October 1993 to modify the Irrigation Xanagement
Information System; (f) NIA will submit annual statements of actual and projected
0c&M cashflow;    (g) GOP/NIA will maintain OM expenditure at agreed levels; (h)
NIA will establish Quality Control Teams and follow up on proposed actions; (i)
NIA will ensure that approved expenditures for systems improvement are not
exceeded without prior approval; and (j) NIA will submit biannual progress
reports.
15.       Environmental Asoects.  The project is not expected to have an adverse
environmental impact. Since the project provides for improvement of existing
irrigation systems, no major new earth movement, water regulation or storage,
deforestation, or drainage will be involved. In project-related erosion-prone
areas, the project will provide for erosion control and stabilization using
vegetative erosion prevention measures, such as vetiver grass and leguminous
shrubs. Specific environmental protection measures will be incorporated as
needed in the design of individual system improvements. Fertilizer and herbicide
application would be based on guidelines issued by the Philippine Fertilizer and
Pesticide Authority, which are consistent with Bank guidelines.
16.       Project Benefits.  Project benefits include increased rice production
and reduced imports of about 100,000 tons p.a. at full development in year 2000,
with consequent foreign exchange savings of about US$30 million in current
prices.   It would alleviate rural poverty through increasing incomes and
employment opportunities for about 460,000 low-income farm families. It would
also benefit NIA through improving its institutional and financial capacity to
deliver irrigation services; local communities through increasing their
participation in O&M activities, thereby reducing their dependence on public
funds and improving the quality and reliability of irrigation services; and the
environment through the promotion of sustainable farming practices. The project
would also encourage more active participation of women in the IAs and the
project impact on women will be monitored carefully.
17.       Lisks.  The proposed project does not face any major risk as it
involves improving existing irrigation systems and sustaining their maintenance,
and incorporates lessons learned from the first phase project.   The main



- 5 -
potential risk would be the delays in 1'uplementation due to inadequate and
delayed fund releases by the Government and inefficient procurement. To minimize
these risks, agreements were reaahed at negotiations on funding, programs of work
and procurement documents.
18.       Roomendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
