                       Implementation Program
      The Borrower shall cause NIA to:
1.    With respect to Irrigation Systems to be improved under the
Project:
      (a)   select Irrigation Systems on the basis of criteria satisfac-
tory to the Bank, covering technical aspects, such as adequacy of water
and completeness of hydrologic data; institutional aspects, such as
presence of an effective Irrigator's Association with commitment to
carry out repairs and improvements and assume responsibility for opera-
tion and maintenance of improved sections of the relevant Irrigation
System; and economic aspects, such as for each Irrigation System an
economic rate of return of not less than ten percent;
      (b)   prepare, in respect of each selected Irrigation System, a
detailed operation plan and improvement plan in consultation and
agreement with the beneficiaries of such selected Irrigation System;
      (c)   submit, by June 30 in each year, to the Bank for review and
comment a detailed work program (based on the improvement plans referred
to in sub-paragraph (b) above) together with the operation plans for
each selected Irrigation System to be improved during the following
twelve months; and
      (d)   implement, taking into account the Bank's comments and
recommendations thereon, each work program referred to in sub-paragraph
(c) above, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
2.    In each year make adequate provision, in NIA's operating budget,
for retirement and/or severance benefits (as appropriate) for ditch-
tenders whose employment would cease during the following twelve months
and ensure that such benefits are made available to eligible ditch-
tenders in accordance with the Borrower's laws, rules and regulations
as the same may be amended from time to time.
3.    Furnish to the Bank, for review and comment, the proposed criteria
for its incentive scheme, taking into account the objective of improved
operation and maintenance of Irrigation Systems, and shall take into
account the Bank's comments thereon.
4.    By December 31, 1993 furnish to the Bank a report on all Irriga-
tion Systems where actual ISF collection was below 60% of the amounts
billed in 1992 providing details of the problems faced in collection
and actions recommended to resolve such problems.
5.    By October 31, 1993, submit to the Bank for its review and
comment, a review of the existing monitoring system in respect of
Irrigation Systems and a proposal for a modified IMIS, together with
a comparison of the two, and shall take into account the Bank's comments
and recommendations thereon.
6.    By June 30 in each year, furnish to the Bank for review and
concurrence a projection of the operation and maintenance cash flow for
all Irrigation Systems, for a minimum of the next five years and showing
actual operation and maintenance cash flow for the preceding five years.
7.    Maintain the annual level of operating and maintenance services
provided to Irrigation Systems in each fiscal year at no less than the
1992 level of the same.
8.    Establish quality control units at its headquarters and in each
regional office to ensure the quality of NIA's construction and opera-
tion and maintenance work.
9.    Implement control measures (including close verification of
individual works under implementation  and disbursement of funds for
completed works) to ensure that regional offices do not exceed expendi-
ture budgets in implementing improvement of Irrigation Systems, without
prior approval.
Page  12
10.   Without limitation or restriction upon the provisions of Section
9.07 of the General Conditions, by no later than September 30 and March
31 in  each year, furnish to the Bank a semi-annual report on the pro-
gress of the Project, including findings of the quality control units
referred to in paragraph (8) above, data on ISF collection and an
assessment of the extent to which the Project has increased female
participation in Irrigator's Associations, and in new income-generating
activities.
