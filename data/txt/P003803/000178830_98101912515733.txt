1. THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
Energy Resources and Status of Development
1.01      Data on energy resources in Indonesia are incomplete and the
coverage is uneven, varying from fairly good documentation on oil reserves
to very little on geothermal resources or nuclear fuels; data on existing
and potential energy consumption patterns is similarly incomplete. Energy
policy formulation is thus rendered difficult and is presently limited to
broad generalities. In the past the Bank has agreed to finance a number of
studies designed specifically to rectify statistical deficiencies (e.g.,
hydropower surveys - Power VI Loan 1365). Recently, however, the Minister of
Mines and Energy has asked the Bank to undertake a more comprehensive survey
of the energy sector with a view to systematizing the data currently avail-
able, identifying the major deficiencies and assisting the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) to determine the best method of proceeding with sector
documentation and policy formulation. A Bank mission to initiate this work
visited Indonesia in November 1980. Available information on the energy
sector and the main issues are summarized in the following paragraphs.
1.02      Indonesia is endowed with abundant energy resources and has large
as yet underdeveloped natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and geothermal
sources.  Petroleum reserves have been exploited for some time.  The
availability of indigenous oil caused Indonesia to develop a petroleum-based
energy sector rather than exploiting other available energy resources.
Prior to independence, the country relied on coal and hydroelectric energy
to a large extent for its commercial energy but now petroleum accounts for
90% of total commercial energy consumption. Steps are being taken by the
Government to increase the shares of coal, hydroelectric power and geo-
thermal energy as rapidly as possible.
Petroleum
1.03      Petroleum reserves are estimated at about 50 billion barrels, but
proven resources are between 10-15 billion barrels. The figure has not in-
creased significantly since 1970. Present production is about 1.6 million
barrels per day, and it is expected to increase to 1.8 million barrels per
day by 1984. The government assessment is that with virtually static
reserves and constant production, and the rapid increases in domestic demand
(about 14% per year), surpluses available for export would steadily decline,
seriously undermining the economy. GOI has therefore adopted a policy of
developing other indigenous energy sources such as coal, hydroelectricity,
natural gas and geothermal for internal consumption. As a result of these
policies and due to expected increases in oil prices the annual growth of
domestic consumption of oil is expected to decrease to about 8.5% in 1983.
Liquified natural gas (LNG) and condensate exports are expected to increase



- 2 -
rapidly and will compensate partially for the slowdown in oil exports. In
the above context, it is imperative that detailed plans be drawn up urgently
for well-coordinated development of the energy sector and its various
subsector_.
Natural Gas
1.04      The estimated natural gas reserve is about 34 trillion cu ft, of
which 5 trillion cu ft represents gas associated with oil production. The
present production level is about 80 billion cu ft per year. Pipelines have
recently been laid to steel and fertilizer factories and consumption is
expected to increase at the rate of 15% per year during the next five years.
Following agreement reached with Japan a few years ago, export of natural
gas in the liquid form (LNG) has commenced and is expected to grow rapidly.
A study of natural gas pricing and utilization has been agreed under Credit
451-IND to determine the potential usage of gas in Indonesia and the
resources available. GOI policy is to use surpluses, where available, for
electricity production. In Java, where some thermal stations have been
designed for dual firing (oil and gas), no surpluses are now available.
Natural gas is being used however in Java and Sumatra.
Coal
1.05      Indonesia-s coal reserves are conservatively estimated at 1.2
billion tons, 86% of which are in Sumatra and the balance in Kalimantan.
Some estimates place the total reserves at 15.0 billion tons. Actual
production was as high as 2.0 million tons per year in 1940, but declined
to 140,000 tons in 1973. Rehabilitation measures increased production to
250,000 tons in 1979. Of this, 150,000 tons came from the Bukit Asam
collieries and 100,000 tons from the Ombilin mines, both in Sumatra.
1.06      Government has decided to encourage the development of coal for
national consumption wherever technically and economically feasible. The
power sector is the largest market for Indonesia-s coal. Exploration
carried out between 1976 and 1979 having confirmed that proven reserves
of about 125 million tons were available at Bukit Asam, and aided by a
US$10.0 million engineering loan from the Bank, GOI proceeded to evolve
an integrated mining and transportation system to deliver about 3.0 million
tons per year for use at an 800 MW dual-fired (oil and coal) thermal power
station at Suralaya in West Java. This power station is now under
construction with financial assistance from the Bank (Loans 1708 and 1872).
The first generating unit of 400 MW is expected to be commissioned in
January 1984. The Bank is now considering a loan for this integrated coal
mining and transportation project. An appraisal mission visited Indonesia
in September 1980. Other similar projects are expected to follow. GOI has
also encouraged private concessionaires to survey reserves with a view to
increasing the export of coal. A large concession in South Sumatra was
given up by Shell, but other concessions in Kalimantan are under active
consideration.

Hydroelectric Resources
1.07      The hydroelectric potential of the country has been roughly
estimated at 31,000 MW distributed as follows: Irian Jaya 9,000 MW,
Kalimantan 7,000 MW, Sumatra 6,750 MW, Sulawesi 5,600 MW and Java 2,500 MW.
The greatest potential lies in Irian Jaya where electricity demand is the
smallest while Java, where the demand is the greatest, has the least.
1.08      The figures in para. 1.07 are estimates of the theoretical
potential. There are no reliable estimates of the proportion that can be
actually developed. Reconnaissance and preliminary studies (mostly the
former) of the sites where an aggregate installed capacity of about 15,000
MW is believed technically feasible have been carried out but little is
known about the costs of their development.
1.09      The total installed hydroelectric generating capacity in the
country now is 662 MW, of which 460 MW is in Java, 174 MW in Sulawesi and
the balance in Kalimantan (20 MW) and Sumatra (8 MW). A major hydroelectric
project is under construction at Asahan (600 MW) in Sumatra, as part of a
large aluminum complex being built by a Japanese consortium of investors. Its
surplus capacity of about 50 MW will be made available to the national
electricity entity, Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN) for distribution.
Besides the 700 MW Saguling project to be financed with assistance from the
proposed loan, three hydroelectric sites, Cirata (500 MW) in West Java and
Mrica (180 MW) and Maung (120 MW) in Central Java are under detailed field
investigations. These projects are included in PLN's development program,
along with a few small hydroelectric stations associated with irrigation
projects.
1.10      The limited reserves of petroleum and the relatively high cost of
energy from new coal-fired thermal stations place a high premium on develop-
ment of hydro resources. Unfavorable location of potential sites away from
the main demand centers, and relatively long gestation periods, have limited
development in the past. The pace of investigation of hydroelectric
projects has been slow, however, and needs to be accelerated. During 1979
PLN agreed to build up its investigative capabilities to expedite hydropower
surveys. Funds for the necessary technical assistance were arranged out of
the savings available under Loan 1365. PLN has decided to draw upon a firm
of consultants experienced in the field to provide the services of three
experts who would work with a PLN counterpart team and prepare within a
couple of years (a) a detailed inventory of all sites, (b) a priority list
of these sites based on location, demand growth in likely areas of supply,
status of supply and available alternatives, and (c) a detailed investiga-
tion program. Most of this work would be outside Java where the main sites
have been either developed or investigated.

Geothermal Resources
1.11      Judging from evidence of surface activity, stretching from Sumatra
to Irian Jaya, and limited exploration, Indonesia is believed to have
substantial geothermal resources. They are not all close to major load
centers and are widespread. Over 17 significant (greater than 100 MW, heat
value) fields have been identified indicating development potentials in
Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores and Sulawesi. The full potential of these
fields is not certain. Some identified fields in Java (e.g., Kamojang) are
reasonably close to load centers. A 30 MW plant is under construction at
Kamojang at a total construction cost of about US$1,200 per KW installed.
The Government of New Zealand is providing financial assistance. GOI
attaches high priority to development of geothermal energy as a part of its
policy of diversification of energy sources (para. 1.02) and conserving
petroleum. It has recently invited proposals from interested parties in
several countries for financing exploration and exploitation of seven
identified geothermal fields in Java, on a commercial basis. The results
are awaited.
Nuclear Power
1.12      Since 1976 several studies have been carried out on the need for
nuclear power in Java. The general consensus of these studies, with which
the Bank agrees, is that a nuclear power station would not be economically
justified until the early nineties. PLN's investment program until 1990
therefore does not provide for one. However, a recent study carried out by
NIRA-ENEL of Italy has concluded that introduction of the first nuclear
power station with a 636 MWe CANDU type generating set by FY89/90 would be
feasible. The Bank-s initial reaction is that the underlying assumptions of
the study as to capital and fuel costs strongly'favored the nuclear
alternative against equivalent coal-fired thermal stations with which it was
compared. The question is being carefully examined by PLN and other
Government agencies concerned.
Non-Commercial Sources
1.13      Accurate information on firewood and agricultural waste consump-
tion in Indonesia is not available although some scattered statistical data
has been collected in this admittedly important area. A recent national
survey conducted by the Forestry Products Research Institute for instance
has estimated that the per capita consumption of firewood in rural areas has
increased about threefold from 0.6 cu m p.a. in 1971. Charcoal consumption
estimates show a sharp decline since 1968. About 17.0 million tons of
agricultural wastes (in the form of rice husks, baggasse and sawmill wastes)
are produced annually but most of these are not used as energy sources.
Recognizing the need to develop these energy sources GOI set up the
Development Technology Center in 1973 but with its limited staff the results
achieved so far have been meager. Shortly a USAID-financed study involving
field work and data collection is expected to clarify both resources and
existing patterns of use.

Growth of Energy Consumption
1.14      Consumption of commercial forms of energy in Indonesia grew in the
recent past at about 13.6% p.a., doubling in about five years. For Repelita
III (FY80-84), growth is projected at 11% p.a., with the share of petroleum
products falling from 90% in 1977 to 79% in 1984. Currently) electricity
provides only 7% of the country's energy, but is projected to increase to
11.3% by 1984. The table below shows a breakdown of consumption by energy
sources:

Organization of the Energy Sector
1.15      In May 1978, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) was
established as part of a general reorganization of government departments to
coordinate all activities in the energy sector. MME has overall respon-
sibility for mining, oil, natural gas and electricty. It controls the state
enterprises responsible for the execution of the government policies in the
energy subsectors - viz. the national oil and gas entity (PERTAMINA), the
coal agency (BATUBARA) and PLN. The Ministry has been recruiting staff over
the past two years and developing its organization to fulfill its role in
the energy sector. MME-s organization chart is shown in Annex 1.
1.16      GOI has established an interdepartmental energy policy and
planning committee at the technical level. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of
the Committee are the MME-s Directors-General of Oil and Gas and of Electric
Power (DGEP), respectively. A permanent energy committee has also been
formed by the Minister and entrusted with the tasks of assessing energy
technologies, dealing with day-to-day energy problems and preparing
long-term projections for demand and supply. A ministerial level National
Energy Board has recently been formed to review proposals emerging from the



-6-
technical committee and eventually to establish a more clearly defined
energy policy with specific implementation instructions to the ministries
concerned.  The first meeting of this Board will be held towards the end of
1980.
Problems in the Energy Sector, Policy and Pricing
1.17      Because of the deficiencies of available statistics on both
resources and consumption (para. 1.01) a comprehensive energy balance, indi-
cating the various sources of energy, patterns of transformation, transpor-
tation and consumption has not yet been prepared for Indonesia. The country
consequently lacks a quantitatively based overall energy policy. This policy
weakness is compounded by a system of energy pricing that does not equate
rational consumer choices with the national interest. In particular,
petroleum prices - subsidized by Government for political and social reasons
- have caused serious distortions in the economy by failing to reflect their
value to the economy as an export good.  The effect has been to favor the
use of oil over other competing fuels, promotion of domestic consumption
over exports, and because the degree of subsidy between oil products is
uneven, to distort the demand between individual petroleum products.
1.18      The elimination of these subsidies has been under serious
discussion between GOI and the Bank for some time. In the context of
negotiations of Loan 1872 (Power IX), the Government confirmed that, as a
matter of policy, it would ultimately abolish subsidies on domestic oil
consumption, subject to the ability of consumers to pay, and a further step
in this direction was taken in May 1980 when oil prices were increased 50%.
In order to consider the full implications of removal of subsidies and the
best manner of achieving this objective, GOI and the Bank agreed that an
energy pricing study would be carried out using about US$3.0 million out of
the surplus available under Loan 1513 (Power VII Project). The Bank has
recently provided GOI with an outline scope for this pricing study and
suggestions regarding terms of reference and is awaiting MME response. This
study would also provide guidelines for pricing of competing energy sources.
1.19      The Bank has also agreed to provide funds through Loan 1513 to
build up a management information system for DGEP activities in the
electricity sector and ensure that development programs in the electricity
sector are entirely consistent with national policy objectives. Proposals
have been invited recently from an agreed short list of consultants to carry
out the study in accordance with terms of reference finalized in consultation
with the Bank.
The Electricity Sector
1.20      The Electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEP.  It
comprises (i) PLN, (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for
their own use, (iii) some small municipal franchises, and (iv) a small



number of cooperatives which were set up to provide electricity in certain
rural areas remote irom PLN supply systems.
1.21      Legislation was enacted in 1979 to provide for private and co-
operative franchise participation in the electricity sector with the
intention of providing electricity generation/supply in areas where PLN was
unable to develop its own supply systems fast enough. However, no new
parties have so far been licensed.
1.22      DGEP.  Since its inception in 1978 DGEP has been responsible for
electricity sector policy in the country. Until its establishment, PLN had
been responsible for giving advice to the Minister on sector policy and for
planning and licensing. Legislation enacted in 1979 transferred these
responsibilities, particularly in policy planning, licensing of franchises,
and general supervision of the sector from PLN to DGEP. Its organizational
structure is shown in Annex 1.
1.23      PLN.  PLN was first formed in 1961 when three Dutch-owned
electricity utility companies were nationalized, but its growth as an ef-
fective modern organization started around 1972, when its status was changed
from that of a department of a ministry to an autonomous entity and foreign
financing became available for its urgently needed rehabilitation and ex-
pansion programs. PLN's subsequent growth has been impressive. It now
has over 2.2 million consumers and provides 70% of the total electricity
supply in the country. Further details are given in Chapter 3.
1.24      Captive Plants.  Until the mid-seventies public sector development
was severely constrained due mainly to lack of foreign financing and PLN
could not meet the demand with any reliability. Captive plants therefore
grew rapidly (see Table 1.2 below). Currently, the total capacity of such
plants is about 2000 MW compared to 2,662 MW of PLN; most of the plants are
small diesel installations, with a few larger gas turbines. During 1973-76,
the average annual growth rate of captive plant was 15% (with a peak of 22%
in 1975). Since then the growth has fallen off rapidly to an average of
about 4% during 1976-79 (Annex 2). It has been negligible during 1979/80.
This is a direct consequence of the rapid augmentatiohi of PLN-s system
supply and significant improvements in reliability standards and other
positive marketing measures. It is PLN's policy, when connecting owners of
captive plant to allow such plant to remain in use as reserve until the end
of its economic life. Some captive plants will continue to be installed as
PLN's investment program is not large enough to meet the entire demand at
all locations in the country, but the rate of growth is more likely to be
below 5%.

Rural Electrification (RE)
1.25      Rural electrification is being undertaken by PLN with consultancy
assistance, among others, from the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association (NRECA) of the US and financed by USAID, which provided a loarn
for seven proiect areas (-US$20 million). Financial assistance in the form
of a loan has also been committed by Holland (Fl 15.5 million/ US$7.7
million) and as a grant by Finland (FM 0.48 million, US$0.12 million).
1.26      Rural electrificatior. as defined in Indonesia covers all towns and
villages in the country except provincial capitals and second level provin-
cial towns.  During Repelita III PLN plans :o electrify about 3,700 of the
64,000 villages in Indonesia; currently 1,081 villages are included in
committed projects whlch will benefit about 29,000 consumers.
Indonesia does not yet have a plani or time scale in which all villages in
the country will be provided access to electric.ity, but those villages and
areas in which electricity would have the greatest economic impact are given
priority. Some time must elapse before the modest national RE plan is
accelerated; currently only 6% of the total population has electricity and a
sector base to support RE is required 'before a national program can be
effective.
IL  THE  POWER. MARKET AND TrE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Status of Surveys
2.01      Several attempts have been made during the seventies to prepare a
meaningful demand forecast for the Indonesian power sector.  They were dif-
ficult because of the very Low prevailing consumption levels and severe
restrictions on supply which made past records (limited to ?LN's sales which



then accounted for only a fraction of the total consumption) an unsatis-
factory basis for future projections. One of the first of these attempts
was by Chas T. Main of the USA in 1973. It applied an indirect method of
using growth probabilities in selected sensitive economic sectors and their
probable impact on other sectors to arrive at the demand for electricity. A
more direct detailed assessment of the underlying demand and future trends
(up to 1985) was made during 1974-76 by Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of
the UK as part of a Bank-financed System Development Study (Credit 399).
This study quantified the effects of restrictions on supply and low
voltages, self-generation and PLN's waiting lists. It was limited to Java,
which is believed to account for two-thirds of the market (see para. 2.03).
2.02      In recent years PLN has carried out market surveys in some of the
other islands using consultants. PLN has also begun to develop methods to
scan the power market using its own limited organization at headquarters and
in PLN's operational regions (Wilayahs). The stage has now been reached
(see para. 2.07) where PLN has to build up a power market survey unit
capable of updating the PCR study in Java and similar consultant studies now
in progress and to compile similar data for all islands. PLN's intention is
to expand the presently small unit in the Planning Directorate. To improve
the quality of its power surveys PLN requires the active association of the
DGEP of MME which should provide (i) guidelines on national energy policies,
(ii) firm data on primary energy availability and (iii) usage and pricing
policies, as these influence the demand for electricity. PLN will, in
future, take full responsibility for the work and will employ experts, drawn
either from operating entities or other organizations involved in this work,
on a short-term basis at periodic intervals. Funds have been provided in
the proposed loan to meet the requirements of such experts. Henceforth the
use of consulting firms should be selective and confined to tasks for which
PLN is unable to mobilize adequate manpower if the time required. An
assurance that PLN, with the assistance of GOI, will take steps to improve
the capability of its power market survey units - at Central (Pusat) and
Wilayah (Regional) levels to carry out surveys to update the PCR study in
Java and similar consultant studies in other islands and compile data for
all islands, was obtained from PLN and GOI during negotiations.
Demand Projections
2.03      The initial results of the PCR study in Java (2.01) implied that
the magnitude of the underlying demand was so large that annual growth rates
of public electricity supply would have to be of the order of 30-35% during
FY76-85 against historic rates of 10-12%. It was recognized, however, that
PLN's sales in Java could not quickly rise to such levels and that, in the
short and medium term, they would depend on the rate at which PLN could
build up its facilities and meet an increasing proportion of the existing
demand, whereas, in the longer term, PLN sales would reflect more closely
the growth of the power market based on the overall levels of economic
development. Retaining the initial results as "high" forecasts, and in



- 10 -
order to provide a basis for preparing a practicable development program for
PLN, PCR then determined lower, but more realistic projections, referred to
as its "low forecasts." The forecasts are summarized in Annex 2.
2.04      Optimized programs of generation and transmission were prepared by
PCR for both "high" and "low" forecasts. During FY77-79 PLN and the Bank
agreed that PLN would (i) adhere to the low forecast for its development
program in Java and (ii) ensure a proper balance between its investments on
generation, transmission and distribution. It was also agreed that PLN-s
development should be annually updated to accord with actual experiences and
be jointly reviewed by PLN and the Bank for necessary modifications. The
reviews have indicated that PLN's studies of the power market are rather
limited and need to be improved (para. 2.02). The reviews also resulted in
somewhat lower forecasts of sales than the PCR "low" forecast in the near
future with prospects of catching up with it by 1990. According to the
latest (1979) such revision (Annex 2) the average growth rate between
FY79-85 was expected to be 21% per year; thereafter the growth is expected
to decline to about 15% per year. The development program based on these
rates of growth has been accepted by GOI and incorporated in Repelita III.
During FY79 and FY80 PLN's sales in Java increased by 22% and 24%
respectively which is slightly better than expectations.
Access to Service
2.05      The per capita consumption of electricity in Indonesia is still
extremely low at about 70 kWh (FY80) compared to 570 kWh in Malaysia, 250
kWh in the Philippines and 250 kWh in Thailand. Indonesia-s population has
low access to electricity; only about 6% of the households are connected.
The degree of electrification in different regions varies, being about 9.6%
in Java, 4.3% in Sumatra, 5.0% in Kalimantan, 4.2% in Sulawesi, 4.6% in West
Irian and 2% to 3% in the other islands.
Connection Programs
2.06      During FY78 PLN agreed with the Bank that it would prepare and
actively implement a consumer connection program consistent with its
improved capabilities. The results are summarized in Table 2.1 below.
Figures in parentheses indicate the growth over the previous year.

2.07      PLN exceeded the consumer connection program targets during FY78-80.
During FY81, the target set for Java was 23% but midway during the year
consideration is being given to reducing it to about 21.5%, because of delays
in commissioning the 4th generating set (200 MW) at Muara-Karang and in the
commissioning of some 150 kV transmission lines and substations. Alternatives
discussed during appraisal may make this reduction unnecessary. In some of
the Wilayahs, notably in East Java (XII) and North Sumatra (II) the results
of PLN's efforts at expediting consumer connections have been really
impressive and must be regarded as a clear indication of growth potential in
the near future. In East Java the growth rates in FY79 and FY80 were 30%
and 36% recently and the target of 33% set for FY81 could easily be attained
or even exceeded, judging by the progress so far on payments of connection
charges and waiting lists. These growth rates are ahead of the growth of
PLN-s supply capacity and it is a matter of some concern that (i)
construction of the 150 kV Central-East Java link and (ii) financing of
Gresik Unit 3 (included in the development program and planned for
commissioning in FY83 with assistance from the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) have not kept pace. The latest demand forecast in the East Java
region is some 20-25% higher than the PCR "low" forecast, and could justify
advancing the construction of the 500 kV Central-East Java link, planned for
completion in FY88, two years earlier. The situation in North Sumatra is
similar. There is an urgent need for PLN to carry out a detailed power
market survey both in Java and other islands in order to properly plan the
scale and pace of its immediate expansion program. To sustain the momentum
built up during the past 3 years, special efforts should be made by PLN and
GOI to ensure that the targets of expansion of power supply facilities in



- 12 -
Repelita III are achieved by improved monitoring of construction, and
providing financial resources, where necessary. Serious consideration has
also to be given from now on to initiating work on schemes whose benefits
are to be derived in the early years of Repelita IV. PLN hao& also to
improve its system planning capabilities, to identify emerging system
bottlenecks in advance and to ensure that its power systems continue to be
adequate as the demand escalates. PLN intends to improve the capability of
its central system planning unit at headquarters to do this, using experts
on a short-term basis (para. 2.02) with funds to be provided under this
loan, and an assurance on this was obtained during negotiations.
Development Program
2.08      Within the limitations of its power market surveys
(paras. 2.02/2.04) PLN follows the practice of preparing annually a 10-year
development plan to cover the projected requirements of generation,
transmission, distribution and other facilities. The latest plan finalized
in August 1980 for Java, covers the development period FY80 to FY90.
Investment requirements based on this plan were revised in September 1980.
A time slice of the program for the period FY80-84 has been incorporated in
Repelita III. In the past, least cost investment programs for generation,
transmission and distribution were planned with the help of the consultants.
PLN has recently developed in-house capability for carrying out least cost
generation planning studies with computer modelling which is utilized to
review and update the Java generation plan. It represents a significant
improvement, but requires further refinement.
2.09      Java accounts for 62% of the population of the country (90 million
out of 145 million) and 80% of electricity sales!,of PLN in FY80 (4,242 GWh
out of 5,343 GWh). Of PLN's total installed generating capacity of 2,662 MW
in the country, 1,760 MW (66%) was in Java. In FY89, the proposed installed
capacity in Java would be 6,410 MW (71.3%) against the total of 8,986 MW and
the sales of electricity would be 21,530 GWh, about 80% out of the total
projected sales of 27,010 GWh; Java continues to be the centerpiece of the
power development plan of Indonesia.
2.10      Detailed studies have been carried out to devise the optimal deve-
lopment strategy for the power system in Java and the least cost path has
been identified. The plan has been formulated to achieve the following
objectives: (a) optimize resource utilization by substituting oil by using
coal, by greater exploitation of hydro and geothermal resources for power
generation and by reducing the use of fuel inefficient installations;
(b) realize economies of scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve
operational economy by coordinating the utilization of plants through
interconnected operations; and (d) provide acceptable standards of
reliability of supply.



- 13 -
2.11      During the past two years PLN's system planning unit has made
efforts to refine its development program (included in Repelita III) for the
other islands, which had not been based on (a) reliable demand forecasts and
(b) an accent towards full use of indigenous energy resources. More work
requires to be done in this area, as recent trends indicate that the demand
growth may have been under-estimated. PLN expects to be able to bring its
studies for other areas up to acceptable standards within a couple of years.

3. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The beneficiary would be PLN, the Government-owned national power
utility.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
3.02      By Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972, PLN was constituted a
public corporation (Perum), with responsibility for the generation, trans-
mission and distribution of electricity and the planning, construction and
operation of electricity supply facilities. Until 1979 these



- 15 -
responsibilities were exclusive to PLN, but in that year, with the objective
of facilitating the exploitation of electric power to the greatest degree
possible, GOI enacted legislation allowing the intervention of private
entities and cooperatives in the sector under license of MME. PLN is
required to participate in the national economic planning process and in the
formulation of national power policies. Financially, PLN is expected to
cover all operating and maintenance costs (including depreciation and
financing costs) from current revenues, and to generate a contribution to the
financing of its expansion program; the amount of this contribution has been
the subject of a continuing dialogue with the Bank (para. 5.07). PLN's
investment plans and tariffs are subject to approval by GOI, as are bid
evaluation and contract awards.
Organization and Management
3.03      PLN is managed by a board of directors headed by a president
director, who is appointed by the President and is accountable to the
Minister of Mines and Energy. The president director has authority for all
day-to-day operations of PLN. The board currently comprises five other
directors with functional responsibility for planning, construction,
operations, finance and administration. These directors operate more in a
staff than a line role, since line responsibility strictly devolves from the
board as a whole (following the principle of collective responsibility) to
16 regional operating managers on the one hand and 12 construction project
managers on the other.  Regions are responsible for minor construction work,
whereas all major construction work is handled by construction managers.
PLN's organization chart is at Annex 4.
3.04      The exact division of responsibility between the regions/construc-
tion divisions and the central departments is sometimes unclear. For
example, construction managers are not fully responsible for ensuring the
progress of their projects on schedule since, inter alia, all contracting
work is handled by the Directorate of Construction. The Directorate does
not have practical systems to effectively control such a large and far-flung
development program as PLN-s is. In order to overcome the problem and to
speed up project construction, Power VIII (Loan 1708) provided US$2.5
million to cover foreign costs of a thorough review by a management
consultant of PLN-s construction organization and procedures. The work has
unfortunately not yet been initiated, owing to delay in contract
negotiations; but the appointment of a suitable consultant is expected within
the next three-six months.
3.05      The next major management development in PLN is therefore likely
to involve increased decentralization of responsibility, so as to strengthen
regional and construction management and avoid the risk of headquarters
becoming a bottleneck as the corporation grows. Steps towards greater
regional involvement in facilities planning were taken during the 1981



- 16 -
planning cycle, and a series of management development courses has been
initiated specifically for regional and branch managers. Extension of the
decentralization policy to regional operation and construction units must
naturally be undertaken slowly and carefully; to some extent It will be
dependent on the introduction of improved and restructured information
systems (paras. 3.06 and 3.11).
3.06      PLN's management systems have in general been well designed and
although there are some undoubted weaknesses (para. 3.04) progress in their
implementation in recent years has been impressive. Recently they were
reviewed in the context of a management audit commissioned by PLN and
carried out by a local firm working in association with international
management consultants. Their report contained a large number of
recommendations for improvement covering in particular the establishment of
a more comprehensive corporate planning process; improvements in coordination
between the various headquarters departments, and between headquarters and
the regions; adoption of common design standards and methodology for project
feasibility studies; and detailed technical proposals for improvement in
procurement, accounting, computing, inventory control and personnel
management. The president director has set up a working party to progress
consideration of the recommendations, and a number have already been
implemented. There is currently a pressing need for better information to
support planning and decision making, both within PLN and between PLN, MME
and other ministries and agencies concerned with power development. This
problem will be addressed in the upcoming power sector management
information system study, which is to be financed out of savings on the
Power VII Project (Loan 1513).
Present Facilities
3.07      Until the early seventies, PLN's expansion was severely restricted
because of the lack of foreign exchange in the country. A crash program
resulted in gas turbines being preferred; currently they comprise about 34%
of the total capacity. The imbalance in plant is being corrected with the
commissioning of 1,000 MW of new steam capacity by 1982 and PLN's planning
is now based on the least cost program of system development for Java.
Similar programs are being developed for the grids located in the other
islands. PLN's istalled capacity on March 31, 1980 is shown below:
Type of plant        MW         %
Hydro               504       18.9
Steam               756       28.4
Gas turbines        896       33.7
Diesel              506       19.0
Total       2,662       100.0



- 17 -
3.08      PLN operates over 4,000 km of transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV
and about 45,000 km of distribution lines, the bulk of which are in Java.
About 2,000 km of 150 kV transmission under construction are scheduled for
completion by 1982. Java will have a fully interconnected grid at 150 kV by
1982. By 1984, a 500 kV system linking West and Central Java will be
commissioned, and extended thereafter to cover all Java.
Manpower and Training
3.09      PLN now has a total of about 29,000 staff of which about 19,000
are on the permanent payroll; of these 1,200 (4%) are university and college
graduates and 6,300 (22%) are high school graduates. A steady improvement in
the proportion of graduate and high school staff has occurred in recent
years. Difficulty is encountered in obtaining technical manpower in
sufficient numbers; PLN sponsors 30-40 scholarships annually at technical
universities and 70-80 university graduates and 40-50 college graduates are
recruited each year, to overcome the problem.
3.10       Six training schools are run by PLN throughout the country to
provide vocational courses for the staff; about 1,100 attend the various
courses each year.  Staff members are sent abroad for advanced and other
training not available in Indonesia. Project oriented training,
particularly in foreign financed projects, is also provided. Numbers
trained and the courses given are not yet geared to provide adequate staff
of all the categories required by comprehensive manpower planning but PLN
will move closer to this goal in conjunction with the program of
strengthening regional staffs during the next two years.
3.11      PLN does not have adequate training facilities for the operation
and maintenance staff for steam power stations. About 40 people have been
trained in the USA with the assistance of Black and Veatch International
(BVI), the Project Consultants for the Muara Karang and Semarang steam
stations. A similar training program is also being arranged for the
operation and maintenance staff for the Suralaya project. To provide more
advanced training needed, Power IX Project (Loan 1872) contains a provision
for the establishment of a thermal station training school including a
simulator replacing the existing facility at Tanjung Priok.
Research
3.12      PLN has established a power research institute which includes a
high voltage testing laboratory. The institute, which conducts applied
research in power associated areas, has a staff of 278, including 87
graduates.



- 18 -
Accounting and Audit
3.13      PLN prepares its financial statements according to generally
accepted accounting principles and normal utility practice. Assets in use
are revalued from time to time according to indices published by the
Ministry of Finance, and annual depreciation charges are revised accordingly.
PLN has agreed with the Bank that in years when an official revaluation is
not carried out it will make a memorandum revaluation for Project Agreement
purposes. PLN-s accounting system was installed by consultants in the early
1970s and, while it has generally served the company's needs well, there are
now some signs that it may be due for overhaul. Furthermore, the trend
towards increased decentralization of management functions (para. 3.05) will
call for some restructuring of the system so that adequate financial informa-
tion is available to local managers in a timely manner. These system
developments are likely to involve increasing use of computers, possibly
including terminal links between regions and headquarters. PLN has an
inter-departmental working group examining this and related data processing
developments, and the Bank should stand ready to assist with appropriate
components of future projects when the needs have been defined.
3.14      Audit of PLN's accounts by the Directorate General of State
Financial Control is prescribed by PLN's charter. The Directorate General
follows the standards of the International Accounting Standards Committee
(IASC) and the International Auditing Guidelines of the International
Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and their audit reports are acceptable to
the Bank. In 1981 they plan to introduce a management audit component into
their audit program which will examine the efficiency of PLN-s operations
and systems as well as the accuracy of its accounting. PLN also has an
effective internal audit group which carries out various special investiga-
tions in addition to keeping general accounting matters under review.
Insurance
3.15      PLN carries motor vehicle insurance, and transit and marine
insurance on equipment and materials in transit. Fire and other hazards are
self-insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any
single loss would be relatively small by comparison with total assets and
operations, and this policy is therefore considered satisfactory. PLN is
separately examining the particular risks associated with the proposed
project (para. 6.07)
Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
3.16      The Bank has provided US$889 million for power generation/distri-
bution facilities in and around Jakarta and in West and Central Java. Three
distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan 1259) for the rehabi-
litated and expanded the distribution facilities in the greater Jakarta
area. They also enabled some major institutional, organizational and
financial reforms to be carried out in the electricity subsector, including



- 19 -
providing PLN with a new charter giving it substantial autonomy. Six power
generation projects ICredit 399, and Loans 1127, 1365, 1513, 1708 and 1872)
in West and Central Java were undertaken to help PLN expand electricity
supply in Java. Past loans and credits have also provided funds for various
consulting services such as the large management consulting effort of
SOFRELEC, the Java System Development Study undertaken by PCR, and
feasibility studies for thermal, hydroelectric, transmission and
distribution projects.
3.17      A completion report on the first two projects (Credits 165 and 334)
was issued in November 1979. It describes how, after an initial period
difficulty and delay (the two projects were completed some three and a half
years behind schedule) many of the institutional and operational development
improvements were effected, greater reliability of supply was achieved, and
PLN-s sales began to increase rapidly. Lessons learnt from these operations
were applied to subsequent operations. A specific program for financial
recovery, designed to improve PLN's management capabilities and to overcome
its financial weaknesses over time was incorporated in Credit 399, for
example, and it was accomplished ahead of target during FY76.
3.18      PLN's performance in implementing the 9 Bank-assisted power
projects has been uneven but is now improving. The earliest generation
project (Credit 399) covering the first and second 100 MW units at Muara
Karang thermal station was completed about two years behind schedule; the
next (Loan 1127) for the third 100 MW unit, had a delay of less than one
year. Subsequent generation projects at Muara Karang (Loan 1365) and
Semarang (Loan 1513) are about 4-6 months behind appraisal schedule; two
projects at Suralaya (Loans 1708 and 1872), although still at an early
stage, are more or less on schedule. These projects are currently free of
major problems.
3.19      There are other quantitative indications of PLN-s steady improve-
ment in performance. Its system losses, as high as 27% on FY75, were down
to 5% during FY79 and less than 22% in FY80. The generation (MWH) per
employee increased from 240 in FY75 to about 340 during FY80. There is still
scope for considerable improvement.
4. THE PROJECT
Objectives of the Project
4.01      The main objective of the project is to utilize the large
undeveloped, hydroelectric potential of the Citarum river - the third
largest river in Java - to meet Java's rapidly growing demand for
electricity in the most economic manner. It will also provide PLN with
technical assistance build up its capabilities in the fields of power market
surveys, system planning, and contract management of major civil works
awarded under international competitive bidding procedures.

Project Description
4.02      The main project comprises construction of:
(a) a 97.5 m high rockfill dam at Saguling, with a crest length of
290 m and volume of 2.9 million cu m;
(b) a side-channel, gated, concrete spillway with a capacity of 2,400
cu m/sec;
(c) two horse-shoe shaped diversion tunnels, 750 m long with inside
diameters of 7.5 m and 9.0 m, respectively;
(d) a tower type, intake structure, with a capacity of 224.0 cu m/sec;
(e) two lines of water conductor system each involving: (i) a 4.7 km
long circular, 5.8 m diameter, concrete lined pressure tunnel;
(ii) a 12.0 m diameter, 100.0 m high, differential surge tank; and
(iii) a 530 m long penstock tunnel with an inside diameter of
5.5 m and an embedded steel liner; and (iv) about 1,250 m of
penstock, with inside diameters varying from 4.3 m at the steel
liner end to 2.54 m at the power house end;
(f) a conventional type power house at Saguling with an initial
installed generating capacity of 700 MW (4x175 MW, with Francis
type turbines); and
(g) a 500 kV switchyard.
The Saguling power station will provide the Java Grid with 700 MW of
peaking capacity and 2,156 GWh of energy annually, of which 80% would be
firm. Further details are at Annex 5.
4.03      The following preparatory works of the project are now in various
stages of implementation:
(a) construction of about 34 km of access roads, improvement and
upgrading of about 17 km of existing roads, and two main construc-
tion camps;
(b) relocation of about 8 km of roads and construction of 3 new
bridges;
(c) resettlement of some 3,000 families; and
(d) miscellaneous environmental related works.
4.04      The costs of the following items are also included in the scope of
the project:



- 21 -
(a)  construction equipment for a PLN task force to be established by
PLN (para. 4.32);
(b)  selected consultancy services, including the Special Board of
Consultants and other experts who will be appointed by PLN on a
short-term basis to assist: (i) civil works contract management
(para. 4.44); (ii) power market surveys (para. 2.02); and
(iii) power system planning (para. 2.07); and
(c) detailed engineering of the Cirata Hydroelectric Project
(para. 4.34).
Investigations and Suitability of the Saguling Site
4.05      Three sites on the Citarum river viz Saguling, Cirata and
Jatiluhur, have been known for many years to be topographically suitable for
construction of storage dams. A fourth site, Rajamandala with a relatively
smaller potential is located between Saguling and Cirata.  It is estimated
that about 4,480 GWh of energy can be generated annually at these four
sites. Their location and features are shown on Map 3 and the profile of
the Citarum River Development at Annex 6. Jatiluhur, the lowermost of these
sites, was developed in 1964 primarily for irrigation of 244,000 ha; its 125
MW power station provides about 800 GWh of energy (mostly seasonal) annually
to the PLN system.
4.06      A reconnaissance survey of the other two sites was first carried out
by New Japan Engineering Consultants (Newjec) during 1972/1973 on behalf of
the Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency of Japan. It was followed during
1975/78 by a feasibility study, with financial assistance from IDA
(Cr 399-IND). The study was carried out by Newjec in two phases. During
the first phase, the features of the Saguling site (which had the advantage
of a sharp 330 m natural drop in river bed level in a 6 km stretch, but
required a long water conductor system) and Cirata (which had the advantages
of a larger catchment area and shorter water conductor system - about 1.0 km
- but could develop a head of only about 100 m) were compared. These
investigations established that the Saguling site was the better of the two
to initiate further hydro-electric development of the Citarum river.
Further feasibility studies were concentrated at Saguling. Funds from TA
451 were used in 1978 to complete the feasibility study and to have it
reviewed by the SBC constituted with well-known specialists. Guidance of
the SBC was also available for the subsequent work of detailed engineering
which has been carried out by Newjec since 1979, with financial assistance
from the OECF. Final project designs were completed by mid-1980 and the
results were incorporated in tender documents issued to prequalified bidders
for civil and metal works on August 1, 1980 (para. 4.46). Bids have been
received and are under evaluation.
Dam Site and Other Features
4.07      Two dam sites, located about 700 m apart, were available near
Saguling village and were investigated in detail at the feasibility stage.
The downstream site was preferred because it was narrower - requiring



- 22 -
smaller volumes of excavation and fill - and the thickness of lake deposits
on the right bank was thinner (10 m) than at the upstream site (35 m).  The
foundation rock at both sites was such that only an embankment type dam was
possible. In view of several faults observed, deep weathering and the
pattern of jointed rock, the downstream site was further explored with 60
drillings of about 3,000 m and 12 adits totalling 700 m.
4.08      The steep valley walls and deeply weathered rock posed problems
for spillway design. The spillway will be located on the left bank, and
consists of both a gated and free overflow section, with a spillway chute
and stilling basin. The arrangement and final design of the spillway has
been based on a hydraulic model study Larried out at Bandung University in
Indonesia. The results have been accepted by the SBC.
4.09      The alignment of the main headrace tunnels - some 5 km long - was
topographically obligatory on the right bank. Two tunnels, rather than one,
were chosen for the project, especially in view of the poor geological
conditions expected in the initial section (about one third) of the tunnel
route (para. 4.15) and also to provide better reliability in operation. The
tunnel route has been investigated by 14 drillings, extending about 1,100 m
and one adit.
4.10      The 1.8 km long penstock route, with an average gradient of 170,
was explored by 21 drillings totalling 1,000 m, 3 adits totalling 170 m and
3 tiltmeters.  The tiltmeters were installed in 1978 on the suggestion of
the SBC, to investigate creeping in view of shallow landsliding observed.
Although no signficant signs of creep have been observed, these investiga-
tions have led to the adoption of a trench type layout which will ensure
good anchors for the penstock.  Consideration was given to the alternative
of underground shafts (instead of surface penstocks) but seismic explorations
cast considerable doubt on the adequacy of the rock for an underground
powerhouse chamber. The underground powerhouse alternative was therefore
not pursued further. A conventional surface power station, founded on sound
rock, has been adopted.
Optimization of Project Features
4.11      After the dam site was chosen, the project features were optimized
for the maximum operating level of the reservoir, the ultimate capacity of
the water-conductor system and generating capacity of the Saguling power
station.
4.12      High water levels of the reservoir were critically examined in the
range of 645 m to 650 m.  It was finally fixed at 645 m as the incre-
mental gain in energy was estimated at only 20 GWh annually, whereas the
submergence would extend to 2,500 additional hectares of land affecting some
24,000 more inhabitants. At 645 m, the number of people affected would be
only 13,500, (3,000 families) whose resettlement was considered manageable.
The area submerged is 56.1 km2, of which 40% represents rice fields, 30%
farm land and 30% forests, orchards and residential areas.



- 23 -
4.13      The Saguling site is well suited to provide a major source of
peaking capacity for the Java Grid. Based on PCR's Java System Study and
Newjec's further aa-lysis, the ultimate capacity of the station has been
optimized at 1,400 MW, which would enable it to operate at an average annual
plant factoi of about 17.5%.  In the present stage of development (700 MW)
the station would operate at an average plant factor of 35% which is
appropriate. Operation studies carried out by PLN have shown that an
installed capacity of 700 MW at Saguling would during 1986/87 relegate gas
turbines (which would otherwise have to be operated to provide energy) to
only peak load functions. Plans for extension of the water-conductor system
and power station at a future stage have been incorporated in the project
designs. The need for a downstream reregulating pond was considered in
detail during the feasibility study and it was not recommended as (a) there
are no downstream users, e.g., irrigation, whose abstraction of river flows
would be adversely affected, (b) the construction of Cirata reservoir
(expected to follow within a few years) would eliminate possible hazards or,
account of sharp fluctuations in river flows, and (c) in the interim period
hazards would be kept at a minimum by warning systems, whose costs are
included in the project.
Geology
4.14      Main Dam.  The foundation rocks at the downstream site are
andesite, agglomerate, conglomerate, and conglomerate with limestone pebbles
and mudstone. There are a number of minor faults, none of which is active.
Except for a few local places in the river bottom and a few areas located
above two thirds the dam height on both abutments which can be treated, the
foundation rock is impervious and is expected to be stable.
Allied Structures
4.15      The tunnel route comprise lake deposits for the first 50 m,
followed by fairly good, though not very hard, andesites, agglomerates and
conglomerates for about 1,700 m. The tunnel then traverses a 1,000 m weak
stretch of soft and cracky rocks comprising alterations of sandstones and
mudstones. All other rocks along the tunnel route are hard and compact.
4.16      The foundations along the penstock slope comprise overburden,
badly weathered sandstone and shale. The surface penstocks will be laid in
a trench excavated to a sufficient depth to give sound rock foundations.
Stable rock conditions are expected at depths not exceeding 20 m.
4.17      The powerhouse excavation level corresponds with the level of
underlying hard limestone. Rock below this level is sound and continuous.
Local slots, pinnacles and chimney-like channels are considered possible,
but drilling data does not suggest that these would be extensive.
Reservoir Area
4.18      There is little concern about leakage of water from the reservoir
because the reservoir is largely covered with lake deposits and the abutmenL
of the dam site and the reservoir area are composed of impervious beds of



- 24 -
volcanic tuffs and tuff breccias. There are no topographically thin ridges
around the reservoirs that would be favorable to leakage of water.  Some
landslides have been observed in the area but they are mostly on a small
scale, occurring in the lake deposits and at the lower sections of the
reservoir and below the lake level.  They have been studied in detail to
enable preventive action to be taken against damage to temporary works
during construction.
Siesmology
4.19      Siesmological studies have been made by Newjec with earthquake
data available for the last 30 years, which indicate a low probability of
earthquake occurrences in or around Saguling. Newjec has used a design
seismic coefficient of acceleration of 0.15 g, which is greater than that
used at Jatiluhur (0.10 g). The SBC has concluded that the analysis made
leads to conservative safety factors which are in line with current
engineering practice.
Hydrology
4.20      The project area has a rainy season from November to April result-
ing from a western monsoon and a dry season for the rest of the year. The
mean annual rainfall is about 2,300 mm. River discharge data are available
as follows:  (a) at the damsite - for 9 years; (b) at 80% of the drainage
area - for 20 years; (c) at 105% of the drainage area - for 12 years; and
(c) at 175% of the drainage area - for 36 years. This data, considered
adequate, was used to establish a long-term pattern of flows at the dam site
for power potential studies.
4.21      There are about 90 rainguage stations in the drainage area dating
back to 1919. The available data was ample to compute probable maximum
flood flows. Floods with the following return periods were computed to have
peak flows as follows:
Return period                 Peak flow cu m/sec
Once in 10,000 years                6,597
Once in 1,000 years                 6,165
Once in 100 years                   3,942
Once in 20 years                    3,208
The hydrological data and studies used to support the project are acceptable.
The project has been designed for the maximum probable flood of
6,597 cu m/sec.

Sedimentation
4.22      The Institute of Hydraulic Engineering (DPMA) in Bandung has been
carrying out measurements of the silt carried by the Citarum river, and of
river bed loads since 1972. These have not been continuous, however.
During 1976 Newjec sampled suspended loads at 138 points, and collected data
on river bed materials at 7 points. On the basis of analyses of this data
Newjec has conservatively estimated the erosion rate from the 2,283 sq km
Saguling catchment at just over 2.0 mm/year (this compares with about 1.0
mm/year assumed for the Jatilihur project downstream). The corresponding
sediment volume was estimated at 4.0 million cu m per year. The storage in
the reservoir below the intake level (618 m) is 50 times this volume.
Newjec has also carried out a study of the likely effect on live storage at
Saguling by aggradation at the reservoir entrances, taking into account the
topographic characteristics of the Saguling reservoir. Its conclusion is
that sedimentation at the top levels of the Saguling reservoir would be
small and will not be significant for about 50 years after construction.
4.23      There are uncertainties about future land use patterns and erosion
rates in the watershed. In response to these, a supplementary sediment
monitoring program has been included under environmental related measures.
It would consist of daily monitoring at Nanjung, just upstream of the
reservoir during the wet season.  If sediment loads are seen to be higher
than assumed, monitoring would be extended to other locations to identify
sources of increased sedimentation and create a data base for corrective
action.
Construction Materials
4.24      During 1975-80 several field and laboratory investigations were
carried out by Newjec under the close supervision of the SBC. These have
confirmed the availability and suitability of sufficient rock and earth
materials for the construction of the main dam and for aggregate.
4.25      Three quarry sites were identified for rockfill materials during
reconnaisance. Of these a site 8 km upstream of the dam at Karang, explored
by 11 drillings of 670 m and 2 adits of 100 m, was chosen at the stage of
detailed engineering, after establishing that it could provide an adequate
quantity of good quality andesite suitable for dam embankments and for
concrete aggregate production. The location of the main quarry site is
shown in Map 4. A smaller scale limestone quarry site at Sangiantikoro has
also been identified and explored.  It will provide aggregate for concrete
work at the surge tank, penstock and power house sites. Basic concrete
tests using local cement, and aggregates from the two quarry sites were
carried out in Indonesia and Japan and have yielded satisfactory results.

4.26      Sites at:  (a) Selak, 1.0 km upstream of Saguling; and (b) Kaak,
1.5 km downstream, were investigated for core materials. The Kaak site (see
Map 4) proved more favorable in regard to the quality of clay. The site has
been inve-sz;gated by 20 drillings totalling 400 m, 3 vertical shafts 30 m
deep and a 50 m adit. Soil tests were carried out at the project field
laboratory. The results were satisfactory.
Engineering and Design
4.27      Newjec of Japan is the consulting engineer and is responsible for
design and construction supervision of the project. The SBC was appointed
early in 1978 to review the investigations and designs of the project and
ensure that due consideration was given to all aspects involving safety of
the structures. It has been agreed with PLN that the SBC will be continued
throughout the construction stage. The appointments of Newjec and the SBC
members were made by PLN in consultation with the Bank. An assurance of
continued appointment of consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank was obtained during negotiations of the proposed loan.
4.28      Detailed engineering of the project was completed during mid 1980.
Final designs, including proposals for instrumentation, have been prepared
and incorporated in bid documents for the main civil works (comprising the
dam, water-conductor system, penstocks, power house & switchyards) which
were issued on August 1, 1980. The final designs, as well as the bid
documents have been reviewed by the SBC.
Environmental Aspects
4.29      Environmental aspects have been given due consideration from the
initiation of the project investigations in 1976. Issues were identified in
time and action taken to ensure that proposals incorporated in the project:
(a) are sound in terms of cost estimates, schedule, and practical
considerations;
(b) minimize the risks which could delay construction or cause budget
overruns;
(c) are acceptable to both project management and the administrative
hierarchy of the project area; and
(d) are sensitive and responsive to the expectations of families who
will be displaced from their homes or otherwise directly affected
by the project.
There has been extensive involvement of environmental specialists in base-
line and impact studies, design review, and implementation planning. Senior
environmental specialists and managers from the Institute of Ecology



- 27 -
Padjadjaran University, Bandung, (LE UNPAD) the Royal Tropical Institute,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands and several others have contributed approximately
3 man-years of effort to the project, supported by an additional 12
man-years of effort by junior specialists, technicians, and students.
Twenty-four project reports have been prepared and a formal project seminar
was conducted. The cooperation of project management and provincial and
Kabupaten leaders has been commendable. Project management has been
responsive to environmental recommendations of specialists and the Bank, and
effective in arranging compromise approaches to complicated problems such as
resettlement. The Governor of West Java and the Bhupati of Kabupaten,
Bandung have supported the project by issuing five decrees to facilitate
land acquisition, resettlement planning and resettlement implementation. In
June 1980 the Minister for Environment, GOI, cleared the project for
construction.
4.30      Apart from the problem of optimizing the high water level of the
reservoir and its design life (dealt with in paras. 4.12 and 4.22 above),
resettlement, public health impacts, aquatic weed control, fisheries
enhancement and drawdown agriculture were the main environmental issues.
Compensation and resettlement of persons with homes or other major interest
in the reservoir areas was the most serious environmental problem
confronting the project mainly because:
(a) areas surrounding the reservoir are densely populated; about 9,500
families have to be dealt with, 3,000 of whom reside in the
reservoir area and 6,500 reside elsewhere but own land or work in
the reservoir area;
(b) of complex proprietary and inheritance rights and out of date
records of land ownership; and
(c) traditions, customs, economic conditions, and perceptions of
transmigration are such that most families prefer to remain in the
vicinity of the reservoir and are reluctant to leave Java.
4.31      The following actions have been taken to date to deal with the
resettlement problem:
(a) a 2-year anthropological, socio-economic, and ecological baseline
and impact study (including censuses and property inventories) has
been completed;
(b) alternatives to transmigration have been developed, scheduled, and
evaluated. These include resettlement in Java through the Nucleus
Estate Smallholders program (NES - 5) for about 1,200 families,
resettlement in Java through the independent redevelopment of an
abandoned plantation (for 500 families), development of aquacul-
ture and drawdown agriculture in the reservoir area, employment
training (for 500 families), and simple compensation (for 300 fam-
ilies). Transmigration is expected to cover about 500 families;



- 28 -
(c) decrees (para. 4.29) freezing land transactions, creating a
Resettlement Coordinating Board, stating resettlement policy, and
creating the resettlement implementation team have been issued and
are now in effect;
(d) a direct-payment compensation system has been in satisfactory
operation for more than a year;
(e) a resettlement cost estimate has been prepared on the basis of
recent local experience in land acquisition, compensation
administration, access road construction, and site planning and
development;
(f) detailed implementation planning has been initiated; and
(g) an aide memoire listing and scheduling additional resettlement
necessities (for item b above) has been prepared by PLN. The
proposed arrangements constitute a program acceptable to the Bank.
4.32      The status of other environmental aspects of the project is as
follows:
(a) Public health - A fortunate circumstance of the project, which
reduces the potential for adverse impacts of the project on public
health, is the fact that the geographic ranges of vectors of
several parasitic diseases including schistosomiasis, sleeping
sickness, and river blindness, which are associated with river
systems, reservoirs, and irrigation systems in other parts of the
world, do not extend into the project area. However, concern
about epidemics of water-borne and insect-borne diseases has
resulted in the developing of monitoring programs that will
continue through the early years of operation. Construction
health services will be provided in accordance with past practice
on other PLN projects.
(b) Aquatic weed control - Because circumstances appear likely to
favor the growth of aquatic weeds in many parts of the reservoir,
provisions have been made for an aquatic weed control plan to be
implemented in 1984.
(c) Fisheries enhancement and drawdown agriculture - As development of
the reservoir shoreline area between elevations 640 m and 645 m
is possible as also development of penned culture of carp and
other species of fish, these potentialities will be assessed in
detail during FY81 and implementation plans will be developed in
accordance with the findings.



- 29 -
(d) Watershed erosion - In response to observations of increasing
erosion rates in other watersheds and concern about the effects of
population pressure and clearing of steep slopes on future erosion
rates in the Saguling catchment area, supplemental sediment
monitoring will be initiated in early 1981.
(e) Safety measures for persons living near the river downstream of
the power house - These will be reinvestigated during the
feasibility study for the Cirata Project which would inundate much
of this area. Appropriate safety measures, including foot
bridges, warning systems, bathing facilities, and resettlement,
will be implemented thereafter. The project cost estimate makes
adequate provision for these.
4.32      There are no archaelogical sites or artifacts of any significance
in the submergence area.  Construction of the project is not expected to
adversely affect fauna in the valley.
Construction Equipment for a PLN Task Force
4.33      Basically all the project works will be done by contract.  How-
ever, PLN intends to build up a small construction task force of its own,
equipped to deal with emergencies - mainly on work being carried out by
local contracts - to ensure that the construction schedule of the main
project is not adversely affected by delays, etc. The Bank agreed that
this is necessary under the prevailing circumstances. The construction
equipment required, estimated to cost about US$500,000, is therefore
included in the scope of the project.
Engineering of Cirata Hydroelectric Project
4.34      As explained in para. 6.01, there would be need for both a
substantial addition of generating capacity and energy potential of the Java
Grid before FY88 in addition to the Saguling Project. Of the available
sites for hydroelectric potential the Cirata site (para. 4.02) has the
largest firm energy potential. Its salient features are at Annex 7. PLN-s
latest update of studies of the least cost development sequence for Java
indicated that the Cirata site should be developed for commissioning during
1986/87. Feasibility investigations of the site are in progress with
financial assistance through Loan 1365 (Power VI) and an interim report was
submitted in December 1980. It has been reviewed by the Bank, and one of
the members of the SBC. The report confirms the technical feasibility of
constructing the Cirata dam. A final report will be prepared by May 1981.
PLN intends to carry through with detailed investigations and engineering of
this project. MME and the national planning commission (BAPPENAS) support
this approach and have requested the Bank to provide funds under this loan
for the purpose. The Bank has agreed to do so and the project includes
US$7.5 million for the foreign costs of detailed investigations and designs
up to the stage of preparation of bidding documents.

Project Cost Estimate
4.35      The total project cost over the 6-year implementation period
(1980-86) is estimated at US$726.7 million equivalent, of which US$386.6 mil-
lion represents the foreign component. The costs are summarized in the
table below and are detailed in Annex 8:
Table 4.1: PROJECT COST ESTIMATE (SUMMARY)

212.8    241.6    454.1   340.1    386.6    726.7
4.36      The cost estimates for the preliminary works of the Saguling
project (access roads and construction camps) are based on local contracts
awarded. The cost of road relocation has also been estimated on the basis
of these rates. The costs of compensation and resettlement are based on (a)
a detailed program of resettlement and (b) rates based on PLN's recent
experiences in the project area in connection with preliminary works. The
cost of the other environment-related items (included in the "miscellaneous"
category) are based on detailed estimates for known work and lump sum
estimates for the rest, made by PLN in consultation with LE UNPAD and Newjec.
4.37      The cost estimates of the main civil works to be carried out through
contracts under ICB have been prepared by Newjec on the basis usually
followed by contractors viz a detailed construction program was first worked
out and then equipment and manpower of known capacities were applied to the
preliminary bill of quantities estimated from detailed final designs
incorporated in the bidding documents. Other items such as fuel, power,
compressed air, lighting etc. were added. Foreign costs cover the
following: (a) mobilization and supervision costs; (b) foreign skilled
labor; (c) main steel structural materials and principal reinforcement; (d)



- 31 -
freight, insurance and transportation of equipment and materials; (e)
depreciation on equipment; (f) explosives and (g) fuel costs. Local costs
cover: (a) applicable mobilization and supervision costs; (b) local labor;
(c) timber; and (d) cement and supplementary reinforcement bars. The method
followed and the resulting estimates are acceptable.
4.38      The costs of penstock steel have been estimated on the basis of
designs prepared by Newjec, expected international prices for mild and high
tensile steel, and adequate provisions for fabrication (at shop and site),
transport and erection. The costs of turbines, generators, transformers,
switchgears, spillway gates and screens (all items which are to be covered
by OECF financing) are based on prices relevant to the type of limited
bidding involved.
Contingencies
4.39      Physical contingencies have been provided for at the following
rates (a) electrical and mechanical equipment - 5%; (b) penstocks and other
metal works - 10%; and (c) civil works - 15%. These are adequate. Base
prices are at September 1979 price levels. Price contingencies on the local
currency portion have been estimated at the following rates: 15% for
FY80/81 and 10% thereafter. For electrical and mechanical equipment and
engineering costs, foreign escalation has been based on an annual escalation
rate of 5% (reflecting the expected rate in the country of origin of goods
and services agreed between OECF and PLN during OECF appraisal in July 1980)
whereas other foreign costs have been calculated at the following rates:
10.5% for FY80; 9.0% for FY81; 8.0% for FY82; 7.0% for 1983-85 and 6.0% for
1986.
Consulting Services
4.40      The cost estimate for engineering of the Saguling Project covers
740 man-months for construction design and 1,100 man-months for supervision
of construction. The average man-month cost, including basic salary,
overhead and fee, international travel, overseas allowance for resident field
engineers and subsistence allowances for staff on short field visits, is
about US$10,400. Detailed engineering for the Cirata hydroelectric project
covers the work up to preparation of bid documents, and is expected to take
20 months, involving about 500 man-months of expatrate effort, at an average
man-month cost (as explained above) of US$10,000. In addition, local
subconsultants, will contribute about 80 man-months of work estimated to
cost about US$2,400 per man-month. Both the estimates include additionally
provisions for test equipment, testing and surveys, and other minor items.
The cost of selected consulting services is based on an estimate of the
periods of use and prevailing rates.



- 32 -
Financing
4.41      The project would be financed as follows:
Proposed Bank loan ...... US$250.0 million
OECF loans .............. US$136.6 million
PLN/GOI ................. US$340.1 million
Total ............  US$726.7 million
4.42      The Bank loan will cover the estimated foreign costs of (i) the
main civil works and penstocks ($240.5 million), (ii) engineering of Cirata
hydroelectric project ($7.5 million), (iii) selected consulting services
($1.5 million), and (iv) limited construction equipment ($0.5 million). The
OECF loan would cover the foreign costs of (i) engineering and construction
supervision of the project, and (ii) electrical, mechanical and hydraulic
equipment. The local costs of the Project will be financed partly from PLN-s
own cash flow and partly through contributions from the GOI. These are
assured because of the high priority accorded to the project by PLN/GOI.
Annex 9 provides a summary of the items to be financed by the main sources
and their costs.
4.43      As in previous operations, the Bank loan would be to the Govern-
ment which will relend the proceeds to PLN, the beneficiary, on the same
terms as the Bank loan. Interest and commitment charges during the grace
period of the loan would be capitalized. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Construction
4.44      The project will be implemented by PLN, with the help of consul-
tants engaged in consultation with the Bank. PLN has appointed a project
manager who has experience in dam construction in Indonesia, along with an
adequate complement of field staff. The project manager will be assisted by
PLN's headquarters staff, who also have some experience in execution of
hydroelectric projects on a smaller scale. The engineer, Newjec, will be
solely responsible for technical supervision and control of the project. As
this is the first major ICB civil works contract which PLN will be involved
in, it feels that expert advice may be required on occasion during the
implementation period particularly on contract disputes where PLN as the
employer would have an important role. Funds have been provided under the
proposed loan for the use of such experts by PLN. The construction
organization and arrangements proposed are appropriate for the nature of
work involved.
4.45      The preparatory works on the project are being carried out by
local contractors selected on the basis of local bidding. The contracts
were placed in time and progress of construction so far has been adequate to
meet the deadlines for providing access and other facilities to the
contractors to be selected for the main works.



- 33 -
Implementation Program
4.46      The main project works have been divided in categories, in
accordance with the requirements of associated financing. The work has been
divided into eight lots. Bid invitations for four of these covering civil
works for the (i) dam and spillway, (ii) water-conductor system, (iii)
powerhouse and switchyard, and (iv) metal work viz penstocks, have been
issued on August 1, 1980. They are multiyear contracts with adequate (15%)
provision for advance payments. The bid invitations for the items to be
financed by OECF, viz. (i) gates and screens, (ii) turbines, (iii)
generators and (iv) main transformer and switchyard equipment, have been
issued in October 1980. The implementation schedule for the main project
works is at Annex 10. The target is to commission the first two generating
sets by March 1985 and the remaining two by September 1985. Milestone
schedules have been prepared for both sets of contracts and are presented in
Annex 11.
4.47      The construction program is tight but capable of being achieved.
Crucial to the success of this program is the award of the main civil works
contract in time to enable the main contractor to mobilize and start work on
the diversion tunnels for the main dam by July 1, 1981. Only then would it
be possible to complete the first diversion tunnel in time to start diver-
sion of dry weather river flows by April 1982 and thus keep to the schedule
of construction of the main dam. A failure to achieve these dates would set
back completion of the dam, and hence the commissioning of the project by a
whole year. Cognisant of the problem, PLN and GOI have reviewed their
procedures and prepared a detailed working arrangement involving special
procedures for bid evaluation and contract approval of the main civil works
contracts, which, if adhered to by all parties involved, could meet the
project requirements. The arrangements are workable. The crucial dates for
award of the other contracts are 2-6 months later than the civil works (May
1981). There is adequate time to follow normal procedures for award of these
contracts.
Procurement
4.48      Procurement of items to be financed under assistance from the Bank
loan would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. The civil and metal works bidders were prequalified by
PLN, after due international notification, in consultation with the Bank.
The items to be financed under the OECF loan would be procured through
limited bidding in Japan and less developed countries. Other local cost
items would be procured, as hitherto, through local bidding procedures,
which have been found to be appropriate so far.
Disbursement
4.49      The Bank loan will be disbursed against the following items:
(a) metal works - 100% of the foreign expenditures;
(b) civil works - 61% of expenditures;



- 34 -
(c)  construction equipment - 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported goods, 95% of the ex-factory cost for locally
manufactured goods and 65% of the total expenditures for imported
goods procured locally; and
(d) consultants services - 100% of expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan signing.
4.50      The schedule of disbursement of the Bank loan is at Annex 12.  It
has been based on the implementation schedule of the project (Annex 10) and
the payment provisions made in the bidding documents. If contract approval
is accorded by the critical dates in the milestone schedule (Annex 11), the
schedule can be achieved.
Maintenance for Dam Safety
4.51      In order to ensure that the project works are maintained
satisfactorily, it was agreed, during negotiations, that PLN will, before
completion of the project, prepare a program of periodic inspection and
maintenance of the project works, which is satisfactory to the Bank, and
implement it throughout the operational period of the project.
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results
5.01      PLN-s operations have grown strongly throughout the last decade,
and energy sales tripled between 1971 and 1980. During the last five years
the rate of growth accelerated; energy sales increased from 2,800 GWh in
1975/76 to 5,300 GWh in 1979/80, and for the last two years the rate of
growth has exceeded 20% per year.
5.02      Revenues from energy sales in recent years have been derived from
a tariff which was introduced in 1973. The tariff contained provision for
the application of a surcharge to recover increased costs attributable to
fuel prices, and this facility was used in 1974/75 and 1975/76 to increase
average revenues to Rp 27 per kWh, at which level they remained until the
introduction of a completely new rate schedule on May 1, 1980 (para. 5.06).
With this revenue base PLN operated at or near breakeven in net income terms
through 1978/79. A loss of Rp 22 billion is reported for 1979/80,/i attrib-
utable entirely to increased depreciation charges arising from the revalua-
tion of assets which was carried out during that year (para. 3.13).
/_ 1979/80 financial results are provisional and subject to audit.



- 35 -
5.03      PLN's investment program began to accelerate rapidly in 1974/5
from the low level of the early 1970s, and by 1979/80 capital expenditure
was running at over Rp 300 billion annually - more than twice sales revenue.
With negligible net income, PLN's only sources of internal funds have been
depreciation retentions and customers' connection fees, which amounted to
17% of capital expenditures over the last five years. GOI provided the rest
of the funds required, mainly in the form of -uity capital, though since
1978 the onlending of finance from international lenders has formed an
increasing proportion of GOI funding Lo PLN.
5.04      Income statements, funds flow statements and balance sheets for
the last five years are at Annex 13.
Present Financial Position
5.05      PLN's balance sheet at March 31, 1980 may be summarized as
follows:
Rp billion
Net Worth
Fixed assets in operation,
at depreciated replacement cost             684
Construction in progress                      857
1,541
Current assets                     187
less current liabilities          44
Net current assets                            143
Total net worth                           1,684
Financed by
Capital and reserves                        1,336
Customer contributions                        157
Long-term debt                                191
1,684
Since loan financing is a relatively recent innovation for PLN, the debt:
equity ratio stands only at 12:88, which leaves the company conservatively
leveraged to sustain a high level of borrowing for capital expenditure. The



- 36 -
current ratio is 4.3, and with current assets including Rp 70 billion in
cash the company's liquid position is satisfactory. The level of
receivables has given some cause for concern in the past, but as a result of
the adoption in 1980 of a more rigorous policy towards delinquent debtors
the average length of credit has been reduced from 94 to 72 days. While
still too high, this measure reflects mainly the long delay in settlement of
certain public accounts; discussions are presently in progress between PLN
and the concerned authoriities to try to improve payment procedures. At
negotiation of the Power IX Project (Loan 1872), it was agreed that GOI
outstanding accounts will be reduced to two months billing by March 31,
1982; this covenant will be repeated in the proposed loan.
Future Financial Performance
5.06      PLN introduced a new tariff on May 1, 1980, whose salient features
were as follows:
(a) the structure of the tariff and classification of customers were
revised, so as more closely to reflect the long run marginal costs
of supply to the various consumer groups, while at the same time
restricting charges to the lowest income households to what was
considered affordable;
(b) rates were revised, increasing average revenue per kWh sold from
Rp 27 to Rp 42; and
(c) the surcharge facility was widened to allow all cost increases to
be passed on, not merely those relating to fuel.
Coincidentally with this tariff increase GOI raised the price of all
petroleum products by 50%, so that initially about one third of PLN's
additional revenue will be absorbed in higher fuel bills. In terms of net
income, PLN would be able to maintain breakeven for two years if the new
tariff were retained without change.
5.07      In 1977 PLN and the Bank agreed that a level of contribution to
capital expenditures from internally generated funds was suitable as a
measure of financial performance. At negotiations for the Power VIII Project
(Loan 1708) this was set at 30% (on a 3-year moving total basis) which was
to be achieved by 1985/86; this agreement was repeated in the loan documents
for the Power IX Project (Loan 1872).  Indicative targets for the
intervening years have also been the subject of discussion and revision from
time to time between PLN and the Bank; the latest ones are:
FY81 through 82              12%
FY83 through 84              20%
FY85                         25%



- 37 -
Projections indicate that the 1980 tariff increase will permit continued
growth of internal cash generation, and this would be sufficient to attain
PLN-s current indicative targets for FY81 and 82.  But, because the rate of
growth will be lower than that of capital expenditures, PLN will need a
further tariff increase to achieve its indicative targets for FY83-85 and
the convenanted level for FY86. This is estimated to be on the order of
20-30% in real terms. Some flexibility exists as to the timing of this
increase; in the financial forecasts (Annex 14) it is assumed to be
implemented in two approximately equal steps in FY82 and FY84.
5.08      Around 1986, PLN is expected to enter a period in which its unit
costs will decline gradually (1-2% per year) in real terms. The factors
contributing to this include, in particular:
(a) the expected impact of the loss reduction program;
(b) increased efficiency of operation in Java on completion of the
EHV transmission line; and
(c) increasing economy of operation in some of the systems outside
Java as a result of scale and improving load factors.
These considerations suggest that for the remainder of the forecast period
(through 1989) PLN's requirements for increased unit revenues will be
entirely within the scope of the tariff's surcharge facility (para. 5.06(c)),
and that average revenues may therefore be allowed to advance at rather less
than the rate of cost inflation.
5.09      On this basis, PLN would maintain its target self-financing ratio
throughout the remainder of the forecast period and would generate a rate of
return (on revalued net fixed assets in operation) approaching 8% by the end
of the period. Continuation of GOI's existing policies on capitalization of
PLN would result in a debt:  equity ratio of about 25:75 at the end of the
period with debt service covered over 3 times throughout, thus leaving the
company comfortably leveraged for continued growth in the 1990s. The
forecasts indicate that the existing agreement between GOI and the Bank on
securing an adequate cash flow for PLN (para. 5.07) is reasonably quantified
for the medium term; it will be continued under the proposed project.
6. JUSTIFICATION
Demand
6.01      The forecast of electricity demand in Java (Annex 2) and growth of
supply (Annex 3) indicates that the available generating capacity based on
additions under implementation through 1985/86, would not be able to meet



- 38 -
the anticipated maximum demand of about 3,440 MW during 1986/87 or its
energy requirement of about 20,500 GWh. The installed generating capacity
during 1985/86 would be 3,727 MW, which, after allowing for the 25% margin
which studies have shown to be necessary to provide a reliability index
(loss of load probability) of one day in one year, can safely meet a maximum
demand of about 3,000 MW. The energy capability of the system, assuming
operation of all its steam plant at base load and all of its gas turbines at
annual capacity factor of 25%, would be only 18,100 GWh. Augmentation of
generating capacity is required before 1986/87.  The most recent trends of
acceleration in the growth of PLN sales (para. 2.07) indicate that the
demand indicated above may materialise earlier than 1986/87. Because of
this, and the possible fuel savings, PLN has planned to commission the
Saguling hydroelectric project during 1985/86. This is appropriate.
Least Cost Solution
6.02      The Java system development study carried out by PCR of the UK
with Bank assistance (Credit 399) had established a least cost development
sequence of expansion of generating capacity for discount rates up to 15%.
PCR recommended in 1976 that out of all the new generation schemes examined,
the Saguling hydroelectric project had the highest economic rate of return
(18%) and that it should be implemented with an installed capacity of 700 MW
by 1981, if possible.  However, investigations of the scheme did not proceed
rapidly enough and precedence was correctly given to the Suralaya thermal
station. This enabled PLN to complete the investigations of the Saguling
hydroelectric project thoroughly and meet the equally urgent need for a
large base load thermal power station at Suralaya. Subsequent investiga-
tions by PLN and other agencies have confirmed that the conclusions of the
PCR study still remain valid and that the Saguling hydroelectric project is
the most economic next step in the least cost development sequence.
Economic studies carried out by Newjec for the feasibility report (1978),
indicated that for the range of discount rates used (6-20%) the Saguling
project was more economic than thermal power stations, as well as gas
turbine installations.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is the discount rate
which equalises present values of the streams of economic costs and benefits
attributable to the project. The costs include all the direct costs of
construction of the project, and those required to deal with rehabilitation
and environmental measures. Extensions of the transmission and the
distribution systems required have been allowed for in the estimates of
costs.



- 39 -
6.04      As the scheme has been designed and is being constructed as a
peaking station (with an initial plant factor of 35%, capable of extension to
operate ultimately at 17.5% plant factor) incremental revenues, which are
used as a proxy for total benefits, have been assessed on the basis of the
project design and the expected pattern of operation of this power station.
Roughly half the energy output of the scheme would be generated during the
4-hour peak period and the balance during off-peak hours. These components
have been evaluated at the respective tariffs currently applied by PLN.
6.05      The cost and benefit streams and details of shadow pricing are
provided in Annex 16. The IERR is 16%. It is a minimum measure of the
benefits principally because consumer surpluses have been ignored. The
project would, in addition to the benefit of power generation at Saguling,
afford downstream benefits both for further power generation as at Cirata
and Rajamandala sites. These have not been evaluated.
6.06      The IERR of the project would be reduced to about 14% if there is
a delay in construction of 12 months involving a cost increase of 10%. The
thorough investigations carried out, ample physical and price contingencies
and adequate rates for base cost estimates, and assurances by PLN and GOI
authorities and expeditions action on contract approvals make it unlikely
that such an increase in cost would occur on this project.
Risks
6.07      The risks associated with the proposed project are the uncertain-
ties inherent in most hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological
problems, hydrological complexities, and similar matters. However, the
thorough and competent preparatory work undertaken by PLN and consultants, as
well as the precautions taken in establishing the SBC right from the stage of
feasibility studies through detailed engineering, are expected to keep the
risks to a minimum. Contractors have been directed to provide for
conventional all-risk insurance as a separate item in their bids. PLN is
separately carrying out a risk analysis study using a consultant acceptable
to the Bank. If the study indicates that it would be more advantageous to
PLN to modify its insurance for the project, the question would be reviewed
and necessary changes made in the contract documentation.
7. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following main covenants in the earlier power loans and
project agreements will be continued in the agreements for the proposed loan:



- 40 -
(a) GOI should, through PLN, review annually with the Bank changes in
the demand growth in Java and consequent variations in PLN's
development program for Java, and take steps to implement such
development programs;
(b) GOI should, through PLN, review annually with the Bank, PLN's
investment program for the next year;
(c) PLN should prepare and furnish to the Bank annually for review,
its customer connection program, and thereafter implement it in a
satisfactory manner;
(d) PLN should attain a level of contribution to its capital
expenditures of not less than 30% by 1985/86;
(e) PLN should maintain a debt:equity ratio of not more than 60:40;
(f) PLN should maintain a debt service cover of not less than 1.3
times;
(g) GOI shall ensure (i) that amounts owing by its departments and
agencies to PLN for elecric power shall be settled by the 15th of
the month in which they are due; and (ii) by March 31, 1982 the
amounts so owing to PLN do not exceed two months billing.
7.02      The specific agreements reached during negotiations of this loan
are:
(a) PLN would with the assistance of GOI take steps to improve the
capability of its power market survey units - at Central and
Wilayah levels - to carry out power market surveys to update the
PCR study in Java and similar consultant studies in other islands
and compile data for all islands (para. 2.02);
(b) PLN would improve the capability of its central system planning
unit at heaquarters appropriately to identify emerging system
bottlenecks in advance and ensure that its power systems
continue to be adequate as the demands escalate (para. 2.07);
(c) PLN would continue to employ consultants (including the SBC) on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for engineering of
the project (para. 4.27); and
(d) PLN would, before completion of the project, prepare a program of
periodic inspection and maintenance of the project works which is
satisfactory to the Bank, and implement it throughout the
operational period of the project (para. 4.51).
(e) Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement will be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan.



- 41 -
7.03      Agreement having been reached on the above matters, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$250 million, for a period of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at interest rates prevailing at Board
presentation.

Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
General
1.        Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (%):
81   82   83   84   85   86   87   88   89
Offshore costs               9    8    8   7       7    6    6    6    6
Local costs (exc. fuel)   15   10   10  10    10   10   10   10   10
Fuel costs                   -    -   30  10    10   10   10   10   10
Income Statements
2.        Revenues assume a tariff increase of approximatey 12% in real
terms in 1982 and another of about 8% in 1984. This assumption is adopted
to exemplify the scale of tariff adjustments likely to be required before
FY 86; in practice, the phasing of the adjustments may vary somewhat, and
they may be consolidated. Thereafter use of the surcharge facility is
assumed to maintain a self-financing ratio above 30% for the rest of the
period.
3.        Fuel/Bulk Power is derived directly from the planting schedule at
Annex 3. Power produced at geothermal plants is assumed to be bought by PLN
from the agency responsible for generating it.
4.        Operating Expenses have been forecast in detail taking into
account the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to
local cost inflation indices as at 1 above.
5.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates to
assets revalued annually as described at para. 8.
Funds Flow
6.        Financing.  Borrowing has been assumed for 50% of the foreign
exchange component of capital expenditures, except where loan agreements
with international agencies require a higher proportion of foreign exchange



-65-
ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 2
costs to be financed as debt. Assumed terms on future borrowings are 9% for
19 years, including 4 years grace. Remaining foreign exchange and all local
capital expenditures (after deducting internal cash generation) are assumed
financed by equity contribution.
7.        Capital Expenditures exclude geothermal generating plants, which
are assumed to be constructed and operated by another agency.
Balance Sheet
8.        Fixed Assets are revalued annually according to the following
assumed indices:
1981 ........ 1.11
1982 ........ 1.09
1983-85 ........ 1.08
Thereafter ...... 1.07

attributable costs of transmission and distribution (US$200.0 million),
less taxes (about 5% of total costs).
/b Shadow price 1.0.
/c Composite labor conversion factor of 0.8 applied.
/d Includes normal project operation costs at US$4.0/KW/year, insurance and
reservoir maintenance: transmission and distribution costs have been
assumed at 1% of capital investment.
/e Figures in column (1) are based on the expected pattern of utilization
of the energy output of the project viz about 1,020 GWh during the 4-hour
peak load period (with a corresponding tariff rate of Rp 86.8/kWh) and
the balance of 1,136 GWh during off peak hours (with a corresponding
tariff rate of Rp 28/kWh). This works out to an average of Rp 55.8/kWh.
The prevailing average revenue is Rp 42.0/kWh. The energy sale is
assumed to be 75% of the gross generation during peak hours and about
85% during off peak hours. Figures in column (2) and column (4) are
based on an increase in the cost of construction of Saguling Project by
10% and a commissioning delay of six months.
