F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
 The project development objective is to contribute to the development of policies and
measures that will assist in a long-term modal shift toward climate-friendly, more
efficient and less polluting, less carbon intensive transport in the Mexico City
Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Specifically, the project will support aspects of the recently
completed Third Air Quality Management Plan (AQM-III 2002-2010) (Programa para
Mejorar la Calidad del Aire en la ZMVM 2002-2010) which are consistent with the GEF
Operational Program on Sustainable Transport (OP-11) and the Metropolitan Climate
Change Action Plan (MCCAP).

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Country Background

Characteristics of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Mexico City extends over a
surface of 1,428 km2. The metropolitan area has more than 21.1 million inhabitants of which 8.9
million live in Mexico City. This places the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) among the
most populated urban areas in the occidental hemisphere. Because of geographic and location
factors (Mexico City as an elevated bowl due to surrounding mountains), temperature inversions
and stagnant air masses contribute to higher concentrations of local criteria pollutants and
worsen the local population's exposure. The city also centralizes a large fraction of economic
activity, commerce and industry and thus is a major consumer of fossil fuels.

Sector Background

Gradual carbonization (increase of greenhouse gas emissions per passenger-km) of the
transport sector - The energy and greenhouse gas inventories for the MCMA at project approval
indicated a gradual increase in its energy intensity. This finding was evident in the analysis of the
modal evolution in the public transport system in the MCMA during the period 1986-2000 which
showed that both the metro system and the bus had lost share of the total public transport market,
having been displaced by smaller vehicles. The gradual shift away from large capacity vehicles
was, in part, an unintended effect of the atomization of services in the transport sector and the
relatively poor regulatory system. This unwelcome development, especially in such a congested
and polluted region as the MCMA, generated inefficiencies from a transport and environment
perspective by adding to traffic congestion and reducing public transport productivity. It resulted
in higher emissions and exposure to criteria pollutants and associated health impacts, caused
increased releases of GHG, and was linked to increasing accident rates. A GHG emission
inventory was calculated on the basis of the energy balance, following the IPCC methodology.
The transport sector was the largest source of methane (CH4) and volatile organic compounds.
The emissions of GHGs were linked to those of local airborne pollutants. Over 42% of the GHG
emissions in the city were associated to the transport sector.

The Problem of Air Pollution in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area - Air pollution in the
MCMA is of serious health and environmental concern. At project approval 19 million
inhabitants were living in the MCMA, equivalent to about 19% of the country's entire
population, and were exposed to high levels of ozone and particulate matter. The need to develop
information and tools to tackle the problem in a comprehensive manner had led the City to
develop integrated air quality management plans. The Third Air Quality Management Plan, in
part supported by the Bank, was intended as a continuation of these efforts while also linking air
quality to climate change issues and providing the required scientific and analytical basis to
formulate further action. The Plan had the support of a blue-ribbon panel, with the participation
of world-renowned specialists.

Health Costs of Air Pollution - While previous efforts in air quality management had yielded
dramatic reductions in lead concentration, emissions of CO and sulfur dioxide, ozone
concentrations had remained high, often exceeding acceptable levels. PM levels were also high
along heavily congested zones and in areas under the direct influence of wind erosion of denuded
land. Abatement of these contaminants remained a first priority for subsequent efforts since they
had been directly linked to respiratory illnesses and mortality. A health impacts study, completed
with Bank support as part of the assistance to the formulation of the air quality management
plan, provided an economic valuation of benefits from reducing pollution in the MCMA. The
study concluded that the annual benefits of a 10 percent reduction in ozone and PM10 is $759
million. High and low estimates of the value of a 10 percent reduction in PM10 are $1,607
million and $154 million, respectively. Obtaining air quality compliance (AQS 1) offers benefits
of approximately $2 billion per year. These results highlighted the urgency of dealing with the
air quality issue in the MCMA.1

Large contribution of the transport sector to the problem of air quality - Under the Integrated
Transport and Road Program (2002-2006), the transport authority of Mexico City attempted to
address the growing demand for transport while minimizing its environmental impacts.
However, the number of vehicles in the area is high for the available infrastructure, resulting in
road congestion, large fuel consumption, unsafe conditions and high level of emissions. In
particular, the increasing number of private cars exacerbates traffic congestion, which

contributed to productivity losses, and higher level of emissions of criteria pollutants. According
to the emission inventory and the Third Air Quality Management Plan (AQM-III) (2002-2010),
the mobile sources accounted for a majority of NOx emissions, 40% of HC emissions and about
36% of particulate emissions. In addition to the large contributions to the release of local criteria
pollutants, the transport sector in the MCMA is the largest contributor of greenhouse gases.

Congestion and low productivity in the transport sector - Traffic congestion affects public
transport efficiency and, in addition, imposes direct and indirect costs on the urban economy.
Time lost in traffic can add up to a substantial share of a city's output as it reduces the size of the
effective labor market, imposes the need for higher inventory and more generally affects
individual productivity. In Mexico, between 1990 and 2000, the number of motor vehicles on the
road grew by 42%. At the same time, the population grew by 25%, while the number of trips
grew even faster than the population. Inefficient public space management, including the lack of
properly designed traffic signs and signals, uncontrolled vehicle parking, and inadequate
facilities for pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic, contributed significantly to the
congestion problem.

Lack of a sustainable business environment for public transport - The business structure of bus
services in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) had led to highly inefficient operations,
resulting in a costly, unsafe and environmentally unsustainable public transport system. The key
issues were: (a) lack of an organizational model that would facilitate efficient public transport
operation in the metropolitan area, (b) dispersed operations that hinder the effective control of
bus services and contribute to traffic congestion, (c) inefficient use of vehicles, (d) deficiencies
in bus inspection and maintenance, (e) lack of professional management among bus operators, (f)
lack of coordination between transport operations in the State of Mexico and the City, (g) a fare
system which penalizes transfers and thus discourages intermodal movements, and (h) systematic
decline in the number of metro passengers since 1989 despite a 35% network extension during
that period. These barriers required of substantial efforts at the policy and regulatory levels.

Need for a better harmonization of sector policies on the issue of Air Quality and on Climate
Change - At time of project approval the metropolitan authorities had adopted comprehensive
sector policies that already identified priority areas in transport, air quality and urban
development.2 However, there was a need for the sector authorities to harmonize the different
programs as these relate to the issues of transport, air quality and land use. Successful
incorporation of climate-friendly policies and measures would depend on the extent to which
sector planning recognized the harmonization potential between climate change and sector
policies, and on the realization of local co-benefits from actions on climate change concerns.

Government strategy
In 2001, a long-term, multi-sectoral 3 , high-profile Third Air Quality Management Plan
(AQM-III) was published on February 11, 2002, which provided the strategic framework to

the Environmental Program (2002-2006) of the City. The corresponding Plans of the State of Mexico are: the
Institutional Program of Medium Term (2000-2005) that integrates all the specific transport programs, the Sectorial
Urban Development Program (1999-2005), and the Environmental Protection Program (1999-2005).

guide necessary immediate interventions, and to further define, the goals and priorities, while
identifying barriers and required reforms. Priority under the AQM-III was given to efforts to
reduce particulates and ozone, both of which had shown to have unsustainable impacts on health
and the environment. The plan established goals for the ten-year duration of the program in
quantitative form. The plan identified the transport sector as a priority area and the adoption of
transport corridors as a means to promote a modal shift to reduce its carbon footprint.

The Comprehensive Transport Plan of the MCMA (2002 - 2006) called for: a) gradual
elimination of subsidies to the transport sector and restructuring of the fare system, b) integration
of the transport system with the State of Mexico and promotion of modal shift through the
development of metropolitan corridors; c) strengthening of the public transport system through
the development and implementation of bus priorities; d) reduction in the environmental load of
the transport sector into the MCMA air shed; and e) support to technology improvements in the
transport sector through the introduction of better bus and rail technologies.

Promotion of a modal shift was a central part of the government's strategy. The key
measure under consideration was the development of transport corridors on which high capacity,
low polluting vehicles would operate. These corridors were being conceived as measures that
would make more efficient use of infrastructure and move passengers in an integrated mode with
the metro at higher speeds, lower costs per passenger and lower emissions per passenger
kilometer and, at the same time, alleviate traffic congestion. The modal shift was expected to
contribute to a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases per passenger kilometer. A key
element in the promotion of the modal shift would be the intended introduction of low emission,
low carbon emitting vehicles. New-technology buses were also considered for the busway
corridors, but first there was a need to obtain solid information on which to base the decision.
The government conceived the air quality and transport policy as complementary elements that
should facilitate the improvement of transport conditions in the City.

Rationale for Bank Assistance:
The Bank involvement would bring together an extensive experience and technical leadership on
public-transport and air pollution issues and their linkage to climate change. The Bank's policy
dialogue with the transport, environment and climate authorities was based on extensive
expertise on the subject. Bank experience relating to urban climate change strategy, transport
regulatory framework and business structure, carbon finance and BRT deployment as well as the
provision of several support tools (PHRD, PDF B, GTF, Carbon Finance, GEF) were key assets
in the implementation of the project. The Bank assisted the formulation of the AQM-III through:
(a) support to the preparation of the 1998 emissions inventory, (b) quantification of the health
impacts associated with poor air quality, (c) formulation of harmonization measures that could
                                                      4
jointly address local air quality issues and emissions of greenhouse gases (climate change), (d)
modeling of the air quality in the metropolitan area and modeling of the measures, and (e)
economic assessment of alternative courses of action (alternative control scenarios). In 2002,
based on these studies, the Ministry of Environment of Mexico City together with the World
Bank began to develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing greenhouse gas emissions in the
city on the basis of a harmonization effort that could also result in reduction of local pollutants.

Global Operation Strategy/program objective addressed by the Project:
The project was consistent with the objectives of GEF Operational Program 11: Promoting
Environmentally Sustainable Transport (OP 11). Under the OP 11, a first approach would
promote the application, implementation, use and dissemination of commercial and near-
commercial climate-friendly technologies where a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would
result. GEF would also support awareness building, assessment and analysis, institutional reform
and strengthening, policy adjustments, regulatory measures and strategic transport and land-use
planning. Information dissemination and public awareness campaign would be integral to
widespread successful examples to raise the acceptance of climate friendly transport options.

                                     through the intended reduction in carbon emission intensity as well
                                     as promote a more efficient (less congested) system along the

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective was to contribute to the development of policies and
measures that would assist in a long-term modal shift toward climate-friendly, more efficient and
less polluting, less carbon intensive transport in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA).
Specifically, the project would support part of a 10 year multi-sector program by the
metropolitan authorities (State and City), outlined in the Third Air Quality Management Plan
(AQM-III 2002-2010) that would seek to contribute to improvements in air quality in the
MCMA through the reduction in the emission of criteria pollutants, therefore reducing human

                                                  5
exposure and improving health indicators for the large area population. The program would
focuse on reductions in emissions of particulate matter, ozone precursors and emissions of
greenhouse gases from mobile and fixed sources in the MCMA, of which the transport sector had
been shown to be a large contributor. The GEF project made part of the larger effort to achieve
these reductions and harmonize said efforts with investments that would mitigate greenhouse
gases from the transport sector. The project would promote the introduction of climate-friendly
measures and technologies that would contribute to the sustainability of the transport sector.

Key performance indicators: (see Annex I)
a) Harmonization of sector planning in the environment, transport and urban development as it
relates to air quality measures;
(b) Adoption and initiation of a Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan in transport and
associated measures;
(c) Adoption of organizational and barrier removal measures to facilitate the implementation of
sustainable climate friendly transport strategies;
(d) Development and execution of a sound, scientifically designed test protocol of global
relevance capable of yielding emissions and cost data of use for better decision making about
this type of air pollution abatement measures;
(e) Incorporation of climate change issues in the design and operation of transport projects in the
MCMA;
(f) Increased use of high capacity vehicles, non-motorized modes of transport as well as the
increased public awareness of the advantages of transport corridors and climate friendly
technologies; and
(g) Effective project management.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The original GEO and performance indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The actions promoted through the project would ultimately benefit the population of the MCMA
by contributing to the harmonization and implementation of policies that result in direct
reduction in exposure to criteria pollutants through the reduction of airborne pollutants and
reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. When implemented at a commercial scale, the
emissions reductions and improvement of air quality would result in improvements in health
indicators that would benefit the population at large and the most vulnerable groups (children
and the elderly).Also drivers of private cars would benefit from decongestion as a result of modal
shift and more efficient operation of buses on the roads. The riders of public transportaion
would benefit from reduced fares and expanded and efficient services provided by METROBUS.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)



                                                6
Component 1. Harmonization of sector strategies on air quality issues and Integrated Climate
Action Plan for Transport (CAP) in the MCMA ($0.8 million with a $0.4 million GEF grant).
This component would support efforts to: a) facilitate the process of integration of strategies
between the air quality (the air quality management plan), urban development plans (land use
plan) and transport sector plans in order to facilitate the adoption of harmonized policies on the
air quality; b) assess urban development models as linked to the process of air quality
management, review travel forecasting model used by SETRAVI and model interactions of
transport activity with land use; and c) assist in the development, evaluation and monitoring of
the Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan as it relates to the transport sector.

Component 2. Definition of an enabling environment to facilitate the implementation of
sustainable transport strategies ($4.8 million with a $2.9 million GEF grant). The project
would support 1) a review of management and business organization measures in order to
promote the adoption, design and use of BRT infrastructure, including a system of business
organization, the concessions for specific bus line operations and the structuring of integrated
fares; 2) technical assistance to identify, improve and facilitate the adoption of economic
incentives and regulatory system reforms required to overcome barriers to adoption of high
capacity and non-motorized transport. The reform of public transport regulations for the
proposed corridors was supported; 3) definition of an institutional framework for the corridors
including the integration with the metro and measures to promote metro rider-ship; 4) an
assessment of organizational measures proposed by the Mexico City Authorities to improve air
quality and public transport efficiency. The studies were expected to have a metropolitan
character; 5) an action plan for non-motorized transport to promote the use of bicycles as a mode
of transport and to divert commuters from motorized modes, especially private cars. The
expected outputs of this component would facilitate the adoption of measures required to
implement the corridors which would be funded under the proposed Second Air Quality and
Transport Project.

Component 3) Field Test of Climate-Friendly High Capacity Vehicles ($4.8 million with a
GEF grant of $1.6 million). This component would support a comparative pilot field test for
alternative bus and fuel technologies (hybrid and CNG) and modern and standard diesel vehicles
to test the comparative and absolute technical, economic, and environmental viability and
climate advantages under typical operations in the MCMA. The testing vehicles would operate
on a route, chosen to represent the average conditions of the metropolitan area, in terms of
supply, demand, physical and topographic characteristics, and service providers. The buses
would be operating on normal conditions, and their emissions would be regularly measured
under a scientifically designed and statistically representative test protocol.4 The test was aimed
at: (a) developing a scientifically test protocol adapted to Mexico City's conditions that can
produce significant data on: emission reductions, fuel efficiency, and indicators of operating and
maintenance costs, (b) using the results of the pilot test to simulate the level of reductions in
local and global pollutants that could be obtained assuming various scenarios of adoption of

  The test protocol, including sample size, were designed during project preparation by STE with assistance from MIT,
University of West Virginia, the University of Toronto, and the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of
Berkeley). This field test would consist of real time measurement of the following parameters: (a) emissions (local and global)
resulting from current and anticipated driving cycles, (b) real operating costs, (c) fuel efficiency per type of vehicles, and other
indicators of sustainable transport with assistance from an ad-hoc high level steering committee with significant experience from
institutions such as MIT.

                                                                 7
these technologies, and (c) enabling cost-effectiveness and possibly cost-benefit analysis to
determine the extent or rate to which the adoption of these technologies is justified compared to
other air quality measures. The test was linked to other components in that it complemented
regulatory and institutional activities that would enable the development of corridors with the
examination of alternative buses to be used in the corridors, to reduce GHG emissions in the
transport system. This component also included the provision of an essential framework for
evaluation of alternative vehicle options. The project would fund the cost of the testing and
monitoring protocols including the buses and the operation and maintenance costs.

Component 4. Technical assistance and training for incorporation of climate change and air
quality considerations in the design and analysis of transport strategies (US$0.8 million;
funded with a US$0.4 million GEF grant). This component's objective was to enhance capacity
to incorporate climate and environmental considerations in the design of transport projects.
Technical assistance, capacity building and training would be provided in the following aspects:
a) Review and support to the restructuring of legal functions for SETRAVI as related to transport
planning;
b) Cost-benefit analysis and modeling using inter-alia, the data produced by the field test and
including considerations of infrastructure costs, and local and global environmental impacts,
using the data produced by the field test (component c). These assessments were to include the
comparative cleaner bus test and the metropolitan transport corridors. The benefits and costs of
these measures were to be compared with the benefits and costs of rationalizing existing
infrastructure;
c) Development of methodologies for measurement and verification of emissions from
Metropolitan Area public ground transport, including provision of training to bus operators,
mechanics, and maintenance staff on the operation of the buses used in the pilot field test;
d) Training to transfer knowledge about testing procedures and potential of tested technologies,
such as training for contracting and coordinating market surveys and institutional capacity
building for the executing agency (SMA); and
e) Review and development of emission standards and transport regulations proposals to be
applied in the Metropolitan Area.
The outcomes of this component would be used also for the establishment of the corridors.

Component 5. Public Awareness and Dissemination ($0.3 million, $0.165 million GEF grant).
This component was to support the design of a public campaign with respect to the impacts of
sustainable transport strategies on climate change, other environmental and health impacts,
outlining the advantages and objectives of transport corridors as well as benefits from the use of
high capacity vehicles and non-motorized modes of transport. This component would also
support the dissemination of technical information produced by the project and will promote and
finance workshops and stakeholder meetings.

Component 6. Project Management ($ 0.7 million, $0.335 million GEF grant). This component
supported the management of the project activities, including monitoring and evaluation. The
project would finance management costs in the form of consultancy services and travel. The
implementation agency was the SMA of the City.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Overall, quality at entry was highly satisfactory. The most important success factors during
project preparation included:

A thorough project preparation process gave the project a solid technical and institutional
base. The World Bank provided three grants (through its Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD), GEF and the German Trust Fund) in support of project preparation.
These grants were coordinated through the SMA and the Federal District Government's
Secretariat of Transportation and Roads (SETRAVI). Its main objectives were to: (a) define the
strategic public transportation corridors that were most viable in the MCMA, providing financing
for the basic design of the first corridor to be implemented (Insurgentes Avenue), including an
assessment of environmental and social impacts; and (b) strengthen institutional capacity for
carrying out these projects as well as for strengthening the management of the financial schemes
that will enable the implementation of projects included in PROAIRE 2002­2010. The PDF B
supported two types of studies: 1) assessment of the global nature of the air quality issues in the
MCMA and; 2) assessment of specific alternative to address the emission of GHG. Under the
global assessment, the PDF B supported an energy balance for the MCMA, a GHG inventory,
and an assessment of energy intensity of economic activity.The preparation grants together with
decisions and assessments undertaken by the Government constituted the basis for the project.
The analysis of impacts of the corridors on job generation and any potential safeguard issues was
also undertaken.

All these studies were instrumental in defining the project: the energy inventory identified the
transport sector as the key user of fuels in the MCMA, and identified type of fuels used. The
GHG inventory led to the quantification of GHG by each economic activity, identifying the
volume and type of GHG released by the transport sector and confirming its character as key
source of GHG. The energy intensity study revealed the increase in carbonization of the transport
sector. Under the specific activities studies, the PDF B revealed the barriers that faced the
modernization of the transport sector and the introduction of new technologies. Finally the
efforts undertaken during 1999-2002 as part of sector work and provided the framework for the
Bank's further cooperation with the MCMA and particularly for the project.

The implementation arrangements were fully adequate to address the consideration of
climate concerns into transport projects. Given the contribution of the transport sector to air
quality issues and to the emission of GHG, and the long term involvement of the SMA in
addressing air quality, it was adequate to consider the SMA as the executing agency in close
coordination with the Electric Surface Transport System (STE) which operates trolleys of

                                                9
Mexico City. At the local level, the SMA is responsible for the implementation of Climate
Change policy of the Federal District in coordination with federal authorities. SMA and STE
helped identify the project at the beginning of 1999, and actively participated in the preparation
and supervision of the preparatory studies. Their technical leadership in the project, their close
coordination with the Federal District's transport authorities and the support of the co-financiers
(including World Resources Institute, Shell Foundation, bus manufacturers and fuel suppliers)
strengthened the mainstreaming of environmental concerns into the Federal District's transport
sector planning and enabled an integral approach in the implementation of the project.

The government demonstrated a strong commitment to the project. Right from the
beginning the project received strong support from the local and federal governments as
demonstrated by the inclusion of the project among the administration's strategic priorities and
sector programs. With the SMA the project had a local champion that was able to address
barriers to the implementation of sustainable transport strategies and that achieved strong
cooperation with the different sectors in that regard. The project was prepared with the
participation of the SMA, SETRAVI and the STE and counted with the continuous support of
private agencies as well as sustainable transport NGOs and counted with the attention of the
Mayor of the city who was routinely briefed and met with the project implementation unit and
bank representatives during the implementation of the project.

A long term cooperation on air quality and transport issues between the Mexico City
authorities and the Bank. The partnership with Mexico City started at a time (early 1990s)
when air pollution was of growing concern and gradually extended into climate issues. The
Federal was in fact a pioneer in acknowledging climate concerns and recognizes the catalytic
effect that the World Bank had in assisting in harmonizing the air quality and climate agendas.
The need to develop information and tools to tackle the problem in a comprehensive manner led
the City to develop integrated air quality management plans. The AQM-III (2002), in part
supported by the Bank, brought a multisectoral, long-term approach that could link air quality
efforts to climate change issues and provide the required scientific and analytical basis.




                                                10
Under the AQM-III, cooperation with the Bank resulted in an assessment of economic
consequences of the failure to address air quality issues in the metropolitan area, the review of
opportunities for harmonization of air quality and climate change concerns for the city, and the
development of modeling tools to simulate air quality in the metropolitan area. The information
and tools developed, as well as efforts made in parallel by other groups, enabled the launching of
specific efforts to address the combined challenges posed by air quality and climate change in
the city. These efforts ultimately led to the formulation and approval of the first transport and
climate operation under GEF financing worldwide (Mexico: Introduction of Climate-friendly
Measures in Transport--PIMAAT, P059161).

Inclusion of lessons learned in project design:
The design of the project was built upon the experience and lessons learned from the Bank's
long-standing involvement in air quality issues in Mexico. The project design took into account
the following lessons:

Air pollution is a long-term problem that requires a long-term response. The Mexican
Government had recognized the need for a long term strategy to address the issues caused by air
pollution (PICCA and PROAIRE) and accordingly had committed to the development of long
range plans, the first of which covered a 5 year period in the City. To assist in this program, the
World Bank needed to continue to have a long-term commitment that matches the time
requirements needed to secure sizable and permanent improvements in air quality. A long-term
vision and concomitant goals needed to be set, to guide removal of barriers and promote short-
term measures. The support of a local climate change strategy, an enabling environment for bus
corridors, the generation of data on alternative bus technologies for decision making, as well as
technical assistance and dissemination of lessons learned represent long term responses by
creating the framework for sustainable transport measures.

Planning for the long-term, however, requires flexibility. Previous experience had shown that,
despite the best planning efforts in the preparatory stage, adjustments required in air quality
management activities would only become evident during their implementation. The project
design built in a sufficient degree to flexibility to account for political and technological changes
and to support at the same time long term measures combining the transport and the local and
global air quality agendas.

Wide participatory approach is required. A participatory approach, incorporating public opinion
in the project, is required to establish legitimacy of the project. Widespread implementation of
the proposed measures is also critical in order to achieve the desired results. The project
considered a broad participation early on by establishing a technical committee to provide
overall technical guidance that included representatives from the government agencies, from the
private sector as well as from NGOs and technical, component specific working groups. The
multi-sectorial composition of these working groups and of the project implementation unit
helped complement and address different sectorial perspectives. Furthermore, a lot of emphasis
was placed on the dissemination of results throughout project implementation and on the
incorporation of public opinion through the realization of several workshops and seminars.

The Bank's involvement should continue to be used for its catalytic effect. The World Bank
catalyzed the involvement and the participation of development banks and agencies, the private

                                                 11
sector, NGO's and foundations and research and training centers in the project design as well as
during project implementation. The Bank mobilized technical and financial support and helped
the exchange of lessons learned from other cities that had already gained experience with BRT
systems. The project included dissemination efforts of the results and experiences obtained
through the implementation of its components.

Local air management matters from a global perspective. Local air pollution issues and global
concerns are linked. Local programs may contribute to global benefits. Major environmental and
economic benefits can be achieved through a well-implemented reform of bus services. The
project's focus on improving air quality through improving public transport services (transport
being one of the main contributor to the local and global pollution) offered simultaneously local
and global benefits as demonstrated by the GHG emission reductions and the reduction in
exposure to local pollution measured as part of the project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable) .

Implementation was highly satisfactory. There were no major changes or restructuring of the
project. The project was never at risk status. Success factors during project implementation
included:

Solid technical and administrative implementation arrangements and efficient coordination
mechanisms ­ The project was executed by the SMA with the support of the STE. The SMA
organized a technical committee with the representation of the agencies of the government of
Mexico City, represented by the Secretary of SMA and SETRAVI, the State of Mexico, the
Federal Government, and the World Resources Institute, which, through the Center for
Sustainable Transport, assisted in the planning and coordination of the execution of the project.
The technical committee provided guidance to the project implementation unit, located inside the
SMA. An Advisory Board was set up to advise on technical/scientific and social matters.

Furthermore, the SMA created in support of the technical committee and for continuous
technical support five working groups associated to the project's components. These working
groups provided key technical inputs and were responsible for defining the technical
characteristics of the supported project activities, and for the development of TORs, the technical
supervision and evaluation of the supported studies and activities. These working groups were
divided into the following topics: legal, institutional, technical, pre-payment schemes, financial,
urban, social and communication, negotiation schemes, non-motorized transport, field test,
carbon finance, and full fuel cycle. The PIU operated in a very satisfactory and responsive way,
provided the Bank on a regular basis with detailed progress reports and achieved the majority of
the pre-defined objectives. Coordination arrangements between the project actors, the financial
intermediary and the Bank were adequate.

Supportive disposition by relevant authorities ­ A key aspect for the project's success was the
strong support by the secretary of environment and the effective involvement of the highest city
and transport authorities in the project. In addition, the BRT system supported through the
project became a priority for the Federal District's past administration and continues to be one
for the current administration. This is reflected in the planned corridor expansion program and in

                                                12
the actions identified under the city-wide Climate Change Action Strategy and Program. The
favorable disposition of the deciding authorities led to a rapid implementation of the first BRT
system with associated funding.

Implementation of the first BRT corridor on the emblematic Insurgentes avenue: The
selection of the Insurgentes avenue resulted in a great success and has considerably improved the
image of public transport in the city. Surveys indicate high satisfaction with the system and
confirm benefits associated with BRTs such as time savings, higher security, reduced exposure
to local pollution and accessible fare system. At project start experiences with BRTs were still
limited and the project was seen as a tool to test the BRT system in the conditions of Mexico
City. Furthermore, climate change and air quality considerations were not yet fully integrated in
transport sector planning and decision making. The executing agency was first considering the
implementation of the BRT system on a route in the outskirts of the City. The considered
Tlahuac corridor located in the south of the city had limited connection to other transport modes,
limited impact on the city´s overall transit patterns and an overall limited visibility. However, as
a result of a continuous dialogue between the government agencies, the Bank, strategic partners
(e.g. Centre for Sustainable Transport) and BRT system experts, the focus changed to
accelerating the learning experience with this type of transport systems and to demonstrating the
priority given to public transport by the government.

An emblematic avenue was chosen as a consequence with a significant demand, strong
interaction with the metro system, limited number of bus operators, and a strong visibility. The
selected Insurgentes avenue was at the project start operated mainly by individual owner-
operators of small buses organized under the "Ruta 2" that competed for customers within the
market, and their day's pay depended upon passengers carried. While this system had led to high
frequencies it had also led to a dramatic oversupply of poorly maintained old buses, slow speeds
due to congestion, and ultimately to higher-than-necessary fares as well. The accidents,
congestion, pollution and GHG emissions caused by this system affected quality of life and
productivity, and the effect was particularly harsh on the urban poor, who were transit-dependent
and live far away from jobs and services.

Successful negotiation process over the development of a BRT with Insurgentes bus
operators: One of the important project challenges was the negotiation with the private bus
operators of the Insurgentes avenue. At project start, the Insurgentes avenue was operated by the
public transport operator RTP and by individual owner-operators of small buses organized under
"Ruta 2". In order to achieve a successful implementation of the BRT system it was necessary to
negotiate with the private operators and to achieve their integration in the new transport system.
This process was led by the Federal District's secretaries of transport (in charge of issuing
transport concessions) and of environment and resulted in the acceptance of the private bus
operators to change their small bus (microbus) concessions against articulated buses concessions.
Furthermore the private bus operators were invited to participate as operators of the Insurgentes
corridor and created the Corridor Insurgentes Company (CISA) in that regard. The Insurgentes
corridor operates today with a 75% participation of CISA and a 25% participation of RTP. The
private bus operators benefit today from considerably improved working conditions and from
higher and more stable revenues.

A few aspects at project entry led to implementation delays:


                                                13
While the bulk of activities were completed on time, the project was extended twice (6 and 3
months). Factors that caused delays in the completion of some studies were related to the
procurement processes and procedures. The implementation agency identified 15 steps between
the developments of the TORs until the conclusion of a given contract. They assessed that it took
an average time of 6-7 months to finalize these arrangements. The process was further
complicated by the three different norms of the Federal Government, the Federal District
government, and the World Bank.

On the substance, the involvement of the State of Mexico was limited considering that the focus
was on the metropolitan area. Also, there were political differences between the state and the
metropolitan administrations. Even though the authorities of the State of Mexico were permanent
invitees to the technical committee which met twice a year, their participation in strategic
decisions was of limited nature. However, information and lessons generated through the project
were continuously shared with the State of Mexico. And the Insurgentes corridor has
significantly benefited the transit of passengers from the State of Mexico who would travel to the
City. Cooperation between both administrations has improved considerably recently.

The project was also going to support non-motorized transport and to promote metro ridership.
Under Component 2, a non-motorized transport campaign was designed. However due to time
constraints, this campaign was not implemented. But the City is committed to carry it out under
the "plan verde" promoted by the city. The city was also able to support a variety of non-
motorized transport measures with own funds. Progress with these measures include creation of
biocycle ways (Ciclovias), bicycle parking, pedestrian walkways. With regard to the Metro the
project did not result in analyzing options to promote the ridership. The Insurgentes corridor is
however crossing five metro lines and operates in a complementary manner. Also, the metro
system authorities are involved in the corridor system planning to ensure an integrated approach.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The system for monitoring and evaluating project performance was implemented as described in
the PAD and resulted in keeping implementation on track and in identifying and resolving
critical issues affecting the achievement of desired outputs and outcomes. As per the design of
the system, the indicators identified in the Project Design Summary (Annex 1 of the PAD) were
reported on by the Project Implementation Agencies, were discussed by regular supervision
missions, and were the focus of the assessments conducted as part of the Mid-Term Review and
the final evaluations done at the end of the project.

The indicators defined at appraisal for the project for all its objectives were realistic and tangible.
All the indicators are considered appropriate and useful to the process for assessing the progress
towards achieving the project's objectives.

The monitoring and evaluation system included reporting requirements by the implementing
agencies on a frequent basis to the project team. This entailed the development of a Design and
Construction Summary Report of the BRT, bi-annual operational summary reports,
dissemination and training reports, and strategic documents developed as part of the project
activities (final field test report, local climate change action strategy and program, emission


                                                  14
reduction reports). The reports were delivered on time and in a satisfactory manner to the Bank
through the financial intermediary, Banobras.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
The project was rated category C. The project focused on climate change-related policy and
regulatory reform and the development of a Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan. The only
activity with a potential environmental impact was the comparative field test of buses. However,
the field test involved established routes, did not require any new works and therefore did not
involve resettlement. The only environmental issues were related to standard maintenance of the
vehicles. No financial reports are pending. All the audit reports were submitted and accepted by
the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

City-wide Climate Change Action Strategy and Program:
The project resulted in the development of the City-wide Climate Change Action Strategy, the
first of its kind in Latin America. The subsequent Mexico City Climate Action Program
represents the operational tool of the strategy and defines concrete policy and on the ground
actions in the field of climate change for the period 2008-2012. First advances of the climate
action program in the transport sector include:

    Adoption of a city-wide BRT system, based on the successful experience of the Insurgentes
    BRT sponsored through the project. The expansion plan for METROBUs calls for a total of
    10 corridors to be implemented over a period of 10 years. Already by mid 2009, a second
    corridor had been inaugurated (Eje 4) which successfully integrated all the lessons learned
    during the formulation, design and construction of Insurgentes.

    Design of an energy saving plan for the metro consisting of 1) installation of illumination
    systems powered by solar energy in the metro's maintenance facilities leading to a saving of
    3,000 MWh/year; 2) installation of efficient illumination in metro stations representing a
    saving of 33,000 MWh/year; 3) realization of improved train operation and modernization of
    system reducing the energy consumption by 65,000 MWh/year. The full implementation of
    these measures would represent a saving of 10.95% of the yearly energy consumption of the
    metro system.

    Non motorized transport: The objective is to increment the percentage of trips realized by
    non motorized transport from 1% to 5% by 2012. In 2009, the federal district's government
    will build 21km of bike lanes and bike parking facilities in 5 metro stations. 5 The plan
    includes also the installation of 1000 bike parking facilities in streets and public spaces, as


5
 In Insurgentes Corridor, 5 bicycle parkings are constructed in Altavista, Revolución, Reforma, Glorieta de
Insurgentes, and Sonora Stations.

                                                        15
   well as a public bike provision system with a total of 1500 bikes distributed strategically in
   51 stations. The totality of these measures is expected to lead to a reduction of 24,479 tCOe
   per year.

   Taxi substitution program: Mexico City has a fleet of 130,000 taxis of which 32% have been
   more than 10 years in use. A program has been designed to substitute the oldest taxi vehicles
   by providing the owner of the concession with 15,000 Mexican pesos in exchange for the
   vehicle and its destruction. In 2008, 35,043 vehicles were replaced through this program
   which represents an annual saving of 41 million liter of fuel and a reduction of 100,083
   tCO2e.

   Microbus substitution program: There are currently 28,000 microbuses in operation of which
   20,000 have surpassed their "useful life". Similar to the taxi substitution program the owner
   of the buses receive 100,000 mexican pesos in exchange for their vehicle and in order to take
   a credit to buy a bus certified with EPA 2004. In 2008, 305 have been replaced.

   Trolleybus corridor: One of the actual trolleybus lines will be converted into a corridor which
   will only operate with trolleybuses avoiding the operation of diesel buses. The resulting
   emission reductions are estimated at 28,000 tCO2e/year.

METROBUS and corridor (BRT) system:
The project resulted in the creation of METROBUS and the implementation of the first BRT
corridor. The institution and the BRT system operate in a very satisfactory manner. This
successful experience has led to the expansion of the BRT system (Eje 4 Sur ­ Line 2) and is
now also being replicated in several other cities in Mexico. One of the main commitments of the
city's current administration is the expansion of the METROBUS corridor net to a total of 200
km by 2012. The World Bank is currently preparing the Urban Transport Transformation
Program (UTTP) supported through an IBRD loan and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) with
the objective to help Mexican cities to the transformation of urban transport toward a lower
carbon growth path. Considered measures include the development of integrated transit systems
(mass transit corridors and ancillary investments) and the promotion of low carbon bus
technologies and scrapping of buses. This program is expected to be effective by December 2009
and incorporates the lessons learned from the GEF project.

Field test: The field test protocol continues to be applied to buses in order to test their
performance in terms of local and global emissions, and their operation and maintenance cost. In
support of these tests the RAVEM equipment purchased through the project is being used for on
board emission measurements of buses. The data generated through the field test which has been
published and disseminated supports decision making processes on alternative bus technologies.

Institutional Capacity: The SMA has a very committed and dynamic climate change team that
has been key for the development of the city-wide climate change action strategy and program,
and for its implementation. However, considering the dimension of the task to deal with the
climate change mitigation and adaption agendas in Mexico City and the limited available
funding, the team would require further institutional strengthening and support in the prompt
implementation of the identified priority measures under the strategy. The SMA indicated strong
interest in continuing the collaboration with the Bank in that regard.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The MX introduction of climate friendly measures in transport project now fully implemented,
has yielded some very significant results. Key outcomes of the project include 1) the
harmonization of sector plans merged into a city-wide climate change action strategy; 2) the
creation of a regulatory and business environment that enabled the development of Mexico
City's first transport corridors (bus rapid transit systems); and 3) a field test of alternative bus
technologies.

   1) The first city-wide Climate Change Action Strategy in Latin America, with goals,
      timetables, programs identified, and budget requirements, was formulated, designed and
      completed and published as a result of the project. The strategy reflects a commitment by
      the Mexico City Government to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG), in synergy with local
      policies for reduction of local criteria pollutants, within the context of the UNFCCC and
      the Kyoto protocol and as a result of the harmonization of sector policies and climate
      concerns.
   2) An enabling environment to facilitate the implementation of sustainable surface transport
      strategies was discussed, defined and enacted. The GEF project was instrumental in
      causing reforms to the policy, institutional, and regulatory framework for the transport
      sector in the city. The core of the reforms was enabled by the program to develop the
      BRT System. This is a remarkable achievement, as it involved the modernization of
      regulations and policies and their approval by the body politic of the city.
   3) The support provided by the project through the modernization of the regulatory and
      policy framework was essential to the creation of METROBUS, a decentralized public
      entity with independent legal status and independent management under the city´s
      secretary of transport (SETRAVI). By the end of the project the METROBUS operates 2
      corridors with a total length of 50 km, transporting 473,000 passengers every day and
      having transported 310 million people since operation started. These corridors reduced a
      total of 107 thousand tons CO2e between 2005 and 2008. Based on this successful
      experience the expansion of the corridor system to a total network of 200 km is planned
      under the current administration. Even more important, the measures developed as part
      of the METOBUS system to reduce the carbon footprint of the transport sector are central
      to the first Clean Technology Fund-supported project in the region, the Mexico: Urban
      Transport Transformation Program (UTTP). The project supported the formulation of
      one of the first methodologies, world-wide for the monitoring and everification of GHG
      emissions from the transport sector (NM0258).
   4) The project has satisfactorily supported the comparative pilot field test for alternative
      drives (standard, series and parallel drives) and fuels (standard diesel, low sulfur diesel,
      and CNG) to test the comparative and absolute technical, economic and environmental
      viability and climate advantages under typical operations in the MCMA. The test results
      have been reported and published and are being considered in the decision making
      process on alternative bus technologies to be operated under the corridor program as well
      as in the context of the proposed UTTP project.



                                                17
The project objective continues to be consistent with the City's current development priorities.
The project focused on transport and it's interference with climate and air quality issues. Both
agendas represent a priority for the current administration. With regard to transport, the current
administration places its priority on improving public transport services. On the climate side the
city has identified priority actions under the climate change strategy and program of which
several are already under implementation as described in the previous section.

The latest Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 6 identifies the following core themes for
Mexico: Accelerating Growth, Improving Competitiveness, Promoting social inclusion and
reducing poverty, Developing infrastructure and assuring energy security, Strengthening
institutions; and assuring environmental sustainability. Within this broad framework, the CPS
and the national development plan for promoting environmental sustainability mention its
intention to turn the concept of environmental sustainability into a transversal element of public
policies and assure that all public and private investments are compatible with environmental
protection. The project's achievements are completely in line with the CPS's core theme on
environmental sustainability, with its objectives and strategies. The project has been instrumental
in promoting the modal shift toward more efficient and less polluting, less carbon intensive
transport in Mexico City through the implementation of the first transport corridor. A
considerable reduction of GHG emissions and of exposure to local pollutants has been achieved
by the project.

The CPS indicates that the economic cost of environmental degradation is estimated at about 9
percent of GDP. This is said to represent a decline of 2 percentage points since the late 1990s.
Nearly 90 percent of this cost is reported to be due to air pollution. Mexico's National Institute of
Ecology, in collaboration with the Sustainable Transport Center, conducted a study to estimate
the impacts of the METROBUS operation on local pollutants. Concentrations of CO, PM2.5,
PM10, and benzene were measured before and after the implementation of the corridor. The
results of the measurements are summarized in the following table:

The project has demonstrated a feasible option to simultaneously address local and global air
pollution concerns and the improvement of the public transport system. At the same time the
successful implementation of the project served as a model for replication and has led to the first
carbon finance operation in the transport sector in Mexico and by the Bank. The Mexico City

Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit System Carbon Finance Operation (P082656) seeks to contribute
to reductions in local airborne pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions generated by the
transport sector in the MCMA. This operation is now in its fourth year of implementation and the
Bank is in the process of making the third payment for emission reductions.

The project continues to be consistent with both the GEF Operational Strategy (February 1996)
for short-term projects in the climate change focal area and with the GEF guidance (2001) for the
GEF Operational Program 11: Promoting the environmentally sustainable transport by
promoting the long-term shift towards low emissions and sustainable transport forms.

Mexico has played an important role in the Climate Change Convention and the subsidiary
meetings. It is the first country in Latin America to have submitted the Third National
Communication (November 11, 2006). At the same time Mexico City is the first city worldwide
to have developed a local climate change strategy which includes the transport sector among the
priority sectors for mitigation of GHG. Mexico is also one of the two largest emitters of GHG in
the region (1.5% of global GHG emissions 7 ) and a country that has shown substantial
vulnerabilities to the impacts from Climate Change.


3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The project emphasized the following measures in ground transport: (a) Modal shifts to more
efficient and less polluting forms of public and freight transport through measures such as traffic
management and avoidance and increased use of cleaner fuels; (b) Non-motorized transport; (c)
Fuel-cell or battery operated 2- and 3-wheelers designed to carry more than one person; (d)
(Hydrogen)-powered fuel cell or battery-operated vehicles for public transport and goods
delivery; (e) Internal combustion engine-electric hybrid buses; and (f) Advanced technologies for
converting biomass feedstock to liquid fuels. The project was particularly successful in
promoting the modal shift from small inefficient and polluting buses to articulated ones. Three
hundred fifty small buses were replaced by 102 articulated buses achieving accountable
reductions of 67,387 tCO2e in the first two years of operation. The replaced vehicles were
scrapped in order to avoid their use elsewhere and to achieve the intended GHG emission
reductions. In fact, the scrapping certificates are a condition for the payment of achieved
emission reductions. In addition to achieving the modal shift from inefficient small buses to
articulated ones, the BRT system resulted also in the modal shift from cars. The latest emission
reduction report indicates that 15 % have left their cars at home in order to use the BRT system.
In addition to that the project promoted the use of non motorized transport and realized the
testing of 3 hybrid buses in the operation conditions of Mexico City. As a consequence of this
experience and the availability of data on hybrid buses the Bank has facilitated a grant that will
support the introduction of a fleet of articulated hybrid buses in Mexico City. This grant has been
approved and the introduction of the fleet is expected for next year.

Sub-objective 1: Urban, transport and air quality plans and planning processes harmonized;
Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan and associated measures adopted and initiated. The
achievement of this sub-component was rated highly satisfactory. This rating reflects the fact that
the first citywide Climate Change Action Strategy in Latin America, with goals, timetable,
programs identified, and budget requirements, was completed and published in 2006 (SMA 2006
a copy is in the project files). The strategy represents a policy commitment to reduce GHG
emissions across sectors in synergy with policies designed to reduce local airborne pollution,
within the context of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. This initiative concentrates various
actions of the 2002-2006 Program of Environmental Protection for Mexico City implemented by
the SMA, particularly for the 2002-2012 Program for Air Quality Improvement for the
Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (PROAIRE) and for the program of Ecological
Restoration of Conservation Land in Mexico City.

The central tenet of the strategy is to seek reductions of GHG emissions through the
implementation of multi-sectoral measures designed to make better use of natural resources, the
regulation and efficient use of installed equipment, fuel substitution, and the use of new
technologies and alternative sources of energy. The strategy harmonizes development strategies
with the goals of a reduced carbon footprint and the adoption of adaptation measures. The
strategy seeks an increase in GHG sinks in the city through a reforestation program and better
land-use planning. It also includes an assessment of vulnerability to anticipated impacts of
climate change and actions to reduce vulnerability through the adoption of preventive measures.

The Government of Mexico identified several options in its local climate-change strategy in
order to mitigate greenhouse gases from the transport sector. These options include:

(i) the introduction of transport corridors, the regulation of public transport timetables, the design
of direct or express routes, and the promotion of cycle lanes. Among new measures to organize
traffic, the government identified the broadening and improvement of streets, the improvement
of the public transport network including exclusive bus lanes, the regulation of microbuses and

                                                 21
taxis, and the extension of the Metro network. The aim of these measures is to transport a high
number of passengers with the lowest possible fuel consumption. Other measures include
controlling of the number of circulating vehicles, and organizing taxis.
(ii) the use of fossil fuels with low carbon content such as compressed natural gas; the use of
renewable fuels including biodiesel;
(iii) the introduction of climate-friendly technologies such as hybrid, fuel cell, and electric
vehicles, and the renovation of the public transport fleet; and
(iv) the establishment of norms that allow emissions to be controlled.

The subsequent development of the Mexico City Climate Change Action Program (CCAP)
(2008-2012) supported through the project represents the operational tool of the strategy and
defines concrete priority policy and on the ground actions in the field of climate change. The
CCAP has two main objectives: the mitigation of GHG that consist in reducing 7 million t CO2e
between 2008 and 2012, and the integration of a climate change adaptation program for Mexico
City and its full functioning by 2012. The CCAP considers actions in 6 thematic areas: energy,
transport, water, waste management, adaptation, communication and environmental education.
These actions are divided into 26 mitigation actions, 12 adaptation measures, and 6
communication and education measures. The CCAP is complementary to the Federal District's
"plan verde" which represents a public policy tool oriented towards Mexico City's long term
sustainability.

Through active participation and consultation with project implementation representatives from
the urban planning, transport and environmental authorities, the Mexico City Climate Change
Action Program identified actions in the different sectors and has been adopted by the relevant
authorities, thus achieving harmonization of different sector strategies on air quality issues.

Sub-objective 2: Organizational and barrier removal measures (enabling environment) to
facilitate implementation of sustainable, climate friendly transport strategies identified and
action plan for non motorized transport designed. The achievement of this sub-component
was rated highly satisfactory. The main outcomes were the development of Mexico City's first
BRT system and the creation of the institution
METROBUS that manages the BRT system.
The efforts brought together through the GEF-
funded project were instrumental in causing
reforms to the policy, institutional, and
regulatory framework for the transport sector
in the city. A summary of these reforms is
presented in the table below. The core of the
reforms was enabled by the program to
develop the BRT System. These included the
necessary institutional, business management,
and regulatory improvements required to
operate the proposed corridors. Specifically,                                    Image: Metrobus
the support provided led to the creation of
METROBUS, a decentralized public entity

management and planning of the corridor program. It also monitors the program's performance
and assists in replicating the experience. METROBUS supervises the fare collection and
prepayment system. It contracted a specialized company to provide, install, and maintain the
necessary payment collection system. The city committed to the adoption of a reform program,
summarized below:

The operation of the corridor includes the following elements, which were developed taking into
account the experience with the Transmilenio BRT system in Bogota, Colombia:
(a) one entity in charge of administration, planning, and verification (METROBUS);
(b) two corridor operating companies (RTP and CISA) over Insurgentes Avenue under a well-
defined regulatory and management structure, representing a significant departure from the chaos
of a multiple small companies working under a loose regulatory structure;
(c) physical infrastructure for bus transport;
(d) a modern fare collection system; and
 (e) a private trust fund for revenue administration.

Key performance indicators of METROBUS:

To date METROBUS is operating two corridors (Line 1 and 2) with 81 stations, of a length of 50
km, with connections to several metro-lines. The project supported the development of Line 1
(Insurgentes). The corridors go through 9 out of the 16 delegations. The length of the corridors
is 30 km from north to south (line 1) and 20 km from west to east (line 2). Line 1 transports
350,000 passengers on a daily basis, and Line 2 transports 123,000 passengers, amounting to a
total of 473,000 passengers using the system every day. According to surveys 15% of the users
of the system have left their car at home in order to use METROBUS. To date METROBUS has
transported 310 million people with its BRT system.8

The METROBUS system has reduced a total of 107,257 tCO2e between 2005 and 2008, of
which 50,000 tCO2e are being reduced per year by line 1 and 20,000 tCO2e by line 2. In terms of
local pollution, the reduction of local pollutants emissions is estimated at 11,096 t per year
(1,108 t/year of CO; 9,709 t/year of hydrocarbons, 206 tNO2/year, and 1.27 t of PM smaller than
10 g). METROBUS includes access for disabled persons such gratuity of service, access ramps
to stations, tactile guides for blind people, same level access to buses from platforms, exclusive
spaces for wheelchairs, acoustic alarm system in buses, and elevators for wheelchairs. The
payment system is automatic with electronic cards. To date 4 million cards have been in use.

The successful creation of the enabling environment as well as the satisfactory operation of the
Insurgentes corridor have led to the plan to expand the system and to have a total of 200 km of
corridors in operation in Mexico City by the end of the current administration. The successful
experience is also feeding the development of the UTTP which seeks to contribute to the
transformation of urban transport in Mexican Cities toward a lower carbon growth path.

 An articulated bus is said to transport the equivalent of 126 cars based on car occupancy rates in Mexico. These
buses are certified with Euro IV and include 209 articulated and 12 bi-articulated buses.

The benefits of the operation of the Insurgentes corridors from the perspective of the different
beneficiaries can be summarized as follows:

For the user of the transport system:
    Time savings; Safer transfers and trips
    Improvement in urban image and in quality of life
    Health benefits through reduced exposure to local pollutants
    Better accessibility for people with disabilities; Affordability

For the transport operators:
    Integration into a formal business structure
    Change to a better planned, more competitive and profitable business
    Better working conditions and work security

For the government:
    More efficiency (organized fleets) and control of public transport
    Lower investment in comparison to other transport modes
    Development of a sustainable transport system
    Incentives for introduction of new technologies and alternative fuels
    Improved relationship with private bus operators
    Increased security and reduction in accident rates

Sub-objective 3: Field test demonstrates less polluting, climate friendly transport
alternatives; Decisions made on alternative transport are based on data from field tests.
The achievement of this sub-component was rated satisfactory. This component has achieved a
solid field test with a protocol that continues to be applied. Data generated through the test has
provided valuable information on the performance of alterative bus technologies in the

                                                  26
conditions of Mexico City and guide future decision making on technology selection.
Specifically data produced on hybrid bus performance has supported the successful approval of a
grant to introduce a fleet of articulated buses into Mexico City. The buses are expected to be
purchased by the end of 2010 (a copy of the results of the field test, published in 2007) are in the
project files.

Background:
Although there was information on alternative bus technologies and a growing amount of data on
field tests of new types of vehicles (most notably in New York, Toronto, and São Paulo),
information on operation under real conditions at Mexico City's altitude was not available.
Running a field test in Mexico City was considered timely and complementary to existing
information on the basis of:
(a) the magnitude of the air quality problem;
(b) the recently completed comprehensive Third Air Quality Management Plan;
(c) the availability of a modeling tool, focused on the characteristics of the metropolitan area to
simulate and evaluate impacts of the proposed measures;
(d) the presence of bus manufacturers; and
(e) available data on local and greenhouse gas emissions (inventories) that provide the current
baseline.

The field test yielded data on emissions information for the different types of buses and also
provided data on bus operation and maintenance. This complemented and validated information
already available. The project supported the comparative pilot field test for alternative drives
(standard, series and parallel drives) and fuels (standard diesel, low sulfur diesel, and CNG) to
test the comparative and absolute technical, economic, and environmental viability and climate
advantages under typical operations in the MCMA. The testing vehicles were operated on a route
that was chosen to represent the average conditions of the metropolitan area in terms of supply,
demand, physical and topographic characteristics, and service providers. The buses operated
under normal conditions, and their emissions were regularly measured under a scientifically
designed and statistically representative test protocol. The field test consisted of real-time
measurement of the following parameters: (a) emissions (local and global) resulting from current
and anticipated driving cycles; (b) real operating costs; (c) fuel efficiency per type of vehicles,
and other indicators of significant experience from institutions such as MIT. The test was aimed
at:
(a) developing a scientific test protocol adapted to Mexico City's conditions that can produce
significant data on emission reductions, fuel efficiency, and indicators of operating and
maintenance costs;
(b) using the results of the pilot test to simulate the level of reductions in local and global
pollutants that could be obtained by assuming various scenarios of adoption of these
technologies; and
(c) enabling cost effectiveness and possibly cost-benefit analyses to determine the extent or rate
to which the adoption of these technologies is justified compared to other air quality measures.
The test was linked to other components in that it complements regulatory and institutional
activities that would enable the development of corridors with the examination of alternative
buses to be used in the corridors, to reduce GHG emissions in the transport system. A part of the
field test this component also included the provision of an essential framework for evaluation of
alternative vehicle options.

Test results
The dynamometer and online tests were conducted during 2005 and 2006 at the installations of
the STE and over the actual Insurgentes Avenue, prior to construction of the Bus Rapid Transit
System. Because the test fleet consisted of only a few vehicles per type and in many cases for
advanced technologies a single vehicle was tested, caution should be exercised in extrapolating
the information obtained. The results have been reported and published (West Viriginia
University 2005; SMA 2006). The test results for the dynamometer clearly indicate advantages
in emissions of N2O, particulates, and CO2 for the hybrid parallel drive vehicle (the series drive
did not reach Mexico City on time for tests on the dynamometer) over the standard drive diesel
vehicles.

Figure summarizes the results of the dynamometer test on N2O for both cycles. The hybrid
parallel drive vehicle clearly outdistanced all other vehicles in the fleet. Figure 12 likewise
summarizes the corresponding results for PM10. Again, the hybrid vehicle had lower emissions
of particulates compared to the rest of the fleet.

Sub-objective 4: MCMA transport projects incorporate climate change issues in design and
operation. The achievement of this sub-component is rated satisfactory. This component focused
on strengthening the integration of climate change concerns in the planning of transport project
and on strengthening the capacity to quantify related local and global emission reductions. The
main result of this component was the development of a baseline methodology to account for the
emission reductions resulting from the operation of the Insurgentes corridor as well as of the Eje
8 corridor. The analysis was realized before the start of the construction and once the Insurgentes
corridor was operating. This methodology has been applied in the case of Insurgentes and has
served to quantify the emission reductions through the operation of the BRT system. The

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               29
methodology has undergone several changes due to the pilot character of the task and the
complex review process by the UNFCCC meth panel but latest review results indicate favorable
outcomes of the submitted methodology. Furthermore the component has resulted in
strengthening SMA's capacity in elaborating GHG emission inventories and in obtaining GHG
emission baselines. The staff in the area of inventories in the SMA (but also two representatives
of the State of Mexico) was trained in the realization of inventories and baselines of the main
GHG. The current administration demonstrates a high commitment to the reduction of local and
global airborne pollutants in transport projects and has the measurement tools in place to account
for the exact reduction potential of planned projects.

SETRAVI's legal review was done as part of the analysis for the creation of Metrobus. Cost-
benefit analysis and the environmental impact analysis were conducted as part of the design of
the Insurgentes Corridor BRT system. CC impacts assessment was done as part of the
preparation of the carbon finance operation.

Sub-objective 5: Better understanding of the potential of high capacity vehicles, non motorized
modes of transport as well as increased public awareness of the advantages of transport
corridors and climate friendly technologies. The achievement of this sub-component has been
rated satisfactory. This component has resulted in the publication of a variety of reports 9 of
which the following are of particular importance: 1) Field Test report; 2) Local climate change
strategy for Mexico City; 3) Local climate change action plan for Mexico City; and 4) Final
report of GEF introduction of climate friendly measures in transport. Furthermore, this
component contributed to the design of the non motorized transport campaign. The City is
commited to implement the campaign beyond the project life. Surveys conducted annually by
METROBUS indicate a high satisfaction of the users with the corridor system. (See Annex 6)

Sub-objective 6: Effective Project Management team established adequate for use in future
operations. The project has been executed in a satisfactory manner. The multi-disciplinary
composition and technical capacity of the working groups resulted extremely valuable for
achieving the project's objectives in an integral manner. The day to day operations of the project
were responsibility of the project implementation unit consisting of one general project
coordinator, and technical and administrative-financial coordination units. The PIU operated in a
very satisfactory and responsive way, provided the Bank on a regular basis with detailed
progress reports and achieved the majority of the pre-defined objectives. Coordination
arrangements between the project actors, the financial intermediary and the Bank were adequate.

3.3 Efficiency
An incremental cost analysis was done as a requirement of the GEF. The baseline scenario
assumed the continued investment and operation of diesel buses. The implementation of the
baseline scenario entailed costs estimated at US$4.1 million, while the GEF alternative incurred
costs estimated at US$12.2 million. The incremental costs associated with the implementation of
project were estimated at US$8.1 million. The GEF funded US$5.8 million of this as part of the
project. Other cofinancing sources funded the balance.

 The oficial gazette publicized the guidelines of the Metrobus operations: Gazette No. 98, September 24, 2004.
The establishment of the Insurgentes Corridor was publicized in Gazette No. 101, October 1, 2004. The creation of
Metrobus was publicized in Gazette No. 29, March 9, 2005.

                                                       30
The project supported the development of the enabling environment (barrier removal,
organizational measures) and field tests that are essential for the construction of the bus rapid
transit system. As a result, the BRT system of a total of 50km was successfully established.
Infrastructure costruction costs of Insurgentes Corridor are estimated at US$3.5 millon per km.
In comparison, those for Phase I of the TransMilenio system in Bogota, Colombia (a total of
41km) are reported at about US$210 million or US$5.0 million per km. (Ardila and Menckhoff,
2002). However, it needs to be taken into consideration that the unit cost involves many factors,
including not only project management, but also design, implementation, materials, labors etc.
which may significantly differ from each other.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

This rating reflects the fact that the project achieved the majority of its measurable outcome
indicators defined in the PAD and went even beyond some of the expected outcome indicators.
Specifically, the project supported the harmonization of sector planning in the environment,
transport and urban development as it relates to air quality measures; it supported the adoption
and initiation of the climate change action strategy for the city, in that regard the metropolitan
character of the plan remained limited due to the limited participation of the State of Mexico; it
achieved the adoption of organizational and barrier removal measures to facilitate the
implementation of sustainable climate friendly transport strategies as demonstrated by the
successful operation of the Insurgentes corridor and of the subsequent corridor on Eje 4 Sur; it
developed and executed a sound, scientifically designed test protocol providing emission and
cost data of use for decision making on alternative bus technologies; it reached the incorporation
of climate change consideration in the design and operation of transport projects; it led to the
increased use of high capacity vehicles, non-motorized transport modes as well as the increased
public awareness of the advantages of transport corridors and climate friendly technologies; and
finally it was managed in a satisfactory manner. The achieved results are already providing a
basis for follow up activities.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In Mexico s public transport services are mainly used by the poor who are transit-dependent and
live often far away from jobs and services. The project achieved the implementation of a cleaner,
more efficient and affordable transport system on the Insurgentes corridor thus directly
benefiting the poor. Furthermore the Insurgentes BRT has achieved a reduction in exposure to
local pollutants with impacts on the health of the users of the system.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Specifically, the support provided by the project led to the creation of METROBUS, a
decentralized public entity with independent legal status and independent management, under the
Secretary of Transport. METROBUS' primary focus is the management and planning of the

                                               31
corridor program. It also monitors the program's performance and assists in replicating the
experience. METROBUS supervises fare collection and prepayment systems. It contracted a
specialized company to provide, install, and maintain the necessary payment collection system.
METROBUS has managed the system in a very satisfactory manner and is also going to operate
the corridors under the expansion program. In addition to that METROBUS is today the project
manager for the carbon finance operation supported by the World Bank and has already
produced its third emission reduction report. Furthermore, the project achieved the operation of
the corridors by efficient transport operators (CISA was created in the context of the project by
the former private bus operators and covers 75% of the operation). A private trust fund has been
established for the administration, distribution and investments of the revenues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
The project should be considered the basis of the proposed CTF operation in Mexico (UTTP).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A project closing workshop was carried out on the 25th of March, 2009. This workshop focused
on the policies and measures achieved as a result of the project. The participation of high level
government officials demonstrates the success and the importance of the project outcomes to
them. (Mexico City's Secretary of Transport, Secretary of Transport, General Director for the
management of air quality in the SMA, General Director of Planning and Transportation,
Director of the Climate Change and CDM Program of the SMA. Three hundred people
participated in the workshop, and the detailed presentations can be found in the project files.

Conclusions from the workshop include 1) the importance of applied testing of technologies,
specifically of articulated and bi-articulated buses that are used by METROBUS. The testing
techniques resulted most adequate in economic and environmental terms; 2) the complications of
considering transport alternatives in a city like Mexico City. The implementation of proposals
and mechanisms represents a major challenge in order to convert the transport in a dignified
system for the inhabitants of Mexico City; 3) the challenges that climate change entails, not only
for Mexico City and its inhabitants, but worldwide. The projects and programs need to focus on
sustainability and mitigation of local and global pollutants; and 4) the importance and the success
of the PIMAAT in converting the Mexico City to a sustainable alternative transport modalities
and an example to be followed by other cities. (See Annex 6)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low. The risk that the development outcomes of the project will not be maintained is
very low.

Long term responses have been established through the project such as the development of the
first local climate change strategy which guides policies and actions in the field of climate
change and which started implementation. Furthermore, the enabling environment for transport
corridors remains stable and provide the framework for the expanded corridor system. The data
generated through the field test and the tools acquired (emission measurement tools) guide the
selection process on alternative bus technologies. Transport projects in Mexico City include
climate and local air quality considerations as integral parts in their planning and implementation.



                                                32
Future challenges include the strengthening of metropolitan considerations in transport programs
planning. Also, the climate change team inside the SMA requires further consolidation and
support in implementing its climate change strategies in the fields of mitigation and adaptation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The Bank performance at project entry was highly satisfactory. The project was well identified,
responsive to the request and needs of the country and consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), government priorities and the UNFCCC. The technical assistance
and appraisal process provided a thorough assessment that resulted in a smooth project
implementation. The implementation arrangements resulted adequate. The performance
indicators were realistic and useful for assessing the progress towards achieving the project
objectives. The support provided to the implementing agencies was adequate and issues and
potentials were identified and addressed on time.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team visited the project approximately twice a year. In addition to the review of
progress reports provided by the clients and to continuous interaction with the clients, the visits
further helped the team to address issues proactively and to support the achievements of project
objectives. At the same time the Bank team was flexible and proactive, developing during project
implementation the first transport carbon finance operation as a result of consideration of
emission reduction revenues right from the beginning in the project planning.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
This rating is based on the quality of preparation and supervision, and the experience and
proactivity of the Bank team. The clients also rated the performance of the Bank as satisfactory.
The technical and financial knowledge of the team was deemed very useful for project
implementation. The twice a year supervision missions by the Bank were just right to stay
abreast of implementation progress to guarantee an overall project supervision beyond desk
reviews of issued progress reports and continuous interaction with the client. The Bank support
was considered beneficial for the capacity building and dissemination activities. The
involvement of the Bank reassured the clients that the funds would be managed in a transparent
and efficient way. The clients however expressed some concerns that the bureaucracy of the
Bank would increase transaction cost because of lengthy and complex Bank procedures.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The government performance is rated highly satisfactory. The project set a precedent in dealing
with BRT projects in Mexico City and serves now as a basis for replication efforts. This rating

                                                33
reflects the fact that the project was able to develop the first Latin American city wide climate
change action strategy, to remove barriers to the implementation of the first BRT system in
Mexico City, to lay the foundation for the development of the first carbon finance operation in
transport in Mexico, to produce a solid field test and protocol that guides further bus testing as
well as the selection of alternative bus technologies, and finally to integrate of climate concerns
in the planning of transport projects in Mexico City and to raise awareness on climate change.
The implementing government agencies are credited with these achievements.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The performance of the climate change team inside the SMA has been excellent. They have led
the development of the climate change strategy and significant mainstreaming of climate change
concerns into other sector programs. Secretary of Transport (SETRAVI) has demonstrated their
commitment to establishment of Metrobus, the replacement of microbuses, the regulartory
framework for the new transport system (BRT). Electric Transport Services (STE) demonstrated
their technical capacity by successfully conducting the field tests and providing the necessary
logistics for the testing, e.g., space, fuel storage, etc.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: The overall performance of the overall borrower performance was satisfactory.
BANOBRAS was the financial intermediary. BANOBRAS appointed a core group of staff with
the required expertise to assist in the intermediation process. During the preparation and
supervision stages, BANOBRAS provided the necessary inputs. BANOBRAS also participated
in most field visits during supervision and was instrumental in providing information on the
status of accounts, contracting processes, including bidding, and procurement information on a
timely basis. Audits were done on a timely basis. The project did benefit from the participation
of BANOBRAS.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
The metropolitan character of the project remained limited. Although the project was
designed from a metropolitan perspective, the involvement of the State of Mexico which shares
the same transport and air quality related problems was limited. The project was not able to
overcome political differences between the Federal District´s and the State of Mexico´s
administrations. Future transport programs need to use tools that are independent from these
political differences in order to overcome state borders and to address common issues.

Before implementing the BRT system, it is essential to count with an integral transport
plan (ITP). Given that any major transport decision has a direct impact on land use, air quality
and climate, it is important that municipalities and deciding authorities are aware of the long-
term nature of these inter-relationships and plan accordingly. ITPs should address at least (i)
institutional reform in the transport sector; (ii) a traffic management component; (iii) a public
transport component; (iv) direct poverty impact component (access improvements to low-income
areas); (v) a transport infrastructure maintenance plan; (vi) environmental evaluation of the ITPs;
and (vii) climate change mitigation and local air quality considerations.

A suitable business environment for public transport is a requisite for sustainable gains in
environmental efficiency and performance. The case of Mexico City has demonstrated that the

                                                34
creation of an enabling environment is necessary before sustainable measures can be
implemented. The adequate regulatory, institutional and technical frameworks were in place
before starting construction and provide a solid base for the expansion of the system. Specifically
the creation of a stable institution for the management of the corridor, the involvement of private
bus operators, the new regulatory framework under which services are being provided, and the
structuring of an integrated fare represented success factors in the development of METROBUS.

The mainstreaming of the climate change agenda is key for its successful implementation.
The climate change team inside the SMA has undergone a considerable strengthening as a result
of the project and has been the main driver for the development of the local climate change
strategy. Also, significant mainstreaming of climate change concerns into other sector programs
has been achieved. However, in order to maintain these achievements it is key to count with a
consolidated team with sufficient resources to function and implement identified climate change
actions as well as with the integration of climate change considerations into the relevant sectors.

Broader lessons:

Sustainable transport programs are also key to reducing impacts on exposure to airborne
pollutants in urban areas. The health risks due to air pollution (specifically ozone and PM) are
quantified by estimating the relationship between the incidence of adverse health effects and air
quality. Data obtained as part of the efforts described in this document for Mexico City indicate
that obtaining air quality compliance for ozone and PM10 and key airborne pollutants (AQS1)
offers benefits of approximately US$2 billion per year, with high and low estimates of benefits
of some US$4 billion and US$400 million, respectively. This is a substantial health benefit that
needs to be considered when the benefits of transport sector improvements are examined. The
INE study has shown that the operation of METROBUS has significantly reduced exposure to
local pollutants by users of the METROBUS system. Further improvements in bus technologies
and fuel types will continue to reduce this exposure.

Bus rapid transit systems provide an emerging model of surface urban transport in Latin
America, typified by the experiences in Bogotá, Curitiba, and other cities, and starting to take
shape as well in Mexico City. This model seeks to optimize the use of public space and promote
gains in efficiency, safety, and environmental performance. These systems respond to the need
for cost-effective mass transport but also serve to advance the goals of low carbon footprint and
reduced loads of air toxics and local criteria pollutants, and complement investments already
made in subways and other mass transport systems. The widespread adoption of BRT systems in
Latin American countries and the associated reductions in emissions of local and global concern
stand in contrast with increases in the energy intensity of passenger transport in industrialized
North America. The experience of these systems should be of interest to urban planners and
policy makers in those countries for their potential application.

Mexico City is positioned for a citywide transport corridor approach. The successful
METROBUS pilot experience has demonstrated the feasibility of the BRT concept for the city
and provided important lessons learned for its replication. The programmatic approach is already
among the current administration's priorities, including the use of cleaner bus technologies.

Development of transport baseline methodologies needs to be further encouraged. To date
there are still very few approved transport baseline methodology. The availability of more

                                                35
methodologies would provide an additional incentive to move ahead faster with BRT concepts in
developing countries. The case of Mexico has demonstrated how the prospect of carbon finance
helped to surmount several barriers. However, efforts invested through the project have just
resulted in the approval of a transport baseline methodology by the CDM meth panel. This great
achievement will significantly benefit BRT and sustainable transport programs in Mexico and
worldwide .

Further field testing of bus technologies is needed for defining emission standards and for
the decision-making process on alternative bus technologies for public transport. The field
test has provided helpful data for the operation of alternative bus technologies under real
conditions at Mexico City's altitude. However, because the test fleet consisted of only a few
vehicles per type and in many cases for advanced technologies a single vehicle was tested,
further field testing is needed to strengthen the database for decision making on bus technologies
for public transport with major emission reduction potentials.

Introduction of new bus technologies and low carbon fuels needs to be encouraged to form
a larger share of the modal and fuel mix. The analysis of these systems should take into
account the economic benefits of avoided health and climate impacts. The proposed expansion of
METROBUS will correspondingly increase the net reduction in GHG in Mexico City. A 10-
corridor system has the potential to reduce annual emissions by between 300,000 and 500,000
tons per year, more if low carbon bus technologies (hybrid drives) are deployed. The
combination of modal shift and reduced congestion with low-carbon, low air toxic vehicles will
place the city at the forefront of developments in climate- and health-responsive BRTs
worldwide.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

BANOBRAS: In BANOBRAS's opinion, the World Bank's performance in the execution of
this project was satisfactory; however, it should be mentioned that the executor required more
time than the World Bank could give it, considering the origin of the grant funds. For
BANOBRAS, it has been a satisfactory experience to collaborate with the Government of the
Federal District, as the financial agent of the Federal Government, and with the World Bank, in
the administration of the grant funds.

The Secretariat of the Environment, City of Mexico:
The World Bank's management during the implementation of the project entitled "Introduction
of Environmentally Friendly Measures in Transport (PIMAAT)" has been extremely successful
and fully satisfactory to the Government of the Federal District and to the Secretariat of the
Environment. The results achieved during the Bank's management confirm the success of this
important project. The project's objectives were achieved satisfactorily and several of them
exceeded the expected results, benefitting the population, especially children and the elderly, and
have brought about improvements in health by significantly reducing the emission of GHG and
other pollutants to which the population had been exposed.
Another point which demonstrates that the World Bank's performance is satisfactory, is the total
support provided to the GDF through the SMA and the SETRAVI, ensuring that coordination
among project agents, BANOBRAS and the World Bank was always conducted under the most
appropriate terms.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

An incremental cost analysis was done as a requirement of the GEF. The baseline scenario
assumed the continued investment and operation of diesel buses. The implementation of the
baseline scenario entailed costs estimated at US$4.1 million, while the GEF alternative incurred
costs estimated at US$12.2 million. The incremental costs associated with the implementation of
project were estimated at US$8.1 million. The GEF funded US$5.8 million of this as part of the
project. Other cofinancing sources funded the balance.

The project supported the development of the enabling environment (barrier removal,
organizational measures) and field tests that are essential for the construction of the bus rapid
transit system. As a result, the BRT system of a total of 50km was successfully established.
Infrastructure costruction costs of Insurgentes Corridor are estimated at US$3.5 millon per km.
In comparison, those for Phase I of the TransMilenio system in Bogota, Colombia (a total of
41km) are reported at about US$210 million or US$5.0 million per km. (Ardila and Menckhoff,
2002)

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results (SMA summary)

A project closing workshop was carried out on the 25th of March, 2009. This workshop focused
on the policies and measures achieved as a result of the project. The workshop was opened by
Mexico City's Secretary of Environment (Lic. Martha Delgado Peralta) summarizing the policies
that the Government of Mexico City promotes in the field of sustainable transport. This
presentation was followed by a description of the objectives and achievements of the GEF
project by Dr. Adolfo Mejia Ponce de Leon, director of the SMA.

The workshop included the participation of the City's secretary of transport, Lic. Raul Armando
Quintero, who presented the programmed plans and objectives of SETRAVI in order to convert
mainly the public transport in a sustainable transport.

The workshop was also assisted by the participation of the environmental specialist of the World
Bank, Ricardo Hernandez, and by Lic. Alejandro Olivo Villa, sub-director of technical and
financial assistance, explaining the economic collaboration mechanisms between the government
agencies.

The METROBUS director Guillermo Calderon Aguilera presented the METROBUS system
focusing on the environmental benefits as a result of its operation. His analysis included data on
the passengers transported by the system, as well as the reduction of pollutants benefitting the
city's whole population.

The technical project coordinator, Joel Delgadillo Ramirez, exposed the specific project details,
its objectives and the challenges encountered during project implementation. The General
Director for the management of air quality in the SMA, Dr. Victor Hugo Paramo Figueroa,
commented on the importance of applied testing of technologies, specifically of articulated and
bi-articulated buses that are used by METROBUS. He concluded that the testing techniques
resulted most adequate in economic and environmental terms.

The general director of planning and transportation, Arq. Sergio Anibal Martinez Sanchez,
exemplified the complications of considering transport alternatives in a city like Mexico City.
The implementation of proposals and mechanisms represents a major challenge in order to
convert the transport in a dignified system for the inhabitants of Mexico City. The director of the
climate change and CDM program of the SMA, Ing. Oscar Vazquez Martinez, explained the
challenges that climate change entails, not only for Mexico City and its inhabitants, but
worldwide. He pointed out that the projects and programs need to focus on sustainability and
mitigation of local and global pollutants.

Finally, Dr. Adolfo Mejia Ponce de Leon, thanked all the project's collaborators and the
presence of those that are interested in converting this city in a sustainable alternative and an
example to be followed by other cities. 300 persons participated in the closing workshop and the
detailed presentations can be found in the project files.

          OPINION OF BANOBRAS ON THE EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT

BACKGROUND. The amount of the grant was US$5.8 million, which the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) granted through the World Bank to the Mexican Government. The contract was
signed on December 13, 2002 for the Government of the Federal District, through the Secretariat
of the Environment, to finance its "Introduction of Environmentally Friendly Measures in
Transport" Project (PIMAAT) until March 31, 2008. Its objective was to contribute to the
development of policies and measures that promote a modal change in transport in the
Metropolitan Area of Mexico City toward transport options that are more efficient, less polluting
and environmentally friendly in terms of climate. For the execution of this grant, BANOBRAS
signed a grant agreement with the World Bank and the SHCP on December 13, 2002, and a
Resource Administration Agreement with the GDF on April 7, 2003.

PROCUREMENT AND HIRING PROCESSES. During the operation of this grant,
BANOBRAS supported the executor in the preparation of terms of reference and their inclusion
in the annual Procurement and Hiring Plan (PAC), and submitted requests to the World Bank for
no-objections in bidding processes for the selection and hiring of the team to conduct pollution
testing, and the hiring of specialists and consulting firms to conduct the studies. Thus, it was
possible to comply in a timely and proper manner with the regulations of the World Bank and
those of the Mexican Government that apply to the project.

DISBURSEMENT OF RESOURCES. In terms of financial management, and in accordance
with the grant agreement, BANOBRAS opened a special (designated) account in which it
administered grant resources. Thus, it made the corresponding payments to authorized staff
members of the Project Implementation Unit (Unidad de Implantación del Proyecto [UIP]) and
to the individual consultants hired, during project execution. The project ended its execution
period on March 31, 2009. Of the total amount of grant resources (US$5.8 million), US$5.6
million were disbursed, representing nearly 97% of the total. The World Bank granted a four-
month administrative extension (until July 31, 2009), during which time BANOBRAS completed
its verification of documents pertaining to resources received from the grant in a timely and
proper manner, reimbursed the remaining funds to the World Bank, and closed the special
(designated) account, to the complete satisfaction of the international financial agency. In light
of the above, it is our opinion that the executor's financial management of the project and the
support provided by the financial agent were satisfactory.

PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION. BANOBRAS constantly monitored the
performance of the project in order to ensure its execution in accordance with the established
contractual provisions. In particular, BANOBRAS participated in project supervision missions
jointly with the World Bank and the SHCP, and monitored compliance with the agreements.

PROGRESS REPORTS. BANOBRAS reviewed the quarterly and semi-annual Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) that the Government of the Federal District (GDF) submitted on
progress in project execution, prepared those for which it was responsible, and delivered them in
a timely and proper manner to the World Bank and the SHCP, in accordance with the deadlines
established in each case. Prior to project conclusion, the executor prepared a report on the results


                                                 2
of the project and disseminated it to the public at a public hearing. BANOBRAS submitted this
report to the World Bank and received the Bank's approval.

AUDITS. BANOBRAS supported the Secretariat of the Environment of the Government of the
Federal District in the timely submission of information to the consulting firm Del Barrio y Cia.,
S.C. for the conduction of annual audits, throughout the project's life cycle; the audit reports
were free of observations. For its part, the consulting firm Del Barrio y Cia., S.C. performed
excellent review work, with which BANOBRAS obtained the approval of the audit reports which
met with the World Bank's full satisfaction.

CONCLUSIONS. Grant execution is considered highly satisfactory because project objectives
and targets were broadly achieved, thanks to the efficient work that was performed and the
coordination that was established among participating agencies, i.e., the executor (Government
of the Federal District, through the Secretariat of the Environment) and other local government
agencies, the support received from the SHCP, the efficient work performed by the auditing
office of Del Barrio y Cia., S.C., BANOBRAS's management as financial agent, and the good
preparation and execution of the project by the World Bank's technical and financial team. In
particular, it should be noted that the executor worked with a team of technical and financial
specialists who were assigned to the project and committed to achieving its objectives and targets,
forming the Project Implementation Unit (UIP) in charge of fulfilling the commitments for
which the executor was responsible. The project results, about which we are aware, are
admirable. It is worth mentioning that the executor was able to make use of the grant funds to
improve the public transport system for passengers and the air quality of Mexico City, through:

   The creation of the METROBÚS company in charge of constructing a Bus Rapid Transit
   (BRT) corridor with dedicated lanes on the Avenida de los Insurgentes. This corridor has
   signaled the modal change in public transit.
   The introduction of articulated vehicles with new technologies and various fuels, with fewer
   emissions of polluting particles. Public transit vehicles under concession contracts (peseros)
   have been removed from circulation and destroyed in an orderly manner.
   The generation of carbon offsets which were sold to the World Bank. This has become a
   pioneering example in Latin America on this subject.
   The implementation of the mandatory use of school buses, thus reducing the number of
   private vehicles in circulation and decreasing pollution.
   The integration of the Climate Action Program, with measures for the mitigation and capture
   of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change.
   With the experience gained from the creation of this corridor, the local authority is
   replicating the project in a comprehensive, coordinated manner with other modes of
   transportation on other important roads in the city.

In BANOBRAS's opinion, the World Bank's performance in the execution of this project was
satisfactory; however, it should be mentioned that the executor required more time than the
World Bank could give it, considering the origin of the grant funds. For BANOBRAS, it has
been a satisfactory experience to collaborate with the Government of the Federal District, as the
financial agent of the Federal Government, and with the World Bank, in the administration of the
grant funds.



                                                3
LESSONS LEARNED. For BANOBRAS, the execution of this grant was an example of
success and thus we believe that it is worthwhile to use it as a case study to determine the key
factors that affected the flexibility of execution and to try to replicate them in other projects. In
light of the above, BANOBRAS is very willing to continue collaborating with the Government
of the Federal District, as the financial agent of the Federal Government, in the financial
implementation of the actions it undertakes to improve public transit and air quality for the
benefit of the residents of Greater Mexico City.

       INTRODUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MEASURES IN
                            TRANSPORT

                              RELEVANCE OF THE PROJECT

OVERALL COMMENTS

The project entitled "Introduction of Environmentally Friendly Measures in Transport"
(PIMAAT) was carried out under a grant made by the World Bank in the amount of US$5.8
million, through the National Bank for Works and Services (Banobras).

The project's objective was to develop policies, regulations and measures that would aid in the
long-term modal change toward transportation that is more efficient, less polluting and emits
fewer greenhouse gases (GHG) in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico (ZMVM).

Under the current administration, climate change is the prevailing issue in the project. Because
this is a cross-cutting issue, climate change and clean development measures form part of all the
projects carried out under this grant. The recurring points are: reduction of GHG in the ZMVM,
adaptation measures, carbon offset trades, energy efficiency, and of course reduction of climate
change effects.

Mexico City's Climate Action Program (PACCM) is the city's environmental policy tool aimed
at consolidating efforts to address climate change. PIMAAT resources were used to support the
execution of measures to ensure its implementation. The dynamic of this tool and the magnitude
of its effects will oblige future administrations to continue its proposals.

Throughout the PIMAAT, several changes took place both in the names of the original projects
and in the list proposed at the start. One example is the project to introduce mandatory school
busing, which underwent various modifications during its implementation.

The grant financed tests of pollutant emissions under real operating conditions. These tests made
it possible to conduct several studies aimed at developing a specific testing protocol for this city
that can be used reliably in other studies of cities around the world. The grant enabled the
purchase of a portable vehicular emissions monitoring system (Ride-Along Vehicle Emissions
Measurement [RAVEM]) to monitor public transit emissions. Its use made it possible to
demonstrate the reduction in pollutant emissions through the introduction of more efficient
means of transportation.

Other important products of the PIMAAT include the results of the Public Transit Sustainability
Study. This is an input for the current urban development, transport and roads programs that are
being conducted by the Government of the Federal District (GDF).

Under the project, the publicity campaign for non-motorized transportation was designed. This
contains the set of proposals that are being used to promote non-motorized transportation in
Mexico City.

                                                 5
SUCCESS FACTORS

The interrelated factors that contributed to the PIMAAT's success brought about positive,
replicable results, the most important of which are presented below:

   a) Personnel and work team

The personnel who participated in the project demonstrated their full commitment. This, added
to their professional knowledge, resulted in quality products. As a consequence of the grant,
various interrelated work teams were formed; they worked independently, under the coordination
of the Project Implementation Unit (Unidad de Implantación del Proyecto [UIP]), which was also
created under the grant.

The work team was mainly distributed in three groups located in two bureaus of the Secretariat
of the Environment: the UIP and the Bureau of Climate Change and Clean Development
Mechanism Projects, both in the General Bureau of Policy Planning and Coordination; and the
Office of Sustainable Transport Promotion, under the General Bureau of Air Quality
Management.

   b) Project Implementation Unit

The UIP worked in two areas: Technical Coordination and Administrative and Financial
Coordination. Its general duties were to supervise and administer the PIMAAT's financial
resources.

The Technical Coordination section was in charge of participating in:
    Determining the projects to be carried out each year;
    Preparing the terms of reference for studies to be contracted;
    Forming multidisciplinary groups to monitor and evaluate the studies contracted; and
    Issuing payments when the studies were delivered to the Secretariat's satisfaction.

The Administrative Coordination section was in charge of:
    Ensuring that the project's operation was conducted in accordance with the Grant
      Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document;
    Ensuring that hiring procedures met the guidelines established by the World Bank, the
      Federal Government and the Government of the Federal District, and coordinating
      communications among the agencies involved;
    Keeping the accounting records of the project's operations and its financial statements;
      and
    Handling external audits, quarterly reports and annual reviews of the project's financial
      statements.

   c) Institutional coordination

The PIMAAT involved coordination among various agencies. The first level included the World
Bank, BANOBRAS and the Secretariat of the Environment. The UIP coordinated with all

                                              6
agencies dealing with the project's various study areas to create five work groups associated with
project components.

The agencies that participated in monitoring the various works were mainly the Secretariat of
Transportation and Roads, the Metro Mass Transit System, the Electric Streetcar System
(Sistema de Transportes Eléctricos), the Passenger Transit Network, the Secretariat of Urban
Development and Housing, and the Secretariat of Public Safety, all part of the Government of
the Federal District. Participating Federal Government agencies included the Secretariat of the
Environment. The State of Mexico was represented by the Secretariat of Communications and
Transportation. Participating offices of the Secretariat of the Environment were the General
Bureau of Air Quality Management and the General Bureau of Policy Planning and Coordination.

The General Bureau of Air Quality Management and the General Bureau of Policy Planning and
Coordination brought together highly skilled personnel to conduct studies such as Mexico City's
Climate Action Program and public transit emissions studies.

PRINCIPAL ACHIEVEMENTS

The PIMAAT contributed various products, including:

   Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
   Implementation of the Transit Corridors System (Metrobús).
   Preparation, printing and presentation of Mexico City's Climate Action Program.
   Construction of bicycle paths (ciclovías).
   Development of a testing protocol for public transit vehicles and continuity in its use, as well
   as the portable emissions measurement system (RAVEM).
   Continuity for carrying out clean development mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions.
   Direct participation of franchise holders in the operation of the Insurgentes corridor and the
   Tepalcates­Tacubaya corridor.
   Incorporation of the concept of a regulatory agency for private companies that provide public
   transit services.
   Support of financial sources for the project's financial and technical aspects.
   Greater understanding of the Kyoto Protocol and application of clean development
   mechanisms.
   The experience gained may be used, with necessary adjustments, by any other city to improve
   public transit and conduct measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

PRINCIPAL OBSTACLES

Communications among all levels were excellent, despite the administrative complexities of the
triple regulation that the project involved, because any action had to comply with the
requirements of the World Bank and of the Federal Government through BANOBRAS, and the
administrative and legal requirements of the Government of the Federal District. Triple
regulation slowed the process of obtaining resources and sometimes took several months.




                                                7
With regard to the implementation of transit corridors, the main obstacle was the resistance of
operators to change their units and their way of working. A business scheme was proposed, with
an agency in charge of operating the service. This made it necessary to hold numerous meetings
with operators and neighbors, at which the benefits of incorporating a transit system such as
Metrobús were presented.

It was necessary to prepare a new methodology for obtaining Emission Reduction Certificates,
and the Metrobús system is currently the most advanced in this matter.

It is essential to have a procedural manual that clearly indicates how to request projects, the types
of projects to be financed, and the administrative procedures that must be conducted with the
various authorities, among other points.

The units to be evaluated during field tests must be carefully selected to avoid delays due to
errors in the performance of these tests, with pre-established cycles.

Adequate inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary coordination must be established to facilitate
project development. It is very important to take customs requirements into account in the case
of imported equipment.

Funds must be allocated to lease public transit units. A warehouse for repairs and test reagents is
also recommended.

SUMMARY OF MEXICO CITY'S TRANSIT SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM.

The project proposes a restructuring in three complementary subsystems for the purpose of
increasing the service quality and operating conditions of the public transit system.

a) Integrated high-capacity system incorporating electric streetcars and Metrobús
corridors.

This integrated system's potential demand is estimated at 6 million trips-person per day (30% of
total transportation in the Federal District). To achieve the integration of this system,
connectivity among subsystems should be encouraged from the time of the design stage, and a
single fare system should be developed that is more practical and less difficult for users. It is also
recommended that complementary measures be adopted to ensure greater safety and connectivity
with non-motorized transportation, of greater interest to users of private automobiles. The current
option of dedicated central lanes, stations with high platforms, and articulated buses with left-
side doors and raised floors appears to be adequate, because it protects the Metrobús system from
invasion by other means of transportation and facilitates options for connection with electric
streetcars in light of the small number of bus corridors that can built with these characteristics.

b) Complementary system of protected corridors for buses.

This proposal deals with the idea of streetcar corridors on main arteries (ejes viales), but it is
proposed that this costly technology be replaced in light of the transportation capacity offered by
conventional buses operating in dedicated two-lane corridors along sidewalks, not in central
lanes. The advantage of operating with two lanes is that local services with stops at each station

                                                  8
and express service can be offered, with stops at hubs (paradas nodales). All that is required is
the construction of bus stops with long platforms to avoid conflicts of bus bottlenecks where
several routes converge. It can also be completed with streetcar corridors where quiet, non-
polluting transportation is required or is justified by the zone's historic and cultural heritage.
Microbus traffic should not be permitted.

c) System fed by microbuses.

Because it may be complicated to supervise and monitor offenders in the corridors, it is proposed
that microbus routes be redesigned as feeder routes of the systems described above and as local
routes between avenues and secondary roads. This means that it will also be necessary to
restructure the entire Passenger Transit Network, concentrating it in the sectors included inside
the Periférico, and allowing microbuses to spread out in all outlying districts (distritos
periféricos) on medium and long routes. This will eliminate competition between both modes of
transportation in the outlying districts and improve the operating conditions of the RTP system
which is currently obliged to use larger units in order to meet the demands of hard-to-reach
districts. This new public transit configuration requires the construction of new CETRAMs near
the Periférico to facilitate connections for residents of outlying districts. Including microbuses in
the single-fare system is not proposed, and thus it will be necessary to pay the costs of
microbuses and of integrated transit.

d) Complementary measures

A series of complementary strategic courses of action must be implemented to make the
proposed system operation. These courses of action are:

Executive bus service:
This proposal is not new. It deals with medium-capacity bus services that connect middle- and
high-income zones with commercial areas such as Polanco, Santa Fé and the Historic District. It
is aimed at motorists or taxi users who are able to pay for a safe, quality service.

Reorganization of taxi services:
The registered vehicle fleet totals 130,000 units and has experienced continuous growth in the
past 20 years, but does not correspond to demand. This means that supply has grown at a higher
rate than that of increased demand, causing many taxicab owners to operate under unsafe
conditions. It is also estimated that unregistered taxicabs (called "taxis piratas" or pirate taxis)
increase supply so that the total number of taxis probably exceeds 150,000, with a demand of
1,200,000 trips per day.

Design of quiet transit areas
Quiet transit areas refer to districts accessible by bicycle that join various pedestrian zones. They
are characterized by physical restrictions on automotive traffic and favor local transit solutions
such as pedestrian walkways, bicycles and short taxi rides. This also implies restrictions and
regulations on parking for non-residents of these zones. These areas can only be conceived under
the framework of neighborhood improvement programs in each delegación or district, where
development criteria for pedestrians and bicyclists will be implemented in urban hubs with a
high collective value, such as commercial or town centers. It also implies developing these areas
to generate non-motorized trips within their boundaries, connecting them with a network of safer,

                                                 9
wider bicycle paths, rehabilitating urban spaces and promoting low-intensity transportation that
has little environmental impact. Motorized solutions are not eliminated but they are restricted
and concentrated in modes of local transportation; non-motorized means, connected to the main
transportation network, are also promoted.

Incorporation of safe network of bicycle paths:
Current bicycle promotion policies should continue to be further encouraged. The closing of
streets for Sunday strolls and the construction of the main bicycle network on primary roads
corresponds to strong demands and may offer transport solutions for a variety of uses. A joint
policy is also needed to efficiently promote non-motorized transportation.

RELEVANCE OF THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE
GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES AND PLANS

The project fits perfectly in the Green Plan (Plan Verde), which is a medium-term government
program that contains strategies and actions aimed at the sustainable development of Mexico
City and is the city government's primary horizontal planning instrument.

Point 4 Transportation: The recovery of roads for efficient, non-polluting, good-quality mass
transit, and the promotion of non-motorized transportation involve the following three strategies:

E1. Promote efficient, non-polluting, good-quality mass transit and recover the use of roads for
the majority.

The most important product is the Metrobús system, which currently has two corridors: Indios
Verdes­Caminero and Tacubaya Tepalcates. There are multiple benefits, because transportation
is efficient, safe, comfortable and reliable; moreover, its dedicated lane allows it travel more
easily than on the lanes used by automobiles that travel along the same route.

These achievements also include eliminating the routes of microbuses that travel along these two
corridors. A new business scheme is introduced for route owners so that they can provide better
service. Carbon offsets are also traded, adding to all the actions taken to reduce GHG emission
through the implementation of the Microbús system.

E3. Encourage non-motorized transportation

Support was obtained for the construction of bicycle paths and dissemination campaigns to
promote the modal change in transportation. The city government is also promoting bicycle
marathons and Sunday strolls which have encouraged many citizens to use this type of
transportation and spend time with their families.

Point 5 Air: Control atmospheric pollutants that are most prevalent and that affect the
population's health (ozone and fine particles), and consolidate the reduction of toxic pollutant
emissions.

E1. Increase passenger efficiency or cargo transported.



                                               10
With the elimination of microbuses on Metrobús's two corridors, which in some cases leads to
old vehicles being sent to the junkyard, more efficient engines are now being used instead of old,
eight-cylinder gasoline engines. Transportation capacity is also increased, considerably reducing
emissions per passenger transported and also reducing transfer times.

E2. Support the efforts of transportation and energy plans and gauge the benefits of the Green
Plan in terms of air quality.

A field testing protocol is in place and is replicable in any other city, with the necessary
modifications. This protocol has made it possible to obtain the emission factors of the public
transit vehicle fleet with internal combustion engines.

Point 7 Climate Change and Energy: Reduce GHG emissions, strengthen the renewable
energy market and conduct climate change adaptation efforts for the population.

E1. Prepare Mexico City's Climate Action Plan.

Mexico City's Climate Action Program 2008­2012 was prepared and submitted, and work is
currently underway to define the measures proposed in this planning instrument, including a
diagnostic in which GHG emissions, vulnerability to climate change, and strategies to meet
stated objectives are reviewed.

E2. Support the efforts of transportation, water, air, public space, waste and energy plans that
decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Public transit corridors such as those of Metrobús constitute mass transit with regulated
operations and centralized revenue, operating exclusively in dedicated lanes, with predetermined
stops and infrastructure for boarding and exiting by passengers.

The PIMAAT considered the development of a program to promote pedestrian and bicycle
transportation, called non-motorized transportation. Its objective included promoting bicycle use
as a means of transportation and called for a modal change. Conditions for pedestrians were
improved, bicycle use was expanded by improving its image, and intermodal transportation is
being promoted through incentives to schools and employers.

E5. Reduce Mexico City's vulnerability to climate change and design adaptation measures for
the general population.

In this regard, a study was conducted which indicates that the Climate Change Adaptation
Measures Program would promote a set of short- and long-term actions to reduce the risks
associated with the city's population and economy. The courses of action included are:
identification of threats and analysis of vulnerability; integration of the adaptation perspective to
increase existing capacity; and implementation of adaptation measures.

For the above reasons, the PIMAAT was fully included in the previous administration and is also
fully included in the current administration of the Government of the Federal District.
