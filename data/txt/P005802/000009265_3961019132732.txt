IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT (CREDIT 1645-YEM)
PREFACE
i.            This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Technical Training Project
in the Republic of Yemen for which an IDA Credit (1645-YEM) in the amount of SDR 12.0 million
equivalent was approved on December 19, 1985 and made effective on April 9, 1987.
ii.           The Credit was closed on December 31, 1993, twelve months past the original closing
date (December 31, 1992). Undisbursed funds from the Special Account (US$139,817) were returned
by the Borrower on October 24, 1994. The unused balance of the Credit (SDR8.0 million) was
cancelled on November 12, 1994. Cofinancing (US$7.2 million) was provided by Germany.
iii.          The ICR was prepared by the Human Resources Division of the Middle East and North
Africa Region (MN2HR), and reviewed by Messrs. Jacques Baudouy, Chief, MN2HR and Gianni
Brizzi, Project Advisor (MN2DR). The Government of the Republic of Yemen provided comments on
the report which were included as Appendix "A" to the ICR.
iv.           Preparation of this ICR began during IDA's completion mission in September 1994.
An aide-memoire summarizing the findings of the mission is attached as an Annex. The ICR itself is
based on material in the project file, discussions with Borrower representatives, and project data
provided by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT
(Credit 1645-YEM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.           IDA support for technical training in Yemen started with the first education project
(1973) and continued in subsequent lending for the sector. The initial focus was on establishing District
Training Centers (DTCs) which provide basic literacy and skill training in rural areas. At the same
time, IDA financed Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) offering two-year programs for post primary
school (Grades 6) graduates. The third education project also provided secondary technical education
in agriculture and livestock practices. All these projects have been completed, and their technical
training objectives were generally met. The Education Sector Investment Project (Cr.2570-YEM)
approved in February 1994, includes a component designed to establish labor market oriented two-year
post secondary technical training programs. A vocational training project is presently under
preparation.
Project Objectives
ii.          The Technical Training Project's main objectives were to (a) alleviate acute shortages
of skilled manpower; (b) train local instructors, thereby reducing the country's dependency on costly
expatriate instructors; (c) increase female participation in technical training; and (d) strengthen national
coordination of technical and vocational training programs through the establishment of a National
Technical Training Board (NTTB).
iii.         The project design included three major components: (a) a Polytechnic Institute (PI)
which would train technicians and instructors; (b) a new Technical Secondary School (TSS) and the
rehabilitation of an existing one; and (c) relocating a VTC which had shared facilities with a TSS.
Technical assistance would be provided for expert services and fellowship training.
iv.          Project objectives and design were consistent with the country's sector priorities and
implementation capacity in the mid-1980s and with the government's priorities spelled out in the
Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86). The project complemented earlier IDA projects which had all been
completed without major implementation problems.
v.            Cofinancing (US$7.2 million) was to be provided by Germany. In 1993, the OPEC
Fund pledged an additional US$6.0 million of cofinancing to support the Polytechnic Institute.
Implementation Experience and Results
vi.           The project was prepared by the Borrower with assistance from IDA staff. A
preparation mission visited the Yemen Arab Republic (now the northern governorates after the
country's unification) in October 1984, followed by an appraisal mission in February 1985.
Negotiations for the Credit were held in October of that year. The IDA Board approved the Credit of
SDR 12.0 million on December 19, 1985. The Credit Agreement was signed in May 1986. but did not
become effective until April 1987 because of delays in the establishment of the National Technical
Training Board (a condition of effectiveness).



-iii-
vii.         With major parts of the project not implemented, and no outputs to date, the overall
outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory. Only the two TSSs were completed. The PI, on the
other hand, which was the largest project component, had to be cancelled largely because of
procurement problem. Work on the VTC was delayed for a similar reason, and as a result could not be
completed. Technical assistance was used to train thirty-one technical teachers in Germany (eleven
financed by IDA), who returned to Yemen in September 1990 and are teaching at TSSs. No expert
services were used due to the cancellation of the PI and delays in completing the VTC. The NTTB was
established in February 1987 and conducted several meetings chaired by the Minister of Education.
After the unification of Yemen in May 1990, however, the Board was replaced by the General
Authority for Vocational Training (GAVT), which has a broader mandate than the earlier NTTB.
Benefits generated from the new TSS appear to be sustainable as the Government continues to give high
priority to education expenditures. The rehabilitated TSS, on the other hand, has not been fully
utilized. Under the Education Sector Investment Project, this school is to be upgraded to a Community
College focusing on engineering technology and business management. Whether additional benefits
can be expected from complementary investments (completion of the VTC or converting the TSS to a
Community College) remains uncertain.
viii.         Overall, the objectives of the project were not achieved. Major factors contributing to
this negative outcome were a sharp deterioration in the Government's budgetary situation after the mid-
1980s and a decline in the effectiveness of public administration; numerous procurement problems;
growing inflationary pressures which provoked protracted disputes with local contractors; and
increasing difficulties in site acquisition caused by rapid urbanization and skyrocketing land prices.
These problems had not been experienced in earlier IDA projects and were not foreseen at the time of
project appraisal.
ix.          The total costs of the project estimated at appraisal were US$28.1 million. As large
parts of the project were not implemented, the actual costs at the time of final Credit disbursement were
only US$10.9 million. Most of this was spent on civil works and equipment and furniture for the two
TSSs, and on technical assistance for training. No funds were used for the PI, and only the initial costs
for the VTC in Taiz were paid from project funds. Foreign expenditures amounted to US$7.3 million,
or 67% of actual project costs.
x.           The original financing plan had assumed that US$12.7 million (45%) of the project
costs would be funded by the IDA Credit (Part II, Table 8), with the Government contributing US$8.2
million (29%) and Germany US$7.2 million (26%). IDA actually paid for 51% of the reduced project
costs, while Germany financed 17% (for technical assistance). SDR 8.0 million of the IDA credit was
cancelled. The Government's contribution was 32%. The credit negotiated with the OPEC Fund was
not used.
xi.           At the request of the Borrower, the original closing date (December 31, 1992) was
extended by one year. A subsequent request for another extension to allow work to start on the PI and
VTC components was not approved by IDA, as the Borrower failed to meet the agreed prior
conditions: (a) civil work contracts for the PI be signed; and (b) the Borrower and contractors to have
agreed on an implementation plan, assuring completion of remaining works during the extension
period.
xii.          IDA staff participated in the design and preparation of the project, and closely
supervised its implementation. Repeated attempts were made to help the Borrower overcome the
problems associated with the PI and VTC, but to no avail. Efforts are now underway to complete the
VTC with other IDA funds, while community colleges planned under the Education Sector Investment



-iv-
Project (Cr.2570-YEM) will take the place of the PI. Overall, the performance of IDA is rated to have
been satisfactory.
xiii.         The administrative capacity of the Government agencies responsible for the project was
adequate and implementation staff were motivated and cooperative. But they faced serious problems
with site acquisition, and bidding procedures and decisions of the High Tender Board which eventually
led to the abandonment of the PI and caused serious delays in the relocation of the VTC. Political
uncertainties after the unification of Yemen in 1990 and ensuing administrative weaknesses contributed
to implementation problems.
Key Lessons Learned
xiv.          Project implementation has provided the following lessons of experience:
(a) it is very difficult to implement a project during a period of
externally generated administrative changes and major political
instability;
(b) careful attention should be given to project implementation
arrangements for civil works at the preparation stage, especially to the
acquisition of land for new buildings;
(c) effectiveness conditions can unnecessarily delay project start up.
Urgent actions should be executed by Government upfront (before
negotiations or Board Presentation) rather than as a condition of
effectiveness;
(d) simple procurement procedures transparently applied should be
followed by the Borrower to facilitate the award of tenders;
(e) civil works contracts of more than two years duration should
contain price escalation clauses, or the contracts should be denominated
in a stable foreign currency. This procedure avoids contractual
disputes caused by domestic inflation when contractors are tied to an
unrealistic exchange rate; and
(f) the general implementation capabilities of the Borrower should be
thoroughly assessed during project preparation and weaknesses
addressed through Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) as
the generic implementation issues are too broad to be addressed in the
context of a single project.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT
(Credit 1645-YEM)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Project Objectives
1.           Sector Background: During the mid-1980s when this project was designed, Yemen
suffered from a severe shortage of trained manpower. Modern education, including technical training,
had started only in the early 1970s and though remarkable progress had been achieved in the following
years, output from existing training facilities was meeting only a fraction of the growing demand for
skilled manpower. Most instructors at technical training institutions were expatriates placing a heavy
financial burden on the Government. In addition, the administrative structure set up in 1977 to guide
and coordinate technical training programs was largely ineffective.
2.            To address these issues, the Government in its Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86)
emphasized the need for continuing development of technical training facilities to meet lower and
middle level manpower requirements. Priority was to be given to a greater participation of women in
the labor force, particularly as teachers, nurses and office workers. Other policy objectives were: (i)
training of Yemeni instructors for technical schools; (ii) developing modern curricula for technical
training; and (iii) improving the administration of training programs.
3.           IDA support for technical training started with the First and Second Education Projects
(Credits 421 approved in 1973, and 611 in 1976) which included the establishment of seven District
Training Centers (DTCs) providing basic literacy and skill training (Part II, Table 2). Three additional
DTCs were financed under the Fifth Education Project (Credit 1340 in 1983), and two more under the
Sixth Education Project (Credit 1470 in 1984). Again with IDA assistance under the first two
education projects, four vocational training centers were established in the cities of Sana'a, Taiz,
Hodeidah and Dhamar. These centers offer two-year programs for primary school graduates (Grades
1-6) in a number of trades such as mechanics, automotive, electricity and carpentry. Finally, the Third
Education Project (Credit 915 in 1979) supported the expansion of secondary education in agriculture
and livestock practices. All these projects have been completed, and their technical training objectives
were generally met. The Education Sector Investment Project (Cr.2570-YEM) approved in February
1994, includes a component designed to establish labor market oriented two-year post secondary
technical training programs. A vocational training project is presently under preparation.
4.            IDA supported project lending for technical training, including the project evaluated in
this ICR, has two major links to macro policy objectives: (i)generating an increasing flow of trained
manpower to meet the demand of labor markets; and (ii) reducing Yemen's dependence on expatriate
skilled workers and technicians.
5.           Project Objectives and Design. The Technical Training Project had the following
major objectives:
(a)          Alleviate acute manpower shortages at the technician and skilled worker levels;
(b)          Provide the capability of training local instructors, thereby reducing the country's
dependency on costly expatriate instructors;



-2 -
(c)           Increase the participation of females in technical/vocational training; and
(d)           Enhance national coordination of technical education and vocational training programs
through the establishment of a National Technical Training Board (NTTB).
These objectives were consistent with Government priorities spelled out in the Second
Five-Year Plan (para.2), and with IDA's strategy for supporting technical training programs (para.3).
6.            The project was prepared by the Borrower with assistance from IDA staff. A
preparation mission visited the country in October 1984, followed by an appraisal mission in February
1985. Negotiations for the Credit were held in October of that year. The IDA Board approved the
Credit of SDR 12.0 million on December 19, 1985. The Credit Agreement was signed in May 1986,
following ratification by the country's National Assembly, but did not become effective until April
1987 due to the delayed establishment of the NTTB (a condition of effectiveness).
7.            The project design included three major components:
(a)           A Polytechnic Institute (PI) in Sana'a which would train technicians for employment in
manufacturing, transportation and construction industries. It would also have a
one-year instructor training program. The PI would admit graduates of both general
and technical secondary schools to the technician training program, which would
correspond to grades 13 and 14. Total enrollment capacity was to be 420 trainees with
an estimated output of 180 technicians and 34 instructors annually. The PI would be
staffed by about 40 professionals to be recruited from the graduating pool of the
faculties of mechanical and civil engineering, science, and education at the University
of Sana'a.
(b)           A New Technical Secondary School (TSS) (grades 10 to 12) in Hodeidah, and the
rehabilitation of an existing TSS in Sana'a. The Hodeidah school would have a
capacity of 360 trainees with an estimated output of 110 graduates annually. Courses
would be offered in automotive, electric/electronics, marine maintenance, refrigeration
and air conditioning. Teaching staff would be graduates of Sana'a University. The
Sana'a TSS was established in 1971/72. Much of the original equipment had served its
useful life and was in urgent need of replacement. In addition, two workshops were
inadequated and had to be upgraded.
(c)           Relocation of the Vocational Training Center (VTC) in Taiz, which had shared
facilities with a TSS. A site for the new VTC had been acquired with sufficient space
to construct facilities for 360 students, including dormitories for 180 students. The
VTC would offer courses in twelve specializations with an estimated annual output of
160 graduates.
8             To support these investments, IDA would provide funds for construction, equipment
and furniture. Technical assistance (TA) would be financed in the form of consultancy services (292
months) and fellowship training (310 months). Curriculum development would be an important aspect
of TA. All programs would admit female students.
9.           In addition, bilateral support equivalent to US$ 7.2 million would be provided by
Germany. This included TA and equipment for the VTC in Taiz, as well as specialist services,



fellowships, equipment and furniture for the PI in Sana'a. In 1993, the OPEC Fund pledged another
US$ 6 million cofinancing for the PI.
10.          To strengthen coordination of technical education and vocational training programs, the
Government provided assurances at negotiations that a National Technical Training Board (NTTB)
would be established by July 1, 1986. The NTTB would function as a permanent body with a staff of
at least six full-time professionals. It would be guided by a high-level steering committee chaired by
the Minister of Education and including other ministers with technical training responsibilities, as well
as representatives of employers in public and private industry. Major responsibilities of the NTTB
would include the preparation of a national policy for technical training; development of plans for
policy implementation; monitoring of implementation and preparation of annual reports on training.
The project would assist in establishing the NTTB by providing 18 months of consultancy services; the
Ministry of Education would assign two full-time counterparts for the consultant.
11.          Project objectives and design were consistent with the country's sector priorities and
implementation capacity in the mid-1980s. The project's design addressed critical bottlenecks in
technical training facilities, provided for the training of local instructors, enhanced female participation,
and institutional development support at the national level. The design was similar to those of previous
IDA projects which had all been completed without major implementation problems (see para.3).
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
12.          Some of the project's objectives were partially achieved, others not at all. The NTTB
was established in February 1987 and conducted several meetings chaired by the Minister of Education.
After the unification of Yemen in May 1990, however, the Board was replaced by the General
Authority for Vocational Training (GAVT), which has a broader mandate than the earlier NTTB.
Specifically, GAVT now serves as executive agency for supervising VTCs and its role is being
broadened to prepare national plans for vocational training and monitor policy implementation in a
number of functional areas.
13.           Technical assistance was used to train 31 technical teachers in Germany (11 financed
by IDA), who returned to Yemen in September 1990 and are teaching at TSSs. No expert services
were used due to the cancellation of the PI and delays in completing the VTC.
14.          The PI Sana'a which constituted the largest project component had to be cancelled
largely because of procurement problems. Work on the VTC in Taiz was started but could not be
completed before the project closed and is proceeding under an ongoing credit. The two TSSs in
Sana'a, and Hodeidah, on the other hand, were completed in 1991 and 1992, respectively (Part II,
Table 5). Equipment and furniture for the two schools have subsequently been acquired.
15.          Major factors contributing to the non-achievement of objectives were a sharp
deterioration in the budgetary situation after the mid-1980s and a decline in the effectiveness of public
administration; the unification of the northern and southern parts of the country which led to internal
political tensions causing even more administrative inefficiency; numerous procurement problems
(paras. 17 and 18); growing inflationary pressures which provoked protracted disputes with local
contractors; and increasing difficulties in site acquisition caused by rapid urbanization and skyrocketing
land prices. These problems had not been experienced in earlier IDA projects and were not foreseen at
the time of project appraisal.



-4 -
C. Implementation Record
16.          Implementation was plagued by numerous delays. The Credit became effective 16
months after Board approval because of delays in meeting a condition (establishment of the NTTB)
which later became redundant. The main factors responsible for the inadequate project implementation
have been mentioned in Section B above. They reflect a deterioration in administrative effectiveness of
government agencies responsible for the project as well as some factors beyond their control - e.g. site
acquisition and unification of the country.
17.          Site disputes for the PI in Sana'a and the VTC in Taiz further delayed the start of the
project, as new sites had to be acquired and buildings redesigned. The first civil works tender for the
PI (1988) could not be awarded, because the High Tender Board decided to grant the contract to the
second lowest bidder. A second round of tenders were delayed by the Gulf Crisis. When tenders were
finally approved by the Government, IDA could not give its approval because some conditions in the
tender documents did not meet IDA guidelines. New bids for the PI acceptable to IDA were prepared
in 1992 but by the end of 1993, only one contractor had made an offer. Meanwhile a civil works
contract for the VTC had been awarded to a Yemeni builder with an Irish counterpart firm, with
completion of works expected late in 1995. Other project components - the two TSSs and teacher
training - were completed with some delay.
18.          At the request of the Borrower, the original closing date (December 31, 1992) was
extended by one year. A subsequent request for another extension to enable the PI and VTC
components to proceed, was not approved by IDA, as the Borrower failed to meet agreed conditions
that:
(a)          civil work contracts for the PI be signed; and
(b)          the Borrower and contractors agree on an implementation plan, assuring completion of
remaining works during the extension period. IDA therefore notified the Borrower on
February 19, 1994 that the final closing date was December 31, 1993. Disbursements
were permitted against withdrawal applications received by June 30, 1994, covering
eligible expenditures incurred before the closing date. Undisbursed Credit proceeds in
the amount of SDR 7.94 million were cancelled with effect on October 24, 1994.
19.          The total costs of the project were estimated at appraisal to be the equivalent of
US$28.1 million, including US$ 7.5 million physical and price contingencies (Part 11, Table 7). As
large parts of the project were not implemented, the actual costs at the time of final Credit
disbursement were only US$10.9 million. Most of this was spent on the two TSSs and on technical
assistance (for teacher training). No funds were used for the PI, and only the initial costs for the VTC
in Taiz were paid from project funds. Foreign expenditures amounted to US$7.3 million, or 67% of
actual project costs.
20.           The original financing plan had assumed that US$12.7 million (45%) of the project
costs would be funded by the IDA Credit (Part II, Table 8), with the Government contributing US$8.2
million (29%) and Germany US$7.2 million (26%). Ultimately, IDA paid for 51 % of the reduced
project costs, while Gernany financed 17% (for technical assistance). The Government's contribution
was 32%. The credit negotiated with the OPEC Fund was not used.
21.           Disbursements of IDA funds started three years later than estimated at the time of
Board approval (Part II, Table 4). In terms of US dollars, the disbursement rate was higher (44%),



- 5-
reflecting the gradual devaluation of the Riyal during the implementation period. The allocation of
Credit proceeds by categories is shown in Part II, Table 9.
22.          Credit covenants as applicable have been complied with (Part II, Table 10). The PIU
maintained accurate records of project accounts, which were audited annually by private audit
companies. The audit reports were submitted to IDA, and were of acceptable quality.
D. Project Sustainability
23.          Only one new education facility - the TSS in Hodeidah - was completed under the
project. Although not yet operational, there is evidence of demand for student places. Recurrent costs
will be met by the Government which continues to give high priority to education expenditures. Some
of the teachers to be employed at the school have been trained through project fellowships. Benefits
generated from this project component therefore appear to be sustainable. The rehabilitated TSS in
Sana'a, on the other hand, for reasons that are not clear has not been utilized as expected and will
require further investment to upgrade it to a commnunity college.
24.          As large parts of the project were not implemented, only a fraction of the expected
benefits will be generated. Whether additional benefits can be expected from complementary future
investments, e.g. the completion of the VTC in Taiz or a community college in Sana'a, remains
uncertain.
E. IDA Performance
25.          IDA staff participated in the design and preparation of the project, and closely
supervised its implementation (Part II, Table 11). Repeated attempts were made to help the Borrower
overcome the problems associated with the PI in Sana'a and VTC in Taiz, but in the end these
components had to be completely or partially cancelled. Efforts are now underway to complete the
VTC with IDA funds from an existing credit, while community colleges planned under the Education
Sector Investment Project (Cr.2570-YEM) will take the place of the PI. Overall, the performance of
IDA is rated to have been satisfactory.
F. Borrower Performance
26.          Government entities responsible for the project - the Ministry of Education, the
Ministry of Planning and Development, and the PIU - were motivated and cooperative. However, they
faced serious problems with site acquisition and bidding procedures which eventually led to the
abandonment of the PI and caused serious delays in the relocation of the VTC. Political difficulties
after the unification of Yemen and ensuing administrative weakness contributed to the implementation
problems.
G. Assessment of Outcome
27.          With major parts of the project not having been implemented, and no outputs to date,
the overall outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory. This is especially true for the largest project
component, the PI in Sana'a, which eventually was cancelled. The project's implementation was

adversely affected by the steady deterioration of general political and economic conditions in Yemen
during this period. The underlying concept of providing occupationally oriented post-secondary
education and training programs to meet demands for middle-level manpower remains sound. Such
programs will be offered under the recently effective (March 1995) Education Sector Investment
Project (Cr.2570), which includes provisions for establishing the first phase of a national community
college system. The colleges will be closely linked to local and regional employers through business
and industry participation in curriculum planning and institutional management.
28.           Project preparation, design and implementation were well documented. There was
sufficient information to gauge the progress of the project, and to evaluate its final outcome. Data for
the Implementation Completion Report were readily available, both at headquarters and in the field.
Borrower representatives gave valuable support to the completion mission.
H. Future Operation
29.           The TSS in Hodeidah has not yet started to operate. Facilities of the rehabilitated TSS
in Sana'a are only partially used. As mentioned above, the school will be upgraded to a post-secondary
Community College with focus on engineering technology and business management. A greater role
must be given to the private sector in planning, managing and financing skilled manpower development
to forge strong linkages between vocational training and labor demand. The proposed Vocational
Training Project (to be approved in 1996) gives employers, especially the private sector, a leading role
in the managing and financing of vocational training.
30.           Even if the better conditions for project implementation had existed, the Government
would still have had to provide the necessary framework, including medium-term planning, exchange
rate policy, regional decentralization, and a greater role for the private sector to reduce risks to an
acceptable level. Moreover, to develop an adequate and sustainable resource base for the training of
skilled workers, the financial base of the country's vocational training system needs to be broadened
and its access to resources diversified. This requires a greater participation of communities and
employers who stand to benefit from the training of the domestic labor force. Such changes in policy
would help to strengthen the financial viability of the system and gradually shift the burden of support
for vocational training from the government budget to the main beneficiaries of the VTCs, and more
specifically, provide incentives for the private sector to provide such training in future.
I. Key Lessons Learned
31.           Project implementation has provided the following lessons of experience:
(a)           it is very difficult to implement a project during a period of externally generated
administrative change and major political instability;
(b)           careful attention should be given to project implementation arrangements for civil
works at the preparation stage, especially to the acquisition of land for new buildings;
(c)           effectiveness conditions can unnecessarily delay project start up. Urgent actions should
be executed by Government upfront (before negotiations or Board Presentation) rather
than as a condition of effectiveness;



(d)           simple procurement procedures should be followed by the Borrower to facilitate the
award of tenders;
(e)           civil works contracts of more than two years duration should contain price escalation
clauses, or the contracts should be denominated in a stable foreign currency. This
procedure avoids contractual disputes caused by domestic inflation when contractors
are tied to an unrealistic exchange rate; and
(f)           the general implementation capabilities of the Borrower should be thoroughly assessed
during project preparation and weaknesses addressed through Country Portfolio
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) as the generic implementation issues are too broad to be
addressed in the context of a single project.

NOTES: The Fourth Education Project (Cr. 1203-YEM) was approved in 1982 and closed in December 1989. It supported the
establishment of the Educational Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Faculty of Engineering at the University of
Sana'a.
An Institutional Development for Public Administration Project (Cr.2015-YEM) was approved in 1989 and will close in
June 1996. Its two components, support to the Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR) and the National
Institute of Administrative Sciences (NIAS) are progressing slowly and project restructuring is being considered to meet the current
priorities of the Government since the country's unification.
The Secondary Teacher Training Project (Cr.2222-YEM) was approved in 1991 and is expected to close in December 1998.
It is providing support to the rehabilitation of the Faculties of Education at Sana'a and Aden Universities: and improving secondary
school teaching while creating a basis for quality improvement through upgrading the cadre of teachers, making better use of teacher
resources and planning for future resources.

ANNEX
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    The IDA completion mission met with representatives of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry
of Education to review issues of project implementation and operation. In this context, the PIU provided the mission
with important information and data which will be reflected in the Implementation Completion Report. The mission
wishes to express its appreciation for the cooperation and support it received from the PIU staff.
2.    Only some of the original project objectives were actually achieved. This included the establishment of a new
Technical Secondary School (TSS) in Hodeidah and the rehabilitation of a TSS in Sana'a. Work on the Vocational
Training Center in Taiz was started but could not be completed. The largest project component, a polytechnic institute
in Sana'a, had to be cancelled primarily due to procurement problems. Technical assistance was used for teacher
training, largely financed by Germany. A National Technical Training Board (NTTB) was established but later
replaced by the General Authority for Vocational Training (GAVT).
3.   Implementation was plagued by numerous delays. The Credit became effective only sixteen months after Board
approval to meet a condition (establishment of the NTTB) which later became redundant. Major factors contributing to
the implementation delays and the eventual cancellation of large parts of the project were a sharp deterioration in the
budgetary situation after the mid-1980s which gradually eroded the effectiveness of public administration; numerous
procurement problems; growing inflationary pressures after the Gulf crisis which led to protracted disputes with local
contractors; and increasing difficulties in site acquisition caused by rapid urbanization. These problems had not been
experienced in earlier IDA projects and were not foreseen at the time of project appraisal.
4.    As large parts of the project were not implemented, the actual costs at the time of final Credit disbursement
were only US$10.9 million compared with an appraisal estimate of US$28.1 million. Only SDR 4 million or 33
percent of the approved IDA Credit (SDR 12 million) were disbursed. The rest will be cancelled.
5.    The TSS in Hodeidah is not yet operational, while the rehabilitated TSS in Sana'a utilizes only half of its
designed capacity. The Vocational Training Center (VTC) in Taiz requires additional resources to be completed.
While the Polytechnic in Sana'a was cancelled, the underlying concept was not lost -- of providing occupationally
oriented post-secondary technical training to meet the demand for middle-level manpower. Such programs will be
offered under the recently approved Education Sector Investment Project (Cr.2570-YEM).

1.          From our perspective regarding Cr.1645-YEM, we concur with the
discussions presented in the subject report. We have nothing to add except to
"ay that the MOE was very pleased with the extraordinary efforts that the Bank
undertook to help us resolve and overcome the problems encountered during the
project execution which resulted primarily from difficult economic conditions
that affected the country, particularly with regard to the civil works
contracts. For example, the Bank agreed to continue providing support for the
VTC in Taiz which should have been completely financed under this credit.
2.         While it in true that the facility allowing payments for civil
works contracts in US Dollars has greatly benefitted the project, since
contractors are assured of keeping pace with inflation, one possible drawback
to this, however, concerns the rate of exchange used by contractors to convert
local cost estimates when presenting their bids in US Dollars.  It has become
apparent that contractors have been inflating the rates as a buffer which is
not necessary, since the hard currency portion, in and of itself precludes the
need for a buffer. We therefore would recommend that this matter be the
subject of further diacussions.
