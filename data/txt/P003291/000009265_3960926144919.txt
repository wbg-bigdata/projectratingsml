MEMORANDUM AND RECOO4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF-THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ZIMBABWE  -
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.     - The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Zimbabwe for US$32.7 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repayable over twenty years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate and help finance a highway
improvement and maintenance project.
2.       Background.  The transport infrastructure and services in Zimbabwe
are characterized by dualisms the urban, industrial, and commercial farming
areas are served by well-developed rail and road networks, while the
communal areas, where over 651 of the population'live, are served mostly by
.gravel and earth roads in fair to poor condition. Furthermore, despite the
highly sophisticated and competitive trucking services in the interurban
and industrial areas, the provision of samilar services in the communal
areas is limited and expensive due not only to poor road conditions but'
also to restrictive licensing regulations. After independence, the
Government embarked on a-program to remedy the situati4o-through an
ambitious. road devielopment scheme concentrated in the commuwtw  lands.
Since these developments were partly financed at the expense of maintenance
activities, they resultedCin a backlog of periodic maintenance and higher
needs for rehabilitation than would have been the case with normal
maintenance levels.
3.       Given this situation,.the Government commissioned its first
National Transport Study (NTS) in 1984-85 to help define the gdnWral policy
framework and d#rection of f-uture development of the'.sectori.  Its
successful comp -tion in 1985 was followed by a Bank transport sector
mission which' carried out a more in-depth study of selected issues of
central concern to the Government in reltion to economic growth and the
budget deficit: namely, how to improve road access and trucking servtces to
the communal areas and how to eliminate the railways deficit.  Primary
conclusions of the studies are that a) future budgetary emphasis should
shift away from railways to roads; b) road user charges cover public
expenditures on roads and make a net contribution to public revenues; c) a
better balance must be struck between new road investments and maintenance;
d) the-existing permit requirements on commercial haulage should be,
removed; and e) a detailed plan should be formulated to bring the growing
railways deficit under control. The Bank's Transport Sector Memorandum
(TSM) went further to recommend specific programs to i) eliminate the
backlog of periodic road' maintenance accumulated over the preceding five'
years; it) improve rural road-access in the short term through low-cost
improvements; iit) improve road transport services in the communal areas
through realistic phased liberalization of permit controls and,,increased
foreign exchange allocations to the trucking sector; and iv) improve the
financial operations of the rallways through X- five year recovery program
in three stages.



-24.
4.       As a result of NTS and the Bank's sector work, the Government
dec.4ed to address the country's various transport problems by a
comprehensive sector program. The net result of this program will be an
Increase In the sector's contribution to government revenues. The Ministry
of Transport (NOT) has fully accepted the recommendations concerning the
restructuring of the railways. MOT has also agreed to liberalize gradually
permit controls for truckers in communal areas. The foreign exchange
allocations to the trucking sector have been increased by about 1502 in
real terms from 1984 to 1986, which is in line with TSM reconmendations.
The Government's decision to increase the annual budget allocations for
road maintenance together with the road works financed under the Bank's
Second Highway Project would eliminate the backlog of periodic maintenance
and bottlenecks on rural roads. In addition, other improvements of the
state, district and feeder roads are underway with funding from a number of
donors and agencies, Including AfDB, BADEA, KfW, Kuwait Fund, the
Netherlands, and SIDA.-  OT's institutional problem of a lack of
experienced menagement staff is being alleviated by ongoing bilateral
technical assistance (SIDA). With the help of the consultants, a sound
evaluation syst.em for--ros& investments following economic criteria was
implemented.
5.       Prolect Obiectives   The primary objective of the project is to
strengthen the road network in commercial farming areas as well as.An
communal lands by reducing the backlog in periodic maintenance of primary,
secondary, and feeder roads and,eliminate bottlenecks on rural roads. This
will contribute to preserving capital invested in the road network,
facilitate road transport and reduce vehicle operating cofts. A further
objective is to Improve trucking services in communal areas through road
improvements and introduction of a more efficient truck licensing system.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project would cor:,zAt of the
following componentst (i) strengthening .nd rehabilitation ot about 175 km
of primary roads; (it) rese4ling of about 1,500 km of primary and secondary
r-oads; (iII) regravelling of about-1,500 km of secondary and feeder roads;
(iv) low-cost Improvements of about 1,400 km of secondary and feeder roads;
and (v) consulting services for construction supervision of (i) and (ii).
The total cost of the project is estfimated at US$86.4 million equivalint,
with a foreign exchange component of US$47.1 million (552). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shawL- in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. Schedules C and D contain a timetable of key project
processing events and the-status of Bank Group operations in Zimbabwe,
respectively. Also attached are two maps and the Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7026-ZIM dated December 17, 1987.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would be
fully in line with Government development and Bank assistance strategies.
It would i) strengthen the paved and gravel road network by eliminating a
burdensome backlog of periodic maintenance and rehabilftation and ii)
facIlitatAe-_t_mprovqeent of road transport services in communal areas by
eliminsting bottlenecks on roads in these areas.  Bank involvement in the



3-
Vroject would help ensure that the specific road programs and policy
change. recommended through the BAnk's sector work are implemented and that
further improvements to strategy and policy formulation and instltuti6n
building are pnirsued.
8.       A&reed Actions.  During negotiations, the following main
agreements were reached with the Governmentt a) an action program to relax
regulation of trucking services in two steps: (1) by the end of December
1988, exempt commercial truck operators from road service permits when
hauling agricultural products during peak seasons, as well as all trucks
below 10-tons cap&city when servicing communal areas, and (2) by the end of
December 1989, replace the existing permit system with a system that
licences an operator based primarily on vehicle safety, and driver and
managerial competence; b) an increase in the Government annual budget for
road maintenance to at least Z$ 44 million over the vext four years In 1988
prices, so that, in addition to covering maintenance, funds are sufficient
for the implementation of the proposed project; and c) that prior approval
by the Bank will be required before any road section can be ir 'uded in the-
project in subsequent annual programs for road works to be undertaken
following the first-year program.
9.       Benefits. Considerablo economic benefits are expected from
eliminating the backlog in periodic maintenance on primary as well as
secondary and feeder roads. The major quantifiable benefits will consist
oft a) savings in vehicle operating costs, b) savings in road maintenance
costs, and c) savings in future rehabilitation costs. Improved road
conditions could result in cheaper and more reliable transport services in
the communal areas which would encourage their agricultural production and
assist in L.tegrating these areas with the main production and consumption
centers. The economic rate of return of the ptoject is estimated at 36S.
10.      Risks.  The principal risk associated with the project is that
eosts may be higher than the estimate. However, tho availability of
substantial recent cost experience for similar works indicates that this
risk is small and tolerable rnd sensitivity analysts shows that 'a
considerable price increase would still leave the project viable.
11.      Recommendationt I am satlsfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
