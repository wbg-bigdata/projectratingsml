LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               Zimbabwe
Beneficiary:            Ministry of Transport
Amount:                 US$32.7 million
.-Mvs:                Variable interest rate, payable in 20 years,
including 5 years of grace.
Prolect Obhectives
and Benefits:           The project would substantially improve
the condition of the state roads by
assisting the Government in implementing a
program to prevent deterioration of the
principal arteries as well as secondary roads
and preserve existing road infrastructure. It
would also assist the Government to integrate the
communal lands with the main production and
consumption centers lby improving trucking services
in these areas through improvement of access
routes and introduction of a more efficient truck
licensing system.
Considerable quantifiable and non-quantifiable
benefits are expected from the improved
maintenance activities on the entire state road
network, resulting in significant reduction in
transport costs.
Proiect Description: (i) Four-year strengthening and rehabilitation
program for about 175 km of primary roads;
(ii) Four-year resealing program for about 1,500 km
of primary and secondary'roads;



- it -
(iii)  Four-year regravelling program for about 1,500
km of secondary and feeder roads;
(iv)  Four-year low-cost improvement program for about
1,400 km of secondary and feeder roads;
(v)  Consulting servicea for supervision of i-ems
(i) and (ili)
Risks:                      The principal risk associated with the project
is that actual project costs mua be higher than
the estimates. However, the availability of
substantial recent cost experience for
comparable works lindicates that this risk is
small and tolerable.

SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT :;ECTOR
A. Background
1.01     Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 square
kilometers bounded by Mozambique, Republic of South Africa (RSA), Botswana
and Zambia (see May IBRD 20678). Topographically, the land rises from low
plains in the northwest and southeast to a high plateau (1,200 - 1,500
meters) which runs from the southwest to the northeast. The high country
has a temperate climate with a reasonably high level of rainfall, while the
middle regions are warmer and drier and the low areas are arid to near
arid. As of mid 1986, the population was estimated at 8.7 million people,
with an annual growth of about 3.42.
1.02     Real growth of the economy in the two-year period 1980-81 averaged
over 11% p.a; in the subsequent three years the GDP was virtually flat, in
real terms, as the international recession caught up with Zimbabwe and a
severe drought curtailed agricultural output. In 1985, GDP growth
recovered to over 9% owing to excellent rains, before a renewed recession
with virtually no growth in 1986 and a slight rise in GDP of about 1% in
1987. Per capita GNP in 1986 is estimated at US$630 (on the basis of the
World Bank Atlas methodology).
1.03     At independence in 1980, Zimbabwe inherited a well-diversified
economy, with good potential for growth and a well-developed administrative
and physical infrastructure. Agriculture, manufacturing and mining are the
most important sectors of the economy. In 1985, agriculture accounted for
about 132 of GDP and provided employment for about 531 of the labor force.
Agricultural exports provided approximately 451 of foreign exchange
earnings. The manufacturing sector contributed about 29Z of the country's
GDP and accounted for 61 of the labor force. Although mining accounts for
only 7% of GDP and employs only 2% of the labor force, its exports
represent about 38% of foreign exchange earnings. The mining and
agricultural sectors supply the bulk of the inputs for the manufacturing
sector.
B. The Transport System
1.04     The transport system of Zimbabwe includes 85,783 km of roads,
2,753 km of railway and eight airports; the system principally serves the
country's urban areas, commercial farms, and industrial and mining centers.
The development and maintenance of transport facilities in communal areas,
where approximately 60% of the population lives, have been neglected
because of pre-independence governmental policies.  The Government in



-2-
recent years has emphasised the nzJd to develop the transport
infrastructure in comunal &reas and to pchieve better transport links
between communal areas and eomercial centers. This is reflected in the
Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP) currently being Implemented.
1.05     As a landlocked country, Zimbabwe faces a serious problem with
respect to the transport of its imports and exports through neighboring
countries. The shortest rail routes to,the aea are two lines through
Mozambique but use of these lines has been severely handicapped by aroed
bandit attacks and deterioration of facilities. As a consequence, Zimbabwe
trade has become heavily dependent upon the relatively long and costly rail
routes through RSA, the main route for this purpose being the line through
Botswana to Port Elixabeth, RSA. Situated astride key international rail
and road routes, Zimbabwe's transport network is of v,tal importance to the
entire southern Africa region, particularly to Zambia, Zaire, Malawi and
Botswana. The problem of securing economical access to the sea for
Zimbabwe and its neighbors cannot be solved without a coordinated effort in
developing regional transport facilities and services. This effort has
been givea the highe-t priority by the Southern Africa Development
Coordination Conference (SADCC) through its Southern Africa Transport and
Communications Commission (SATCC) which promotes and coordinates the
development of regional transport and communications in its nine member
countries. SATCC has concentrated particular attention on planning the
rehabilitation of railway links through Mozambique and the port of Beira.
Various international and bilateral financing agencies, including the Bank,
are assisting in getting these projects implemented.
HiRhways
1.06     Details of the road subsector are presented in Chapter II.
Railways
1.07     The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) is the nation's largest
parastatal organization, employing 18,600 personnel. Its dominant role in
the transport system is seen in the fact that NRZ handles over 901 of the
country's total external trade in terms of tonnage. The railway operates
310 diesel locomotives, 94 steam locomotives, 30 electric locomotives,
11,748 wagons and 412 passenger coaches over 2,753 km of rail line. The
segment from Harare to just north of Oweru was recently electrified;
extension of the electrified line has been considered but indefinitely
postponed for various reasons. In 1985, NRZ carried 13.1 million tons of
freight, a 2X decline from the previous year. Net ton-kilometers also
declined slightly from 6.4 billion in 1984 to 6.2 billion in 1985, caused
chiefly by limited capabilities of the railway itself. Of the traffic
carried, 682 was local, 12Z exports, 131 imports and 72 transit. Wnile
the availability of freight wagons has been high, operations have been
hampered by low availability of locomotives: 64% for diesel, 45Z for steam
and 80% for electric. This problem is attributable to the high average age
of the locomotive fleet, the multiplicity of diesel locomotive types,
shortage of skilled labor, and periodic shortages of spare parts due to the
insufficient availability of foreign exchange.



- 3 -
1. 08    IRZ has incurred deficits in Its operations each year since 1970
and Is subsidised by government grant. The daficit, which totalled
Z$ 32.3 sillion (US$51.2 million) in FT 1979/80, has risen ste-dily to
Z$ 87.4 dillion (US$53.3 million) in FT 1985/86. The Goveriment haJ been
reluctant to allow sufficient Increases In tariffs on the ground that they
ould be inflationary; thus freight tariffs were unchang d between 1983 and
1986 despite a significant rise in railway expenditures. As a result of
these eircums tances, the operating ratio deteriorated to 114 in FT 1985/86.
NRZs' financial situation is expected to improve somewhat based on the
increases in freight and passenger tariffs in 1986 but still further
Increases will be required in the near futur-. Another factor affecting
adversely the financial condition of the rrilwey is the transf-r of NRZ's
611-Em rail line located in Botswana to the Botswana Goverment effective
January 1, 1987; the loss of this line Is *xpected to reduce NRZ's revenue
more than its expenditures.
1.09     Another pressing problem is the critical shortage of qualified
staff. This shortage resulted from past neglect of training of black
Zimbabweans for senior management positions and the exodus of artisans from
Zimbabwe following independence. The problem is being addressed by both
..he short-term employment of expatriate technical assistance from the
United Kingdom (UK), India and Pakistan, and in the improvement and
expansion of training programs and facilities, particularly with support
from the Bank's Railway Development Project (para. 1.23) under which some
progress has been achieved.
Air Transport
1.10     Air transport, though less important than railways and roads,
provides vital links between major Zimbabwe cities and between the country
and other countries in Africa and elsewhere. There are eight airports, of
which three, Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls, are international. Air
Zimbabwe (AZ), a parastatal company under the Ministry of Transport (MOT),
operates three Viscounts, five Boeing 707s and three recently acquired
Boeing 737-200s on its domestic, regional and intercontinental routes.
International routes were opened to London in 1980, Frankfurt in 1981,
Athens in 1982 and, in a seat-lease arrangement, to Perth and Sydney also
in 1982.
1.11     In FY 1985/86, AZ flew 653 million passenger-kilometers, a slight
decline from the level for the previous year. Air cargo traffic on AZ
increased rapidly from 3 million to 11 million ton-kilometers in the period
1980 to 1986. Revenues in FY 1985/86 were Z$ 79 million, up 25% from the
previous year. With continuously rising operating costs, however, large
losses occurred from FY 1981/82 through 1985/86. Most of the losses have
been incurred on the international routes. Airline operating costs have
been high because of the old age of the aircraft fleet. The new 737s are
not yet utilized efficiently. Due to noise restrictions on flights to
Europe, effective on January 1, 1988, AZ is forced to either acquire or
lease new aircraft for those flights to replace the noisy 707s currently
used. Fares were not 4mcreased from May 1982 until February 1987 when a
201 increase on domestic and regional routes and a 25Z increase on
international routes became effective.



1.12     Affretair, a 1002 Government-owned corporation, in 1985 handled
with its two DC 8 aircraft about as much air cargo as AZ. The main
operation of the airfreight line consists of two flights a week to Europe.
Revenues in FY 1985/86 were ZS 17 million with a net lose of Z$ 3 million,
the sow  loss as in FY 1982/83. Freight rates were !icroased substantially,
on average around 401, in 1986.
C. Role. Organization and Performance
1.13     The railway plays a dominant role in the long-distance transport
of goods in Zimbabwe. On the whole, truck transport provides servic6s that
are complementary rathor than competitive with rail service. Tariffs for
road transport are generally higher than for railways. Nonetheless, some
shift has taken place from rail to road transport. Attracted by the
superior quality service furnished by truckers, shippers would not likely
return to rail service even if rail rates were reduced. Similarly,
travelers faced with a modal choice generally prefer bus transport to rail
service despite the higher cost of the former. The more extensive route
structure of the road system, of course, means that bus services are
available at many locations beyond the reach of the railway.
1.14     In terms of organization, the different modes of transport are
distinctly different from one another: NRZ is the only railway entity in
the country except for a few extremely small lines integral to particular
mining operations. Commercial air transport is dominated by AZ and
Affretair but some 350 general aviation aircraft, mostly privately owned,
provide a variety of services. In the trucking field, there are a few
large operations, one of which is a subsidiary of NRZ, and many small
private operators. Similarly, there are many small privately-owned
intercity bus operators.  Governmental organizations concerned with
transport include MOT which builds and maintains the state roads, regulates
road transport, oversees the railway and civil aviation activities and
operates the airports. The Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban
Development (MLGRUD), through its District Development Fund (DDF), is
hea- -ly involved in the construction and maintenance of district roads.
1.15     Overall performance of the transport sector has been fair to good
so far as services are concerned in the commercial farming areas and in
industrial and commercial centers. In the communal areas, however,
transport services are poor, largely because of the lack of adequate roads.
Financial performance of major sectoral entities has been unsatisfactory in
that NRZ, AZ and Affretair have all operated with heavy losses.
D. Government Oblectives and Policy in the Sector
1.16     The objectives of the Government in the transport sector include
the following: (1) to improve regional transport systems and reduce
dependence on RSA routes; (2) to promote the most efficient use of each
mode of transport and avoid wasteful competition; (3) to provide adequate
roads and transport services in communal areas; (4) to intensify
construction and improvement of secondary and feeder roads in rural areas
thus facilitating the economic integration of communal areas into the
modern sector; (5) to review the permit regulations for road transport with



a view to removing regulations which deter efficient transport operations;
and (6) to modernize the aircraft fleet of AZ. These objectives are
reasonable and the Government has made considerable progress in the
formulAtion of detailed policies and programs toward achieving them.
1.17     In 1984, under the Bank's First Highway Project (Loan 2282-ZIM,
1983, US$26.4 million), the Government of Zimbabwe comuissioned a National
Transport Study (NTS) to carry out a comprehensive review of the sector.
The objectives of the study were to recomiend an integrated national
transport policy, a comprehensive invest*nent program and improvements in
the management of the sector. It was completed in 1985 and some
recommuendations have already been incorporated in the first Five-Year
Development Program 1986-1990. The main recommendations of NTS were to
(i) shift the investment emphasis from the railways to the road sector;
(ii) undortake a financial restructuring of NRZ and AZ; (Iii) change the
pricing policy in the sector; (iv) strengthen MOT's institutional planning
capacity; (v) give priority to maintenance of existing infrastructure; and
(vi) reduce the regulatory control of the trucking industry. NTS is
presently under discussion in the cabinet. Since it has already passed the
cabinet committee, it is expected to be approved by cabinet shortly.
1.18     Taking into account NTS, a Transport Sector Memorandum (TSM) was
prepared by the Bank in 1986-87 providing an in-depth analysis of selected
issues in each subsector. The road sector analysis focuses on the impact
of road investment strategy, road maintenance policy, road planning and
coordination and on the access of communal areas to the national markets.1
The Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development (MFEPD) and MOT
have already fully accepted the TSM recommendations for this sector. The
trucking sector analysis develops alternative options to improve the rural
services through greater private initiative and the Government has agreed
to relax regulations of trucking services (para. 2.08). For the railway
subsector, TSM analyses the causes of the increasing deficit and proposes a
five-year plan to restructure NRZ into a financially viable operation,
which has also been accepted by MOT. MOT has decided to adopt the TSM
reconmendations as its own policy and submit it to the Government for
actioii.
E. Transport Planning and Coordination
1.19     Transport planning is carried out separately by each agency
responsible for a particular modal activity. Thus, plans for railways are
prepared by NRZ and for air transport by AZ and the results are considered
by MOT's Department of Surface and Air Transport where planning is carried
out for airports and air navigation facilities as well; MOT's Engineering
Department carries out planning for state roads. There is interaction
between these agencies and MFEPD which is responsible for central economic
planning. The planning for district road development is undertaken by DDF
in MLGRUD, which also interacts with MFEPD as the Five-Year National
Development Plan is prepared.

paras. 2.08, 2,16, 2.18, 2.23, and 2.25. 



1.20     In 1983, the merger into HOT of two ministries concerned with
various aspects of transport, brought the whole transport sector (except
district roads) under one ministry. This consolidation has facilitated
sector planning and coordination. MOT is vell structured to evaluate both
development plans and policy issues in the mector with due consideration ot
intermodal relationships. The road planning unit within MOT, however,
needs strengthening and a Swedish aid project providea assistance for a
training program for MOT staff. A study of f-eder roads, the National
Feeder Roads Study (NFRS), covering district roads in selected areas was
conducted by consultants under the First Highway Project. NFRS formulated
planning criteria for district roads and recommendations for institutional
arrangements for coordination of feeder road development among various
agencies involved, particularly the two key agencies, MOT and DDF (para.
2.25).
F. Transport Investments
1.21     The Public Sector Transport Investment Program for the period FY
1985/86 tu FY 1989/90 is presented in Table 1.1 which is based on
development programs prepared by the various transport agencies. The
investment program represents a shift in emphasis from the public sector
investment program for previous years which concentrated on railway
improvements (electrification). The emphasis is now on upgrading the road
network and modernization of AZ's fleet. This reorientation is reasonable.
The financial implications of a fleet modernization program for AZ have not
been determined but AZ's recent performance suggests that continued
financial support trom the Goverrnuent will be required in the foreseeable
future. The proposed allocations for transport in the Government's entire
public sector investment program for the period 1986/87 to 1990/91
correspond to about 18X which would be adequate.

G. Experience With Past Lendina in the sector
1.22     The Bank approved in 1981 the Transport Rehabilitation Program
Loan (Loan 1994-ZIN, US$42.0 million) which provided (i) NRZ with foreign
exchange for spare parts, track maintenance equipment, tools and technical
assistance and (1i) Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED) with
replacements for unserviceable road equipment and vehicles, and spare
pa:rts, for use of the road agencies (Annex 1). The closing date of the
lan was June 30, 1986. Implementation of the program v"an atisfactory.
1.23     A Railvay Development Project (Loan 2342-ZIM, US$40.0 million),
approved by the Bank in 1983, provided assistance for (i) continuation of
contracts of expatriate artisans hired under the Transport Rehabilitation
Program Loan; (ii) expansion of the NRZ training program; and (iii)
procurement of spare parts. Considerable delay occurred in completing
actions required for the loan to become effective and consequently
disbursements have been slower than anticipated. At the Goverrnment's
request, the Bank has twice extended, one year at a time, the closing date
for the loan from December 31, 1986 to December 31, 1988.
1.24     The First Highway Project included construction of the Pamushana-
Birchenough Bridge, Ndanga-Triangle, Range-Mharadzano and Chivhu-Lothian
roads. The project also included assistance for training, a national
transport study (i.e., NT'S), a national feeder road study (i.e., NFRS) road
feasibility studies and detailed engineering. Implementation of the
project has been satisfactory and completion is expected in September 1988.
H. Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
1.*25    Bank's involvement in the project would address some key problems
in the highway subsector by assisting the 4overnment in (i) strengthening
the paved and gravel road network by elimiaiating a burdensome backlog of
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation; and (ii) improving road transport
services in coammunal areas where poverty is severe and truck operators are
reluctant to serve. The project would thus be fully in line with the
Bank's assistance strategy of improved maintenance and efficient expansion
of economic infrastructure. Bank involvement in the project would help
ensure that the specific road programs and policy changes recommnended
through the Bank's sector work are implemented and that further
improvements to strategic and policy formulation and institution building
are pursued.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01     The hig&iway network of Zimbabwe totals about 86,000 km of which
about 15% is paved, 51Z gravelled and 342 earth roads (Table 2.1). State
roads are the major roads connecting provincial and district centers and
include the key links of regional or international routes. Rural council
roads serve principally the commercial farming areas. District roads are
those serving the communal lands; these are less developed. Roads located
in the eleven urban areas and controlled by municipalities are designated
municipal roads.

2.02     NTS proposed a functional classification system for the state
roads. These roads would be divided into primary, secondary and feeder
roads as shown in Table 2.2.

Source: NTS
In 1982, about 6,000 km of the most heavily trafficked district roads were
transferred from DDF to MOT, and they form the major share of the MOT
feeder roads.



2.03     The length of the state and rural council roads is adequate but
the condition of some of them, particularly secondary and feeder roads
under MOT authority, has suffered from lack of periodic maintenance and
improvement, caused largely by insufficient funding. Construction of
district roads was given low priority before independence and only recently
has there been a significant effort to build roads in communal areas (para.
2.26).
B. Road Transport Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.04     The size of the vehicle fleet in Zimbabwe has increased steadily
since 1980, as shown in Table 2.3. The fleet rose from 270,689 in 1980 to
330,701 in 1987. Heavy vehicles rose by 45S from 1980 to 1987 while light
vehicles increased by only 18Z in this period. The truck fleet, with one
truck per 360 inhabitants, is the second largest in the eastern and
southern part of the region after Kenya; the light vehicle fleet, with one
such vehicle per 33 inhabitants, is the largest in this part of the region.
Almost all cars and trucks sold in the country are produced by the domestic
motor vehicle industry which assembles vehicles from largely imported
components; some parts are manufactured locally.

Traffic Growth and characteristics
2.05     Since independence, traffic on Zimbabwe roads has increased
considerably, reflecting the growth in vehicle fleet. Traffic on the paved
road network outside urban areas averages about 700 vehicles per day (vpd)
with a large portion carrying over 1,000 vpd; about a third of this traffic
consists of trucks and buses. Traffic of heavy vehicles has increased more
rapidly than traffic of light vehicles, consistent with the relatively high
growth rate for the heavy vehicle fleet.   Nationally, heavy vehicle
traffic increased nearly 10% p.a. from 1979-1984, but the rate of increase
has apparently declined slightly since 1984.

C. The Road Transport Industry
Freight Transport
2.06     About 902 of freight transport by road is handled by manufacturing
enterprises and by other business firms which have their own vehicles. The
remaining 102 is carried by commiercial haulage firma who own only 102 to
152 of the heavy vehicles. Among these firms is the Road Motor Services, a
branch of NRZ. The commercial haulage industry is dominated by 10 to 15
large firms using relatively large trucks but there are more than 200 small
operators with only one or a few trucks; about 152 of the small firms lack
Government permits and thus operate illegally. Although the total capacity
of the 17,000 trucks in the commercial haulage industil is adequate, the
average age of the fleet is high with 552 of the trucks more than 10 years
old. This problem has led to high vehicle operating costs which, coupled
with a shortage of spare parts, makes truck operators unwilling to trivel
on bad roads, most of which are located in the communal areas. The project
includes road improvement programs that would improve road conditions in
these areas which should result in increased availability of transport
services there.
Passenger Transport
2.07     Rural and inter-urban bus services are provided by some 170 bus
operators with a total of 1,850 vehicles. One large bus company has three
subsidiaries in Zimbabwe operating a total of approximately 100 vehicles;
numerous other operators have one or a few buses. A very high degree of
standardization exists on a 76-seat bus design; as a result, relatively few
smaller buses and minibuses are available, even on short-distance routes or
feeder roads.
D. Government Regulation of Road Transport
Permit System
2.08     Permits are issued by the Controller of Road Motor Transportation
and are required for all freight transport for hire. The system is
complex; a permit may be granted for a certain area or route or for the
entire country, either for specified commodities or for all goods. Only a
few large truck operators have general nationwide permits. The NRZ Road
Motor Service is exempt from permit requirements. During periods of peak
demand for freight transport, permit requirements are relaxed and
consideration is being given to a more general relaxation of the permit
system in the interest of achieving greater economic efficiency in road
transport. NTS as well as the Bank's TSM have recommended removal of some
restrictions in goods transport and instead to replace the current permits
by operators' licenses. At negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government that it would relax regulation of trkacking services in two
steps: (1) by the end of December 1988, exempt commercial truck operators
from road service permits when hauling agricultufal products during peak
seasons, as well as all trucks below 10-tons cap city when operating within
and providing service to and from the communal ateas, and (2) by the end of
December 1989, replace the existing permit s9dtem with a system that
licenses an operator based primarily on vehicle safety and driver and



- 11 -
managerial competence considerations.   With these changes, it is expected
that the availability of trucking services in the communal lands would be
improved significantly. In the passenger tr-nsport fi-ld, a bus operator
is required to obtain a permit which specifies the route, size of vehicle
and period of operation. NTS containa appropriate recomendations for
improvements also of the passenger transport services and licensing aystem,
such as, introduction of new maxim-n fares for smaller buses operating
within a single administrative district area, and determination of standard
bus fares, as well as the number of bus permits issued for a route, to be
based on an average 602 load factor for operations on paved roads.
Control of Fuel Supply and Price
2.09     The availability and cost of gasoline and diesel fuel are vital to
the road transport industry and to other operators of motor vehicles.
Covernment control of the supply and price of these commodities has
substantial influence on the supply and cost of transport services. The
supply of fuel for transport has generally been adequate. In November
1987, the pump prices for regular gasoline and diesel in Harare were
Z$ 1.15 and Z$ 0.63 per liter, respectively, including taxes, which were
above the prevailing import parity prices. The tax component at that time
represented 462 of the cost of gasoline but only 19% of the cost of diesel.
Government has moved towards increasing the price of diesel by raising the
tax on diesel from 8.8 Z cents a liter to 11.8 Z cents a liter in 1985, but
the wide differential between gasoline and diesel fuel prices tends to
distort the relative demands for these fuels in the transport sector which
is suppressed by Governments's strong controls on the import of engines.
NTS had already recommended that diesel duties be raised. An Energy
Pricing Study, commissioned by the Government, was completed in January
1986. Its main conclusion regarding diesel fuel pricing was that the
prevailing retail price was too low to encourage economically efficient use
of diesel for transport services (e.g., through better vehicle utilization
and maintenance), or to invest in equipment, such as turbo chargers, which
can cut fuel consumption. Diesel pricing policy has to take account of
users in non-transport sectors as well, particularly the commercial and
agricultural sectors, and it is still under discussion within the
Government.
Regulation of Vehicle Weights
2.10     Maximum axle loadings for vehicles, as specified in vehicle weight
regulations, are designed to protect roads fromg severe damage.  The maximum
permissible load per single axle is 8.2 metric tons. Enforcement of the
regulations has been fair. Weighbridges are located in vehicle inspection
centers in all major towns, and loadometers have been positioned at other
strategic points on the road network. Vehicles entering the country with
overloaded axles are not allowed to proceed until the load has been reduced
or adjusted to comply with regulations.
Road Safety
2.11     The Government is concerned about the large number of accidents
involving motor vehicles. In 1986, a total of 19,777 road accidents
occurred in which 934 persons were killed.  From 1981 to 1986, the number



_ 12 -
of accidents increased an average of about 1X p.a.; the number of deaths
fell from 1,047 in 1981 to 934 in 1986. Intensive efforts of the Zimbabwe
Traffic Safety Board in recent years have apparently had a good effect.
Since 1983, the Board has expanded its staff, decentralized its operations,
augmented its driver education program and introduced a driver assessment
program. The Swedish Government has been assisting the Board since 1983 in
its efforts to improve road safety. No major changes in road saiety
legislation are required.
E. Administration of State Roads
Organization
2.12     The responsibility for planning, building and maintaining the
state road network rests with MOT; other agencies are responsible for the
remaining part of the overall road network (para 2.25). MOT has its
headquarters in Harare, and provincial offices have been established in the
seven provinces, each office headed by a provincial engineer. The
organizational structure of MOT (Chart 1) is satisfactory but there is a
lack of transport economists and the administration has been weakened by
the departure of many experienced engineers in recent years. A Swedish aid
project is providing engineers to fill some of the key vacancies and
assisting in strengthening the training program for MOT staff.
2.13     MOT does not have the responsibility for procurement, maintenance
and replacement of equipment and vehicles for road works; this function is
carried out by CMED in the Ministry of National Supplies (MNS), which rents
equipment to MOT (and to other user agencies). CMED has 6 main workshops,
15 minor workshops and 21 mobile repair units as well as . central
warehouse in Harare. Performance of the CMED repair facilities has
declined recently because of the loss of experienced staff, and
consequently MOT has had difficulty in carrying out its own road
maintenance and construction activities. CMED was intended to operate on a
commercial basis but its rental rates, subject to annual review and
approval by Treasury, are lower than comparable rental rates in the private
sector; CHED rental income is insufficient to cover its actual replacement
and repair costs. One consequence of the subnormal CMED rental rates is
that MOT road maintenance and construction works, carried out by force
account, are subsidized to some extent. Under the First Highway Project,
an agreement was reached with the Government that it would review
periodically tne equipment and vehicle hire rates CMED charges MOT. Some
increases have been made (the latest in July 1987, a 30Z increase) but the
adjustments have not been adequate since tLey only took into account past,
but not projected, increases in the costs of acquisition and repair.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to adopt the latter principle
and to review hire rates annually.
Road Maintenance
2.14     Maintenance of state roads is carried out by force account and
private contractors. Much of the state road system is maintained to a high
standard but other portions, particularly secondary and feeder roads, have
not been well maintained in recent years. A sizeable backlog of p~eriodic
maintenance (resealing and regravelling) has thus accumulated and the



- 13 -
project is designed to reduce this backlog substantially. Furthermore,
several sections of the paved roads have reached a stage where normal
periodic maintenance would no longer be sufficient but some rehabilitation
and, where traffic warrants it, strengthening would be required. The
projoct includes assistance for the rehabilitation and strengthening of
paved roads.
2.15     The road network is divided into maintenance sections of 50 to 250
km with a roads supervisor in charge of each section; the section work is
undertaken by a crew of 20 to 30 laborers, truck drivers and equipment
operators. The maintenance staff uses a manual which emphasizes the need
for good recordkeeping including regular updating of road maintenance
records and road inventory sheets; the manual specifies all the maintenance
tasks to be performed and the materials to be used. The provincial
engineer determines the equipment to be used in road maintenance and the
composition of crews. Cost estimates for planned maintenance work are
based on actual costs incurred for comparable work in the recent past,
subject to appropriate adjustments for inflation.
Road Planning
2.16     Planning for the state road network is carried out by the Planning
Branch (PB) in the Roads Department of MOT. It is responsible for the
preparation of a five-year development plan which provides the basis for
the highway component of the PSIP. An important consideration in the
planning process is the extensive record of traffic counts taken throughout
the year at many locations on the state road network, both by automatic
axle counters and by manual counts. PB's evaluation system for road
investments is sound; economic feasibUlity studies are presently carried
out with the assistance of consultants. The process of screening and
prioritizing investment proposals follows mainly economic criteria, such as
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Net Present Value (NPV). MOT prepares a
rolling five-year plan which is rolled forward annually. The current five-
year plan was reviewed during the preparation of TSM and found
satisfactory. Its successful implementation will result in an increase of
the proportion of paved state roads from 391 to 502 by 1990. MOT's plan is
to improve 4,200 km of roads within this time including (i) upgrading of
2,000 km to paved standard, (ii) upgrading of 270 km to all-weather gravel
standard, and (iii) reconstruction of nearly 1,900 km of paved and gravel
roads.
Engineering
2.17     PB also carries out most of the detailed engineering needed for
construction and improvement of state roads. It selects the routes,
locates materials and prepares plans for the work to be undertaken. MOT
sets and controls the design standards (see Annex 2) which follow good
engineering practice. Use of consultants for detailed engineering has
increased in recent years because of the shortage of MOT engineers and the
expanded program of road construction. Consultant firms established in the
country are, for the most part, branches of international firms
headquartered in UK or RSA. However, a few firms that are more strictly



- 14 -
local in character have been organized by former HOT engineers; they often
carry out studies and detailed engineering in association with foreign-
based firms.
Construction
2.18     Road construction has been undertaken both by force account and by
contract. Force account work is carried out by 8 construction units with a
total work force of 1,800 personnel.  Each unit is under the supervision of
a resident engineer and an assistant resident engineer and uses equipment
rented from CYED or private companies. A shortage of managerial personnel
has been a problem. The construction units operate under conditions
similar to contract work (bill of quantities with unit rates, supervision
by consultants, etc.) but the risk element and competition have been
removed. Performance of the units has varied. The Government is presently
undertaking studies on how to improve the performance of the construction
units. NTS contains recommendations regarding reductions both in the
number of units as well as in permanent labor. These recommendations are
presently under review. At negotiations, the Government agreed to prepare
an action plan to improve the current organizational structure of the
construction units; the action plan will be submitted to the Bank for its
review by December 31, 1988. The Government also agreed that it will take
all measures necessary to carry out road works in an efficient and cost-
effective manner on the basis of an appropriate mix of contractors and
construction units. In the project, the construction units will undertake
about 30% of the Bank-financed rehabilitation and resealing program. Force
account unit rates for disbursement purposes (para. 3.17) will be
determined based on the average unit rates obtained through competitive
bidding for similar works. The supervisory consultants would assist the
units in improving their operating efficiency through monitoring actual
expenditures and identifying ways and means to increase productivity.
2.19     Almost all the work contracted by MOT is done by locally-based
contractors who belong to the Zimbabwe Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors. Of the 51 such contractors, 23 are registered as local
contractors eligible for 10% preference in bidding on Government-financed
contracts. Many of the local contractors are spbsidiaries or associates of
foreign firms which have often lacked interest in bidding for road works in
Zimbabwe because of the small size of most contracts.
Expenditures on State Roads
2.20     Expenditures on construction and maintenance of state roads over
the fiscal years 1982-1988 are shown in Table 2.4. Administration
expenditures usually amount to 25-30% of the expenditures on construction
and maintenance. The amount expended on road maintenance during the period
up to FY 1986/87 increased only slightly in current prices; in real terms,
however, the expenditures declined, resulting in a large backlog of
periodic maintenance work.  The project will assist the Government in
reducing this backlog. To prevent further backlogs in the future, MOT has
agreed to increase the annual maintenance budget, and has already reflected
the first increase in the FY 1987/88 allocation.

Source: MOT and MFEPD
2.21     The expenditures for construction as shown in Table 2.4 include
contributions from a number of foreign donors. Donor funding for the
remaining three years of the five-year development plan (FY 1987/88 -
1989/90) will be provided by AfDB, BADUA, the Dutch, Kuwait Aid, and SIDA
for a total of over Z$ 100 million and about 1,000 km of secondary and
feeder roads. In addition, AfDB in September 1987 appraised a Rural Roads
Project which would upgrade about 200 km of secondary and feeder roads from
predominantly earth or bad gravel standard to low-cost, two-lane bitumen
standard.  These roads form part of the 6,000 km of roa s transferred in
1982 from DDF to MOT and are particularly important to the communal areas.
Revenues from Road Users
2.22     Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and
duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts and through fees for
vehicle registtation and inspection, road service permits, driving tests
and licenses, abnormal load permits and a surcharge on licensing fees for
all heavy vehicles. The major part of the road user revenue, by far,
derives from the taxes on fuel, especially the tax on gasoline (Table 2 5).
Total road user revenues from all sources are not easily available but an
estimate for FY 1984/85 is Z$ 289 million. This amount is substantially
higher than recent annual expenditures on roads (Table 2 4), indicating
that the road user charges adequately cover the variable economic cost
caused by road traffic, as they should, and also cover the fixed investment
cost for roads. The curren; difference in the level of duties applied to
petrol and diesel, however, results in passenger and light delivery
vehicles paying much higher road user chargOs than the heavy vehicles which
use diesel fuel.

F. Maintenance And Development Budget For State Roads
2.23     The lack of sufficient budget allocations in recent years for road
maintenance has been indicated above ( ara. 2.20); the resulting backlog of
periodic maintenance will be reduced but not eliminated altogether by the
project. The need to raise the annual maintenance budget to levels
consistent with the real needs for maintenance work on the road network has
been recognized by the Government. The budget allocations for road
maintenance in 1987/88 have been increased to Z$ 30 million, compared to Z$
22 million in 1986187, which is just about sufficient for MOT to resume
normal periodic maintenance activities. However,jsince MOT has decided to
finance the regravelling and low-cost improvement programs (Z$ 9 million
annually over the four-year program period) under the recurrent budget, the
allocations for each of the following four fiscal years should be increased
at least to Z$ 44 million (1988 price level). During negotiations, the
Bank and the Government agreed on these levels. This policy is consistent
with the TSM recommendations for the road sector: it increases the
maintenance budget to avoid build up of a new backlog and to enable spot
improvements. The combined effect of the project and the foregoing
increases in budget allocations will be to eliminate the maintenance
backlog by 1992. Technical assistance provided to MOT by Sweden is helping
to establish a more effective system for determining future budget needs
for road maintenante".
G. Training For Ministry Of| Transport
2.24     Departures of many experienced personnel from the MOT staff in
recent years have underlined the need for a; expanded training program to
enhance the capabilitles of the present sta Ef. Training of civil engineers
at the University of Zimbabwe, which began in 1974, has expanded to an
output of 20 graduates per year and this level will double by 1990,
according to current plans. MOT's Road Training Center (RTC) in Harare,
begun in the mid-sixties, provides training for technicians; the RTC
program was strengthened under the First Highway Project which financed
training aids and equipment. The primary training need now is for



- 17 -
upgrading the capabilities of engineering and managerial staff of MOT
through short-term courses in-country plus training courses in regional
institutions as well as appropriate institutions outside Africa. A
substantial program of training assistance, financed by Swedish aid, is in
progress.
H. Administration of District Roads
2.25     The responsitility for planning, construction and maintenance of
district roads ras.s heavily on DDF, a semi-autonomous agency under the
general administrative control of MLGRUD, District Councils, located in
communal areas, have virtually no capability for building and maintaining
roads. Rural Councils, in commercial farming areas, build and maintain
roads within their jurisdiction and their performance in this regard has
been good. Legislation is currently being considered in Parliament to
amalgamate District Councils and Rural Councils into Rural District
Councils (RDCs) and it is uncertain at this stage what provision will be
made for administration of roads under the new organization. One main
problem, which has been hampering the feeder road development in recent
years, has been a lack of coordination between MOT and DDF. NFRS (para.
1.20) recommended improvements in the institutional arrangements. These
recommendations, however, were formulated on the assumption that RDCs would
have been established so they are not implementable at this stage. Some
interim measures (regularly scheduled meetings between representatives from
MOT and DDF, both at Headquarters and in the provinces, preparation of
joint reports, etc.) have been proposed by TSM, and MOT is presently taking
steps to implement them.
2.26     A district road development program was initiated in 1984 to
construct a total of 14,000 km of so-called primary district roads
scattered through a large number of districts. Financing of this 5-year
program is provided by KfW (Federal Republic of Germany). The construction
work is largely carried out by DDF force account units and to a limited
extent by contractors. Total cost of the program is estimated at
Z$ 42 million and it is to be completed in 1991.   An important condition
of KfW's continued support of the project is that, as each section of road
is built, DDF will undertake to maintain it adequately with financing
entirely by the Zimbabwe Government.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
3.01     The primary objective of the project is to strengthan the state
road network in commercial farming areas as well as in communal lands by
reducing the backlog of the periodic maintenance of primary, secondary, and
feeder roads (par&. 2.14). This will contribute to preserving capital
invested in the road network, facilitat- road transport, lower vehicle
operating costs and help to improve trucking services in communal areas.
B. Description
3.02     The project comprises:
(a)  strengthening and rehabilitation of 9 sections of paved roads
totalling about 175 km;
(b)  resealing of about 1,500 km of paved roads;
(c)  regravelling of about 1,500 km of secondary and feeder roads;
(d)  low-cost improvement of about 1,400 km of secondary and
feeder roads;
(e)  consulting services for construction supervision of
(a) and (b).
Strenathenina and Rehabilitation of Paved Roads (175 km)
3.03     Nine widely scattered segments of the paved road network totalling
about 175 km require strengthening and rehabilitation (see Annex 3 and Map
IBRD 20678). Traffic volumes on the roads are heavy, mostly over 1,000
vpd. The project will reduce the existing maintenance backlog on these
main arteries. In August 1987, detailed engineering by consultants
financed from MOT's own resources was completed for 47 km of these roads,
comprising the first year's program.
Resealing of Paved Roads (1,500 km)
3.04     This project component comprises resealing of about 1,500 km of
paved state roads or about 212 of the total length of paved state roads in
the country. Insufficient funding of resealing work in recent years has
resulted in a backlog of such work and the com*onent will help alleviate
this burden. Traffic volumes on the 1,500 km 4f roads are relatively heavy
as the routes include some of the most important arteries in Zimbabwe.   A
detailed four-year program of the roads to be resealed has been prepared by
MOT (Annex 4 and Map IBRD 20678).



- 19 -
RearavellinA of Secondxrv and Feoder Roads" (1.500 Ik)
3.05     Since MOT has done virtually no regrave lling In recent years, a
large backlog exists and *bout 1,500 km of grave* roads are in particular
need of this work. NOT has prepared a detailed Orogram for their
implementation over a four-year period (Annex 5 and Map IbRD 20679).
Low-Cost Imorovements of Secondary and Feeder Roads (1.400 km)
3.06     About 1,400 km of the 6,000 km of feeder and secondary roads
transferred to MOT in 1982 (para. 2.02) are In poor condition but traffic
is light (on average about 60 vpd) and, therefore, full rehabilitation
works on them cannot be justified at this tme.  The utility of these roads
will be raised substantially, however, by a progrm oi low-cost
improvements in which the worat conditions as identified by HOT's
provincial engineers are iproved, especially at river crossings, with
minimal expenditure. Detailed engineering for such works is not required;
a detailed four-year program for this project component can be found in
Annex 6 and Map IBRD 20679.
Consulti naServices
3.07     Consultants will supervise the strengthening, rehabilitation and
resealing of paved roads; an estimated 300 man-months of consultants work
will be required. MOT will assure adequate supervision of the regravelling
and low-cost improvements.
3.08     Consultants would be needed for completing detailed engineering
for the last three years of the four-year program for the rehabilitation
and strengthening of paved roads. This work will be financod by the
Government.
C. Prolect Costs and Financing
Proiect Costs
3.09     The total project cost, including price and physical
contingencies, is estimated to be US$86.4 million with a foreign exchange
cost of US$47.1 million or 552 of the total coet (Table 3.1). The total
cost, net of taxes and duties, is US$71.7 million.  The base cost estimate
reflects March 1988 prices. Price escalation based on rates shown below
has been included in the project cost estimates

It is *ssumed that divergence between local and foreign cost escalation
will be corrected by exchange rate adjustments. Post experience on highway
projects in the region suggests that the length of the implemontation
period will be seven years and the disbursement schedule is based on this.
The Government is, however, planning to implement the project in accordance
with the target implementation schedule (para. 3.13), which would reduce
the costs by 81 or from US$86.4 million to US$79.5 million.
3.10     Cost estimates for the civil works were based on actual costs for
comparable works in Zimbabwe or in neighboring countries. Costs per km for
various civil works components are estimated as follows:
Average cost
Component                                per km (USS)
Strengthening/Rehabilitation of Paved Roads           116,000
Resealing                                               12,370
Regravelling                                            8,720
Low-cost Improvements                                   4,830
3.11     The cost estimates for the consulting services for supervision
included in the project are based on recent experience in Zimbabwe, namely,
corresponding to about 8Z of the estimated cost of the road works, which is
reasonable and in line with experience from other countries in the region.
3.12     The foreign exchange cost of the project, estimated at
US$47.1 million, is to be financed by the World Bank and the Zimbabwe
Government as follows:
USS million 2
World Bank                                 32.7      69
Zimbabwe Government                        14.4      31
Total                                47.1      100
All local costs, estimated to be US$39.3 million equivalent, will be
financed by the Government.
D. Implementation
3.13     MOT will be responsible for execution of all project components.
A target schedule (Annex 7) for project implementation is based on the
expectation that such activities will begin in July 1988 and that four
years will be required to complete the works for aXl components which is in
accordance with the Government's plans. The detailed target implementation
schedule for the project was agreed between the Bank and the Government
during negotiations.

Notes:   Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts
financed by the Bank.
3.15     The civil works components of the project will be carried out
partly by contractors and partly by construction units of MOT. The Bank-
financed rehabilitation and resealing programs will be carried out mainly
by contractors. However, to ensure a cost-effective use of HOT's own
resources (para. 2.18), which cannot be reduced in the short term, a minor
part of the work, limited to 30X of total cost for1the two programs, will
be carried out by MOT's construction units on force account basis because
the works are small and must be carried out without disruption of ongoing
operations. To the extent practicable, the Bank-financed civil works to be
carried out by contract shall be grouped in contracts estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$1.0 million or more. Contracts will be based on unit
prices. All contracts to be financed by the World Bank and estimated to
cost more than US$1.0 million will be awarded after international
competitive bidding (ICB), including prequalification of contractors, in
accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A number of the contracts will be
for works in scattered locations and small enough (under US$1.0 million) to
encourage the participation of local contractors and will be awarded after



-23-
local competitive bidding following procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Contracts for civil works under ICB financed by the World Bank will be
subject to the Bank's prior review and approval of the bidding documents.
For civil works under LCB, MOT will use standardized bid documents and
contracts acceptable to the Bank.  Individual LCB bid documents and
contracts will not be reviewed routinely by the Bank but MOT will maintain
copies of the bid evaluation and awarded contracts for the Bank's
inspection.
3.16     The contracts for consultant services to be financed by the World
Bank will be awarded in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants, August 1981.
F. Disbursements
3.17     The loan funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 552 of the total expenditures on civil works by contract in
the rehabilitation and resealing programs;
(b) 552 of the total cost of each road section by force account
in the rehabilitation and resealing programs;
(c) 752 of the total expenditures on consultant services for the
rehabilitation and resealing programs.
Disbursements for civil works procured under ICB and for consulting
services would be documented by contract. For civil works procured under
LCB and by force account, disbursements would be made based on statements
of expenditures (SOE); for force account works, SOE would be based on
Ustatement of works carried out' certified by the supervisory consultants,
and the unit rates determined based on either LCB or ICB contracts for
similar works (average rates for all contracts awarded over the previous 12
months period), whichever is the most economical. Price escalation for
force account work will be calculated in the same manner as for contract
work.
3.18     The estimated schedule of disbursements of the World Bank loan is
given in the table below. This schedule is based on experience with
disbursements under Bank-financed highway projects1in the region. In order
to expedite disbursements of funds under the abovelcategories of the loan,
a special account with an initial deposit of US$2.0 million (an amount
roughly equivalent to four months estimated expenditures in US dollars)
will be established and maintained by the Government in the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. The Special Account will be replenished by the Bank in
accordance with agreed procedures.

G. Accounting. Auditing and geiortina Requirements
3.19     Project accounts, including statements of expenditures, will be
maintained by H4OT with separate accounts for each component. In the
previous Bank Group project, accounts have been audited by the Comptroller
and the Auditor-General; as this arrangement has proved satisfactory, it
will also be followed for the current project. During negotiations, the
Government agr-ed to have all project accounts audited by the Comptroller
and the Auditor-General and to have audited accounts, together with the
Auditor's reports, submitted to the Bank not later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year. Agreement was also reached with the Government
on the content and timing of quarterly progress reports and the submission
of the project completion report, in a form satisfactory to the Bank, not
later than six mcaths after the project closing date.
H. Environmental Impact
3.20     No adverse environmental impact is expected to result from the
project. The roads subject to rehabilitation, strengthening and low-cost
improvements will have improved drainage facilities which will benefit the
immediate surrownding land. Improved surfacing and wider and improved
shoulders will contribute to road safety.



- 26 -
IV. ECONOHIC JUSTIFICATION
A. General
4.01     The project is consistent withisectoral development objectives
(para. 1.16) and is designed to reduce the *xisting backlog in periodic
road maintenance (par&. 2.14). It should have a substantial impact on the
overall economy through reduction in transport costs on both main and
secondary roads. Communal areas will benefit from the improvements in
secondary and feeder roads and the improved trucking services. Reduced
vehicle operating costs will provide an incentive for truckers to service
these areas more frequently and at lower costs, thus stimulating
agricultural production in the communal lands. The more developed
commercial farm areas and urban centers will benefit from the improved
surfacing of many roads to be strengthened, rehabilitated, resealed,
regravelled or otherwise improved. By strengthening some of the roads now
rather than later, higher rehabilitation and periodic maintenance costs in
the future are also avoided.
4.02     The Government is planning to implement the project over a four-
year period starting FY 1988/89 in accordance with the target
implementation schedule. In September 1987, MOT provided a list of all
sections to be included in the entire project (see Annexes 3 - 6); detailed
analysis has been done on sections to be included in the first-year
program. The construction costs include a 10 physical contingency and,
for the Bank-financed and supervised components, an additional 82 for
supervision. Traffic forecasts for individual road sections are based on
consultants' studies incorporating future geographical population
distribution, changes in income and income distribution and estimates about
consumption and production as well as international goods traffic within
each zone. Where no detailed studies were available on small individual
road sections, the national average for that type of road was assumed. It
was further assumed that the maintenance operations would neither generate
new traffic nor divert traffic from other roads. The average rate of
traffic growth was thus calculated at 42 p.a. Economic vehicle operating
costs (voc) are calculated for different road categories, road standards
and terrain types (see Annex 8). Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been
calculated individually for each road section. The proportions of the
total investment costs, ERRs, and NPVs for the four components of the
proposed first-year program are as follows:

Total Investments             100         36        53.8     46.6
All of the foregoing rates of return are satisfactory.  The economic rate
of return for the entire first-year program calculated as the weighted
average of the individual rates of return is 36%. Comparable returns are
expected for subsequent programs of similar type road works. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that specific Bank approval will be
required before any road section can be included in a program subsequent to
the first-year program and the principal criterion for determining
eligibility for such inclusion will be that the planned works yield at
least a 122 ERR.
B. Economic Evaluation of Proiect Components
Strenathening and Rehabilitation of Paved Roads
4.03     The nine paved road sections included in the project for
strengthening and rehabilitation ate some of the most important segments of
the highway network, carrying relatively large volumes of traffic (between
350 and 3,000 vehicles per day). Domestic commerce depends heavily on the
capability of the country's trunk roads to handle traffic efficiently.
Some of the roads are also frequently used by international truck
transport.   The roads included in this component need either strengthening
or rehabilitation to prevent rapid deterioration and consequent sharp
increases in vehicle operating and maintenance costs. At the current age
of the pavement, the high level of traffic and/or high proportion of heavy
trucks, it is expected that a further deferment of this rehabilitation
would make the complete reconstruction of these major arteries unavoidable
after five years. The rehabilitation would reduce the road roughness from
an average 4,000 m to 2,500 mm. The benefits of the project are thus
threefold: savings in vehicle operating costs from reduced road roughness
with beneficiaries extending to virtually all segments of the country's
population; benefits from savings in road maintenance costs; and benefits
in terms of the avoided higher costs of later reconstruction. Savings in
accident costs are expected but have not been quantified. The economic
life of the capital investment in road rehabilitation is assumed to be 20
years. Costs include 10% for physical contingencies and 82 for
supervision. Costs and benefits are expressed in constant 1988 prices.
The Z$ 42.1 million for this component represent 35% of the total project
base cost and physical contingencies.



- 28 -
4.04     Annex 9 shows the projected traffic, the construction costs, and
the economic rates of return for each road section to be included in the
first-year package. The average ERR for these sections is calculated at
24%.  The ERRs for the three sections to be completed in the first year are
26%, 14% and 26%.
Resealing
4.05     Resealing of paved roads constitutes essential periodic
maintenance to prevent premature deterioration of the roads.   The 1,500 km
to be resealed under the project will thus preserve the capital investment.
Without this component, the economic life of the roads would be reduced;
roughness, and consequently vehicle operating costs, would rise. Since the
road sections have not been resealed for at least 10 years, they will
deteriorate rapidly if resealing is not carried out. Their present
roughness is assumed to be 4,000 mm per km. To prevent the road roughness
from increasing to unacceptable levels on' these major roads, an estimated
20% of their surface will need rehabilitation after about 5 years and
another 25% after 10 years if it is not resealed now. Thus the main
benefits from undertaking the resealing component would be the savings in
vehicle operating costs from a reduction in road roughness to 2,000 mm per
km and savings in rehabilitation costs. Additional benefits will occur
from savings in maintenance costs; without the resealing, future
maintenance costs will rise as more routine maintenance efforts will be
required. Assuming an economic life of 10 years, the resealing will yield
an average ERR of 58%. The individual ERRs for the first-year package
range from 29% to 107% (see Annex 10 for details). The costs of this
component amount to Z$ 39.4 million representing 33% of total project base
costs and physical contingencies.
Regravelling
4.06     Regravelling of about 1,500 km of roads will result in significant
savings in vehicle operating costs which will translate into widespread
benefits in Zimbabwe, particularly for the population in rural areas far
removed from the main centers. Withholding regravelling may cause the
gravel roads to lose surface material and ultimately revert to an earth
road. Taking into account the differences in vehicle operating costs on
poor and good gravel roads (with a roughness oc' 10,000 mm and 6,000 mm per
km, respectively), projected traffic levels and the costs of regravelling,
the component over an assumed seven year economic life is expected to yield
an ERR of 28%. ERRs on individual road sections range from 16Z to 68%.
The base costs and contingencies for this component of the project are
Z$ 25.7 million over four years representing 21% of the total project base
costs and physical contingencies (see Annex 11 for detailed information on
the individual road sections).
Low-Cost Improvements of Roads
4.07     The about 1,400 km of roads included in the project for low-cost
improvements are in poor condition, causing high vehicle operating costs
and, at certain times and places,  nterruptions in traffic flow.   While
these roads are not major arteries of the highway network, they are vital



- 29 -
means of transport in rural areas, particularly communal areas.   Traffic
levels vary from 10 to 200 vehicles per day; the average traffic level is
about 60 vehicles per day. The base costs and physical contingencies of
these improvements amount to Z$ 13.3 million, representing 11% of the total
project base costs and contingencies.
4.08     The primary benefits from the low-cost improvements will be
savings in vehicle operating costs, which, in Zimbabwe's competitive
transport environment, will largely be passed on to shippers and consumers.
At present, the roads generally have a poor gravel surface with many
sections having severe structural damage to the roadway itself and related
drainage facilities.   The improvements w 11 overcome the worst of these
conditions and consequently reduce vehicl4  operating costs.  Taking into
account these savings, traffic forecasts, an average economic life of the
improvements of 5 years, and the costs including a 10% physical
contingency, the ERR of this project component is estimated to be 37% (see
Annex 12 for detailed calculations).
C. Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
4.09     The sensitiv'ty of economic returns to variations in the estimated
costs and benefits was determined and the results indicate that for
individual components none of the ERRs would fall to unacceptable levels if
project costs for the component were increased by 21%. Similarly, if one
assumes traffic benefits 15% lower than those underlying the basic ERR
estimates (due to either lower traffic growth or lower operating cost
savings per vehicle), the ERRs would not fall below 15% for any component.
Even with a combined 15% increase in construction costs and 15% lower
traffic benefits, the returns on individual components do not fall below
18%. For the three sensitivity analyses, the overall return of the entire
project ranges from 28% to 32% (Annex 13). Further sensitivity analyses
were undertaken using shadow prices to reflect distortions in the economy
owing to the trade regime and the labor market. This was considered
necessary because the official exchange rate understates the scarcity value
of foreign exchange and because formal sector wages are substantially above
the opportunity cost of unskilled labor. As the foreign exchange content
is, however, slightly higher on the benefit than on the cost side and the
proportion of unskilled labor used in this sector is low, the effect of
shadow pricing on the ERRs is small and positive.
4.10     The principal risk associated with the project is that actual
project costs may be higher than the estimates.   However, the availability
of substantial recent cost experience for comparable works indicates that
this risk is small and tolerable and the sensitivity analysis shows that a
considerable price increase would still leave the project viable. The
above calculations assume that there will be no delay in the implementation
of the first-year package. Since the experience in the region (para. 3.09)
shows that delays are frequent, alternative calculations were made under
the assumption that it will take two years to complete all sections
included in the first-year program. The change in the overall ERR of the
project as well as that of the individual components is, however,
negligible (Annex 14).
