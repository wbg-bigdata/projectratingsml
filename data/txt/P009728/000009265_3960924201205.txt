PROJECT COMP'.STION REPORT
INDIA KARMATAKA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 788-IN)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report reviews the Karnataka Irrigation
Project in India for which an IDA Credit of US$126.0 million was approved
on April 4, 1978. US$8.4 million of the Credit was cancelled in June 1979
due to cancellation of tunnels from financing. Although the original
official closing date was March 31, 1984, it had to be extended by two
years due to revision of the project, delays in land acquisition and
procurement. The final disbursement under Credit 788-IN was made on
September 30, 1986.
This report was prepared by an FAO/CP mission that visited India
in September/October 1986, in close collaboration with Bank staff that
prepared a second phase project for possible Bank financing. Additional
sources of information included Karnataka Irrigation Staff Appraisal Report
No. 1835a-IN of Match 15. 1978, the Project and Development Credit
Agreements of Mry 12, 1978, eleven supervision reports (1978-86),
correspondence in the South Asia Information Center and discussion with
staff associated with the project. The report's main conclusions have been
discussed with the Borrower.
A draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on September 7, 1988 and the
comments received from the Government of Karnataka are attached as Annex 1
and comments received from the Government of India are attached as Annex 2.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
|      ~~Introduction
The Karnataka Irrigation Project was des&gned to help complete Phase 1 of the first
Stage of the development of the Upper Krishna Project, which has been concei. -ialized as a
long-tem development program to irrigate the Indiai state of Karnataka's drought prone
northern districts from water of the Krishna river.The implementation of the Upper Krishna
Project is envisaged in two Stages. Implementation of Stage 1 has been divided into a
number of Phases to take account of the large area to be developed, and the Government of
Karnataka's implementation capacity. Phase 1 commenced in the mid 1960s and was
expected to be completed under this project.
3bjectives
The project aimed at bringing irrigation to about 100,000 ha by financing (a) civil
works associated with the construction of two dams at Narayanpur and Almatti; (b)
associated distributary canals, latermls and field channeLs; (c) on-farn development on about
25,000 ha; (d) construction of abcut 530 km of new roads and the improvement of about
70 km; (e) an agricultural development center, and (f) agricultural support services. In
addition the project was expected to provide for the resettlement and rehabilitation of about
13,000 families disvlaced by the construction of the two reservoirs. The total cost of the
project was esdmated at US$ 284.4 .million of which about 44 percent or US$126 million
w is to be financed by the IDA crA-it.The credit was expected to be disbursed in 5 years.
Implementation Ex2ience
The main implementation problems faced by the project were as follows: (a)
inadequate planning and procurement (far too many small contracts) practices; (b)
management and staffing weaknesses characterized by lack of accountability and
responsibility in managers and inadequately trained and insufficient staff; and (c)
insufficient understanding of the magnitude and complexity of the resettlement and
rehabilitation operations which resulted in this operation being poorly designed, funded and
executed. In addition the construction of the Almatti dam was premature as its need for
irrigation requirements was not necessary in Phase L Consequently, even after 3 one year
extensions of the Credit closing date the infrastructure was not completed and there were
serious costs overruns. At Credit closure, actual expenditures incurred were more than 50%
higher in rupee terms and more than 35% higher in US$ terms(due to the depreciation of the
rupee). About 82 percent of the civil works proposed under he project had been completed
and about 60 percent of the target had been reached in providing irrigation waters to
farmers. Actual disbursements under the Credit totalled US$117.6 million and US$ 8.4
million was cancelled because of misprocurement of the construction of two tunnels on the
main irrigation system.
EWUDa 1W
At completion the project had already had a significant impact in the project area.
Agricultural production has increased and with it, the incomes of direcdy benefitting



farmers. Nutyitional levels among the population is increasing as seen by an increase in
quantity and varietv of food in the local markets.This trend is cxpxcted to continue and
expand. On the negative side, the most serious impact has been on the project's displaced
population. Available evidence suggests that most of the people affected by the project
suffered a deteric;rzdon in their standard of living and in some cases in their social status.
Landless laborrs have been particularly hard hit as a result of the loss of productive land
base and c..nequent lower demand for labor in an increasingly competitive labor market
with the entrance of fonner small land owners. The PCR estimates the economnic rate of
return (ERR) of the Narayanpur dam system to be 9.5%. This is strictly not comparable to
the appraisal estimate of 16% for the entire stage I of the Upper Krishna Scheme (UKS). A
more comparable estimate is the one made in the PCR (8.5%) for a situation where no
further work is done on the Almatti dam wiLh that made at appraisal (10%O) for a situation
where no further development of the UKS takes place.T7 - . re-estimated ERR(s) at Credit
closure are lower than those estimated at appraisal.HowevWr, non-quantifiable benefits
would accrue to non-farmer beneficiaries from the project and to other users of the village
road network created.
Sustainabilq
At completion there was reason to be confident that the project would be sustainable.
Indeed two years after credit closing the Phase I irrigation wgets have been achieved. The
introduction of suitable cultivation and water management pracdces in Phase I has laid the
foundation for more efficient future development, soil conservation and for an effective and
equitable use of water resources.In addidon, in the preparation and appraisal of a follow up
poject, attention has been focussed on improving the recovery of costs incurred during the
upenauiun and maintenance of tie irrigapion systems. Consequently, it is envisaged that
financially too, the project would become increasingly self- sustaining. Encouraging
progress has also been made in the follow up project in defining a more atdonal and
detailed insdtutional and legal framework to implement a coherent resettlement and
rehabilitation program Consequendy, there is reason to be confident that costs associated
with population displacement would also be minimized in future efforts.
Findings and Lessons
Several findings and lessons emerge from the project experience. On the irrigation
side,a common denominator of many of the deficiencies encountered during implementation
was the weak institutionad base which was reflected in the lack of effective project
management and lack of accountability at all levels. It is clear that design and construction
must be improved and that staff turnover must be reduced by proper incentives and the
provision of facilites. The harsher lessons were however, leamed in attempting to deal with
the human displacement problem Involuntary resettlement of populations affected by the
submergence of their habitat for irrigation, power and other puwposes is a consequence of
tie development of water resources to meet the needs of a growing population. However, it
is clear that resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected families should also be one of
the major objectives of such a development process. The lessons learned under this project
clearly indicates that a coherent, well planned and designed resettlement plan should be
formulated and implemented in projects of this nature.

KARNATAKA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 788-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTROOUCTION
1.1      Karnataka,  located  in  the  southwestern  part  of   the   Deccan
peninsula, has a population of 37 million (1981 census) of which about 70%
are engaged in agriculture. Its cultivable area is estimated to be 12.6
million ha out of the State's total area of 19.i million ha. In 1983/84, the
net area sown to crops was 10.6 million ha and the gross food grain
production reached 7 million tons, of which the main components were rice
(2.3 million tons), sorghum (1.8 million tons), millet (2.5 million tons)
and other grains (0.4 million tons). In dry years, however, food production
is substantially less and given the expected population growth, significant
increases in the production of foodgra1ns will be necessary in the future.
1.2     According  to  area  sown  in  1984/85, sorghum (jowar) is the most
important crop, with some 2.1 million ha annually. Finger millet (ragi) and
paddy come next with about 1.0 million ha each, pearl millet (bajra) with
about 0.4 million ha, and then wheat and minor millets with about 0.3
million ha each. About 1.4 million ha were planted to pulses. Of the
connercial crops, cotton with about 1.1 million ha, was the  most  important
crop, followed by sugarcane 0.9 million ha and groundnut 0.7 million ha.
Coffee and tea are grown in the mountains running parallel to the west coast
(Western Ghats).
1.3     At  least  50% of the state Is drought prone and supports about 50%
of the population. The total area covered by irrigation is about 2.5 million
hag with an net area actually irrigated in 1983/84 of 1.6 million ha. In
view of the higl risk of drought east of the Ghats, high priority  is  given
to  incrusing  thte are  Irrigated. The ultimate potential for Irrigation,
'includtiSuse of groundwater, has been assessed at 5.5 million ha, of which
the Krishns basin provides the largest potential contribution of 3.S million
ha. Within the Krishna basin, the Tungabhadra scheme is nearing completion
and the Ghataprabha, Malaprabha Schemes and the Upper Krishna Project are
under construction. (Figure 1).
l.4      The  Ka.r%taka  Irrigation  Project  (KIP), the  subject  of  this
completion repdrt, comprises a phase of the development of the Upper Krishna
Scbn (UKS) as well as minor works in the Malaprabha and Ghataprabha
Schemes. The Upper Krishna Scheme has been under construction since the
1960s; the first stage Involves the construction of two dams and the
irrigation of 425,000 ha; it is expected that further stages will increase
the area irrigated. KIP included the completion of irrigation of 105,000 ha
in UKS: the estimated cost of KIP was USS284.4 million of which USS126
million was to be financed by an TDA credit.



2
1.5      The major difference  between  the  project  constructed  and  that
considered at appraisal is the omission of the completion of one of the two
dams, which is not required for irrigation of the works included in KIP.
1.6      This report Is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR
no. 1835a-IN dated March 15, 1978), the ProJect Development, Credit and AROC
Agreements, IDA Supervision Reports, and data compiled by the Government of
KarnAtaka (GOK). The project was discussed with staff of GOK, Irrigation
Department (ID), Command Area Development Authority (CADA) and IOA during a
visit to Delhi and Karnataka in September and October 1986.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Project Identification and Preparatlon
2.1      As  originally  proposed  the  Karnataka  Irrigation Project was to
include Irrigation infrastructure and land development in each of the
ongoing Upper Krishna, Ghataprabha, Malaprabha and Tungabhadra schemes. In
1976, the project scope was changed, partly at the suggestion of GOI and
partly because of the already advanced stage of the Ghataprabha and
Malaprabha projects: the nature of the work at Tunghabadra, remedial work
on canals, drainage and improvement in land development in areas already
under irrigation, would have required more attention in project preparation
than could be provided at that time. It was suggested that the substantial
works to be carried out in proposed further stages or extensions of
Ghataprabha and Malaprabha and in improvements and extensions to Tunghabadra
might be included in a future Karnataka II project and only field channels
and on-farm development in Ghataprabha and Malaprabha be included in
Karnataka I.
2.2      In determining the extent of  Upper  Krishna  scheme  works  to  be
included ia Karnataka I project, considerations were the wish of the
Government of India (C21) to limit the duration and cost of the first phase
of the project, nd on the other hand the need to carry the canal system far
enough to bring in a stgn1ftcanta rea of irrigated comeand.
2.3      The project was prepared Largely by GOK with coLlaboration by the
FAO/WorLd Bank Cooperative Programme, who presented a draft report of the
Karnataka I Irrigation and CAD project in March 1977. The preparation report
covered a project which was substantiaLLy the same as that appraised.
Agrsj saL
2.4      The project was appraised by a WorLd Bank mission which visited
India in September 1977 and reported in March 1978 (Rep 1835a-IN), and
considered, inter alia, two major issues.
2.5      The Bank's invoLvement in major irrigation projects, which typi-
caLly take 15-20 years to implement, necessaritly involves "time-sLice"
financing.  The risk invoLved in "time-sLico  financing is that either the
Government wiLL not complete the project or it wiLL be compLeted at such a
sLow rate that it affects the viabiLity of the project. The issue was
discussed with GOK and the mission received assurances that GOK wouLd con-
tinue to finance project implementation according to the agreed scheduLe at
a rate not Less than th. Lavel nf *  er i+1r  r *  * 9nfl 4   4   4 v    1



3
2.6      Repayment of project costs  (infrastructure  and  land  development
costs) by the farmer at present rates of water charges and terms of credit
for land development, woulo be equivalent to about 30% of project rent at
full development. The GOK was implementing a Bettermert Charges Act which
would assess a betterment charge of about Rs3,700 per ha to be recovered
over 20 years. This would increase the total payable by the farmers to about
40% of project rent.
The ApDraised ProJect
2.7      The Upper Krishna Scheme includes two impounding reser-lirs, canals
and related works to irrigate an area of 425,000 ha In the fl .   stage  with
the possibility of extending the area to at least 660,000 ha later.
Construction began in 1962 and at appraisal in 1978 It was proposed that the
IDA project would comprise a five years phase of the development of the
Upper Krishna Scheme, referred to as Phase I of Stage I <D, and minor works
in the nearby but separate Malaprabha and Ghataprabha schemes.
2.8      Under  the  project,  it  was expected that the pace of development
would be accelerated significantly in comparison with the performance of the
past, and improvements would be made both in the design and construction
standards employed and in the organizational and administrative arrangements
for command area development. By completion of the project investments in
1983, about 105,000 <2' ha of the potential UKS cultivable command area of
about 425,000 ha would be irrigated. Optimization of returns on all
investmentb in UKS would be achieved by the development of irrigation in the
full Stage I cultivable command area of 425,000 ha, in which case an
economic rate of return of 16% was indicated. The SAR stated that it was the
intention of GOI and GOK to complete Stage I of UKS as promptly as possible.
A period of 15 years, including the five years of the project, would be
required.
2.9      Ouring  the  five  years in which the project was to be implemented
the following activities were to be undertaken:
A. Within Upper Krishna Scheme
1) The completion of Almattt and Narayanpur dams. Almatti dam would
have  a  full reservoir level of 512 m with spillway crest at level
500   above se level4
11) The-completlon  of  Narayanpur  Left  Bank   Canal   (NLBC)   from
approximately 3& to 78 kh, including the Rajankollur tunnel (3 km)
and the Gundalgera tunnel (I kh); and the construction of Shahapur
branch canal (SBC)(76 kn).
111) The construction of lined/stabilized irrigation distribution system
and drainage system. to serve an area of about 105 ,0.M ha.
!  -- - - -Phase II of Stage I is now being considered for World Bank
financing. For details of areas see Table 1.
<2b      105,000 ha is the area stated In SAP to be irrigated. However field
channels would be completed for say 8O.UOO na (including pre-Phase
I anea  by 1983.



4
iv) The construction of lined/stablized field irrigation channels to
individual farms serving an area of about 80,000 ha.
v) The rehabilitation and upgrading of about 70 kt of existing village
and link roads and the construction of about 530 km of new village
and link rogds.
vi) Tile construction of field drainage channels and on-farm works
including land shaping, farm irrigation and farm drainage ditches
for about 2i,000 ha. The establishment of a Land Development
Training Centre to train staff- on the design, execution, and
operation and management of land development works.
vii) Implementation   of   a  programme  of  monitoring  the water  use
efficiencies and economic and social impact of the project.
viii) Resettlement of familie: displaced  due  to  construction of  dams
under the project.
ix) Establishment of an agricultural development centre, agricultural
research stations and other facilities.
x) ProcL.ement of vehicles and equipment for road construction,
operation   and   maintenance,   agricultural  services,  the  Land
Development Training Centre and project monitoring.
8. Within Mal.prabha and GhataPrabha Schemes
2.10     Construction  of  lined/stabilized field Irrigation channels, field
drainage channels, and on-farm works including land shaping, farm irrigation
and farm drainage ditches, for about 26,000 ha in Malaprabha and about 5000
ha in Ghataprabha.
2.11     The project would be implemented by  the  Goveroment  of  Karnataka
with the Irrigation Department responsible for major construction and
Command Area Oevelopment Authorities (CADA) responsible for field channels,
on-farm development and agricultural aspects of the project.
.2.12    The  project cost was estimated to be USS284.4 million of which 44X
was to be financed by the IDA credit of US$126 million. Annual agricultural
production lncreases by UKS at fu)T development of 423,000 ha (about year
2000) were estiated to be 765,000 tons of foodgrain, 109,000 tons of
cotton, 110,000 tons of oilseeds and 11,500 tons of chillies. It was
estimated that UKS would Increase on-fare employment from about 20 to 45
million man-days, equivalent to the creation of about 83,000 full time jobs.
The incoi of 4 family with a median holding of 4 ha was estimated to
increase from Rs600/year to about Rs3,30/year. The income of a landless
l#arer was estimated to double or triple with the project.
Neuotiations
2.13     Negotiations were held in Washington DC in February and March  1978
between  delegations  from  G0I,  60K  and  the  Agricultural  Refinance and
Development Corporation (AROC) on the one hand and IDA on the other. GOP
explained its policy for resettlelment and rehabilitation of persons whose
lands are submerged. The delegations  discuss"d  60I's  subsidy  scheme  for
small farmers. It was agreed that the Central Water Commission (CWC) would
arrange supervision of quality cont ol of Na a.vapur and Almatti dams ano



5
NLBC tunnels and that the density, classification and specification of new
roads would be reviewed and discussed during review missions. Agreement was
reached on. the lining of small canals, the omission of ongoing contracts
from the Credit, strengthening of extension services and the inspection of
completed das. The Credit Agreement was signed on 12 May, 1978.
|II.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
ProJect Start-Up
3.1      IDA found at the end of May 1978 that overall  progress  since  the
appraisal mission was generally satisfactory in particular regarding budget
allocations,  staffing,  and  construction  progress.   The   Command   Area
Development Authority Administrator had set up his headquarters in Gulbarga.
Following authorization and ratification of the Project Agreement by GOK and
of the AROC Agreement the credit became effective in August 1978.
Revisions to the ProJect
3.2      In describing the construction of Atmatti dam, the SAR gives the
spiLLway crest at EL. 500 m, fuLL    reservoir LeveL (FRL) 512 m but does
not mention that these were intermediate eLevations, as the dam had been
designed to an uLtimate FRL 524 m. Since the project began, Almatti's
spiLLway crest has been changed twice. In 1982 the spilLway crest eLeva-
tion was changed to 512 m instead of 500 m, but in 1985, after considering
the time when ALmatti's storage contribution wouLd be required, it was
decided to construct the spiLLway crest to eLevation 509 m under a subse-
quent Phase II project. Almatti dam is not required for irrigation of the
Phase I area and outstanding works required for its compLetion have been
excLuded from Phase I.
3.3      The irrigation network has generaLLy been buiLt in accordance with
SAR proposals but as a resuLt of more detaiLed survey the cuLtivabLe command
area is in the order of 6X smaLLer than estimated at appraisaL. Other
changes incLude the Lining of smaLL canals in bLack cotton (SC) soiLs:
murrum Lining alone was considered impracticabLe and sLab Lining was subs-
tituted. ALL fieLd irrigation channeLs have been Lined with concrete or
stone sLabs.  Areas completed earLy in the project have gated outLets to the
fieLd channeLs but the design was altered in 1984 to reduce the number of
gates and to simpLify operation and maintenance by providing outlet moduLes,
designed to deliver a proportionaL fLow of water to the size of the served
area. In order to match water suppLies with demands, the SAR proposed the
instaLLation of a flow measuring device at the head of NLBC and each distri-
butary but these have not been constructed. Because of generaLly favorabLe
reLief for naturaL drainage, no drains were built under the project. A
study to determine future drainage needs is in process and resuLts are being
anaLyzed by UKP. These wiLL serve for the deveLopment of drainage pLans and
their imptementation under a future phase.



6
3.4      SAR proposed that roads would be  built  in  first  quality  murrum
where this is -locally available. However first quality murrum was not found
and pavements are waterbound Macadam.
Planning and Design
3.5      The Stage I project area, was mapped by the Survey  of  India,  who
provided CADA with rectified airphoto maps at a scale of 1:2500 witn
contours at a vertical interval of 0.25 m. The first sheets were avaiLable
in 1980/81. In the meantine Irrigation Department (ID) were using vilLage
maps at a scale of' 1:7920 for Layout of canals. Agreement between the two
sets  of  maps  was  generalty  satisfactory  but  inevitably  there   were
discrepancies which resulted in ID constructing outlets at levels and
Locations  which  were  not  best suited for construction of field channels;
consequently some Land couLd not be commanded. Detailed soiL capability
maps became available in 1981 after parts of the irrigation system had
already been designed and as a resuLt some 'marginal' areas were included
for irrigation. These maps are used predominantLy by CADA's agriculturaL
teams foe Land preparation and planning of crops.
3.6      Design was  carried  out  by  ID  staff  in  the  project  for  all
irrigation works from the dams to the outLet to the field channels and for
roads. FieLd channels and on-farm development were the responsibility of
CADA.  CWC are responsible for the design of major structures, incLuding the
dams.
3.7      In general, design  was carried  out  to  satisfactory  engineering
standards but supervision missions repeatedly rpeerted several areas of
concern which were not aLways adequately dealt with: 4nadequate provisions
were made for cross regulators on Shahapur Branch Canal (SBC); the routes
chosen for canals often required deep excavation and inadequate geotechnical
investigation resulted in some unnecessarily deep excavation in hard rock,
which caused difficulties during construction. Several major faiLures have
already occurred  on  Narayanpur  Left Bank Canal which give rise to doubts
concerning the stability cf the major earthworks on this vital waterway. At
least one failure was aggravated by unvalved pressure relief (weep) holes
throughout the canaL Lining in a h gh embankment which caused piping and
endangered the stability of the embankment and required costly repairs.
Project staff has been alerted by Bank staff to discontinue weep holes in
fills.
3.8      Overall planning for the deveLopment  of the project has been less
than adequate. After 25 years of construction there is doubt about the
ultimate scope of the project; whether the area to be irrigated should be
425,000 ha(Stage I), 660,000 ha referred to in the Phase II identification
report or 1,000,000 ha or more as has been suggested by ID. Only now, at the
insistence of IDA, is a detailed reservoir operation study being undertaken
which will give a realistic idea of the area that can be irrigated with the
storage available. The configuration of Almatti dam has radically changed at
least twice since appraisal (see 3.2) and the present design has yet to be
approved by CWC. Large expenditure has been incurred much earlier than
necessary for the construction of Almatti dam, which is not required to
store water until well into Phase II, and for the downstream end of SBC
which was substantially complete long before upstream reaches.



7
Procurement and Construction
3.9       The SAR stated that about $64 million, or 48% of civil works, would
be procured through ICB. In fact only about 25%, or $33 million were procured
under ICB.  The reason being that (i) spillway gates for Almatti dam
W  $7 million) were deleted from the project because of design changes;
ii) Bank-financed procurement of tunnel construction was reduced by about
$18 million (disbursement value $8.4 million)because of misprocurement;j/
(iii) the SAR provided for procurement of canal construction Caggregating
an estimated $30.9 million, as per subparas (III) and (iv) of para 3.60(a)
in the SAR3 through large or small contracts. Accordingly, works were
procured through 41 odd small contracts which proved to be the cheaper alter-
native. They werieconsidered too small for foreign bidders and hence were
procured through LCB procedures. In retrospect, construction by small con-
tractors proved to have many disadvantages. Many contractors lacked adequate
skilled manpower, plant, equipment and/or finance and lacked knowledge and
experience necessary to comply with given technical specifications. Project
staff proved incapable to effectively supervise the very large number of con-
tractors and as a result works proved sub-standard.
3.10     Construction  was  delayed from soon after the start of the project
by countrywide shortages of cement and explosives which continued until 1983.
Land acquisition, Insufficient budget allocations, procurement delays and
difficulties with contractors slowed construction progress. Further delays,
particularly in the tunnels, were attributed to electricity supply failures.
After delays with the erection of the main spillway gates, Narayanpur dam
and the initial reaches of NLBC were substantially complete by 1982 and stored
water enabled the first irrigation in the 1982/83 dry season. By September
1983 NLBC was substantially complete up to Km 35.5 (the Initial reach of 35.5
km was not included in Cr 788-IN as it was to be completed before this project
began) and into the Hunsagi Branch Canal which was the first area within the
IDA project to receive irrigation. The development of irrigated area is shown
in Table 3.
3.11     Many reaches  of  canal  were  found  to  have  unforeseen  large
quantities of rock excavation and ID and contractors  failed  to  reach  the
necessary agreement on rates for carrying out this additional work.  Disputes
were referred to arbitration but many contractors refused to continue the
work until their dispute had been resolved. Where arbitrators decided in
favour of the contractors, ID invariably took the dispute to court, which
further delayed a settlement:   in only one of about 20 such cases  has the
court quashed the arbitrator's award. Four cases have been referred to the
Karnataka High Court and one has reached the Supreme Court in Delhi.
3.12     Progress by CADA in the construction of field channels and on-farm
development caused concern to IDA supervision missions and though the pace of
construction has improved somewhat the quality of construction is substandard.
Land shaping and drainage have bomb-allowed to lag.seriously behind other
construction.  At Malaprabha and Ghataprabha there was a delay in establishing
CADA and shortage of funds and cement caused slow progress.
jf A sum of S8.36 million was cancelled from the credit because of misprocure-
ment of the construction of two tunnels on the main Irrigation system;
because after bids invited under ICB procedures were opened, GOK for
reasons unacceptable to the Bank decided to ask for rebids, upon which the
Bank cancelled the relevant disbursable portion from the Credit.



a
3.13     The quality of construction has been a constant problem (see 3.17),
due in part to unqualified, unequipped contractors and to 10's inadequate
supervislon.
3.14       When  the  credit  closed in March 1986 construction of the civil
works proposed at appraisal was approximately 82% complete:   the  state  of
completion of the ain components is sumarized below:
Almatti Oam Civil Works                  70%
Village Centres              85X
Narayanpur Dam Civil Works               92%
Village Centres              84%
Narayanpur Left Bank Canal               97%
Shahapur Branch Canal                    86%
Distribution System                      75%
Drainage System                           0%
Village Roads                           100%
Field Irrigation Channels                64%
Field Drainage                            3%
Malaprabha and Ghataprabha               58%
3.15     The  major  outstanding  construction  is completion of Almatti dam
but, as it is not required to store water for Irrigation until well into
Phase II. the delay is not critical. The erecti1n of the gantry at
Narayanpur dam and the removal of stoplogs in five additional spillways bays
are expected to be complete by March 1987. Remedial work is proceeding on
two large failed slopes nn NLBC and on the outstanding work on SBC, the
distribution system and field channels; the majority of this is expected to
be complete by March 1987 with work on distributaries continuing till July
and on field channets till 1988. There has been negligible work on drainage
and only since drainage problems have become apparent has work begun on
design of this important aspect. The length of roads described in the SAR
has already been completed but additional work continues. Figure 3 shows the
implementation schedule for Stage I of UKS proposed in the SAR and the
current optimistic proposals of ID taking account of the actual progress to
date.
3.16     By  March  1986 only 18,000 ha owt of 31,000 ha of field irrigation
.channels in Nalaprabba nd Ghataprabha had been lined. Channels in a further
2.50   h   ar   expected  to  be  lined  in I9N6/SI 4sing IDA finance but no
further linin will be undertaken once the existing stocks of precast lining
have been used. Land shaping and on-favw development are also behind
schedule.
Quality and PerforMancQ of ProJect Work'
3.17     The quality of design and construction has been variable.   Major
works,  such as  Narayanpur  dam  appear to be generally  satisfactory but
construction of line structures scattered over large distances has not
been given adequate attention. IDA supervision missions repeatedly
tried to raise standards of design and construction to internationally
acceptable levels but with only limited success. The supervision of
construction by the frequently changing ID staff gave constant cause
for concern and IDA missions made many references to examples of poor
construction practice; the most frequent were inadequate compaction, lack of
ce_nt, poor quality of in-situ concrete lining and of precast slabs, inadequate



9
curing of concrete and inappropriate laying and jointing of slabs (para
6.5). The low quality of design construction will give rise to high main-
tenance requirements in the future.
3.18     The performance of  the  irrigation  network  will  depend  on  the
maintenance accorded to it, and on the ability to control and measure
adequate flows. Appropriate water management procedures based on rotational
water supply have been introduced but successful implementation requires
continuous attention.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation
3.19     At the time of appraisal it was estimated that the  two  reservoirs
created under Phase I at Almatti and Narayanpur would lead to the
submergence of about 41,000 ha of cultivated land, displacing around 13,000
families. While no specific proposals (other than the construction of
village centres) were included in the SAR for the rehabilitation of these
families, it was recogni2ed that the activity would be carried out based on
guidelines laid out under the existing GOK policy for the rehabilitation of
such persons. This included the construction of village cer1tres (including
necessary facilities such as roads, water supply, schools, etc.), provision
of free house sites at these centres, and compensation for loss of land and
structures at a fair market value. In addition, it was agreed that GOK would
allocate, to the extent possible, land suitable for cultiva'ion to the
farmers resettled from the two reservoirs. Estimates of project cost
included provlsions for land compensation, and the construction of 50
village centres (25 each at Almatti and Narayanpur).
3.20     In fact, 55 village centres  (called  rehabilitation  centres)  are
being construc' d at the two reservoirs under the Phase I project. At
Narayanpur, internal roads and electrification have been completed for all
27 centres; the principal outstanding work is the completion of water supply
facilities at 10 centres. Work Is in progress at Almatti, but none of these
centres has so far been completed.
3.21     With  regard to the nuaber of families displaced as a result of the
Phase I construction, various estimates have been prepared during the period
of  project  implentation.  It appears that no detailed survey was carried
*out during eitber the project design phase on the early stages of project
implementation,  to  establish  the  numter of  families  which  would  be
displaced. The ost recent estimate of families affected as a result of
Phase I is provided in a "Rehabilitation Plan for Persons Displaced"
prepared by CADA in July 1986. The salient figures are summarized below:

Total             6.435           12.957
V At Almatti no land has been submerged so far.
Virtually all the families have been paid compensation for the assets lost
at rates established within GOK norms. Almost all the land-losing families
(11,466) have contested In court the amounts paid as compensation. About
5,000 cases have so far been settled in favour of the displaced families,
with courts award4ng enhancements equal, on average, to the amount of the
original compensation. Another 6,000 cases are presently sub-judice.
3.22      It is  generally  recognized  within  GOK that the compensation and
resettlement assistance provided have not enabled the ousted families to
regain or better their pre-project standard of living. This has been parti-
cularly so in the case of those families who have lost farmland. While Indian
law clearly stipulates that oustees receive full compensation for lost assets,
in practice land assessments are based on under-reported sales values and thus
has resulted in the land losers receiving low awards thereby leading them to
contest the amounts in court. Consequently, only around 10% of the land-
losing families have purchased replacement farmland.
3.23     The above situation has been caused by a combination of factors:
I) inadequacy of initial copensation paid for land lost;
Ai) gap of mnW years between ccpompnation payment and actual flooding,
when the families actually have to move, durini which period much
of the compensation may have already been spent (particularly
during the recent drought years);
iii) receipt of compensation and subsequent court enhancement, in
instalments spread over time;
iv) in some instances, collection of past debts from the amounts paid
as compensation;
v) the need for the land losers to make payments to 4a4yers from the
court enhancerdents awarded.



it
Finally, no detailed rehabilitation programne was drawn up early erough,
either as part of the project or as a separate GOK programme which could
have addressed the problem of restoring the standard of living of the ousted
families. While GOK had agreed that it would allocate to the extent
possible, land suitable for cultivation to the ousted farmers (which it has
failed to do), no operational framework was outlined, through whici such an
action could have been implemented.
Studies
3.24     Many   assumptions  were  made  for  project  design  and  the  SAR
considered it important for further development of UKS and future project
evaluation that such assumptions be compared with actual field data. The
project therefore included a monitoring programme involving water use
studies and assessment of project benefits. The water use studies have not
yet been started. Studies for farm economy, social framework, income,
investment and employment were entrusted to insti utes in Bangalore in 1983
but no results have yet been obtained.
3.25     Other issues which require study include  the  ultimate  extent  of
UKS,   the   feasibility  of  pumped  irrigation,  Lne  conjunctive  use  of
groundwater, and conveyance losses in canals.
Project Costs
3.26     Table  2  provides  a  comparison  between  actual  costs  incurred
(including estimated cost of completion) and the estimates made at appraisal
for the different project components. The completion of Phase I of the UKS,
and the m,nor component for Ghataorabha & Malaprabha, will have cost
Rs4901.1 million (US$478.6 million), which in rupee terms is double the SAR
estimete of Rs2445.4 million. In US dollar terms the project cost represents
168% of the SAR estimate of USS284.4 million. The relatively lower cost
overrun in US dollar terms reflects the depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis
the US dollar which has occurred between 1978 (Rs8.60 per USS) and 1986
(Rs12.70 per USS).
3.27     Me most important factor which has contributed to the cost overrun
is the higher costs of completing the two dams, in particular Almatti dam.
As  against the estimated Rs594 million, the dams have actually cost Rs1786
million. While much of the cost overun is accounted for by the significantly
higher costs of land acquisition and compensation, it appears that the
originally anticipated costs were underestimated at the time of appraisal.
The other factor which has contributed to the cost escalation Is the
considerably longer period of implementation than originally estimated (now
estimated to be substantially complete in nine years instead of five),
comlined with higher rates of inflation in the  earlier years  of  project
implementation than those assumed at appraisal.
Project financina and Credit Allocation
3.28     The IDA credit of US$126 million was expected to finance 44X of the
estimated total project cost. Actual disbursements against the credit were
US$117.6 million, which covered approximately 30% of the actual cost
incurred up to 31 March 1986, and 25% of the now estimated total project
cost (includfng costs projected for completion). Of the total credit US$8.36

(30 September 1986) US$35,580 remained undisbursed. Other than the first
year of project implementation, disbursements were behind the appraisal
schedule, principally on account of delayed implemntation (see basic
data sheet).
3.29     The  table  below  compares  actual  disbursements  for   different
expenditures categories, with the proposed allocation at appraisal.

The Development Credit Agreement stated that US$7 million would be allocated
to finance 55X of AROC's refinance for on-farm development (OFO). Due to the
slow progress of OFD and farmers' reluctance to borrow for this work, only
US$0.2 million was disbursed for this work. No fonmal reallocation of the
credit was carried out to correct the situation of overdisbursements under
the  other categories.   The  credit  closed on 31  March  1986  after  two
postponements, but disbursements continued for ancther six months for expen-
ditures incurred prior to March 31, 1986.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.1      The IDA Project has significantly accelerated the pace of development
of UKS in comparison with pre-project performance, even though the optimistic
construction schedule in the SAR has not been achieved. The main impact of
the proJect is the-substantial improvemt in agricultural production that is
nw becmng apparent dut to the Irrigation in the dry anti depressed project
area. At the same time the welfare of the approximately 6,450 families who
were forced to resettle seriously declined.



13
Intended Agricultural Imoact
4.2      Phase I of Uoper Krishna Scheme (UKS).  The major production impact
intended by the Phase I of UKS were increases in: annual foodgrain
production of about 197,000 tons from the pre-project base of 18,500 tons,
cotton production of about 31,000 tons from 6,800 tons; oilseeds of 27,000
tons from 3,700 tons; and other miscellaneous crop production of about 5,000
tons from 2,500 tons. <1> These were expected to be achieved through
provision of irrigation and drainage systems, command area development and
strengthening of agricultural support services. The project area appraised
for the Phase I development was 105,000 ha (net c-tivable command area
(CCA)) out of a total 425,000 ha (net CCA) of UKS area. No projection was
given in SAR as to when the full development of crop production would be
attained in Phase I area.
4.3      Malaprabha and Ghataprabha Schemes.  The production impact of these
schemes was not quantified In SAR. It was estimated that irrigate( crop
yields would increase by about 30% a, a result of the construction of lined
field channels and on-farm development.
Crop Development in UKS Phase I Area <21
4.4      Land  use.  The  appraisal  target  was  to  develop  105,000 ha of
irrigation system; field irrigation channels would be developed on only
80,000 ha by 1983 (the original end of Phase I implementation period). It
was assumed at appraisal that irrigation water would be supplied before
field channels were constructed as was the practice In other schemes.
However, since this would favour farmers near the outlet who would become
accustomed to receiving more than their share of water and would discourage
the construction of field channels, it was decided that irrigation water
would not be delivered until after the completion of field channels. Table 3
sets out annual changes in land use during the past 5 years, compared with
the appraisal targets. Phase I development area has been reduced from
105,000 ha (SAR) to 97,340 ha as a result of the detailed topographical
survey conducted during the course of project Implementation. Irrigable land
<3). so far developed by the project covers about 60% or 59,400 ha of the
reduced Phase I development area. Reasons for the delay in development are
'explained In Chapter Itt.
4.5      CropDgni  Pattern.  The past 5 years' actual changes in the cropping
pattern in  Phase I area, compared with the appraisal projection, are given
in Table 5. Differences between "actual" and "appraisal" cropping patterns
include introduction of sunflower (kharif and rabi) and groundnut (rabi),
and reduction in cotton cultivation. Increase in both rainfed and irrigated
sunflower is particularly noticeable. The current annual area plar.ted to
sudlower is about 9,000 ha or nearly 10X of total Phase I net cultivated

area. Cotton area decreased gradually from about 14,200 ha (1982) to about
10.300 ha (1985). However, there has been a drastic reduction in cotton
planted urea in 1986 reportedly because of severe Insect attack in 1985 due
to insufficient insect control. The area planted by end of September 1986 is
estimated at only about 300 ha. These changes have also occurred in
neighbouring taluks (sub-district) In Stage t area as shown in Table 4
Sorghum nd sunflower are reportedly replacin cotton mainly because of the
relatively higher production cost of cotton, particularly for insect
control. 01fficulty in marketing of cotton is also claimed by farners in the
Phase I ir-rigated area.
4.6      In additlut.# to the above changes; cultivation  of  irrigated  paddy
and  sorghum  (ratoon)  envisaged  at  the  time  of appraisal, has not been
realized in the Phase I irrigated area with the exception of a small area of
paddy cultivation in poorly drained lowland. Ratooning of sorghum in rabi is
considered to be unprofitable by farmers in the irrigated area. Cultivation
of irrigated paddy in the Phase I area is now prohibited because of the high
water requirements of paddy. Although the area of paddy does not appear in
CADA  recordh.  the  mission  c4served some irrigated paddy grown within the
command area. It appears that unless a proper drainage system is provided to
these areas, farmers have no choice but to grow paddy.
4.7      With  regard  to changes in cropping pattern by two main soil types
(Black cotton soils and Red soils), no data has been systematically recorded
in the Phase I irrigated area. Moreover, the appraisal report does not
clearly distinguish in its projection of cropping pattern between the two
soil types, in spite of distinct differences in the land use of these soil
types. However, Information obtained in the field indicates the following
soroximate  changes  in  cropping  patterns  by soil types before and after
irrigaton.

4.4      It  should  be  noted  that  black  cotton  soils  in the currently
irrigated Phase t area reportedly occupy only about 10% or about 2,000 ha,
although about 50% of total Phase I area consists of black cotton soils.
4.9      crogping  intensity.  Present overall cropping intensity in Phase I
area is estimated at      t I05% (1985), which is nearly the  same  intensity
projected at the time of appraisal (see Table 6). Overall irrigation
intensity in the area is however low, being 36% (1985) compared to 101% of
the appraisal projection, is the Phase I area Is not yet fully developed.



15
4.10     Within the irrigated area  (notified  area)  c1  present  cropping
intensity is reportedly about 150%. The mission's discussion with CADA
agricultural staff and interviews with some groups of farmers in the area
reveal that a significant area within the area notified for irrigation Is
cultivated with rainfed crops In addition to irrigated crops because the
current schedule of irrigation water supply is not planned to irrigate the
entire notified area.
4.11     Irrigation intensity (the ratio of area' receiving Irrigation  water
to notified area) within the irrigable CCA is summarized below:

The   higher  intensity  currently  attained  compared  with  the  appraisal
projection could be due to farmers spreading the water thinly over  a  large
area  or  to  more  water than planned being supplied or to a combination of
these. Available records  of  discharge  in  the  canal  are  inadequate  to
correlate with the actual irrigated area.
4.12     CrogyYlds.   Table  5  sets out the past 5 years' annual average
crop yields in the Phase I area estimated by CADA, compared with the
appraisal projection. Yields of Irrigated safflower, pulses and whiat have
exceeded the-appraisal projection. Yields of the rest of the irrigated
crops, except for sorghum and maize, are closer to the projected yields. It
appears that the appraisal made a little too ambitious an estimate for
average yields of maize and sorghum (4.0 and 3.6 tons/ha respectively),
although some progressive farmers in the irrigated area have reportedly
attained these high levels of yield. The yield levels presently attained in
the Phase I Irrigated area are more or less identical to average irrigated
crop yields In neighbouring taluks.
r
4.13     Production.  Oevelopuent  of  annual  total crop production in the
past 5 yeanrs n the Phase I area together with the appraisal projection of
full development projection are given In Table 6. Foodgrain production,
Including sorghum, millet, maize and wheat, has increased from the actual
pre-project (1982) level of 24,30D tons to the present 61,600 tons (1985).
Oilseeds production, including groundnut, sunflower and safflower, hat also
increased from the pre-project 9,700 tons to the present 34,700 tons. Cotto'i
production has decreased from the pre-project 6,000 tons to the present
4-30O tons for the reason explained in para 4.5. Production of miscellaneous
crops such as pulses, gram and vegetables has increased slightly in total
from the pre-project 7,000 tons to the present 8,700 tons. It is interesting

under the provision of GOK Irrigation Act. This Is the area for
which irrigation systems have been completed, and for which IO is

16
to note that oilseeds production  in the  Phase  I area  has  exceeded  the
aDpralsal projected production at full development, in spite of the fact
that the Phase I area Is not yet fully developed. This is due to an increase
in the price of oilseeds while the cultivation of cotton entails a relatively
higher risk dub to, as yet, undevelored market and fluctuating prices.
oevelop nt in Mala rabha and Ghataorabha Schemes
4.14     The  area  developed  with  construction  of lined field irrigation
channels (FICs) under the project Is given in Table 7. The total area
provided with lined FICs by the end of March 1986 was about 17,950 ha,
comprising 14,250 ha in jlaprabha area and 3,700 ha  in Ghataprabha  area.
This is about 60% of total area envisaged for development at the time of
appraisal. This shortfall is due to delay in implementation.
4.15     Since  no  data  on  agricultural  production  were  systematically
recorded and little effort was made to quantify the production impact due to
the stabilization of FICs, it is not possible to assess the actual effect of
this component.
Use of Farm Inputs
4.16     Distribution   of   farm  inputs  including  chemical  fertilizers,
agrochemicals, and improved seeds in the UKS area is handled by  Cooperative
Marketing Societies and private dealers with the assl%tance of CADA
agricultural wing. As shown In Table 8 use of chemical fertillzers has, in
general Increased with the increase in annual irrigated area ftom 290 tons
(310 ha) to 5,620 tons (42,310 ha) over the period of 1982/83-1l'85/86. cl>
The present annual use of fertilizer per irrigated ha (1985/36) is about
55:50:25 (N;P;K) kg. As data on fertilizer use before irrigation is not
available, comparison between "before" and "after" irrigation cannot be
made. Historical data on use of agro-chemicals and improved seeds is not
available, but in 1985/86, use of these inputs per ha is estimated at about
1.3 litret for agro-chemicals and about 22 kg for improved seeds. Purchase
of  draught animls in the UKS irrigated area through medium-term 'Oans over
the past 5 year was in the range of 350 pairs to 600 pairs per year.
Farm Buduets
4.17     Data  made available by CAMA on the distribution of landholdings by
size, for the Shorapur taluk, shows that approximately 48% of the holding
are less th4n 3.0 ha in size, while 36% are between 3 and 7.5 ha. In line
with this, two representative farm budgets, for 1.5 and 4.0 ha farms
respectively, have been prepared to show the impact of the project on farm
incomes. These are sumarized in tables 9 and 10 respectively. A "with
project' cropping tntensity of 119% has been assumed (see 5.7). As can be
seM, net farm income 'with project* goes up nearly five fold as compared to
"future without project" in the case of the 1.5 ha farm (SAR estimated a 4.6
fold increase), and a 5.2 fold increase in the case of the 4.0 ha farm (SAR
estimated a 4.3 fold increase). The higher percentage increase, as compared
with the SAR is on account of the considerably lower water charges actually
levied on farmers (estimated at RsSS per ha on the present schedule of

charges), compared to what was proJected at the time of appraisal (Rs 495
per hectare). In addition, a higher *with project" cropping intensity has
been assumed, compared to the 106-107% assumed at the time of appraisal.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Aporaise'l stimate
5.1      At appraisal an economic rate of return (ERR) of 16% was  estimated
for the entire stage I of the Upper Krishna Scheme. This was based on
projected  costs  and  benefits  from  irrigating   425,000   ha,   and   an
Implementation period estimated to be 15 years from the beginning of Phase
I. In addition, an ERR of 10% was estimated for an assumed scerar1o where
GOK would stop further development of UKS (presumably on account of non-
availability of funds) once the IDA assisted Phase I project was completed.
At  appraisal  one  cropping  pattern  was  used  for estimating incremen-'l
agricultural production from the entire project area, which assumed thet
from a "without project" rainfed cropping intensity of 85%, farmers wou:d
move to a "with project"   cropping intensity of 106%  (with  an  irrigatici
intensity of 101%). Furthermore the SAR states that in the computation o.
the above ERRs all sunk costs were included In the analysis (the firs.
expenditures on the development of UKS were incurred in 1957/58). A separate
estimate was made of the ERR for the Ghataprabha and Malaprabha component.
Revised Analysis
5.2      It is not possible, at this stage, to undertake an analysis of  the
entire  UKS  (covering  425,000 ha), as done in the SAR. For the purposes of
the PCR the following ERRs have been estimated:
I) ERR from the Investment, including sunk costs, In only the
Narayanpur   Cam   system,   i.e.   Narayanpur  reservoir  and  the
-      distribution system for  the  area  that  can  be  served  from  it
(assumed !to be 152,000 ha CCA). Sunk costs have been included in
the analysis principally to retain a similarity with the approach
adopted at appraisal.
II) Above ERR, excluding sunk costs.
lii) An ERR under the assumption that on account of shortage of funds
and no further World Bank assistance for Phase It of the- project,
GOK would stop further work on Almatti daw. and only complete the
*       Narayanpur dam system '1'
<1>      This analysis is probably no longer necessary, as there is a
coumitment in GOK to complete the UKS. However, it has been done tv
provide a partial comparlsor with the SAR estimate of the 10% ERR.



-                                                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~18
Adequate data are not available for re-estimating the ERR for the
Ghataprabha and Malaprabha component.
5.3      The  analysis  of the complete Stage i area, including Almatti Dam,
has not been carried out principally on account of inadequate data available
at present to ,rovide a reasonable estimate of future benefits and costs.
While at appraisal it was estimated that UKS Stage I would be completed in
15 years, in fact just the Phase I project, which would result in 98,000 ha
being irrigated took more than nine years to complete. Without a detailed
review of implementation capacity and Go 's future resource availability, it
is difficult to project the likely imp. ecantation rate far into the future,
as Stage I completion could take up to 20 years more. In addition, a major
change which has taken place since the appraisal of the Phase I project, is
the recognition that the completion of Almatti Dam for the Stage I area
would require substantial relocation of Bagalkot town with an estimated
population (1981 census) of around 70,000. Consultants have been appointed
to prepare a plan and detailed costs of relocation. In the context of a PCR
and  given  the  time available, it is not possible to identify the economic
costs (and possible benefits) of relocating a town, as it would require a
detailed review of the assets of the town, the proposed plan and costs for
relocatiun, and the activit pattern (present and proposed for the future)
of the relocated population.
Bases for Analysis
5.4      As part of UKS Phase It preparation a reservoir operations study is
presently being conducted to match water availability and the optimum "with
project" cropping pattern (given present farming practices and cropring
patterns in the project area), given GOI's equity objective of spreading
available water on the maximum area possible, without impairing the
project's economic viability. Based on the results available so far from the
study, it is estimated that water from Narayanpur reservoir (without
additional storage at Almatti reservoir) would be adequate to irrigate
152,000 ha. This is based on an assumed with project" cropping Intensity of
119%. Consequently, Almatti da  is not required for  irrigating  areas  till
the latter half ot' the proposed phase It project period. The analysis
carried out in this report Is alied at estimating an ERR for the Investment
-1n th Narayanpur On System. While the Phase I project would create water
distributiow infrastructure for irrigating 97,000 ha and FICs fot 90,000 ha,
additional costs have been projected for completing total infrastructure for
servicing the entire 152,000 ha. The costs of Almatti Dam have been excluded
from thoe analysis.
5.5      Investment  Costs. All investment costs related to the construction
of Narayanpur Dam, NLBC and SOC, and the related costs for the water
distribution system (including field Irrigation channels) for 152,000 ha
htvI been included In the analysis. Land shaping and field drainage costs
have been included for 80X of the total area. The analysis has been carried
out In 1986 prices, with past expenaitures restated in 1986 price terms by
using the wholesale price index. Table 11 summarizes total investment costs
used in the analysis, In both financial and economic terms. A conversion
factor of 0.67 <1 has been used to convert into economic terms the
In line with conversion factors being used by the World Bank it, the
preparation of the Phase II project.



19
financial costs of dam construction, branch canals, distribution system,
land development, and road construction, and the standard conversion factor
of 0.80 1> for the costs of equipment and services, including engineering
supervision and administration.
5.6      Land Acquisition and Resettlement. An estimated 13,200 ha  of  land
would ultimately be submerged by Narayanpur dam (by 1989/90), of which about
2850 ha had been submerged prior to 1978. Of the remaining 10,350 ha an
estimated 70% is assumed to have been cultivated prior to submergence (75%
as rainfed and 25% as irrigated from the river using pumps). An estimated
additional 9500 ha has been acquired for the construction of main and branch
canals, distributarie   the IO and CADA colonies etc. It is assumed that 75%
was cultivated undt. rainfed conditions. For the purposes of the analysis,
the economic value of the land acquired is reflected in terms of the net
value of agricultural production foregone as a result of the project. In
addition to the cost of construction of village centres, the cost of
submerged structures has been included in the analysis. It is estimated that
4,300 families would lose houses, and their financial value estimated at
Rs3O,000 each has been reflected in economic terms by applying the SCF of
0.80.
5.7      Agricultural Production. A "with  project"  cropping  intensity  of
119%  has  been  used  for the analysis (see tables 12 and 13), based on the
latest cropping pattern proposed during preparation of the Phase II project,
for the reservoir operations study. This broadly corresponds with the
irrigation intensity achieved In the notified area in 1985 (see 4.11).
Furthermore the higher irrigation intensity assumed, as compared to the SAR
estimate of 101%, reflects the downward revision in per hectare irrigation
water requirements presently estimated for some of the crops, and a 5%
higher total water availability (See table 12). There is, however, one
reservation in using this cropping pattern for the analysis, and this
relates to the assumption that 18% of the "with project" irrigated area
would be planted to cotton. Presently, only an insignificant part of the
Phase I irrigated area is planted to cotton and rainfed cotton areas have
declined, and now represent between 10% and 12% of the rainfed cropping
pattern in the project area (see table 6). For the purposes of the PCR it
has not been practicable to amend the cropping pattern, as it would need to
be subjected to the reservoir operations study to ensure that the revised
cropping   pattern   maintains   the   water   supply  and  demand  balance.
Consequently, the 119% cropping/irrigation intensity has been adopted for
the analysis. This compares with the SAR "with project" cropping intensity
of 106%, and irrigation Intensity of 101%.
5.8      Crop budgets and the economic prices (in 1986 constant terms)  used
in  the  analysis  are  shown In tables 13 and 14 respectively. The economic
prices of traded commodities (wheat maize, cotton, groundnut, fertilizers)
are based on IBRO Commodity Price Forecasts (August 1986), and are shown in
table 15; the economic prices of sunflower and safflower are derived by
applying the ratio of economic to financial price of groundnut, while those
o'torghum and millet by applying the economic to financial price ratio of
maize. Pulses, gram and vegetables are treated as non-traded, and their
economic price has been derived by applying the SCF of 0.80 to the financial
price.
5.9      In  estimating  total  incremental benefits, it is assumed that the
full development yields "with projeLt" (table 16) are aLhieved 5 years after
irrigation is introduced. Full development "with project" yields adopted for
the anlysis are based on expeeience in Phase I irrigated area to date
(1982/83-1986 kharif season).



20
Re-Estimated Economic Rate of Return
5.10     Based on the above assumptions, and that full development irrigated
area of 152,000 ha is achieved in 1994/95, <1> the economic rate of return
on the Narayanpur dam system, including sunk costs, is estimated at 9.5%.
(See table 17). If, however, the pre-project costs (i.e. costs, incurred
before 1977/78) are treated as sunk costs and excluded from the analysis,
the ERR is estimated at 13%.
5.11     Finally,  by  including  all  costs  incurred  on Almatti dam up to
1986/87 only, as well as the past and projected c'sts for completing the
Narayanpur dam system, an ERR of 8.5% has been E mated.
5.12     The above estimates of project benefits are based on the assumption
that the area receiving irrigation water "with project" is the same as that
on which the farmer has been practising rainfed cultivation prior to the
project. However, as the "without project" cropping pattern clearly shows,
there  are  areas  left  fallow  in  each  of  the  kharif  and rabi seasons
(including the area  devoted  to  the  bi-seasonal  cotton  crops).  If  the
irrigation  water  is used on the previously fallow areas cropping Intensity
"with project" would be higher than assumed (while irrigation Intensity
would still be 119%), both in the SAR as well as in the revised analysis
carried out in this report, and there would be a smaller loss in the
previously rainfed area production. Based on discussions with farmers in the
presently irrigated area, it appears that the above reflects the actual
situation being practiced. However, since CADA's record of cropped area in
the Irrigate?, area does not include rainfed crops, a precise estimate of the
overall cropping Intensity cannot be made. This exclusion of rainfed crops
in the "with project" cropping pattern leads to a downward bias, albeit
small, in the estimated ERRs. Analysis carried out reveals, that if there is
only a 70% loss of without project production as a result of the project
(i.e. a with project cropping intensity of around 150%), the ERR of the
Narayanpur Dam system (including sunk costs) would be 10.2%, instead of the
9.5% estimated above.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Performance of GOK
6.1      GOK  has made great efforts and allocated a large proportion of its
irrigation budget to the Upper Krishna Scheme; consequently the pace of
development of the project has accelerated substantially since 1978. However
the rate of progress forecast in the SAR has not been achieved, partly due
to budget allocations being less than proposed in the SAR and to GOK's
Inability to provide sufficient experienced staff for the project.
6.2      Staffing the project, particularly at the junior levels, has been a
constant problem on a number of scores. The Karnataka Public Works
Department includes Irrigation, Comnunications and Buildings and staff are
transferred between these at frequent intervals, often resulting in staff
without irrigation training and experience being transferred to the project.

21
The project, particularly the  command  area,  is  in  a  poor,  remote  and
undeveloped part of Karnataka with inadequate educational, commercial and
recreational facilities which discourage professional staff from living in
the project area. There is a reluctance of staff to be transferred to the
project and an eagerness to transfer away as soon as possible. The
incentives given to staff are insufficient to overcome this. IDA missions
have proposed that the Irrigation Department staff should be a separate
establishment from other parts of PWO and that greater incentives be given
to  UKS staff to encourage them to stay. Some progress has been made towards
establishing a separate staff cadre but-there is still a rapid turnover of
staff.  If  ID becomes a separate organization consideration will have to be
given to the arrangements for nonstructing and maintaining roads in the
project area. This is at pre. ..t the responsibility of UKS staff but if the
project Is staffed only by irrigation engineers there would be advantages to
returning the responsibility for roads to PWD.
6.3      The  responsibility  for  the  project has been divided between two
Chief Engineers and the CADA Administrator; since 1985 an additional Chief
Engineer has been responsible for Bagalkot relocation and a further two
Chief Engineers have recently been appointed for Phase II works. The Chief
Engineers report to the Secretary Irrigation II in Bangalore and the CADA
Administrator to the Additional Secretary CADA. The Secretaries have many
other responsibilities throughout the State. There is no one person with
overall responsibility for management and coordination of all aspects of the
project. A full-time UKS Project Manager resident in the project areas is
required  to  take  overall  responsibility   for   the   project,   improve
coordination, particularly between CADA and I0, and ensure that GOK is made
aware of the action necessary for the successful implementation of the
project.
6.4      GOK's shortcomings regarding the resettlement and rehabilitation of
people dispaced by the project are discussed in Chapter 3.
Irrigation Department
6.5      The performance of the Irrigation Department has been variable. The
increased pace of development of the project is mainly due to ID but the
shortcomings noted In design para (3.7) and construction para (3.17). are
cause for concern. There has been a serious lack of overall planning and
there are now many important Issues that require early study If efficient
impl_mentation of the second ond subsequent phases is to be achieved. The
rapid turnover of staff and the use of staff without irrigation training and
experIenc contribute to some of the shortcomings but I0 did not take
adequate action to prevent the bad workmanship which was repeatedly reported
by supervision missions nor to discipline construction supervisors who
permitted unsatisfactory work to continue.
6.6      Ooeration and Maintenance of the completed  part  of the irrigation
system is presently carried out by one circle of the construction division
after finishing      supervision of the construction of the same system. Even
though the irrigated area is constantly expanding and expected to reach
100,O0 in about two years, O&M has not yet been formally separated from
construction. The lack of a fonmal separation is, in effect, a disincentive
to the establishment of an OSM organization in this project as long as cons-
truction continues. Recently GOK agreed with a proposal by a Bank mission,
to engage consultants for the preparation of a comprehensive W1KM master plan
for the ultimately developed Upper Krishna Project* that would be Implemented
in phases, con_ensurate to the development of irrigation. These consultants
will specify appropriate 011 procedures, quantify Infrastructures muupoers
and equipment requirements and their cost.



22
6.7      A procedure has been proposed by a recent Bank pre-appraisal mission
of a future project for formal hand-over from the construction divisions to
the OhM divisions but this has not yet been adopted by project authorities.
It is proposed t* hn* over field channels to farmers after they have been
successfull)voperate*and maintained for one year by CADA (or possibly by ID
in futur.' seE-pars 6.10) but the formal procedure for this has not yet been
agreed; outtet committees should be given a legal standing to permit them to
formally take over field channels.
6.8      It is understood that it is the policy of GOK to provide water only
at  the  rate  that       will ultimately be available so that farmers do not
become accustomed to more than their share and consider it their right.
Although  NDO  staff  have  made  efforts  to  establish  a  :ter management
programne this is not being strictly observed in the field. Instead of a
strict warabundi system being adopted, whereby each farm receives water at a
fixed rate for a given length of time proportional to the area of the farm
at prescribed weekly or fortnightly intervals during the season, the system
is being operatea to satisfy farmers demands. This is possible at present
while there is surplus water available to meet excess demands from the small
part of the system that is being irrigated but there will not be  sufficient
water to permit this when the system is fully developed, when water will be
available to irrigate only 50% to 70% of the CCA during any one season. ID
does not appear to have appreciated the importance of making all farmers
aware of the water management policy and delivering water accordingly.
6.9      Many outlet structures, particularly the early gated  design,  have
been damaged to permit Increased quantities of water to be taken. I0 nave
generally adopted a lenient attitude and have not prosecuted those causing
damage. It is essential if the project is to function efficiently that
anyone who wilfully damages the system is brought to justice.
CADA Engineering Wing
6.10     The performance of CAOA has also been variable. The initial setting
up of CADAs was slow and uncertain, particularly in Malaprabha and
Ghataprabha. Design and construction of field channels was carried out by
staff secondqd to CADA Engineering Wing from the I0 but they were often
inexperienced in irrtgat10w. In Nalaprabha and Ghataprabha CADA constructed
the  field  channels  using  directly  hired  labour whereas  in  UKS small
*contractswea let fow this work, frequently to landowners through whose
land  the  channl passed or to contractors approved by these landowners. In
view of the poor quality of field channels IDA now proposes that design and
construction of field irrigation channels (FtC) should be transferred back
to IO. The advantages of this would be consistency between main system and
FIC design; designs would be subject to the ID approval procedure; It would
be  possible  to  include  FIC   construction   in   large   contracts   for
distributaries, thereby improving the quality of construction, reducing the
stAff time required for supervision and accelerating construction.
CADA UKS Agricultural Wing
6.11     The appralual report did not give much account of the institutional
aspects of CADA Agricultural Wing or Its linkage oith the research programme
assisted by the project and OOA regular extension programme in spite if the
fact that CADA for the UKS scheme wos just established at the Lime of
appraisal. CADA Agricultural Wing ompr;-.e% r Agricultural Division (AD),



cj
an Agricultural Complex Division (ACO), an On-Farm Development Division
(OFO), and a Land Development Training Centre (LOTC). These four divisions
are each headed by a Deputy Director of Agriculture (ODA). A Joint Director
of Agriculture (JOA) oversees and coordinates the activities of the four
DOAs. The functions of these divisions and the activities carried out during
the Phase I implementation period are summarized below.
6.12     Agricultural  Division  is  a  task  force,  to  guide  farmers  in
irrigated farming, organize water users' groups, and. establish water
scheduling among farmers, in the newly irrigated area during the first 4 or
5 crop seasons: its work is then transferred to DOA regular extension
services. The performance of nO has been in general satisfactory.
6.13     OFO Division has been respons       for executing land levelling  ard
land shaping since August 1984, when the OFO works were transferred from tte
CADA Engineering Wirg. The progress of OFO works under the project was slow
due to lack of field staff. The division is at present mainly responsible
for setting up OFO demonstration fields,  land  shaping  and  levelling  for
farmers.  They  have  assisted  farmers  to implement about 6,800 ha of land
shaping and given technical assistance to farmers for construction of key
bunds  and  broad  bed  furrows on over 25,000 ha as a temporary measure, in
order to facilitate better on-farm irrigation practices  before  the  proper
land shaping is implemented.
6.14     Agricultural  Complex  Division  (ACO)   has  been  responsible for
producing certified serds, a small-scale varietal trial and raising some
horticultural nurser.es for the farmers in UKS area. An adaptive research
programme was conducted by six research scientists seconded from the
University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) as a part of ACO activities.
However, due to delay In construction of research facilities coupled with
lack of irrigation water, active research work other than a few varietal
trials has not been carried out. ACD operates four farms with a total area
of about 150 ha (located at Bheemarayangudi, Kavadimatti, Almel and
Almatti). These farms have not yet been fully established because of delay
in land acquisition and lack of irrigation water sources.
6.15     The  mission  was  informed  by  UAS, Bangalore that under the IDA-
assisted National Agricultural Research II Project (NARP II) UAS is now
planning t% establish a new research station to conduct adaptive research
related to irrigation farming in Phase I Irrigated area (Hunsagi). Since the
responsibility of agricultural research in Karnataka is in the hands of UAS,
research activities in UKS should be, in principle, carried out by UAS.
6.16     Land DeveloDment Training Centre (LOTC) was established In 1979 for
training  project  field  staff  In  design,  execution  and  operation  and
management of land development works, including construction of field
irrigation channels and drains, land shaping and land levelling; farmers are
trained in land development and production. To date, LDTC has trained 70
junior engineers, 165 AAs and about 800 farmers. Performance of LOTC has
besA satisfactory.
GOK's Compliance with Covenants of the Project Agreement
6.17     In general GOK complied with covenants  of  the  Project  Agreement
except in the following respects. Inadequate budget dllocations were made,
particularly between 1978 and 1982, which was contrary to  Sectorn  2.01  of
the Project Agreement. in the early stages of the project, audit reports
were frequently late. Karnat4ksi undertoil' to complete the UKS as early as



24
technically and financially feasible (Section 3.04); there have been
considerable delays to date due to financial, managerial and technical
factors. Section 3.05 requires GOK to allocate to the extent possible land
suitable  for  cultivation  to  farmers  resettled  from  the  Almatti   and
Narayanpur reservoir areas. This has not been done.
6.18      Cost Recovery. Section 3.11(a) requires GOK to assess and collect
a bettenment-levy.  This levy, after being contested in courts was abolished
in 1980, without IDA's consent. Section 3.11(b) requires GOK to review and,
if necessary, increase water and water-related charges with the objective of
collectin5 full O&M costs, and, to the extent possible, the cost of infra-
ttructure investment.  GOK reviewed water charges but because the project
was still in its five-year running-in phase, no water charges had actually
been levied. l/ Assuming no change in current (1976) rates, after the termi-
nation of the running-in phase farmers would be paying on the aver-ge
Rs 70/ha/yr, or about 50% of GOK's current budget of Rs 140/ha/y,  ur O&M of
irrigated land, probably even a smaller percentage after appropriate O&M
costs are determined (para 6.6).  However, farmers contribute also indirectly
to O&M through taxation increases. Based on records of production increases
in irrigated parts of the project area market taxes wiil rise, on the average,
by about Rs 190/ha/yr, thus yielding a combined revenue increase of about
Rs 260/ha/yr. These may be adequate in the short run, but should be adjusted
periodically to actual expenditures.
6.19      The PCR mission has not been able to  establish  that  Almatti  and
Narayanpur dams were being periodically inspected in accordance with sound
engineering practice as required by Section 3.12. No reports of earlier dam
panel reviews were available.
Performance of IDA
6.20      IDA assisted  in  the  planning  of  the  project  and  have  been
instrumental in causing many changes. At the time of appraisal an IDA
consultant recommended that the design floods at Almatti and Narayanpur be
substantially  increased;  five additional  spillway  bays  were  added   to
Narayanpur dam to cope with the increased design flood and the design of
Almatti dam waS changed. The dacisions to design and supervise construction
of roads by project staff and to transfer field channels to CADA were made
at  the  insistence  of  IDA.  They  were  not  completely  successful   and
consideration is now being given to transferring road construction to PWO
and field channels to Ij.
6.21      The appraisal report stated that the IDA  credit would assist with
the completion of Almatti dam wherea- the dimension quoted refer to only
pa; tial completion. It is difficult to Justify on economic grounds the
inclusion of Almatti dam in the IDA project: the SAR makes no reference to
the reasons for the early construction which are understood to have been
related to the establishment of allocated water rights by Karnataka. The
area to be submerged and the price used for land compensation were
underestimated in SAR and no mention was made of the future submergence of
Bagalkot town. The price assumed for compensation at Almatti was a small
fraction of that assumed for Narayanpur and has been the largest contributor
to the cost overrun. The SAR does not justify the inclusion of the field
channels and on-farm development works in Malaprabha and Ghataprabha in the
Credit except to attribute them with an unexplained ERR of 45%. The
scattered nature of these works has made it impracticable to collect data to
permit a reestimation of this.
I/  in line witn current practice, the running-in period is five years.This,
in view of Bank missions, is unjustifiably long and hence a dialogue
with GOK was initiated during pre-appraisal of a possible future project,
with a view of shortening it.



6.22      Eleven full supervision missions have visited the project area over
a period  of  about  8  years.  These  have  been  predominately engineers in
keeping with the nature of the project and the apparent lack of agricultural
input in the fonmal supervlsion missions was compensated by informal
intervention from NDO. NDO's Irrigation Manag'ment Team spent considerable
time devising a workable water management operation for UKS but there has
been only limited success in putting this into effect. Supervision missions
assisted ID staff to improve engineering capabilities by holding workshops
and informal discussions on irrigation design and construction. Although
supervision missions were regularly critical of the quality of construction
IDA did not insist on severe action that might have ensured that only work
of acceptable quality was permitted. Neither did IDA insist on project action
by the Borrower to meet its legal obligation to provide an adequate R&R
progran.
6.23      Supervision missions and missions for appraisal of Phase II have
drawn attention to the need for a reservoir operation study, plans for
resettlement of Bagalkot and adequate provision for the rehabilitation of
people who have lost their livelihoods due to the project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
Conclusions
7.1       The bulk of the UKS works included in the Appraisal  Report, other
than Almatti Dam, is likely to be completed in 1987 thereby enabling 97,000
ha in a drought prone area to be irrigated. Although the IDA credit has
accelerated the development of UKS, construction will have taken four years
longer than the five years expected at appraisal. The overrun is due to
insufficient budget allocations, shortage of suitable staff, delays in land
acquisition, shortages of materials, procurement delays and difficulties
with contractors. The estimated cost at completion is double the cost
estimated at appraisal, mainly due to delays, in conjunction with inflation,
and underestimation of resettlement cost at appraisal.
7.2       Inclusion of  Almatti  dam  in   the  IDA  project  is difficult to
understand and has incurred substantial costs much earlier than can be
economically justified.
7.3       Although  the  principle of resettlement of people displaced by the
project was appreciated at appraisal no attempt was made to prepare a plan
of specific action required to ensure that adequate compensation was
promptly paid and families displaced by the project were enabled to become
established and economically self-sustaining at living standards that at
least matched those before the project.
7.5       GOK should institute a formal handing over of completed sections
of the irrigation system to a separate O&M organization after ensuring that
the system is operating as designed. All O&M costs should be recovered from
beneficiaries and GOK should shorten the current grace period from five
years to two years, after ensuring reliable and equitable Irrigation supplies
to all water users on the system.
7.6       Although agricultural plans are prepared by CADA, they bear  little
relation to crops grown and irrigation operation plans developed with the
assistance of NDO's Water Management Programme are not being effectively
implemented. The irrigation system has been designed to distribute the
14#n4+ad wat*r available over the largest practicable area In order to



zr 
achieve GO's objective of equity. This will only be achieved if a suitable
operation plan is devised and implemented; consequently, addressing such
operatlonaV matters early In the development ef the system is of paramount
importance. Water use studies  and  continuous  monitoring  of  agricultural
benefits  are  essential  to  enable operational improvements to be made. If
operational efficiency is not achieved the full potential benefits which
have been assumed will not be realised; Investments in construction near the
tail of the system will have been wasted and the economic viability of
further development will be undermined.
Lessons for Further Development of UKS
7.7      The  Irrigation  Department  must  pay  more  attention  to project
planning and in particular the coordination of irrigation develonment, the
programme for raising the water level in Almatti reservoir and the
resettlement of Dagalkot, and the feasibility of pumped irrigation schemes.
The ;ltimate extent of the project (stage Ir) and the optimum use of the
allocated  water  should  be  studied  together  with  conjunctive  use   of
groundwater. Estimates of water lost in the irrigation network should be
improved by measurements so that correct quantities of water are delivered
to farms and losses in the system can be identified and allowed for or
reduced. The agricultural soil survey results should be taken into account
when designing the irrigat 3n network.
7.8      The  quality  of design and construction must be improved. Measures
which could be adopted to achieve this include the separation of the
Irrigation  Department  from  other  parts  of  PWO  so that only staff with
suitable training and experience in irrigation are employed, the reduction
of staf turnover by incentives and improved facilities in the project area,
and the appointment of a Project Manager with overall responsibility for the
project. Engineers must be made aware of the high professional standards
that are required at all times. Construction contracts should be awarded to
contractors with adequate resources of skilled man-power, plant and finance,
and the knowledge and experience to maintain high standards of construction:
this will require much larger contracts in order to attract suitable
contractors. Contract documents should be-improved to minimize litigatiovi.

1. preface and Basi  data      The statements that the
Sheet*                       credit *$closing date
was 31-3-X983 and the pro-
ject was extended by
3 years, are not correct.
The credit closing date
as per the agreement was
31-3-1984 which was extend-
ed by 2 years unto 31-3-1986.
2. Bvaluatioa summary           The slackness in implemen-
Iiplementation Expe_         tation has F-een attributed
rdnce  Findings and          to staffing weakness charac-
Lessons.                     terised by lack of accounta-
bility and resnonsibility
etc., ThLs statement is far
from truth. The main hurdles
encountered during imzlemen-
tation are land acquisition
nroblems and contractual
oroblems like Arbitration
etc.
3. Para 3.7                     It is stated that the
inadequate trovisions
for cross regulators
on SrC were due to the
inadequate Geotechnical
investigations . Noimally
a    canlal investigatioLis,
Geotechnical methods are
not adopted. Trial bores/
nits are found to be
sufficient.
4- para 3.8                     The present design of
Almatti Dam has been
accepted by WCM.
5. Para 3.9                     It is stated that the Canal
works were procured through
41 small contracts under
WC: procedures. This is not
true.  The works of ILV

and SBC were procured only through
ICB contracts. It is also not true
that the project staff were in..
capable of effective supervision
resulting in substandared works.
No. doubt, there might have been a
few instances where the quality
of work suffered. Immediate correc-
tive action has been taken by the
project staff, whenever necessary.
6.  3.19 to 3.23             A detailed action plan for R&R
of families affected by UKP (in-
cluding those of First Phase)
has since been prepared and Made
a part of the Second phase pro-
ject proposed for implementation
with World Bank Assistance.
7. Para 3.27                 It is stated that the project
took 9 years instead of 5 years
for its completion. This is not
true. The project was implemented
in a- pe*Lod wasem           iU
a period of 8 years from 1978 to
1986.
8.  Para 3.29                It is stated that no formal re-allo-
cation of credit was carried out to
correct the situation of over_disburse_
ment'in other categories. In fact,
the Government of Karnataka had
sent up proposals for re_allocation
of credits under the project, to the
Denartment of Economic Affairs ln
Deceml,er 1984 itself and the DEA in
its letter No. 4/23/8/FP-TITdated
9-5-1985 had forwarded the proposals
to the World Rank;  Subsequently,
inNovember 1985, modified proposals
for reallocation of credits were
sent to the DEA. As can be seen from
the above, the GOK had initiated
necessary proposals for the reallo-
cation of credits before the credit
closing date itself.
9.  Table-l                  The year of completion of First
Stage project is shown as 2004, This
is aot correct. It is proposed to
complete the First S-age by 1995-96.
