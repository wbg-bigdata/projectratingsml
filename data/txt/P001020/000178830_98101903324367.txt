REPUBLIC CF GUINEA
APPRAISAL CF BOKE BAUXITE EXTENSION PROJECT
* SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In 1963 the Government entered into a basic agreement with a conpany
subsequently incorporated as Halco Mining, Inc. to create the Compagnie des
Bauxites de Guinee (CBG) for the exploitation of the large bauxite deposits
near Boke in northwest Guinea. The Govermnent owns 49% and Halco 51% of 020.
The Government was to provide the infrastructure for the project consisting of
a railway, a port and township, and Halco was to supply the mining, processing
and bauxite train equipment.
ii.       In 1966 the Bank made an engineering loan of US$1.7 million (S.1.-
GUI) for final engineering and preparation of contract documents and the
Goverrment set up the Office d'Amenagement de Boke (OFAB) to carry out this
part of the project. Subsequently, Halco was reorganized to include six major
aluminum companies as shareholders and the project was enlarged so as to
accomnodate the nining of 6.6 million tons of bauxite and transportation of up
to 8 million tons per annurx. Following these developments, a Bank loan for
US$64.5 million (557-GUI) vas signed in September 1968 and became effective
December 1968.  It provided the foreign exchange content of the estimated
US$83.5 million total cost of the transport infrastructure. local currency
with a margin of security was provided by a loan from USAID for US$21 O miILJcn.
iii.      The original (Loan 557-GUI) project comprised a new port insta11a-
tion at Kamsar on the Rio Nunez 'with a dredged access channel, a 136 km
railway from Kamsar to Sangaredi, and a new town at Kamear to house OFAB and
CBG personnel.  The total cost originally estimated at US$83 5 million, is
nov expected to be US$88.5 million, with foreign exchange overruns of US$7.5
million financed by CBG, and local currency savings of US$2.5 million. All2
these works are being undertaken by one civil engineering contractor.  Con-
pletion, originally forecast for April 1972, is now expected in December 1972.
CBG's mining project provided mine operating equipment, locomotives, ore cars;
crushing, drying and loading equipment at an estimated original cost of
US$99.0 million, now revised to US$113.9 including pre-operating expenses,
Tractionel (Belgium) carried out engineering for both OFAB and CBG works.
iv.       Because of the increased world demand for aluminum and the Halco
shareholders wish to diversify bauxite ore sources, the shareholders and tlb
Guinea Government representatives agreed, at a CBG meeting in November 1970,
to further increase the annual production and sales of bauxite to 9.2 millitn
tons.  The Goverument of Guinea has now asked the Bank to finance the US$9.0
million foreign exchange component of the estimated US$12.9 million total ccst
of an extension of the project financed under Loan 557-GUI. Sufficient lecal
funds will be available from the original USAID loan.
v.        In addition to the BanK and USAID loan agreements, and the Bank
Project Agreement with the Government, eight other agreements were signed 1y
the Bank, the Government, CFAB, CEG and Haleo. These included the Financial
Assurances Agreement 'which because of the Government's lack of credit-worthSnems,



- ii -
covered, inter alia, satisfactory arrangements to service Loan 557-GUI and
arrangements whereby Halco shareholders would finance any foreign exchange
overrun thereon. The Construction Coordination Committee (CCC) was formed
at the Bank's suggestion to coordinate OFAB's and CBG's planning and con-
struction. Ail these arrangements will continue in force for the extension
project.
vi.       The extension of the Government's transportation infrastructure
under the proposed project includes additional harbor works to increase capac-
ity, longer railway passing stations and heavier rail, additional roads and
services at the Kamsar townsite, an increase to the hospital, and ancillary
works. Construction will be carrÓed out by variation orders on the existing
contracts. It is expected to be fully completed by March 1973 and sufficiently
advanced for the first shipments of bauxite to be made in December 1972.
It will be impractical to disburse from the original and extension loans
separately and it is proposed that the two now be considered as an expanded
loan of US$73.5 million.  Total cost of the OFAB expanded project will be
US$101.4.. million. CBG will expand ore production and processing capacity
to 9.2 million tons/annually and its investment will increase to US$143.5
million. Total cost of the overall project will be US$245.0 million
vii.      On the basis of the projected sales and selling prices, the latter
protected by escalation clauses, it is estimated that the discounted financial
rate of return on the Governnent's investment will increase from 1h.5% (origi-
nal project) to 20.8% (expanded project), and the internal economic return
from 18% to 26%, over an economic life conservatively estimated at 20 years.
The Government's financial rate of return on the extension project alone !ill
be 48%. The increase in net foreign exchange earnings of Guinea should
amoimt in aggregate, to about US$575 million over 20 years for the expanded
project, compared with US$300 million estimated for the original project.
This sum, if stated as an annual average of US$28.8 million, is equal to
aboutlOO%of the present annual net export earnings of Guinea.
viii.     The extension project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$9.0 million equivalent to the Governnent of Guinea for a term of 21
years including a two-year grace period.

APFRAISAL 0F BOKE BIJXITE EXTENSION PROJECT
1 . INTRODUCTION
1.01      The original Boke bauxite project loan - 557-GUI for uS$64.5 million -
vas signed on Septemaber 8, 1968 and became effective December 15, 1968 (Report
TO-672a, August 30, 1968). It provided the estimated foreign exchange for
construction of transport infrastructure and a townsite (See Chapter 3 below)
to enable some 6.6 million tons of bauxite to be exported annually from a new
mine. The mine was to be developed and financed by the Compagnie des Bauxites
de Guinee (CBG). The total cost of the transport infrastructure and townsite
was estimated to be US$83.5 million, of which the local currenc.,. US$19.0
million equivalent, was provided by a loan from USAID set at T.3$2l.O Ôillion
equivalent to provide a margin of security. A previous Bank eng _.-airlng loan -
S.1 .-GUI for US,1.7 .illi-on - had been si aed on la±-'ch 30, 1966 toefinance con-
sultant services required to provide detailed engineering and cost estimates.
Loan S.1.-GUI was refinanced by loan 557-GUI.
1.02      The Government of Guinea has now asked the Bank for a further US$9.0
million loan to finance the foreign exchange comnponent of the estimated
US$12.9 million equivalent total cost for an extension of the infrastructure
of the Boke project. This extension will enable the production and sale of
bauxite to be increased from the originally proposed 6.6 million tons to 9.2
million tons. Halco shareholders (para. 2.01) contracted ta take 5.1 millicn
tons of the original production and 9.0 million tons of the increased produc-
tion in order to diversify their sources of bauxite ore to meet increased
world aluminum demand. The balance of 0.2 million tons represents sales of
calcined ore on the free market. CBG vill finance the necessary extension of
the mine facilities.
1.03      This appraisal report was prepared by R. Carmignani (Industrial
Projects Department), F. Higginbottom and F. Sander (Transportation Projects
Department). Assistance with the country economy and legal sections vas
provided by M.J.W.M. Paijmans (Western Africa Departiaent) and G. Dela2me
(Legal Department).
1.04      The appraisal is based on:  (a) engineering reports by the Belgian
consulting firm Traction et Electricite (Tractionel) on the transportation and
mining aspects of the project; (b) consultations with CBG on legal and tech-
nical aspects and on production and operating costs; and (c) findings of Bank
staff following visits in Conakry, on the site of the project and in EÓttsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

2.  BACKGROUND
A. Existing Project Organiz-ition and Agreements
2.01      In October 1963, a long term contract was signed between the Govern-
ment and Halco I4inÓng, Inc., at that time a subsidiary of the Harvey Aluminzir
Co. As a result of subsequent re-organization the present shareholders of
Halco are:
PercentagMe -of _Ownership
Aluminum Company of America                     27%
Alcan Aluminum Limited                           27%
Harvey Aluminum Ccipany                         20%
Vereinigte Aluminum Works                        10%
Pechiney-Ugine                                   10%
1Montecatini-Edison                               6%
The contract governs the terms and conditions for the mining and marketing cf
the large bauxite deposits in northwest Guinea and specifically in the Boke
region (para. 2;12), through the establishment of a mixed company called
"Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee" (CBG) owned 51% by Halco and 49% by the
Government. Annex 1 gives details of its main provisions.
2.02      To carry out its part of the project, mainly construction and oper-
ation of the infrastructure, the Governwent, by decree, establisfted a semi-
autonomous agency, the Of'ice d'Amenagement de Boke (OFAB) in l'65  Details
of OFAB's constitution and duties are given in Annex 2.
2.03      Because of the complexity of the project and because the consulting
engineers, Tractionel, were appointed for CBG as well as for the Government,
the Construction Coordination Committee (CCC) was established.  This comprises
an independent chairman and the construction managers of CBG and OFAB.  Its
duties and mode of operation are given in Annex 3.
2.04      The Boke project, with its many responsibilities divided among the
Government, OFAB, CBG and the Halco shareholders, required eight agreements
in addition to the Bank's loan and project agreements and the loan agreement
with USAID. These are listed and summarized in Annex 4.
2.05      In view of the lack of creditworthiness of the Guinean economy
(Economic Report AF 63.b, September 1967), the Bank obtained iatisfactory
arrangements to secure service of Loan 557-GUI from funds provided by CBG and
the Ba co shareholders. These are dealt with in the Financial Assurances
Agreem£nt as supplemented by the Trust Agreement. Guineats lack of credit-
Vorttiness persists.  Should CBG's operations not provide sufficient funds
to enab-le the Government to fulfill its debt service ob igation to the Bank
then '3G, Haico and ultimately the shareholders themsel2 es are bound to make
payia_ it to the Trustee.  The Financial Assurances Agreement also covers the
arrangements wh,roby the shareholders will advance, thr:ugh the trustee, funds
to complete the project in case of an overrun in foreign exchange cost. Halco
is, of course, responsible for the necessary investment in the mining section
of the project.



- 3 -
2 c06     The Financial As3urances Agreement includes a "force majeure" clause
which relieves CBG and the Halco shareholders of their obligations under
certain conditions, Namely, if events make it impossible to construct or
operate the OPAB or the CBG project for a period of 180 days and only inen
such events arise from political causes within, or acts of war directly
relating to, Guinea or its territory. These obligations may be terminated
only if the suspension continues for 600 days or in certain other circum-
stances outlined in Annex 4, page 2,
B. Courtry Economy
2.0?      Guinea has an area of 95,000 sq  mi  and a total populatio-: Sol::s r
about 3.8 million, increasing at an annual rate of about 268%. Agriculture
is the principal economie activity and contributes about one-half of GDP,
mining and manufacture account for about 13%, construction and energy for 20%
and administration for 20%.
2 .8      Although the pace of investment has steadily risen, the economic
growth rate is not likely to have exceeded that of population growth. Indeed,
because of decreasing incentives, agriculture has grown very slowly. GDP per
capita has stagnated at around US$800  Although manufacturing has expanded
since 1960, the value added is still relatively small. In recent years,
mining value has declined, because of termination of iron mining and exhaus-
tion of bauxite reserves on Kassa Island. The long term prospects for mining
in Guinea appear promising, however, with bauxite exports from Boke and the
Dussian development at Kindia, Mineral exports, which represent about two-
thirds of total exports will probably continue to be the most important source
of foreign exchange earnings.
2.09      Nining is largely omned by private foreign interests. Halco )Lring
Inc. has the exclusive right to mine bauxite on Tamara Island; production was
expected to reach one million tons in 1970. Halco will market 600,000 tons,
Guinexport (commercial state enterprise) will market the remainder. The most
important bauxite mining venture actually operating in Guinea is the Compagnie
Internationale pour la production d'Alumine (Fria), owned 48.5% by Olin
Mathieson Chemical Corporation (US) and 26.5% by Pechiney-ULgine (France).
Fria owns and operates various mines near Kimbo, an alumina plant, a railway
and export facilities in Conakry. Annual production is expected to increase
to 700,000 tons in 1971, and to 1,000,000 in 1975. The company retains two-
thirds of its foreign exchange receipts and surrenders the rest to the
Central Bank for local currency.
C. Bauxite Reserves and. Marketability
lWorld Bauxite I4arket
2.10      Following the rapid growth in consumption of aluminum (9.2% per year
over the period 1959-.969), world bauxite production increased rapidly over
the same period (9e5% per year) to reach 46 million tons in 1969.  Developinr
countries accounted for about 64% of the world bauxite production in 1969 and
four leading countries (Jamaica, Australia, Surinam and Guyana) for more than
62% (Annex 5(v))o
2011      The expected future trend in world aluminum production and con-
simption will result in increased demand for bauxite. According to Bank



- 4 -
projecti.ons, world demand in 1975 uill reach about 60 million tons (f;lrnc-x
5(v)).  Guinea wU.l, by t1iat date, account for about 17% of world supply aad
the Boke project (8,0 million tons by 1975) for about 13%. Furthermore, the
Boke project would account for some 50% of the increase in world supply
between 1969 and 1975.
Ore Reserves
2.12      Balixite deposits in the northwest of Boke are estimated to contain
at least 1.75 billion tons of high grade bauxite. The project's mining
facilities wfill extract bauxite from the Sangaredi block which contains about
210 to 220 million tons with a dry alumina content above 58% and a minimum of
185 million tons of bauxite with a dry alumina content of 58.9% (Annex 5(i))d
2.13      It can be concluded that there are sufficient bauxite reserves in
the Sangaredi block alone to meet the requirement of the bauxite sales con-
tracts signed betwieen CBG and Halco's shareholders (para. 2.14).
Sales and Prices
2.14      CBG has signed 20-year contracts with Halco shareholders guaraxitee-
ing, subject only to CBG's production of the required quantities, the sale of
the proposed increased production of metallurgical grade bauxite up to 9.0
million tons per aninum. These contracts, compared with the original project
contracts are detailed below:

The quality and quantities of metallurgical grade bauxite contracted by
Halcols different shareholders are shown in Annex 5(ii) and (iii).
2.15      Under the original project the balance o? bauxite ore sales (1.3
million tons/an.num) and some 200,000 tons of calcined bauxite, for use as
abrasives in the cheimical industry, vere to be sold on the free market. Unde-r
the expanded project only 200,000 tons of calcined b=uxite are to be sold on
the free marlcet.

The base prices will be adjusted for alumina, silica and water content. Pric3
escalation clauses which protect CBG against increases in production cost,
have been reviewed and tested by the Bank; they have been found favorable to
Guinea. Calcined bauxite will be sold on the free market at about US$33/ton.
AdJustments and escalation clauses are discussed in Annex 5(iv) and are fourd
acceptable.  The contractual prices are irrespective of world production levr2

3.01      The works being financed by Loan 557-GUI, which were based on a
forecast 6.6 million tons of bauxite to be exported annually and which have a
maximum capacity of 8.0 million tons/annumn, comprise:
(i)  A single track standard gauge railwray 136 lm long from
the mine location at Sangaredi to a new port at Kamsar.
(ii)  A new port at Kamsar with an approach and loading jetty

an area of some 88 ha on which CBG provides 370 houses,
and OFAB 225. Water supply is being piped some 60 km
from Boke.
(iv) Supply of floating and heavy lift equipment to operate
the port, three locomotives and some passenger and goods
wagons for CFAB traffic.
3.02      The original engineering loan (S.1.-GUI) enabled consultants to
prepare final engineering and cost estimates. Loan 557-GUI provided for
letting contracts, professional services for engineering supervision and other
supervision costs of OFAB.
3.03      Because of the complexity of the works to be undertaken, and the
logistic problens involved in carrying out the work in the undeveloped area
between Kamsar, Boke and Sangaredi, one overall contractor was selected to
-onstruct all OFAB's and CBG's civil engineering works, following international
competitive bidding. The contractor comprised an association of Impresa
Astaldi Estero (Italy), Constructions et Enterprises IndustrieIles (Belgium),
and Westminister Dredging Company, Ltd. ('Th)rQiCEW).  Thr-parate supply
contracts were also let for OFAB equipment. DetaiLs of all contracts are given
in Table 1.
3.04      The CCC, on behalf of OFAB, supervises the consultants' work and
certifies the money due to the contractor.

- /  Overrun is financed by CBG overage loan.
The estimated foreign exchange overrun for construction is due to increased
quantities, an allowance for construction claims and a higher cost escalation
than originally provided. The increase in interest and the additional con-
tractorls claim are due to anticipated late completion (para0 3.07).
Official escalation on the local currency portion of the expenditure has
proved less than anticipated but an additional claim is expected. Details of
the original allocation of loan funds together with the present estimnated
expenditure under each category are given in Table 2.
3.o6     Wulork coii%enced on site in October 1969 and is expected to be suffi-
ciently completed to enable bauxite to be shipped by December/January
1972/73, about ten mionths after the contract date. On March 31, 1971 the
value of civil engineering work completed was US$28,26 equivalent - about 38i57
including US$23.1 million foreign exchange.  Disbursements from the loan on
April 30, 1971 amounted to US$27.5 million; disbursement is normally made 90
days after measurement of work on site, but includes aiso costs of supply
contracts supervision and interest. A disbursement schedule showing the
present estimated disbursements from Loan 557-GUI is given in Table 3.
3.07      Delays on tle project have occurred due to: (i)  the contractorts
problems caused by strikes in Italy which delayed arrival of plant and equip-
ment; (ii) lack of suitable skilled labor in Guinea; (iii) the bankruptcy
of the subcontractor employed for construction of the jetty; and (iv) the
political situation in Guinea which has resulted in: (a) problems in labor
recruitment; (b) difficulties in interpretation of agreements; and (c) the
disturbances of November 1970.



- 7 -
3.08      Imzrediately £oilowimng the November 1970 disturbances, and until late
February 1971, difficulties were experienced in obtaining visas for consul-
tant's and contractorts personnel to enter and leave the country. These
latter events caused considerable delays and are likely to give rise to
clais by the contractor.
3-09      Experience since October 1969 has indicated a need for close
supervision by Bank staff and the usefulness of the CCC in promoting liaison
between all parties involved. However, most problems have been resolved and
the project is proceeding satisfactorily, although some ten months 'late
overall.
3.10      One particular item on which experience has shown that special
attention must be given is the maintenance of road traffic between Boke and
Conakry via the ferry at Boffa. During negotiations for the extension loan,
the Government undertook to maintain the road and ferry in a satisfactory
condition.
B. CBG Installations
3.11      The contracts for (BG s installations at Sangaredi and Iamsar, and
for the railway transport equipment provide:
(i) At the SanUaredi mine site: Necessary drilling
equipment and loading shovels, electrical power
supplies, and a towship <ivth housing for a staff
of about 250.
(ii)  At the Ka-msar Industrial Installation:  Bauxite
ore-hanaling, drying and storage equipment, con-
veyors on the loading wharf and a shiploader, and
construction of houses at the tovnship site provided
by CF12.
(iii) Transportation eauipment comprising diesel locomotives
and ore cars.
3.12      The original CBG processing equipment was designed for a maximurx
annual production of 6.6 million tons. Annex 6(i) gives details of the
original project together with the 1968 estimate of its capital cost. The
present cost, compared with that of 1968 is given below:

3.13      The CBG mining cost overrmn is about US$1.U. million due to increase
of interest during constriction and price escalation;including CBGts cverage
loan and working capital increase, the total CBG overrun reaches US$22.4
million.
3.14      All construction and equipment purchase contracts had been let
by 1970. Annex 6(iii), gives details of contractors, and dates on which
contracts were let; the present status of contracts is discussed in Chapter
4-B.
4. TE EXTESION  rOJECT
4.01      In the light of increased world demand for alumiflwm (Annex 5(v))
the Guinean and Halco directors of CBG, at their meeting in Noveznber 1.970,
agreed to increase the annual production and sales of bauxite from Sangaredi
to 9 million tons, and the Halco partners signed contracts to take the in-
creased quantities.  It will therefore be necessary to increase CBG's invest
ment in the m.ine facilities and rake additions and improvements to the port
railway and townsite being constructed by the Grinea Government. Details of
the necessary works and their estimated cost are given below.
A. _FAB
Description and Cost of Works
Harbor Works
4.02      The original project provided for 30,000 dwt ships to leave the load-
ing wharf for the open sea at half tide; if they missed the tide they had to
remain alongside the wharf. With exports at a maximum of 6.6 million tons
annually, this arrangement was acceptable whatever the arrival sequence of
ships for loading, and up to 8.0 million tons could be handled if the arrival
sequence followed a regi:lar pattern. For exports of 9.2 million tons annually,
better use of the loading capacity must be ensured. This will be done by
providing a waiting berth with breasting and mooring dolphins to which a
loaded ship can be moved to await the tide, thus permitting the loading of
any waiting ship as soon as the previous vessel is loaded. The opportunity
will be taken to make provision for handling oil imports for the mine facili-
ties at the nev berth. The depth of water available at the new waiting berth
and the existing loading berth has already been increased to enable the han-
dling of up to 45,000 dwt vessels.  This was done, on CBG's instructions, on
completion of the original dredging contract so as to avoid the expense of
bringing the dredger back to the site. Ancillary works included are the
foundaticns for the heavy lift derrick in its new location, and a slipway at
Kamsar to reduce the time required for necessary overhauls to floating craft.
Railway
4.03      The additional tonnage will be handled on the railway by using longer
trains so that the track at the three passing stations will have to be length-
ened. Earthworks, to enable longer sidings to be constructed, were included



-9 -
in the original project.  A dec'sion to use heavier rail had aiready been
taken on the original project to increase the useful lif'e of the track and
would have been financed by CBG as part of the overrun. As the heavier rail
is necessary with the increased traffic to give normal running life, the cost,
is included in the proposed loan..
Tovnsite
4.04      Extra roads and services will be required at the Kamsar tmmsite to
serve the additional houses to be built by CBG and the hospital wvill have to
be enlarged5 the original loan provided for sufficient fill to enable exten-
sions to take place.
4.o5      OFAB also proposes to make improvements to its houses, to match
similar improvements to CBG housses and to improve the drainage and sanitation
of the surroanding area; the Bank will include part of the foreign exchange
cost involved in the Loan.
General
4.06      The foreign exchange cost of the extended consulting engineers',
legal and audit services for OFAB, together with that of CFAB's and CCC's
supervisory services is included in the proposed loan.
4.07      The estimated cost of the additional works and services in the
OFAB extension project are given below, with detail of individual items at
Table 4.

4.08      The estimated costs are based on estinates prepared by the engineer-
ing consultants and are related to existing contract prices as increased by
the appropriate escalation rate. They are considered satisfactory by the
Bank.  The physical contingencies are about 12% on all iters wzith an addi-
tional 8% for price contingencies but excluding supervision costs.

4.10      The proposed extension loan would finance the total foreign curreney
cost of the new works and the supervision and other professional services
required, amounting to US$9.0 million equivalent.  The local currency cost liI3.
be financed from the original US$21.0 million equivalent USAID loan (see also
para. 5,07). Should the US$9 million foreign exchange provision prove in-
adequate, CBG will also be responsible for any overrun on the extension.
Procurement
4.11      The works to be constructed for the extension project fall within
the scope of existing contracts 1, 5 and 6 (Table 1). Apart from the extra
cost involved in a new contractor setting up in Guinea, it eould be imprac-tcal
to have two contractors on the same sites. It is therefore proposed to issue
variation orders on the existing contracts based on the existing prices plus
escalattion.
Construction Schedule and Disbursement
4.12      All the new works are expected to be completed by April/'Ilay 1973.
Work on both the items financed by the original loan and those included in
the proposed extension loan will proceed concurrently; it is therefore
considered impractical to attempt to isolate expenditure on work perfoni.ed
under the tbo loans.  Accordingly, it is recommended that the new loan, if
approved, be added to the existing loan to make the sum available for
disbursement US$73.5 million,  It is expected that disbursement of US$64.5
million provided under the original loan will be completed during the quarter
ending September 1972. Although contingencies have necessarily been included
in arriving at the US$9.0 million cost of the new toraks, the full amount of
the expanded US$73.5 million loan will be disbursed because in accordance



- l1 -
with the Financial Assurances Agreement, CBG only provides Overage Loans
to OFAB to cover expenciture in excess of funds available from the Bank
Loan. By April 30, l971, US$27.5 million had been disbursed. A schedule
of disbursement from such an expanded loan is given in Table 3 and summarized
belOW:
Bank Fiscal Year          Amount Disbursed at End of Period

1971                                32.5
1972                                60.0
1973                                73.5
Expenditures all come within the allocation categories of the existing loan
as is shown in Table 2.
Retroactive Financing
4.13      The existing contracts require the contractor to be advised of
additional work requirements before the loan is expected to be signed.
However, the onl;r actual expenditures anticipated prior to loan signature
are for dredging (the new dredging had to be done before the dredgers left
the site), possibly the cost of additional rails required depending on when
they are delivered (they have been ordered), and electrical supplies. The
cost of dredging, US$160,,000 and perhaps the rail US$70,000, will be paid
from existing loan funds. CBG has guaranteed to cover such expenditure in
the event the extension loan is not approved and up to an additional
US$500,000 if required.
B. CBG
Additions, I_nprovements and Extensions Financed by CBG
4.14      Tlhe original projectts equipment and construction contracts have
been nodified by increasing the size/capacity of the individual items of
equipment ordered under the original project to increase the overall capacity
of the mine and processing plant to 9.2 million tons/annum. Sone improvements
in design have also been incorporated. The proposed extensions are detailed
in Annex 6(ii).
Cost Estimates and Contract Status
4.15     WrJith the exception of sone mining and general equipment (contract
50), all contracts have been let and the additions to the original project
have been approved. All variation orders to cover improvements and extension
items have been prepared and most had been signed by December 1970; provision
has also been albowed for elaims on each contract. All equipnient contracts
are fixed price contracts and construction contracts are fixed unit price.
Annex 6(iii) gives the name of the supplier/contractor, the date of contract,
the construction budget and the conmitments as Of December 1970 for each
contract.

4.16      On the basis of the total construction cost shown in Annex 6(iii)
the following teble shows the capital cost of the exparided CBG project as
of February 1971 at start of operations.  The total cost of construction
at start-up is estimated at US$117 million, of iwhich about US$9 million is
local currency. Some US$7 million of this amount will be supplied by hard
currency converted into Guinean Francs and about US$2 million by non-
repatriated earnings from Halco's Guinean subsidiary.

h.19      All equipment iL  expected to arrive on site at the end of 1971 and
during spring 1972. The erection of drying kilns to be completed in Octobelr/
November 1972 will terminate CBGts construction work. Stockpiling of metal-
lurgical grade bauxite is therefore scheduled to start in December 1972.
Shipping Date for Bauxite
4.20      Under the original project, shipment of bauxite to fulfill Halco's
contractual obligations was to commence not later than 90 days after issue of
a completion certificate as defined in the Financial Assurances Agreement.
Extension of the project and consequent later completion requires issuing a
certificate of substantial completion, (when the state of constructicn has been
advanced to a point where bauxite can be shipped) which jill obligate Halco
to commence shipment 90 days or less thereafter. Such a definition has been
agreed and incorporated as paragraphs 4.08 and U,09 of the amended Financial
Assurances Agreement.
5.  FIMANCIAL
5.01      The total initial investment in the integrated mining and transport
complex will be about US$245 million for the expanded project (paras. h.09
and 4.16) as compared to about US$182,5 million for the original project (1968
estimate excluding CBG and OFAB overruns).
A. CBG Investment and Financing
5.02      The initial investment in the expanded project to be provided by
CBG, together .i‚th preliminary expenses incurred by Halco and its shareholders
and the working capital necessary to start operations (including US$7.5
million overage loan), is estimated at US$151.0 million (para. 4.16). Further
capital expenditures will be incurred after start-up to bring the plant capa-
city to 9.2 million tons per year (Annex 6).
5.03      The initial financing plan and additional financing required in
early years of operation are given in Table 5 and sunmarized below. Due to
delays in start-up, principal repayments (amounting to US$2.1 million) will
have to be made in 1972, prior to start-up and are included in the total
capital requirement. Interest payments have been capitalized until start-upe

and its shareholders to provide all the funds needed to complete the original
mining project; in particular, it stipulates that Halco and its shareholders
will provide (according to a schedule) US$36 million as a part of CBGes
equity of US$37 million. However, the agreement does not stipulate any rules
concerning the obligation of Halco and its shareholders to increase their
equity contribution in case of overrun or expansion.  The initial financing
plan of the original project (determined by the Agreement) and of the ex--
panded project (as proposed by Halco) show the same equity contribution -
US$37 million. Given the increase in capital cost due both to the CBG/OFAB
overruns and to the extension project costs, the initial debt-equity ratio
for the original project 63/37 becomes 76/24 for the expanded project.

5.05       al-co has no legal obliga+ion to increase its equity contribution
and, for the fo1lo^Ing reasons, the Bank is satisfied with the expanded
project's initial debt-equity ratio and with the proposed financing plan.
(i) The long-term debts contracted by CEG are fully
guaranteed by Halco and its shareholders; Halco
commitments to the project have substantially
increased since the 1968 appraisal.
(ii)  The debt service coverage of the Bank loan improves
as a result of the expansion (para. 5.15) and
improves with each year of project operation (parae 5.11).
(iii)  The income to the Governient of Guinea will increase
in proportion more rapidly than the dividends earned
by Halco after the extension (Table 14).
(iv)  There are no market risks, given the contractual
arrangements; Guinea is protected against increases
in operating costs by satisfactory escalation clauses.
(v) The general conditions stipulated in the "8S'è letterr"l/
addressed by Halco to the Governnent of Guinea (December 11,
1968) are likely to be met.
(vi)  The initial debt-equity ratio improves quickly after
start-up of operations.
The debt-equity ratio is therefore not of critical financial significance
to the Bank or to the Government of Guinea.
5.06      Except for US$26 million, shown under senior debt loan agreements
not yet executed (paras 5.03), and to which the provisions of the '"81-
letter" will also apply, financing for the miDinng project has been
arranged at terms and conditions given in Table 5. Additional financing
required during the early years of operation to supplement cash generation
To insure that unforeseen developments with respect to interest rates
to be borne by CBG will not reduce too much the Profits Tax to be paid
by CBG to the Government of Guinea, Halco has agreed that it will cause
CBG not to claim, in determining the Profits Tax to the Governnent of
Guinea,any deduction from its annual income wJith respect to interest
to be paid by CBG, to the extent that such interest might exceed an
average rate of 8TI: on all CBG debt (excluding US$20 million free
subordinated debt).

for working capital and equipment purchases, will be supplied partly in tlia
form of a revolving credit (US$8 million) during the first three years of
operation, and partly through long-tern  tied fi-nancng (US$h.6 million) for
the purchase of expnsion equipment.
B.  Guinea Inves tent and Financin;
5.07      The total investment of the Government of Guinea in the expanded
project is expected to be about US$101.4 (para. 4.09). The sourcos of the
estimated finance are as follows:
US$ million
Foreign       Local      Total
IBRD Loan 557-GTJI           64.5          _        64.5

Total Finance           81.0          20.4     101.4
5.08      Loan 557-GUI is for a term of 24 years including a five year grace
period, with an interest rate of 614 per annum. Tne first redemption p-iyrmen't
is due on October 1, 1973. The CBG Overage Loan will be made, in accordance
with the terms of the Financial Assurances Agreement, on substantially the
same terms and conditions as Loan 557-GUI as to rate of interest and grace
period. However, subject to thle proviso in the Financial Assurances Agreemn_nt
that Guinea, after pa3nrent of debt service, shall not receive in cash in and
year a payment of less than 60% of the total profits tax, the Overa- g-An
may be redeezaed at such a rate as the profits from the bauxite operivaions
permit.  In the forecasts which follow it is assumed that the proposed Bank
Loan of US$9.0 million for the expansion project will be for a term of 21 years
including two years' grace, -aith interest at the rate of 7º5 per a;r.iam, and
that the first redemption paynent will coincide with that of Loan 557-GUI,
i.e. on October 1, 1973.  The term  of the USAID loan is 30 years inclusive of
a grace period of !‡ years counting from the date of the first Ónterest pay'
nient. Interest is at the rate o? 21-I… per annun. Repaynent bi'l b*e by equal
half-yearly installments, with declining interest.

years of operati-on of the expanded project. To facil_tate co.parison, the

2/ See Annex 1, page 4.
Because of economies of scale, the net lncome and profits tax increase nore
than proportionetely to the increase in the level of production.  Other poinlts
of interest are:
(i)  Worlking costs tend to decrease because of the progre,-.iive
replacement of high-cost expatriate staff by lower-cost
local staff.
(ii)  Provision for depreciation of fixed assets also decroases
over time, because the service lives of assets, as pre-
cribed in the basic ag7eement for purposes of calculating
depreciation charges, are shorter than the expected Gco-
nomic service lives of the assets in actual use (Table 6
gives C3G depreciation schedule).
5.10      The end result is that increased net incoine for Guinea and CBGts
private shareholders arply justifies the additional investment needed to
incrnase the level of production to 9.2 million tons of bauxite per year
(paras. 5.17, 5.18).

Debt Equity Ratio            56/h4 44/66 3)/56   70/30  55/45  17/83
The following points are of interest:
(i)  Net fixed assets increase proportionately to the increased
investment.
(ii)  Current assets, the majority of which represents 90 days'
credit on bauxite sales, increase proportionately to output.
(iii)  Advances to Governmnent include the overage loan and are
therefore greater at the outset, but are repaid faster
because of the greater revenues made available to the
Govemnnent by the expanded operation.
(iv)  The initial debt equity ratio 76/24 improves only slightly
in the second year of operation and more rapidly thereafter.
As explained in para. 5.05 this position is acceptable to
the Bank although less satisfactory than for the original
project.

may be sumarized as follows lor the fifteen years of the proj ection:

Total Applications                  232.0                  405.8
5.13      The projecti.on maintains the principle, agreed during negotiations
for the original project, that in any one year the sum paid out in current
and deferred dividends to the Halco shareholders shall not exceed the residual
sum received by the Gove'nnaent of Guinea as profits tax (after payuent of
debt service on the Bank loans). CBGts debt service coverage is shown in
Table 9 and is satisfactory.
E. Goverrneat Income from Baxite Operations
5.14      In the original Appraisal Report, the financial responsibilities
of the Government of Guinea, OFAB, CBG and the Trustee were described.  It
was shown that the financial benefits accruing to the Governnent of Guinea
from the bauxite operation, supported by the financial assurances given by
CBG, Halco and the individual shareholders of Halco, would assure that service
of the Bank loan would be apMly secured. By jncreasing bauxite sales to 9.2
million tons a year tlhe financial benefits to Guinea will be more than doubled
and, in consequence, the service of the Bank1s loans will be even more soundly
secured, as the follo<idng figures demonstrate.

See Annex 1, page 4.
5.15      The application of the formula for calculating the amount of the
advances wihich must be made by CBG to the Governnerit (to ensure that the
Governnent receives not less than 60% of the total profits tax after service
of the Bank loans) is shotsn in Table 10. It izill be seen from the above
figures that the net gain to Governnent at the higher rate of production
(after service of debt, both foreign and local) is expected to be twice as
great in the second year of operation as it would have been under the original
project, and that it tends proportionately to increase thereafter.  Debt
service coverage of the Bank loan ihiL'ch ranged between 1.5 and 2.6 under the
original project, increases to betwfeen 1.9 and 4.5 under the expanded project.
Return te Guinea per ton of Bauxite
5.16      Earlier calculations showed that Guinea would derive directly from
its participation in CBG operations (exclusive of customs duties, payroll
taxes and other imposts of a general revenue nature) a net benefit of US$1.78
per ton of bauxite sales during the 20 year term of the existing sales con-
tracts. The present projections indicate that at the expanded rate of
production now-r envisaged, Guinea will benefit from its participation in CBG
operations at the rate of US$2.82 per ton of bauxite sold.



- 21 -
F. Rates of Rettirn
5.17      In calculating the rate of return on the investment, it is assumed
that the economic service life of the assets will be 20 years, because the
term of the bauxite sales contracts entered into between CBG and the share-
holders of Halco is 20 years, after which it is conceivable that the infra-
structure assets nayf not be recuired for the purpose for which they were
built, or may be used only at sub-economic levels. The average technical
service life of the assets includedin the infrastructure is of the order of
37 years but a calculation based on this longer life wouild not add signifi-
cantly to the rate of returN. On this basis, the results given in detail
in Table il may be summarized as follows:

i/ Foreign exchange overrun on original OFAB project included in Guinea
investment.
5.18      It will be noted that, whereas the return on Guinea's investment
ias initially calculated to be the same as the return on the combined invest-
ment, the benefits to be derived from expansion of the project vill accrue
in proportionately greater degree to Cuinea than to the Halco participants,
because the additional investment needed to increase infrastructure capacity
is proportionately less than that needed to increase mining and processing
capacity.



- 22 -
5.19      Table 14 compares increased benefits to the Governmrent of Guinea
and dividends paid to Halco shareholders on the original and expanded
projects. During years four to six, because of repayuents of CBG advances
for the overrunm, Government benefits increase by 2.2 tines against 2.5
times increase in dividends paid to Halco; but for years seven to fifteen.
Government increase is in the ratio 2.5 against Halcoes 1.8, These projeotions
are conservative since they are based on 1971 constant prices with a price
escalation clause favorable to Guinea. The Government and CBG's return on
the incrernental investment establishes a clear justification for the
expanded project.  By undertaking the extension, the rate of return on the
total investment is substantially improved.
Pay-back Period
5.20      The earlier appraisal indicated that, at the average rate of
interest payable on the whole of the borrowing for the infrastructure,
pay-back period would be slightly less than 10 years. A similar calculation
based on the revised estimate of US$101i4 million for Guineals total invest-
ment gives a pay-back period of 6.8 years; the incremental investment would
be recovered in only 2.8 years. Similar calculations for the combined
Government/CBG investment produces pay-back periods of 11 years for the
total investment and 4.6 years for the incremental invest'ent.  The longer
pay-back periods for the combined investment result from the proportionately
greater increase in CBG investment and the higher rates of interest payable
on CBG borrowings.
G. Financial Advice and Audit
5.21      The Governnent of Guinea has retained Price Waterhouse and Ccipany
as financial advisers and auditors of OFAB accounts.
6. ECONOEUC EVALUATION
6.01      The Boke pro4ect will make a substantial contribution to the
economic development of Guinea by creating employnent, generating foreign
exchange and increasing the Governnent's tax revenues.  The economic analysis
of the original project, as set out in Report No. TO-672a of August 30, 1968,
evaluates the future annual additions to Guinea's national income to yield
an economic rate of return of 18% on the Governnent's investment in the
infrastructure of the project.
6.02      The proposed extension will further improve the cost-benefit rela-
tions of the project and bring the economic rate of return of the to-al
expanded project to 26%. The net increase in Government income will be more
than doubled and the stream of net foreign exchange earnings is expeicted to
yield a surplus, undiscounted, of about US$575 million over the loan repay-
ment period of 20 years., This sun, if stated as an annual average of US$29
million, is equal to about 100% of the present annual net export earnings of
the country. Details of the calculations are given in Table 12 and a summary
of the principal results follows below:

7.01      Some information on the function of various organizations involved
in connection with existing Loan 557-GUI and of the existing agreemaents signed
have been briefly described in Chapter 2-A and Annexes 1, 25 3 and 4. The
oan and project agreements for the proposed extension project incorporate
by reference the substantive provisions, of the 1968 agreemerits.
7.02      During the negotiations for the proposed loan, the followi:ng matter
was agreed vith the Governnent.
(a) H,1aintenance of the existing surface of the road between
Conakry and Boke in an acceptable condition to the Bank
and of regular and reliable operation of Boffa ferry
(pcra. 3.09).
Conditions and Effec±tiveness
7.03      In addition to the usual legal instruments, the following are also
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan:
(i)  The Financial Assurances Agreement, the Participation
Agreement, and the Bauxite contracts, as anended, shall
have become effective.
(ii) The USAID Loan Agreement shall have been amended to make
reference to the extended Project as described in Schedule
2 to the Bank Loan Agreement.
7.04      The extension project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to
the Governent of Guinea of US$9.0 million equivalent for a term of 21 years
including a grace period of tueo years.

Company of Delaware and the Guinean Minister of Economic Development.  The
agreement was ratified by the National Assembly October 24, and signed by
the President of Guinea October 26, 1963.  The name Harvey Aluminum Company
was later changed to its present name Halca Mining, Inc., incorporated
under the laws of the state of Delaware, USA.  The Agreement establishes
the terms and conditions of the exploitation of the Boke bauxite deposits,
of which the main features are summarized in the following paragraphs.
Structure of CBG
2.        A mixed-economy corporation, the "Compagnie des Bauxites de
Guinee" (CBG) was established within six months after the effective date
oa the Agreement. The corporation is a Delawiare corporation which is
also registered in Conakry. The initial capital stock is US$2 million
divided in 100,000 shares of a par value of US$20.  Of these, 49,000 "A"
shares were issued to the Government against the grant of mining rights,
and 51,000 '"B  shares to Halco, when the latter deposited the par value of
its shares (TUS$l,020,000) in the country's central bank.  Voting rights of
each "A" and "B" share are equal in stockholders meetings.  The stock capital
may be increased up to US$10 million by mutual Agreement of the parties.
Before selling their shares to others, each party must offer them first to
the other party at equal prices and conditions; "B" shares may be transferred
to any other corporation belonging to the Halco group. Only "B" shares
are entitled to dividends, which are repatriable in the original currency
of investment.  The Government, as holder of the "A" shares, does not receive
dividends but derives its profits from defined "profit taxes" (para. 8).
3.        The President of the corporation, who is not a member of the
Board of Directors, shall perform the function of general manager. He will
be designated by the directors representing the '5A' shares. The Government
designates the Vice President. The Board of Directors is composed of 10
members, of which the "A" and "'B" stockholders each designate five. The
nomination is for four years. In the event that voting in the Board results
in a tie, the non-member President (designated by the '"B shareholders) will
have the decisive vote for that particular case.
4.        The Board Of Directors is generally res-onsible for the managing
of CBG's affairs and its finances.  The President of the corporation,
assisted by the Vice President, assumes the general management and is
responsible for all transactions including sales, the corporationts finances,
the recruiting and dismissal of staff., etc.

iIining Rights
5.        The agreement defines the perimeters of the region in which CBG
is entitled to mining rights and exploitation permits. The duration of
the permits is 75 years; they grant the rights to explore, to mine and to
export bauxite (and if later so decided, to transform it into alunina or
aluminum), and to construct all plants and installations required therefor.
Financing
6.        Under the Agreement, the Government undertakes to finance and
build the infrastructure as described in the report (Chapter 3); the
Goverrnent will own it, and it may also be used for purposes other than
those related to CEG activities. The Agreement grants Halco the option
to realize the infrastructure for the Government's account, but this
procedure will not be followed.  The Governnent shall make the infrastructure
available to CBG at rates reflecting the operating cost of the use of the
infrastructure, excluding finar.cial charges corresponding to amortization
and interest of funds borrowed by the Government. It is assumed that the
latter charges wlll be paid from the "proLit taxes" paid by CBG to the
Governmeint. Tne Agreement stipulates, however, thlat CBG may pay advances
against future profit taxes, so as to allow the Government to meet its
financial obligations.
7.        Halco wll! advance to the corporation all funds needed for the
original installations of machinery and equipmEent, and for the initial
working capital for CBG's mining operations. The terms for such advances,
including interest rates, are to be mutually agreed upon between the parties.
These advances were to be considered as loans to CBG, and the resulting
financ-al charges would be charged to the corporation.
Fiscal Regime and "Profits Tax"'
8.        The Agreement includes a special fiscal regime, granted by the
Government to CBG for 25 years, of which the arrangements are as follows:
(a)  all imports needed for the original installations
shall be free of import duties;
(b)  all imports needed for subsequent operations shall
be subject to an import duty op 5.6% (on POB value);
(c)  there uirll be no export duty on CBG's exported products; and
(d) CBG will pay the Government a "profits tax" computed as
the first 30% of "net taxable profits", and 50% of the
remainder thereof, thus working out as 65% of the total
net taxable profits.



A NOE 1
Page 3
The net taxable profits, the 65% share whereof replaces divdend to the
"A" shareholders, is defined as:  gross incone, minus (i) interest and
other expenses related to funds advanced by Halco to CBG; (ii) exploita-
tion charges incurred by both CBG and OFAB: (iii) depreciation of CBG
plant, equipment and buildings; (iv) any profits actually reinvested in
CEG; and (v) provisions for renewal of equipment and tools.  This definition
of net taxable profits has been modified, as shoern in para. 6.11 of report
TO-672a dated August 30, 1968.
9.        CBG will pay, in accordance with normal tax laws, payroll taxes
and social security taxes.  Wages of expatriate personnel, however will
be exempt from the social security tax, and only the locally paid part of
expatriate salaries will be subject to income tex.  Since CBG arranges
for its own apprenticeships, it is excluded from the usual apprenticeship
taxes.  Dividends to "B" shareholders mili be exempted from all taxes and
duties.
lMining Volumes
10.       The 1963 Agreement provided that a minimum of one million tons
of bauxite should be exported annually, and if not, that the Government
would receive profit taxes as if the above volume were actually exported.
It also established the rrinciple that CBG would accept all reasonable
orders for additional sales to others, and if not, that other parties would
be allowed to infringe on CBG's mining riglits. It further stipulated
that CBG would examine, at an appropriate time, the feasibility of erecting
in Guinea a plant for transforming all or part of the extracted bauxite into
alumina or aluminum.  The mining volumes states above have since been
greatly increased.
Technical Assistance
11.       Under the Agreement, Halco shall make technical assistance available
to CBG, at cost.  Guinean personnel will exclusively be used for arork for
which specialization is not necessary. As to staff requiring specialization,
preference will be given to Guinean personnel if it is of equal competence
and has the same qualifications as expatriate staff.
Other Conditions
U.
12.       The Government reserves the right to have 50% of exported bauxite
shipped in vessels under Guinean flag, if this would not adversely affect
the bauxite sales.
13.       The Agreement included a "force majeure" clause which, in the
Bank's viewv covered a rather mwide assortment of risks.  Insofar as the
Bank's security arrangements and the financing and operations of the
project are concerned, the, "force majeure" clause has been superseded.



ANNE 1
Page h
l!.       The Agreement further stipulates that C-uinean law will apply as
the laws and regulations were at the date of the Agreement, and that sub-
sequent changes therein will not apply to the Agreement. An arbitration
clause is included, calling for the appointment of three arbitrators in
case of disputes.
Subsequent Events
15.       The mining rights decree, based on the Agreement, was signed in
June 196h.  When the Bank made an engineering loan in MIarch 1966, bring-
ing the realization of the plans for the exploitation of the Boke bauxite
a step further, several aluminum companies began to show interest in the
high grade Boke bauxite.  As a result, in April 1967, firm sales contracts
for 4.7 million tons annually, to be increased to 5.1 million tons after
five years, were concluded between CEG and six large aluminum companies:
Harvey Aluiminumn, Alcoa, Alcan, Pechiney-Ugine, Vereinigte Aluminum IJerke
and Il rtecati-ViM--son.. By mid-1967 it became apparent that the cost of
both the infrastructure and the CBG installations would be close to three
time the initially envisaged us$55 to US$60 million, largely as a resuit
of increased capacity of the installations, and to some extent because of
initial underestimation. The investment requirements and other obligations
having increased so much, it was decided in October 1967 to expand and
re-organize Halco by making the purchase contractors shareholders in the
company.  This event strengthened the case of a Bank loan for the infra-
structure, not only because the increased voluime of sales improved the
financial and economic justification of the project but also because the
expansion of Halco made it possible to make the shareholders ultimately
responsible for guaranteeing the service of the Bank loan under all circum-
stances, except if so-called political risks should occur.
16.       The reorganization of Halco caused the role played by its
initial single shareholder, Harvey Aluminum,, to be greatly reduced, and
the lead in further preparation of the project and the negotiations and
discussions between shareholders, the Governnent and the Bank to be taken
over by Alcoa and Alcan, who now together own 54% of the Halco shares.
This, together with the fact that, in mid-1967, the Bank started Twith the
pre-appraisal of the project, has led to the need for clarifying the
interpretation of the original 1963 Agreement and superseding certain of
its provisions in a number of agreements, the signature and effectiveness
whereof was a condition of effectiveness of Loan 557-GUI.

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
BOKE BAUXITE EXTENSION PROJECT
Debt Service Security and Other IMortant Legal Arrngements
L.       A project as complicated as the Boke project, with many respon-
sibilities divided among the Government, OFAB, CBG and the Halco share-
holders, requires numerous legal documents. These are:
Financial Assurances Agreement
Trust Agreement
Railway-Port Project Agreement
OFAB Training Agreement
OFAB Technical Assistance Agreement
CBG Technical Assistance and Training Agreements
Participation Agreement
Special Matters Agreement
The substance of some of these has already been discussed in this appraisal
report. Others are discussed and all are summarized below.
2.       The basic 1963 agreement is described at Annex 1.  It is now
supplemented by detailed agreemoents regarding financing, construction
and operation of the infrastructure project, the mining project and the
sale of bauxite; these last agreements provide that to the extent there
is inconsistency with the basic agreement, their provisions shall prevail.
3.       The then, as does the present most recent report on the Guinean
economy shows that the country has practically no creditworthiness.
Therefore, the Bank insisted upon satisfactory arrangements which secure
service of the Bank loan from funds provided by CBG and the Halco share-
holders. These arrangements are treated in a Financial Assurances Agree-
ment as supplemented by a Trust Agreement. If CBG's operations do not
provide sufficient profits to enable the Government to fulfill its debt
service obligations to the Bank, then CBG, Halco and ultimately the
shareholders themselves are bound to make payment to the trustee in amounts
adequate to cover the debt service; any such payments will be treated
as advances against CBG's obligation under the basic agreement to pay a
profits tax to Guinea. The Financial Assurances Agreement also incorpo-
rates the arrangements whereby the shareholders will advance, through
the trustee, funds to complete the infrastructure in case of an overrun
in the foreign currency cost of the project. The Financial Assurances
Agreement and the Trust Agreement were made effective at the same time
as Loan 557-GUI. Certain aiendments of the Financial Assurances Agreement
are required to account for the extension of the original project. The



ANEX h
Page 2
supplemental agreement amending the Financial Assurances Agreement is
acceptable to the Bank and will be signed and made effective as a condition
of effectiveness of the Bank Loan.
4.       The Financial Assurances Agreement includes a "force majeure"
clause which relieves CBG and the Halco shareholders of their obligations
under certain conditions. These obligations are subject +o suspension
only upon events making it impossible to construct or operate the railway,
the port or the mining project for a period of 180 days and only when such
events arise from political causes within, or acts of war directly relating
to, Guinea or its territory. These obligations may be terminated if the
suspension continues for 600 days, or if the Bank loan is accelerated
because of the suspension, or because of compulsory deprivation by Guinea
of the shareholders' fundamental rights of ownership, of the effective
control of CBG, or of the ownership or control by CEG of its property
or assets essential to the construction or operation of the mining project.
There are of course considerable political uncertainties connected with
such a project, as illustrated by the history of the present project itself
and of its predecessor, Bamidi. However, the numerous assurances which
have been obtained and the great importance of the success of the project
to the economy of the country justify the extension loan.
5.      The Participation Agreement which concerns the re-organization
of Halco was made effective at the same time as Loan 557-GUI. A competant
official has been designated as the president of Halco, and a full manage-
ment is in office. !minor amendments to the Participation Agreement conse-
quent upon the amendment of the Financial Assurances Agreement are needed.
The supplemental agreement amending the Participation Agreement is acceptable
to the Bank and will be signed and made effective as a condition of effec-
tiveness of the Bank Loan.
6.       The shareholders have arranged finance in order to comply with
the requirements of the Financial Assurances Agreement.
7.       The following additional agreements were signed and made effective
at the same time as Loan 557-GUI.
(i)  RailTay-Port Project Agreement among Guinea, OFAB and
CBG dealing with the management and administration of
the infrastructure.
(ii)  OFAB Technical Assistance Agreement among Guinea, OFAB
and Halco wherein Halco undertakes to furnish technical
assistance to OFAB in connection with the construction
and operation of the infrastructure.
(iii)  CBG Technical Assistance and Training Agreement among
Guinea, CBG and Halco wherein Halco agreed to provide



AÓz,NwEX 4
Page 3
technical assistance to CBG in the construction and
operation of the mine, and CBG undertakes to train
Guinean personnel.
(iv)  OFAB Training Agreement among Guinea, OFAB, CBG and
Halco wherein Halco and CBG undertake to train Guineans
to work on the infrastructure.
(v)  Special l4latters Agreement among Guinea, Halco and CBG
dealing with the arrangements governing the use by CBG
of Guinean  francs derived from business operations in
Guinea of Halco or CBG.

Description of Boke Deposits and Bauxite Reserves
1.        Bauxite deposits located in Guinea in the area northwest of Boke
are estimated to contain at least 1.75 billion tons of high grade ore.
These reserves are among the largest concentrated deposits knoam in the
world, amounting to about 30% of proven reserves and 18% of rotential
bauxite resources (excluding USSR and some Eastern Block countries).
2.        The initial mining area granted to CBG near the settlement of
Sangaredi (see map 1) covers an area of 500 sq mi and is estimated to
contain a minimum of 257 million tons of high quality bauxite with a dry
average alumina content of 58.2% and a silica content below 1.5%. The
best ore body discovered in the mining area contains 53 million tons with
an alumina content of 61.1% and a silica content of onLy 0.8%. Boke bauxite
is predaminantly of the desirable trihydrate type uhich, together tith the
low silica content, facilitates chemical processing to alumina, which is the
basic raw material for aluminum smelters.
3.        The Boke deposits begin approximately 50 miles inland and the
bauxite is found at the top of law, flat-topped hills.  There is virtually
no overburden on these deposits, thus mining costs are low. Bauxite depth
varies from 8 ft to more than 100 ft, and the initial mining area has an
average depth of about 70 ft.
4.        The original geological exploration of the Sangaredi block (permit
883) which was conducted in 1956/57 by the former concessionaire, a
consortium led by Alcan, indicated the presence of 185 million tons of bauxite
with a dry alumina content of 58.9%. A subsequent Alcan survey included
further drillings and proved the overall reserves to be about 210 to 220
million tons of high grade bauxite (above 58%).
5.        In April 1965, the Dank appointed MIr. Lloyd !-!N. Schofield to
review the geological data available on Boke deposits in the office of
llessrs. Harvey Aluminum, Torrance, California.  The conclusions of I'r.
Schofield's report, sent to the Bank under his covering letter dated May 4,
1965, were as follows.
"From the foregoing,and in view of the fact that the southern
and eastern limits of the bauxite area on Sangaredi claim
covered by permit iNo. 883 have not yet been reached, it is my
opinion that there are on Sangaredi 883 at least a quarter of



A œONT.x 5 (
Page 2
a billion natural metric tons of bauxite containing 5% of
moisture, with a dry available alumina content of more than 57%.
Other elements are within the US Government specifications for
'stockpile' metallurgical bauxite. A considerable amount of this
bauxite, particularly near the bottom of the deeper portion of
the deposit, is of such grade as to make it highly suitable as
raw !amaterial for premium calcine.  Although I cannot offer my
opinion of the total tonnage of bauxite within the entire Boke
concession, nevertheless, estimates by others do exist which
sugeest the existence of over one-haif billion tons of bauxite
averaging over 55% of available alumina, and over 1.75 billion
tons of bauxite averaging over 50% of available alumina
including the half-billion tons of high grade."
6.        Both Alcen's and Schofield's conclusions show that there are
sufficient bauxite reserves in the Sangaredi block alone to meet the
requirements expressed in the two sales contracts passed between CBG and
Halco's shareholders and thus to sustain an annlual mining rate of an
average of 7.1 million tons of metallurgical grade bauxite duaring the
first five years of operation and 9.0 million tons aftentrards for the
next 15 years.  The product specifications are sholr in Annex 5 (ii) for
both the metallurgical grade and the calcined bauxite.
7.        The proposed railroad from the port of Kamsar to Sangaredi wil'
adequately service the bauxite reserrves of that area and -wilJ. easily permit
expansion of mining operations to new sites if necessary.

CEG - Sales Contracts
1.        CBG has entered into two sets of firm contracts ivith Halco share-
holders.
2.        The first agreement, signed in December 1966, covered a 20-year
period and was concluded for the supply, at a base price of US$7/ton, of
about five million tons a year of metallurgical grade bauxite after start
up of the CBG operations.
3.        In N'Iovember 1970, in view of the excellent quality of the Boke
bauxite and the desire of the aluminum companies to obtain raw materials
from a number of different sources to ensure continuity of supply, comple-
mentary 20-year contracts were agreed upon between CBG and Hl1cots share-
holders for the supply of additional metallurgical grade bauxite. Contract-
ual prices are US$9/ton for the first 15 years and US$10/ton for the re-
rmaining five years.
4.        As a result of these two agreenents, Halco's shareholders and
their respective yearly purchasing comitments are as shown below:

Pro,osed F    e g Prices of Bauxite
1.        Bauxite is not freely traded and the world bauxite market is
strictly controlled by a small number of aluminum companies. Most bauxite
is mined by subsidiaries of these aluminum companies; the arrangements
which these organizations make with the countries where the bauxite is
mined, and the production costs involved, are not normally revealed by
the parties concerned. Bauxite of a certain specification will have
different values for aluminum companies depending on location of the alumina
plant in relation to mine and amelter, the tax agreements which cover the
contracts, and whether the companiest alumina plants are adapted to handle
the type of bauxite offered.
2.        For example, European countries have used French and Yugoslav
mono-hydrate bauxite extensively and have therefcre built plants adapted
for the higher temperatures and pressures required to process this type
of bauxite to alumina.  Such a company would therefore not be wtilling to
pay a substantial premiun to obtain tri-hydrate bauxite which can be processed
at lower temperatures and pressures.  On the other hand, American and
Canadian producers have plaints designed to treat the Caribbean tri-hydrate
type of bauxite, and their equipment cannot process mono-hydrate efficiently
without costly modifications.
3.        Shipping costs of bauxite from the Caribbean area to Canada or
Europe would not be greatly different from those from Guinea, and bauxite
of similar quantituy in both locations would therefore have the same FOB
values for aluminuni producers in these countries.  However, American companies
with alumina plants on the Nexican Gulf coast would incur considerably
higher shipping charges for Boke bauxite than for bauxite from Jamaica,Surinalr!
or Guyana, and this difference in transportation cost must be compensated
by lower prices for Boke bauxite to make it attractive.
4.        Another important factor affecting the cost of bauxite is the
quality.  Due allowances must be made for silica content, which affects
the cost of processing ta alumina because of caustic requirements, as well
as for other impurities and water content which affect not only the processLug
cost but also the shipping cost.
5.        Under the terns of the initial and extension contracts concluded
betwieen CBG and Halco' 2shareholders, the base price wiill be US$7/ton (first
contracts) or US$9/tonYZ (second contracts) FOB vessel at the sellerts load-
1/ For the extension contracts, the base price is US$9.0/ton for the first
15 years and US$10.0 for the remaining five years.

6.        Besides the price adjustment clauses related to the chemical
characteristics of the bauxite sold the sales agreements also include
price escalation clauses in relation to the costs of operational inputs:
loca'l wage costs, diesel and fuel oil, and tl-e US wholesale commodity index.
Price excalations to january 1971 are attached (page 3), and show a bauxite
price increase of US$o.55 -for the initial contracts and $0.h2 for the
extension contracts.
7.        Calcined bauxite will be sold on the free market at US$33/ton.
8.        The Bank has carefully reviewed the proposed ba-axite selling prices
for both the metallurgical grade bauxite and the calcired Talawite.   he trice
of US$7/ton for the initial contract appears today to have "sln sliJht1y or,
the low side in comparison to estimated POB prices in the Cn:.ibbean area
(even after allowance for  transport cost differentiaXl); but the clifference
is well covered by the escalation clause.  On the other hand, the price of
US$9/ton for the extension contract is favorable to Cuinea.  Long-term
contract FO  prices today are estimated aet US$6 to 8 for Jamaica (50% aluminl)
and US$ 8 to 9 for Surinam (55% alurmina).
9.        In addition, net income received by Guinea on bauxite exports (an
average of US$2.7 per ton compares favorably with royalties and taxes derived
by Jamaica for which figures are obtainable (US$2.2 per ton).
10.       The contractual prices and price adjustment clauses are therefore
considered satisfactory.

mined by the availability of cheap electricity. Among the major aluminum
producing countries, however, only France covers its requirements with
locally nined bauxite; others are net bauxite importers. I-Iajor reserves
and major existing bauLxite mining facilities are located in developing
countries (Annex 5 (v), pages 5 and 6). The world bauxite trade consists
therefore mainly of floiT from developing countries to developed countries.
6.        World bauxite production increased at a 9.5% annual rate over the
period 1959-1969, and in 1969, developing countries accounted for about 64%
of production. The major world producers in 1969 are shoirn below:

Total world               46.3              100.0
Four countries (Jamaica, Australia, Surinam and Guyana) account for more
than 62% of world bauxite production. Currently, the United States relies
on the Caribbean area (Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Haiti) and on North-
eastern South America (Surinam and Guyana) for over 85% of its bauxite supply.

Other major bauxite importing countries are: (i) Canada from Jamaica and
South America; (ii) Japan from Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia; (iii) West
Germany from Greece, Yugoslavia and Australia; and (iv) Norway from Jamaica.
7.        The rapid trend in world aluminum production and demand will result
in increased dependence of developed countries on bauxite supplies from
developing countries.  On the basis of 4.5 tons of bauxite per ton of
alumiinam, the Bank has projected the world bauxite demand and supply in
1975, and Guineals share in the world in 1975 and the supply increase between
1969 and 1975, as shown below:

and 1975.

Notes:  1/ Initial investaient in Year O is adjusted froei the figure shown in CBG accounts.  The over-run on the foreign-exchange component of the original infrastructure project,
which will be financed by CBG in the first place and recovered from Guinea throug  earnings, is in this statement included as investment of Guinea.  Future investments
of CBG are as shown in Table 6.  US$15.0 million is included in Year 20 for renewal of railway track and locomotives.
2/ Cash operating expenses are CBG costs as shown in Table 7, but exclude depreciation of Kamsar town assets (approximately US$0.7 million p.a.) provision for which is
included in charges raised by OFAB against CBG.          4

such delay continues.
