INTERNATICUAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECVMIENDATICN OF THE PRESIDET
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
GN A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR THE BOKE EXTE\iSIGC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Guinea for the equivalent of US $ 9.0 million to
help finance an extension of the Boke infrastructure project financed
under Loan No. 557-GUI. The proposed loan would be amortized over the
same period and on the same dates as the first loan; this would give it
a term of 21 years including 2 years of grace. Interest would be
7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The reserves of bauxite in the area of Guinea northwest of Boke
form one of the largest concentrated deposits known in the world. To mine
and sell bauxite from part of these deposits, the Republic of Guinea and
the Harvey Aluminum Company of Delaware Inc. (subsequently Halco (Mining)
Inc.) in 1963 formed the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (CBG), of which
Halco subscribed 51 percent of the shares and Guinea 49 percent, in
consideration of the mining concession granted to CBG. Under the Basic
Agreement between the parties, CBG was responsible for the development
of the mine, including mining township, crushing, drying and loading
equipment, and locomotives and ore cars. The financing of this CBG
investment was to be provided through Halco. Guinea took responsibility
for financing and providing the necessary infrastructure, consisting of
a railway, a port and a port townsite.
3.        The Government of Guinea then approached the Bank with a request
to finance the infrastructure, but a review of the mining and infrastructure
proposals indicated the need both for additional studies and a substantial
increase in the scale of operations if the combined mining and infra-
structure project were to be financially and economically sound. Matters
were sufficiently advanced by 1966 to justify a loan to Guinea of $ 1.7
million to enable final design and engineering for the infrastructure to
proceed while negotiations continued on the participation of major inter-
national aluminum companies.  In 1968 Halco was completely reorganized
following the entry of five major producersl/ who, together with Harvey
1/        viz, Aluminum Company of America, Alcan Aluminium Limited,
Vereinigte Aluminium Werke, Pechiney-Ugine, Montecatini Edison.



- 2 -
Aluminum Company, undertook to take about 5 million tons of bauxite a
year under long-term contracts. CBG expected to sell another 1.5 million
tons either to the shareholders or to other consumers, and mining and
infrastructure plans were accordingly finalized on the basis of these
tonnages.
4.        To finance the foreign exchange cost of the infrastructure
component and to refinance the 1966 engineering loan, the Bank made a
loan to Guinea of $ 64.5 million in September 1968, Loan No. 557-GUI,
referred to hereafter as the Prior Loan. Financing to cover the local
costs, estimated at US $ 19.0 million equivalent, was provided by a loan
from USAID. The shareholders of Halco provided in equity and loans to
CBG the US $ 99.0 million required for the mining project. Under the
Financial Assurances Agreement in connection with Loan 557-GUI, the Halco
shareholders assumed specific undertakings to Guinea, CBG and the Bank to
finance and complete the mining project and to finance the foreign exchange
cost of any overrun on the infrastructure project. Through sales contracts
for bauxite and other arrangements, the Halco shareholders also assured
payment through a Trustee of the debt service due on the Prior Loan.
5.        Construction and operation of the infrastructure project is the
responsibility of a semi-autonomous agency of the Government of Guinea,
the Office d'Am6nagement de Boke (OFAB). A Construction Coordination
Committee (CCC), consisting of the construction managers of OFAB and CBG,
under an independent chairman, has been established to ensure coordination
between the mining and infrastructure projects. CFAB and CBG employ the
same consulting engineers and a single prime contractor has been appointed
for the construction of both the OFAB and CBG civil engineering works.
Work on the site began in October 1969 and is about 35 percent completed,
some 10 months behind schedule, due mainly to strikes in Italy which
delayed the arrival of contractor's plant and to the November 1970
disturbances in Guinea which led to restrictions on the entry of foreign
personnel and caused other difficulties for the contractor.
6.        In view of the prospective increase in their requirements for
bauxite, the Halco shareholders agreed in November 1970 with the Govern-
ment of Guinea to increase the capacity of the Boke project to 9.2 million
tons of bauxite a year. The shareholders of Halco will arrange financing
for the necessary extension to the mining operation by CBG. The Govern-
ment of Guinea has applied to the Bank for an additional loan of US $ 9.0
million to cover the foreign exchange cost of the necessary extensions to
the infrastructure project. Negotiations with the Guinean delegation led
by M4r. Lansana Beavogui, Minister of State for Economic Affairs, were
completed on May 14 and were attended in part by legal counsel for CBG
and Halco.
7.        Guinea joined the Bank in 1963 and IDA in 1969, but there has
been no lending except for the Boke project (see Annex 1). The Government
has expressed an interest in Bank Group financing for projects in trans-
portation and agriculture, but neither the stage of project preparation nor
the economic and financial situation in Guinea have yet been such as to
justify Bank Group lending beyond the Bok6 project.



PART II - THE ECCNQMY
8.        The last economic report (No. AF-63b, dated September 1, 1967)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 22, 1968. In
November 1970, a small economic mission made a short visit to Guinea.
The findings of this mission are incorporated below.
9.        Since gaining independence in 1958, Guinea has experienced many
difficulties. In the first years, a serious lack of equipment and skilled
labor resulted in a decline in economic activity. In the early 1960's
Guinea received a large inflow of technical assistance which was unfamiliar
with local conditions and capital aid which was used ineffectively. 14hile
continuing to seek capital aid, Guinea places strong emphasis on self-
reliance and does not align itself with either Eastern or Western bloc
countries. Economic activities are carried out by the State or closely
controlled by it. Production and consumption are influenced primarily
by political and social action rather than by economic forces and incentives.
10.       Economic growth in Guinea has hardly kept pace with population
growth (estimated at 2.8 percent p.a.) since 1958. Thus, real per capita
income has stagnated around US $ 70. During the first seven years, GNP
at constant prices increased by only about 2.5 percent a year and by
about 3 percent in the period 1966-1970. This disappointing performance
in a country endowed with substantial economic potential in agriculture
and mining has been largely the result of inadequate economic policies.
Agricultural production and exports have fallen; public resources have
been misallocated; and excessive Central Bank lending to the public sector
has produced a continuous inflation.
11.       The economy, which depends primarily on the rural sector, has
suffered from falling agricultural exports and insufficient foreign,
exchange earnings.  Only Fria, the privately-owned alumina companyL/
which started production in the early 1960's, has been able to expand
its exports. These now account for 40 percent of Guinea's net foreign
exchange earnings. The decline in other mineral exports and increasing
foreign debt service added to the sharp fall in the country's import
capacity. The reduction in imports caused an increasing shortage of
durable consumer goods in the country and had the effect of reducing
farmers' incentives.  This train of events has not yet been corrected.
In addition, the Government tended to neglect the rural sector, giving
priority to manufacturing industries which generally lacked economic
justification and were badly managed.
12.       The deteriorating balance of payments situation has been
alleviated somewhat by the very substantial inflow of foreign aid. Despite
a decline of one-third in aid disbursements compared with the 1964-1967
level, average annual aid disbursements during the last three years still
1/        owned by:  Olin Mathieson, Pechiney-Ugine, British Aluminium
Co. Ltd., Alusuisse, Vereinigte Aluminium Werke.



-4 -
exceeded US $ 9 per capita. Almost half of these disbursements
represented program aid, which financed nearly 50 percent of Guinea's
total imports. During this period, approximately 60 percent of total aid
was extended by the Sino-Soviet countries, primarily the USSR and the
People's Republic of China. Bilateral aid and suppliers' credits from
IBRD member countries accounted for 30 percent, including 14 percent
from the United States. Disbursements under the Bankts 1968 loan accounted
for 10 percent. During the past two years Guinea drew twice from the IMF
for a total of US $ 7.5 million and in addition received SDR 5.0 million.
The impact of these operations on the country's foreign exchange position,
however, has been extremely limited, debt service having absorbed these
receipts.
13.       Most official assistance has been in the form of long-term
loans at concessional terms. Nevertheless, foreign indebtedness has
increased markedly, reaching about US $ 270 million (excluding undisbursed)
at the end of 1969, virtually equivalent to total GNP. Even after sizeable
and frequent rescheduling, debt service has absorbed 50 percent of net
foreign exchange earnings during the past three years. In the absence of
a long-term consolidation of Guinea's external debt this proportion would
increase further.
14.       IThile the real growth of the economy remained slow, the annual
growth of money supply averaged over 17 percent during the last ten years.
Virtually the entire increase resulted from the expansion-of Central Bank
credit to the public sector, including public enterprises. The ambitious
public investment program far exceeded the available amount of foreign
aid and public savings. In 1969, based largely on the advice of the IMF,
there was an attempt to improve economic performance, for instance through
increased tax rates and higher producer prices for some important crops;
Available data indicate, however, that the objectives have not been met.
Uhile new Central Bank credits to the public sector did not exceed the
level of previous years, the use of accumulated PL 48o counterpart funds
resulted in an even faster expansion of total money supply during the past
three years than before.
15.       The rapid increase in money supply caused a growing imbalance
between supply and demand within Guinea, which seriously affected all
sectors of the economy.  Nationalization of imports and wholesale trade,
as well as most retail trade, prevented the inflationary pressure from
influencing official prices and salaries, but a fast-growiLng parallel
market developed in which prices have increased several times above the
official price level. There has also been a sharp growth of unofficial
imports and exports.
16.       Increasing import difficulties combined with unabated inflation
have created considerable problems for public manufacturing enterprises
which operate at official price levels. Only about 40 percent-of capacity
is utilized and financial accounts show a considerable deficit. The main
difficulties in this field are lack of raw materials, spare parts, and
managerial skills.



17.       The unsatisfactory financial. performance of public enterprises
and the continued fall of imports, which constitute the country's most
important tax source, have led to a deterioration of public finances.
Falling revenues and growing current expenditures have resulted in a
deficit in current operations during the past two years.   This is in
contrast to the pre-1966/67 period when the current budget usually
produced a small surplus. Guinea's tax effort, however, remains impress-
ive with total revenues exceeding 22 percent of GDP in 1967/68 and
1968/69. The deterioration in the current operations' account, together
with the recent reduction in foreign aid, has resulted in a substant;ial
fall in development expenditures. The overall deficit of Central Govern-
ment operations remained about the same as during the period 1964-1967.
Therefore, there was no reduction in the volume of new annual advances
from the Central Bank.
18.       In order to revitalize the economy, Guinea should undertake a
comprehensive stabilization effort as soon as possible. This program
should be aimed at correcting the present financial imbalance, provide
incentives for agricultural production, strengthen the balance of payilents
and reduce restrictions on trade and payments. It would have to involve
major reforms in the monetary field and be accompanied by a large inflow
of capital and technical assistance to rebuild the seriously deteriorated
capital stock of the country.
19.       The financing of the Boke Extension project would constitute
the most important contribution the Bank Group can make to Guinea's
economic development under present conditions. The sizeable benefits
derived from the project (see para. 27 below) should enable the Govern-
ment to begin implementation of a policy focusing on economic and
financial recovery. Such a policy is required to foster sustained growth
and make better use of the country's very substantial resources.
PART III - THE PROJECT
20.       To increase annual production and shipment of bauxite from the
originally planned level of 6.6 million tons to 9.2 million tons, of which
the shareholders of Halco have already contracted for 9.0 million tons,
requires expanding the capacity both of the infrastructure, which is the
Government's responsibility, and of the mining operation, the responsibility
of CBG. The expansion of the CFAB infrastructure involves the provision of
a waiting basin in the port and further dredging, the lengthening of
railway passing loops, heavier rails, and extensions to the Kamsar townsite
and hospital. The total cost of these works would amount to US $ 12.9
million equivalent, of which the proposed loan of US $ 9.0 million would
cover the foreign exchange component. The estimated local costs of $ 3.9
million can be met from the original USAID loan, under which adequate
uncommitted funds remain available.



- 6 -
21.       This investment will be added to the basic infrastructure
project, which is now estimated to cost $ 88.5 million as the result of
changes in   quantities   and increases in the costs of materials over
the past eighteen months, as well as an increase in interest during
construction and contractors' claims, both largely the consequence of
delays in execution. The total cost of the revised infrastructure project,
including the proposed expansion, is therefore now estimated at US $ 1o0.4
million, against wihich the financing that would be available is $ 73.5
million from the Bank under the Prior Loan and the proposed new loan, and
$ 20.4 million equivalent under the USAID loan. The presently estimated
shortfall of $ 7.5 million would be provided by the shareholders of Halco
through CBG in accordance with their obligations under the Financial
Assurances Agreement, all of which will apply to the expanded project.
22.       The additional investment by CBG in the mining facilities,
processing plant, ore loading and railroad equipment required for a
capacity of 9.2 million tons a year is estimated at $22.9 million. This
is to be added to the cost of the basic 6.6 million ton project, the
estimate for which has been increased from $ 99.0 million to $ 120.6
million as the result of substantially the same factors as are referred
to above in connection with the infrastructure. The total CBG investment
for the expanded project is thus now estimated to be $ 143.5 million.
23.       The additional finance required to be provided by Halco to CBG
in respect of the cost increases over the last eighteen months and the
expanded mining project will be $ 44.5 million, to which will be added
the Halco shareholders' obligation to finance the $ 7.5 million overrun
on the CFAB infrastructure project. Halco proposes to arrange for the
entire additional $ 52.0 million to be provided to CBG by way of loans.
Although that will weaken the initial debt/equity ratio of CBG from the
63/37 under the financing plan worked out in connection with Loan 557-GUI
to 76/24, it is considered that the position of the Bank and of Guinea
will not thereby be significantly affected. The additional earnings of
the expanded project will increase the debt coverage of the Prior Loan
and the proposed new loan taken together, and the debt/equity ratio of
CBG will improve more rapidly under the expanded project than the original
project. In any case, the guarantee undertakings by the shareholders of
Halco with respect to the Prior Loan will be extended to the proposed new
loan. Part of the additional loan financing to be arranged by the Halco
shareholders will not be required for some time and the shareholders,
while accepting the obligation to provide financing, have requested that
they be allowed to defer the raising of funds until they are actually
required. Guinea and the Bank have accepted that position in con-
sideration of an undertaking by the Halco shareholders that in computing
CBG liability for profits tax the interest cost to be charged against
income by CBG in respect of the additional funds required for the expansion
project will be the actual rate or 8-1/2 percent per annum whichever is
the lower.



-7-
24.       The expanded 9.2 million tons a year infrastructure and mining
projects, with a combined estimated cost of some $245 million, would be
carried out under essentially the same adninistrative, organizational and
contractual arrangements as the initial 6.6 million tons a year project,
that is, common consultants to both OFAB and CBG, overall coordination
of the mining and infrastructure construction by the Construction Coordi-
nation Committee and a single prime contractor for the civil works. The
financial obligations of the shareholders of Halco to the Bank, Guinea
and CBG would continue to apply.
25.       There are, however, two significant modifications in the contractual
arrangements with respect to ore sales. In the first place, the base price
for the additional output to be purchased by the Halco shareholders will
be about 28 percent higher than the base price applying to the amounts
initially contracted. In the second place, the construction of the expanded
mining and infrastructure projects is now scheduled for final completion
in June 1973. On this schedule, sufficient quantities of processed
bauxite will have been stockpiled'at the port by the end of January 1973-
to enable some shipments to begin. This date of January 1973 would repre-
sent -"substantial completion". The shareholders of Halco, whose ori-ginal
long-term contractual obligations to take bauxite and pay for it would
not have commenced until a date 90 days after "final completion", which
would have meant about October 1973, have agreed to advance the date on
which they will take and pay for ore under long-term contracts to 90 days
following "substantial completion", which, on the present construction
schedule, would be Iay 1973. Any ore available for shipping prior to that
time would be sold under normal commercial arrangements.
26.       The extension works fall essentially wvitthin the scope of tuhe
existing works. A new round of international competitive bidding is not
therefore considered appropriate and the additional procurement involved
will be by way of variation orders to present contracts on the basis of
initially agreed prices plus escalation. For the same reason, the proposed
new loan would be-disbursed according to the same allocation of proceeds
as the Prior Loan. Disbursements would be charged first to the Prior
Ioan account until that is exhausted and then to the corresponding cate-
gories of the proposed new loan account. It is expected that the Prior
Loan will be completely disbursed byseptenber 1972 and the proposed new
loan by mid-1973. For purposes of repayment the proposed new loan and
the Prior Loan would be consolidated; the new loan being amortized over
the same period-(19 years) as the Prior Loan and on the same dates, starting
in October 1973.
27.       Guinea would benefit substantially from the expanded Bok6 project
and, because the incremental investment in the infrastructure is smaller
than in the mining operation, the combined project benefits would accrue
in greater proportion to Guinea than to the lIalco shareholders in CBG.
In cash terms under the expanded project, net income to the Guinean Govern-



- 8 -
ment from bauxite sales is estimated at approximately US $ 475 million
over a 20-year period, as compared with US $ 217 million under the initial
project. It is estimated that additional indirect Government income
generated by the expanded project, such as local wages, payroll taxes and
import duties, will equal US $ 80 million over the same period. The
discounted financial rate of return from the Governmentts total investment
in the expanded project is accordingl-y expected to be about 21 percent,
compared to about 14 percent on the initial project. Taking into account
the net revenues expected to accrue to the Government from the infrastructure
and mining projects taken together over an economic life conservatively
estimated at 20 years, the economic rate of return to Guinea would be about
26 percent for the expanded project compared to 18 percent for the initial
project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRU1PNTS AND AUTHORITY
28.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Guinea and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and OFAB, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
29.       To the extent possible, the Loan and Project Agreements incor-
porate by reference the substantive provisions of the 1968 Loan and
Project Agreements. The following new features are of particular interest:
(a) provision has been made for the consolidation into one Loan
Account of the proceeds of the Prior Loan and the New Loan, and
for the exhaustion of the proceeds of the Prior Loan before
withdrawals on the New Loan can begin (Section 2.03 of, and
Schedule 1 to, the Loan Agreement);
(b) provision has been made for procurement on the basis of exten-
sions to existing contracts let in accordance writh the provisions
of the Prior Loan Agreement (Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement);
(c) to the extent necessary to assure consistency between the Loan
Agreement and the Prior Loan Agreement, the latter Agreement
has been amended (Section 9.01 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the
Loan Agreement) and cross events of default have been provided
(Sections 7.02 and 9.01 (e) and (f) of the Loan Agreement);
(d)  the amendment of existing contractual arrangements between
Guinea, OFAB, CBG, Halco and its shareholders, and of the US
AID Loan Agreement are conditionsof effectiveness of the Bank



-9-
Loan. It is contemplated that all these amended agreements
would be executed at or about the same time as the signing of
the Bank Loan and that, after all necessary action (including
ratification by the President of the Republic of Guinea and by
the Board of OFAB) has been taken, all the agreements would be
made effective sirmiltaneously; and
(e)  a new covenant (Section 4.03) provides for the maintenance of
the public highway between Conakry and Kalaboui and the ferry
at Boffa.
30.       I am satisfied that the-proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreexent of the Bank.
PART V - RECODENDATION
31. -     I recormend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

Procurement Arrangements:   Because the project expansion consists essen-
tially of extensions of existing contracts,
it is not considered that further international
competitive bidding is appropriate. Construction
of the expanded infrastructure project would
be carried out by variation orders on the
existing contracts.
