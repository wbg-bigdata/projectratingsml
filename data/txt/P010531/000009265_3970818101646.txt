Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development objectives (see Annex lfor key performance indicators).'
The project would assist the Government of India (GOI) to improve the performance of its Family
Welfare Program (FWP) in reducing maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and unwanted fertility,
thereby eventually contributing to stabilization of population growth. The project objectives would be to
assist the FWP to: (a) improve management performance by nationwide implementation of policy
change referred to as the "participatory planning approach,"' and institutional strengthening for timely,
coordinated utilization of project resources; (b) improve quality, coverage and effectiveness of existing
FW services; (c) progressively expand the scope and content of existing FW services to include more
elements of a defined package of essential reproductive and child health (RCH) services;2 and (d) in
selected disadvantaged districts and cities, increase access by strengthening FW infrastructure while
improving its quality.
2. Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed project description and Annex 3 for a
detailed cost breakdown):
The proposed project would be a sector investment project with a strong policy and program
content, and is envisaged to be the first in a two-part financial support for the Family Welfare Program to
implement a nationwide policy change. It is estimated that nationwide implementation of program
strategies would require a project cost of about US$600 million (with US$480 million IDA financing).
This project would provide Interim Trust Fund (ITF) financing of US$284.3 million for a five-year
period and would focus on strengthening institutional capacity (program management and monitoring,
funds flow, procurement support, technical assistance from specialized consultant institutions)
particularly to improve implementation in weaker states and in operationalizing some of the newer
technical interventions, such as referrals for essential and emergency obstetric care and reproductive tract
infections, in which there is limited experience. Close continued monitoring, together with a mid-term
evaluation at the end of the first two years, would form the basis for appraising the second follow-on
project expected to begin in year three and cover a further five-year period, as indicated in the diagram
below. In order to gain efficiency and reduce transaction costs the second project would utilize much of
the documentation prepared for the first project, updated to reflect changes in project design and content.

1 The "participatory planning approach" formerly known as the "target free" approach is a management policy
shift. It removes management incentives that have placed excessive focus on achieving annual method-
specific contraceptive acceptor targets, and introduces a "bottom-up" need-based management approach
focusing on provision of good quality care to meet fertility and health needs at different stages of the life cycle
such as adolescence, birth spacing and limitation together with healthy sexual activity, and pregnancy and
childbirth.
2   A package of essential RCH sefvices has been defined by GOI for (a) prevention and management of
unwanted fertility, (b) management of pregnancy and childbirth, (c) child survival (including immunization,
diarrheal and acute respiratory illness, and newborn care), and (d) reproductive tract infections. (See Annex
11, Attachment 2).

3. Benefits and Beneficiaries.
The project would benefit poor women and children below age five living in rural areas and urban
slums throughout India by improving health during reproductive years and early childhood, respectively,
and by enabling couples to space or limit births. More specifically the project would:
(a) Reduce fertility. The project would reduce unwanted fertility among the 30 million women
reported in the 1993-94 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) to have 'unmet
contraceptive needs', namely, not using contraceptives although they wished to space or not

Country: India                                        Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
have any further births. Reduced fertility would contribute to empowerment of women. While
project benefits would go directly to those couples who use the FW services, there are also
economic and environmental benefits of a reduced growth of population to society as a whole.
(b) Reduce health risks for women. The project would also decrease the health risks and burden
of disease associated with pregnancy and childbearing among the 220 million women in the
reproductive age group in India, in particular, the largely poor rural women particularly in
districts with high concentrations of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, and poor women in
urban slums.
(c) Increase in child survival. The project would increase child survival in the 0-4 year age
group by (i) increasing program coverage to an estimated 10 million additional children over
the five year period and improving effectiveness of ongoing interventions, and (ii) reducing
poor maternal health which is estimated to be associated with 30% of deaths of children under
five years of age.
(d) Increase the effectiveness of past investments by GOI and IDA. In addition to the benefits
derived from new activities, the project would support the re-vitalization of the health care and
family welfare physical infrastructure across the country and promote changes in management
practices. This can be expected to significantly increase the demand for, and utilization of,
existing resources.
(e) Encourage decentralization and local ownership. The Institutional Strengthening and Local
Capacity Enhancement components are expected to encourage decentralization and build
capacity within a centralized program, and increase involvement and ownership of RCH
activities at lower levels of government. The outcome is expected to be improved
implementation and more responsible use of resources.
4.  Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 1997 to 2001
Executing agencies:   District Family Welfare Bureaus or Zilla Parishads (District Councils)
under the supervision of State Family Welfare Departments
Project coordination:  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
Project oversight:  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: (See Annex 6 for details).
Each participating state would create a separate budgetary item, and maintain identifiable project
accounts at state, district, and institutional levels. Monthly consolidated state expenditure reports would
be prepared and a consolidated state audit would be required annually through auditors acceptable to
IDA.
Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements: Agreed project benchmarks would be monitored by MOHFW
through: (a) service delivery and utilization data from the Management Information System (MIS); (b)
financial and physical performance data from state project directors; (c) data from technical quality
assessments by service supervisors; and (d) rapid assessments of service coverage, quality and facilities
by independent agencies, and of technical quality of training and IEC by competent agencies. From this
system, MOHFW would provide to the Bank semi-annual summary progress reports, including
information on agreed indicators (see Annex 1). This would be supplemented with data from a joint
monitoring system to be established by GOI to include GOI and all donor agencies that support the FWP
so as to avoid separate monitoring mechanisms by each donor agency. Through this mechanism there

would be (i) field visits during project supervision; (ii) review of the selected data from a wide range of
indicators used by MOiIFW for Program monitoring: and (c) review of studies, evaluations and lessons
learnt through work done by MOFIFW and project states and their agents, as well as other independent
agencies. Achievement of development objectives would be assessed through a mid-term evaluation and
project completion evaluation. For such evaluations, in addition to special commissioned studies, data
from the Sample Registration Survey (SRS) system, and a proposed National Family Health-type survey
expected to be funded by USAID, would be utilized.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5.  CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for lndia, discussed by the Executive Directors on
June 20, 1995 (Report No. 14509-IN), provides the basis for supporting the Governmeit's attempt to
accelerate the pace of sustainable economic and social development. The progress report discussed by
the Executive Directors on September 5, 1996 (Report No. IDA/R96-154/1) confirms this approach. The
development of human resources is integral to both objectives. The Bank's specific objective in this
respect is to support the restructuring of social programs to increase their effectiveness, improve the
quality of life, and provide thle poor with increased opportunities to participate more fully in the
economy. The proposed project directly focuses on this objective within the hiealth sector. It will
support a comprehensive reorientation of India's Family Welfare Program in line with that proposed by
GOI and supported in Bank Economic and Sector Work. The participants in the public sector's Family
Welfare Program are predominantly from the poorest sections of society. Other more general objectives
of the CAS include reducing poverty, strengthening institutions, increasing the role of beneficiaries in
project design and implementation, and enabling women to participate more fully in the development
process. Each of these is supported by the project.
6.  Main sector issues and Government strategy:
(a) Main sector issues:3 Two fundamental issues affecting the sector have influenced project
design: (i) inadequate slowing of population growth despite a long established family planninlg
program, and (ii) major disparities betweeni different states and urban and rural areas in hiealthi
and fertility, reflecting differences in socio-economic status, level of political commitment and
management capacity. The sector issues addressed by the project are: (i) a heavy burden of
disease among women and childreni for which highly cost-effective interventions are available;
(ii) higih levels of unwanted fertility: (iii) underutilization of the existing large infrastructure of
public sector facilities and manpower while poor women and children continue to have
inadequate access to the services they need; (iv) prograin distortions caused by an excessive
focus on method-specific contraceptive acceptor targets and use of financial incentives; (v)
poor quality of care associated with shortages of supplies, drugs and. particularly. female staff
and improper behavior of staff contributing to client dissatisfaction; (vi) inadequate funding,
inflexible, poorly coordinated, top-down management, and inadequate support for front-line
workers; and (vii) inadequate mobilization of private and NGO resources.
(b) Government strategies to address these issues:
(i) GOI is adopting a nulti-sector approach to population stabilization. Strategies include
improving the performance of the Family Welfare Program through measures that are

and relevant services to clients, decision makers in the family and

to high population momentum, are being addressed by IDA-funded
projects in Education.

women to participate in economic activity; and (c) build a base of
healthy human capital essential for economic growth. Although
private sector facilities are widely available, they focus mainly on
curative services and the overwhelming proportion of women and
children obtain preventive services from the public sector.
Furthermore, private facilities capable of providing the higher
technology required for treating obstetric and childhood illness
complications, and the more effective though provider-dependent
contraceptive methods such as sterilization and intra-uterine
devices, are concentrated in urban areas. Contact with private
sector providers costs about one to two and a half times more than
contacts with government providers, and poor women and children
are unlikely to use private providers. There is little experience and
knowledge about the cost and effectiveness of mobilizing the
private sector and NGOs on a large scale to cater to the needs of the
rural poor. USAID is financing a major initiative for this purpose
in Uttar Pradesh, but the results are as yet unclear. Therefore the
main project strategy would be to strengthen the public sector
services while facilitating increased mobilization of private sector
resources (see below).

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design (from completed and on-going projects financed
by the Bank and other development agencies):
Family Welfare projects: Common implementation problems in the state-based Population Projects
have been: (a) initial slow disbursement due to delayed start up of project activities, particularly in
staffing, cumbersome state level approval and funding procedures; (b) inadequate integration with
related FWP activities at national, state and district levels and poor coordination with other related
projects; (c) inadequate commitment at state and district levels leading to inadequate technical support
for training and IEC, weak community involvement and lack of supervision of construction; and (d) in
weaker states, inadequate and delayed release of funds, frequent changes in project officials and poor
project management. In the centrally managed Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) project,
problems have been the initial poor procurement capacity, vertical approach with inadequate
coordination at state and implementation levels, significant delays in implementing the Safe Motherhood
component, and inadequate reporting of implementation progress. Similar projects funded by ODA,
DANIDA, UJNICEF and USAID have experienced comparable problems.
Technical and social problems experienced in the Family Welfare Program have been (a) over-emphasis
on achieving contraceptive acceptor targets leading to neglect of other reproductive health needs, (b)
inadequate information, counseling and poor services for birth spacing needs particularly for younger
couples, and (c) inadequate detection of complications of pregnancy, lack of referral procedures for
complications that are detected, and inadequate, inaccessible and insensitive services at facilities capable
of treating such complications.
Lessons from related projects: The Bank's education portfolio, through the District Primary Education
line of projects, has had initial success in addressing problems similar to those experienced in the Family
Welfare projects by using registered societies to reduce procurement and funding delays and decentralize
responsibility, and requiring formnal annual reviews and work program proposals for management
control. USAID, which is implementing a ten-year project in Uttar Pradesh, has had difficulty
establishing and maintaining an autonomous society for Family Welfare but is making progress in
introducing performance-based funding.
Project design features that reflect lessons learned: These are: (a) decentralization of responsibility
for implementation planning, definition of expected program performance, and performance monitoring
of state and district levels; (b) refinement of the Center's responsibility in program management, from
detailed program planning and guidelines to definition of program strategies, technical guidance and
quality standards, monitoring and trouble shooting; (c) full integration of project activities with all FW
program activities through integrated project management structures at national and state levels; (d)
linkage of annual state project budgets to formal annual GOI reviews using criteria agreed with the Bank;
(e) strengthened capacity for procurement through the use of consultant agencies and other special units
to be known as Procurement Support Institutions; (f) establishment of state level registered societies to
expedite flow of funds from the Center to district level implementing authorities, and (g) strengthened
quality of small, scattered civil works by use of detailed technical manuals developed and approved
during project preparation.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
(a) As of April 1996, the Family Welfare Program declared the end of the "targets" system, and
distributed a manual entitled, Manual on Participatory Planning (formerly known as the
Target Free Approach) which provides guidance to districts on the implementation details of a
revised monitoring system and decentralized planning system.

(b) During FY96, there has been a gap in external assistance for the CSSM activities due to the
revised scheduling of the project planning cycles of most external agencies to coincide with
GOI's five-year planning cycle. During this period, GOI has demonstrated its commitment to
the activities initiated under CSSM (to be continued and expanded under RCH) by mobilizing
additional domestic funds to ensure that the core CSSM activities are continued.
(c) MOHFW has requested all external agencies interested in providing support for the FWP to
link the next cycle of their projects to the proposed MOHFW RCH program.
(d) MOHFW has published a booklet entitled A Paradigm Shift describing the key features of the
proposed program. The booklet is used as informational material about the FWP.
(e) During project preparation. MOHFW organized more than 20 meetings/seminars to discuss the
project with State Family Welfare Secretaries, NGOs, state training institutions from health
and related sectors, the Department of Women and Child Development, and the Ministry of
Rural Development.
(f) Several state officials have been invited by MOHFW to participate in project planning and
have contributed to: (i) identification of key policy commitments to be required of states; and
(ii) preparation of a 5-volume manual containing detailed technical standards for
implementation planning, service delivery, training, civil works, financial monitoring and
procurement that will be used during project implementation.
(g) MOHFW officials from the Center participated with the Bank's mission in a logical
framework analysis exercise for the project and will replicate the exercise with state teams.
(h) GOI in its Approach paper to the 9th Five Year Plan clearly enunciated its support for the
FWP. Further, it has been recently re-iterated that the entire amount of external assistance
available in any given sector is to be added to the normal plan resources (nett budgetary
support) to obtain the overall amount (gross budgetary support) available to the sector.
12. Value added of Bank support:
(a) Bank inputs during project preparation have assisted MOHFW to: (i) move to the "target-free
approach" with full participation of a wide range of stakeholders (see section on Participation);
(ii) develop technical guidelines and standards for adapting and applying the recommended
package of essential RCH services under various situations of resource and institutional
constraints; (iii) rationalize the resource needs and utilization of available resources; and (iv)
develop a framework for implementing RCH that has attracted other donor investments,
including major funding from EC which is new to this sector in India.
(b) Bank support for the project would: (i) enable larger numbers of priority clients to be served by
the FWP; (ii) expand the range of essential services offered by the FWP; (iii) assist GOI to
refurbish the existing infrastructure and revitalize its manpower, thereby bringing value added
to past investments; and (iv) modernize program management approaches so as to achieve
greater efficiency and effectiveness.
(c) Without Bank support, it is unlikely that: (i) GOI would have addressed the most fundamental
issues relating to modernization of program management such as removal of contraceptive
targets; (ii) health problems of women during pregnancy, childbirth and sexual activity would

Country: India                                            Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
have been addressed; and (iii) attempts would be made to improve effectiveness of child
survival interventions except for immunization.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments Detailed assessments are provided in Annex 11 entitled
Institutional, Social and Technical Assessments.
13. Economic Assessment.
(a) Public investment in family welfare services can be justified in principle on the grounds of
both efficiency and equity. Some services have characteristics of public goods, e.g., IEC, and
more importantly, several provide positive externalities or benefits to individuals beyond those
receiving the service. Infant immunization programs for communicable diseases is an
example. Another is the improvement in maternal health and nutrition which increases the
survival chances and well-being of children leading in turn to lower fertility levels. Lower
fertility may then lead to environmental and economic gains for the existing population. In the
absence of public financing, the effective demand and provision of these services is likely, in
many cases, to be below the socially optimum level. Equity arguments in favor of subsidized
health services are strong in India, where the most recent survey of poverty suggests that over
one third of the rural population has access to Rs. 5 or less a day. The public provision of
health services, in addition to their financing, is justified when private provision does not exist,
the public sector is a more efficient provider, or consumers exhibit a clear preference for
public services.
(b) Recent IDA sector work in India concluded that while some reproductive and child health
services may be provided by the private sector and NGOs, the public sector will have to
continue to play the central role, especially for the poor. According to the recent National
Health and Family Welfare Surveys, 79 percent of individuals using any form of modern
contraceptive are supplied by the public sector. In rural areas the share is 87 percent. Only 11
percent of all women and 6 percent of rural women who have recently given birth did so in a
private institution. Virtually all infant immunizations are provided by the public sector.
Overall, the vast majority of the population in general, and the poor rural population in
particular, are dependent currently on services provided by the public sector. For the future,
recent extensive survey research in Uttar Pradesh indicates that of the large group of women
with unmet demand for contraception, the percentages who intend to use public (as opposed to
private) sector services in the future for sterilization, IUD, pills and condom supplies are 89,
81, 64 and 50 percent, respectively. Among rural women, the percentages are significantly
higher - 93, 87, 68 and 62 percent. Of 157,000 private practitioners, only 28 percent offer
contraceptive methods, mainly pills and condoms, and under 15 percent of all private health
sector staff have received family planning training in the past three years. While the results are
not presented with a rural/urban disaggregation, it can be safely assumed that these percentages
are significantly lower in rural areas. In some areas of family planning and reproductive
health, the private sector does not provide services. When it does, the substantial use of the
altemative public services, particularly for clinical services, suggests that the financial charges
are beyond those that can be paid by many, particularly rural, families. However, where the
private sector is capable of providing goods and services efficiently they should be encouraged
and the possibility of public subsidies considered. The current USAID-supported project
which encourages the development of the private sector in providing family planning services
in Uttar Pradesh will generate valuable lessons over the project period.
(c) Even if the public financing and provision of health services can be justified in principle, there
is a need to provide services in the most economically efficient way. No single, universally



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 15
Country: India                                           Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
accepted tool of economic analysis exists to measure efficiency in the sector. In project
preparation, attention has been given to various measures of cost effectiveness, trends in unit
costs, simulations of cost recovery and cost reductions and to a very partial use of cost benefit
analysis. More details are provided in Annex 4.
(d) The child health interventions follow the standard cost-effective protocols for vaccinations
recommended by WHO/UNICEF. The basic set of vaccinations being extended in coverage
were evaluated in the 1993 World Development Report as being among the most cost effective
of all health interventions. A detailed cost effectiveness study undertaken in Andhra Pradesh
in 1996 as part of the Department's sector work on health sector reform estimates that the cost
per disability adjusted life year (DALY) gained for the universal immunization program is
around $8, which compares well with the estimate of $12-17 in the World Development
Report. The WDR defined a cost-effective intervention as one where the cost/DALY gained is
below $250.
(e) The reproductive health interventions are anticipated to achieve multiple objectives,
including increased health status of women of child bearing age and of their children, and
reduced levels of fertility and population growth.
(i) Health status. Previous Bank studies have estimated the cost per DALY saved through
treatment for RTIs/STls at $10-15 and for the diagnosis and early cure of cervical cancer at
$150-250. The Andhra Pradesh study broadly confirms these estimates. The cost/DALY
gained for the provision of referral care for complicated pregnancies was estimated to be
$2, urban pregnancies with little complication $18; neonatal care for perinatal conditions
$60, and rural pregnancies with little complication $100. Again, all are significantly
below the $250 level suggested by the WDR and are well below recent estimates for
similar interventions in West Africa. These studies focus on women's health. There are
also significant impacts of reproductive health interventions on child health. It is
estimated that in India, one third of under-five mortality could be prevented if mothers
were more healthy and obstetric complications were appropriately managed.
(ii) Reduction in fertility. Interventions aimed at widening the range of available
contraceptive methods and increasing the use of all family planning and safe motherhood
services, particularly by the poor, have the objectives of increasing choice and personal
empowerment and of reducing fertility and mortality. The value of improved choice
cannot be measured. Regarding reductions in fertility, again it is problematic to measure
quantitatively the outcome. A narrowly defined benefit-cost analysis compared the costs
of previous government family planning activities with the benefits measured in terms of
savings in public expenditures on social services and food distribution subsidies arising
from the estimated decrease in population increase resulting from the family planning
program. The results implied an IRR of 11.3 percent.
(f)  The cost effectiveness of different contraceptive methods was measured with the unit of
effectiveness defined as one couple year of protection. Since sterilization involves a single
operation, and the effects are permanent, the cost effectiveness is high. This is followed by
IUD insertion, while condoms and pills, which require regular replenishment, appear least cost
effective. Studies in East Asia and Latin America demonstrate the same order of ranking.
However, the markets for the various contraceptive methods are different and, for significant
periods in a woman's reproductive years, the methods do not all compete. Sterilization cannot
help younger, lower parity couples who wish to limit the number of children and control the
spacing of births but are not ready to end childbearing. For a further significant decline in



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 16
Country: India                                           Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
fertility in India, the behavior of young couples will now need to change and the family
planning program will need to respond. It will be difficult to sustain the current very high
levels of sterilization. In many states the focus will have to shift to non-terminal methods for
younger and lower parity women and men even though these are more costly and require a
more efficient delivery system. As the objective of the program widens to one of meeting
peoples' reproductive goals rather than just preventing births the distinction in the
measurement of effectiveness for terminal and non-terminal methods will become increasingly
important.
(g) Calculation of the unit cost of the family planning program per couple year of prc  ,tion and
birth averted over time indicates that real costs have decreased across the country as a whole
while significant variations exist between states. In current prices, the cost per couple year of
protection and birth averted increased by 30 percent between 1991/92 and 1995/96 while the
Government consumption deflator increased by 42 percent. The average cost per couple year
of protection in 1995/96 was Rs. 128. Most major states were close to the average. Significant
outliers were Bihar, Orissa, Rajasthan and Kerala. Greater utilization of existing infrastructure
in the first three of these states through the project's measures to increase demand by more
adequately catering to clients needs would reduce these unit costs. Already, international
comparisons show that unit costs in India are low. The cost per couple served is roughly one
third that in Bangladesh. However, there is also international evidence that unit costs start to
rise once contraceptive prevalence is above 40-50 percent-just above the current rate in India.
(h) The potential for generating significant resources through user charges is relatively low.
Estimates of the revenues expected by imposing charges equivalent to 10 and 15 percent of
variable recurrent costs of the whole family welfare program were calculated. At those rates,
the levels of cost recovery would be sufficient to pay for additional services resulting only in
increases of 1.6 and 2.3 percent in the existing level of couple years of protection. The
imposition of user charges for reproductive and child health services cannot be implemented
unilaterally but as part of a general policy on charging for health services. The issue is being
discussed with state governments within the context of the IDA-supported State Health
Systems projects. Currently there is greater potential to reduce pressures on public resources
through the revision of measures which provide free contraceptives (mainly condoms) and
compensation for sterilization. Provision of free contraceptives and compensation for
sterilization, however, absorb almost one sixth of the Government's Family Welfare budget,
and cost seven times the amount that could be raised by cost recovery at the highest of the
above rates. The Government's intention is to reduce further real expenditures on these items.
Their removal would likely have a greater impact on the unit costs of family planning funded
through the public sector than would the introduction of cost recovery.
14. Financial Assessment:
(a) The Family Welfare Program is fully funded by the Central Government with substantial
donor support. Expenditures increased by 40 percent in real terms between 1990/91 and
1995/96. Over the past two decades they have increased from 14 to 18 percent of total health
expenditures. The distribution across states is largely driven by population levels, and per
capita expenditures are significantly less unequal than for health expenditure as a whole.
While not necessarily reflecting the differential needs across states for family welfare services,
the distribution does at least allow the same level of service in resource poor states as in the
richer ones. This reflects GOI's intention to ensure that a program with large social benefits
and externalities flowing across state boundaries is implemented nationally. Donor support



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 17
Country: India                                         Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
has been equal to 20-25 percent of total expenditures. Between FY1994-97, the annual
average IDA support was Rs. 335 crores, around $93 million a year.
(b) The activities to be supported under the project are a subset of the total activities devoted to
improving reproductive and child health planned for the next five years. Past budgetary
allocations for the family welfare program have provided a physical and manpower
infrastructure appropriate for a family welfare approach which has concentrated largely on the
delivery of a very narrow range of contraceptive methods. The orientation towards a more
comprehensive approach requires substantial additional inputs introduced in an integrated
way. This justifies supplementary donor assistance. The new integrated approach will be
implemented largely through the maternal and child health activity of the Family Welfare
budget. The budgetary allocation for this item, plus compensation for sterilization, in 1996/97
is US$125 million of an overall departmental budget allocation of US$431 million. Over the
Ninth Plan period, 1997/98 - 2001/02, it is tentatively planned to increase expenditure on
reproductive and child health to an average of US$280 million a year, with recurring costs of
US$244 million. Assuming that all activities apart from reproductive and child health remain
funded at their current real levels, the Family Welfare budget would require a 40 percent real
increase by the final year of the Ninth Plan if all of the planned expansion of RCH is
implemented. The project will support part of this increase. It will not finance some of the
existing activities at all (e.g., compensation, grants to existing sub centers), will finance only
the expansion of others (e.g., IEC, safe motherhood in the current maternal and child health
activity) and will finance all costs of specific new activities (e.g., treatment for RTIs). The
project will not finance any activity currently being provided apart from expansions resulting
from changes in coverage and/or scope. In the event of other donors being willing to fund
existing activities, IDA will need to be satisfied that the GOI funds released remain within the
family welfare sector. During the project life, GOI will be required to provide evidence to this
effect.
(c) The fiscal burden of the project during implementation is manageable but will require an
increased financial commitment by GOI. As a share of total GOI revenue expenditure, the
overall Family Welfare budget is 1.2 percent. As a share of total government expenditures
(Center and state), the budget is just 0.4 percent. GOI counterpart funding for the project will
be equivalent to around 3 percent of GOI own-expenditures on Family Welfare in 1995/96.
(Issues related to the project's financial sustainability are discussed below in section 20.)
(d) The new family welfare approach being implemented by GOI will result in some savings
within the current budget. Real expenditures on the free distribution of contraceptives, as well
as compensation for sterilization and health guides, are already being reduced and will be
reduced further during the project period. Currently they consume around one sixth of the
program's budget. The financial implications of going beyond these measures and charging
for a proportion of the costs of medical services, drugs and vaccines have been calculated as
part of project preparation. The opportunities to charge for activities which require universal
coverage for effectiveness such as immunizations, and which help implement the right of every
woman to have safe deliveries, are limited. However, limited cost recovery is being piloted in
the IDA-supported State Health Systems Project. This may escalate and result in the recovery
of a small share of the costs of reproductive health drugs.
(e) While the Family Welfare Program is a central scheme, part of its success depends on the
quality and quantity of health personnel and infrastructure funded by the state governments.
The project does not fund additional staff or health sub-centers in any major way. However,
one of the main criteria for states becoming eligible for the funding of sub-projects is the



Project Appraisal Document                                                         Page 18
Country: India                                        Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
requirement that at a minimum they maintain current shares of expenditure on health. This
level should ensure that those states which are interested and able to implement additional
programs are systematically improving their overall health care provision.
15. Technical Assessment.
(a) The technical aspects of the RCH program as developed by MOHFW have been assessed by
the Bank, with assistance from WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA. The program approach aimed at
reduction of unwanted fertility, i.e., births to women who say they want to space or not have
additional children but who are not using a method of fertility regulation, is in accordance with
the recommendations of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development
(ICPD), which reviewed and made recommendations to make family planning programs more
effective. Contraceptive use in India is dominated by female sterilization, and unwanted
fertility is particularly high among couples who need spacing methods. The technical quality
and quantum of birth spacing methods are generally acceptable. However, the quality of
technical advice about use of such contraceptives and the competence of health workers in
providing clinical contraceptive methods is inadequate. The project appropriately focuses on
training and IEC to address these shortcomings. IEC would address some of the underlying
causes of unwanted fertility such as health concerns associated with methods of fertility
regulation, distrust of providers, and opposition by husbands and family members, male
involvement and responsibility. Training would focus on better information on modem
contraceptives and greater choice of methods, increased focus on individual client needs and
improved technical quality of services. Further, the increased use of temporary contraceptives
would require an un-interrupted, sufficient and conveniently accessible supply of the
contraceptives. Logistics systems are being strengthened through a UNFPA-financed project.
Schemes to: (i) permit outreach workers to sell condoms, (ii) increase the participation of
social marketing agencies at state level, and (iii) increase the involvement of NGOs and private
providers are expected to improve access to services. However, the reduction of unwanted
fertility is a "moving target" because improvements in female education and employment and
other factors are expected to escalate the rate of increase in the pool of couples who wish to
limit their fertility either by spacing or limiting births. Expectations of program achievements
should recognize such factors. The challenge for the Family Welfare Program is to meet the
needs for fertility regulation not only of the existing pool of couples with unmet need but also
the escalating rate at which additional couples are expected to desire suitable methods of
fertility regulation.
(b) The Essential Package of RCH services addresses conditions that are responsible for a heavy
burden of disease in India and consists of interventions recommended in the 1993 WDR as
highly cost effective. Several of the interventions were initiated under the recently completed
CSSM project. A recent evaluation of the Safe Motherhood component of CSSM by
MotherCare, an NGO, indicated that maternal health needs more emphasis than received to
date (see Annex 11). If the complications of pregnancy such as anemia, hemorrhage,
obstructed labor and postpartum infections that continue to be major causes of maternal death
are detected early and managed appropriately, maternal morality and morbidity would be much
reduced. This could be achieved through the provision of Essential Obstetric Care (EsOC)
closer to the place of residence (such as at the PHC level which should be able to handle 85%
of matemal complications), while Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) requiring surgical
interventions, blood transfusion and anesthesia could be provided at a higher level, namely the
Community Hospitals or First Referral Units (FRUs). MOHFW, with input from WHO,
SEARO and CARE, has adapted the Standards for Midwifery Practice for Safe Motherhood
and will be introducing it in selected states to strengthened EsOC at PHC level. The medical

Country: India                                        Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
technology (drugs, equipment, staff skills) to be provided in the RCH package are the least
cost and most appropriate for addressing these conditions, and provide access for rural and
urban poor (see Annex 11, Technical Assessment for details).
(c) Two new interventions, namely management of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and
adolescent reproductive health, would be introduced to address the recent recognition of the
high prevalence of RTIs and their linkage to AIDS, and the recognition that one in three
adolescent females become pregnant. A high proportion of RTIs in females are non-
symptomatic, and currently there is no proven low cost technology that can be used effectively
by peripheral health workers for diagnosing RTIs. With assistance from WHO, clinical
management guidelines are being developed to introduce interventions gradually in selected
areas, and would be evaluated before wider implementation. The interventions would focus on
IEC to increase awareness of RTIs and their dangers, and to strengthen diagnostic and clinical
treatment capacity of smaller rural hospitals. Strategies for improving adolescent reproductive
health are as yet embryonic, and it is expected that developmental work would be done during
the early phases of the project.
(d) In the child survival component, the immunization interventions have been the most
successful, and the FWP aims to achieve elimination of polio and neonatal tetanus.
Strengthening of surveillance mechanisms for this purpose is underway and would also be
supported by other Bank-financed projects. The cold chain for vaccines has been established,
and its maintenance would be strengthened under the RCH project as recommended by
UNICEF. The medical technology for improving clinical management of the two major
childhood causes of death - diarroheal and acute respiratory disease - has been introduced
under the CSSM project. However, the effectiveness with which such interventions have been
implemented is inadequate and the RCH program would appropriately focus on further
training, improved referral and clinical management procedures. For this purpose, MOHFW,
with assistance from WHO and SEARO has adapted the WHO training modules on the
Integrated Management of the Sick Child, and will develop appropriate strategies for
introducing such training within the framework of the District Training Guidelines.
(e) The coordinated human resource development and training strategy proposed by
MOHFW's Family Welfare Program is sound (see Annex 11 and the Project Implementation
Plan for details). The strategy would address recognized weaknesses, particularly in clinical
skills, interpersonal counseling skills and gender sensitivity, and management skills. During
project preparation a start has been made in coordinating the inputs that several external
agencies provide so as to remove wasteful duplication and optimize synergy. Mechanisms for
on-going coordination would need to be established. Experience from CSSM indicates that
quality of training becomes diluted and compromised when training initiatives are replicated
on a large scale through training teams who are inadequately prepared and under pressure to
cover large numbers of trainees. Therefore, training quality would be monitored through
indicators based on the award of clinical skill competency certificates and technical
evaluations of trained workers (see Annex 1). UNICEF would support capacity development
through Training Coordinators at national, regional and district levels, and support the training
of core training teams at district level, while specialized consultant institutions would be
appointed to provide technical input at state and district levels. An IEC strategy has been
developed that relies heavily on improved interpersonal communication by outreach workers,
social mobilization and tapping of NGO networks to reach disadvantaged and remote
community groups and to sustain a suitable policy environment for RCH-relevant behavior
change. However the capacity of weaker states to implement the strategy effectively is
doubtful. GOI has recognized the need to build IEC capacity and is enhancing IEC units at

state level. Staff in such IEC units would need to be trained and state-specific IEC strategies
would be needed. The Social Assessment and District Modeling study implemented during
project preparation has provided insights into approaches for rapid social assessments and the
use of such assessments for developing locally relevant IEC strategies. Building on this
experience, UNICEF would support the coordinated implementation of rapid social
assessments and local IEC strategies with support from specialized consultant institutions to be
financed under this project. Such training is expected to enhance the capacity at state, district
and block levels for planning and implementing locally relevant IEC strategies using local
assessments of communication needs and increasing the skills of all front-line family welfare
workers in interpersonal communication. Effectiveness would be monitored through rapid
community assessments (see Annex 1).
(f)  The civil works to be funded under the project consists almost entirely of construction,
refurbishment or extensions to a large number of small, scattered rural facilities. Appropriate
measures have been developed to address the two problems that have affected such civil works
in previous projects, viz., poor quality due to inadequate technical supervision, and inordinate
delays before constructed facilities become functional because of poor procurement planning
for furniture and equipment. To improve quality, technical standards and guidelines including
drawing and technical specifications for standard designs, have been developed (see Civil
Works and Design Manual in the project file), and all construction to be financed by the
project would be in accordance with the guidelines. Further, supervisory capacity at district,
state and MOHFWs level would be enhanced through relevant consultant services and by
establishing a Civil Cell in the Area Projects Unit at MOHFW to take responsibility for review
of civil works designs submitted by states and districts.
16. Institutional Assessment:
(a) Capacity for program management. The Family Welfare Departments (FWDs) at national,
state and district levels are relatively efficient and committed organizations that have
demonstrated the capacity to reduce fertility and childhood deaths in a vast, predominantly
rural and culturally varied country. At the national level and in most states, the FWDs would
have the capacity to manage the RCH program activities if their capacity for monitoring,
supervision and troubleshooting in weaker districts is enhanced by consultant support as
proposed under the project. Since the FWP is a 100 percent centrally funded program, the
national level MOHFW would also assume the responsibility for closer supervision and
troubleshooting in states that have weaker management capacity. Inadequate horizontal
coordination between units within the FWDs has been problematic in the past and would be
addressed through the management structures being established under this project. However,
coordination between FWDs and the Health Departments that manage communicable disease
programs, hospitals and curative services needs to be strengthened. Similarly, coordination
needs to be strengthened between FWDs and other departments, notably the Women and Child
Department that manages nutrition and early childhood development activities and has an
extensive village worker network, the Tribal Welfare Department, and municipalities that
manage health and family welfare in urban slums. Coordinating committees would be
established under this project. Their effectiveness is likely to evolve gradually.
(b) Capacity for managing IDA financing. The FWDs at national level and in the 15 larger
states are experienced in managing Bank-financed projects. Since most projects have
experienced difficulties in implementing procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines, a
key feature of this project would be the use of consultant Procurement Support Agencies
(PSAs) that have proven experience with Bank projects. Such PSAs would be responsible for



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 21
Country: India                                         Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
procurement of goods and institutional services. Detailed preparatory work that has been
completed during project preparation is expected to be sufficient to reduce problems in
procurement of civil works and individual consultant services. In a few states that have
experienced persistent delays and inadequacy in transfer ofproject-funds from state Financial
Departments to implementing authorities at district level, an altemate mechanism to transfer
project funds from the center to district implementing agencies would be established through a
state level Registered Society. Such societies would be formed by expanding the roles and
responsibilities of the Standing Committee on Voluntary Action (SCOVA) that manages GOI
financing of non-profit NGOs in family welfare. This mechanism would need to be carefully
monitored. The capacity for financial management of Bank funds at FWDs national and state
levels would be strengthened by additional accounting and clerical staff who would be
responsible for project accounts and preparation of statements of expenditure.
(c) Capacity for management re-orientation Effective implementation of the RCH program
would require major innovations affecting both the philosophy and management of the whole
FW Program. Whereas there is strong commitment for such re-orientation at national and
most state levels, the capacity for implementing such change is limited at district and sub-
district levels, and there have been no mechanisms for systematically using client and
community opinions in managing local activities. The extensive training to be financed under
the project would contribute to the development of district and sub-district capacity, and the
expansion of the existing monitoring system with client polls and community surveys would
introduce the necessary feedback mechanisms. However, the process of management re-
orientation is complex and difficult and likely to be more rapid and effective in some of the
500 plus districts than in others. Experiential learning of the process has already commenced
in several districts that have been given technical support with a.;sistance from several external
agencies, and sharing of lessons learnt has been a useful feature during project preparation.
The project would support GOI in continuing this process.
(d) Capacity for technical upgrading. The Bank assesses that the health system would be able to
absorb the complex technical upgrading needed for implementing the RCH program, provided
the progressive and graded approach proposed in this project is carefully supervised and
monitored, and necessary adjustments are made from time to time to accommodate the varied
capacity and needs of different states and districts.
(e) The FWDs manage an extensive rural health system of outreach and primary health facilities
that has demonstrated very good capacity to cover the vast rural population with health
interventions that require limited technology such as immunization, and higher technology
interventions that can be delivered through a rural camp approach such as sterilization for
contraception. The RCH program requires that this be supplemented with (i) a broader range
of a simpler technology that is accessible on a continuing basis (such as for birth spacing,
uncomplicated pregnancies and childbirth, and milder illnesses in early childhood); and (ii)
that clients who need higher level technology have timely and appropriate access to user-
friendly hospitals (such as for pregnancy complications). Such upgrading is a particularly
complex undertaking in a program that covers more than 500 districts which vary in the
institutional capacity of the rural health system and hospitals, as well as the health needs and
cultural patterns of the populations.
(f) Considerable capacity to provide technical upgrading such as establishment of training
institutions, trained trainers, and clinical management guidelines, has been established under
previous projects as well as several on-going projects (see paragraph 9). Consultants to
provide technical assistance for training and IEC would be financed under the project. There



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 22
Countty: India                                         Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
are two further critical elements. First, it would be necessary to ensure that various elements
of higher technology are matched to the institutional capacity of the particular outreach,
primary health or hospital facilities into which they are introduced. Further, such interventions
would also need to be appropriate to the health needs and cultural characteristics of
communities to be served. For this purpose, MOHFW has provided good guidelines in its
Concept Paper and Project Implementation Plan. (See Annex II for detailed Technical
Assessment, and the Project Implementation Plan). MOHFW would need to ensure that state
implementation plans operationalize the Guidelines appropriately. Particular attention would
be devoted to this aspect during appraisal and review missions during project implementation.
(g) Second, it would be necessary to establish a chain of technical supervision and back-up from
specialists in the hospitals through the rural health system down to the peripheral outreach
workers, as well as an effective referral system for early recognition of conditions requiring
referral by rural health workers and families, timely transportation, user-friendly reception and
appropriate clinical care in the hospitals. This would require (i) much closer coordination at
national, state and district levels between FWDs and Health departments that manage hospital
services, and (ii) functional linkages between hospital specialists and the rural health staff. For
this purpose, authorities have been required to establish relevant committees at national, state,
district and sub-district levels to develop and implement appropriate procedures. It is as yet
unclear how effective such committees would be. In the four states where the Bank is
financing SHS projects, the projects provide a foundation for the development of feasible
mechanisms. A system of coordinated supervision of the proposed RCH project and the SHS
projects is expected to promote coordination between the state and district FW and Health
departments.
17. Social Assessment:
(a) Project beneficiaries' reproductive health needs and behavior. Secondary analysis of data
from a battery of studies provided information about needs, attitudes and constraints faced by
poor women and children who are the potential beneficiaries of the project, as well as about
the attitudes and behavior of health care providers in the public sector. The studies were: (i)
the 1992/93 National Family Health Survey; (ii) tweny-eight quality-of-care studies funded by
the Ford Foundation, USAID, and the Population Council that used interview surveys, focus
groups, non-participatory observation, clinical surveys, service utilization and morbidity data;
and (iii) state-specific studies on tribal groups and disadvantaged groups in six states (Assam,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Punjab and West Bengal) and in urban slums carried
out in recently approved IDA projects. Almost 80 percent of individuals who use
contraception obtain supplies from the public sector, and about 10 percent from the private
medical sector. In some states, scheduled castes, tribal groups and some minority groups have
higher fertility and worse health status. Among these groups that would be the main
beneficiaries of the proposed project, a sizable proportion of couples were giving birth to more
children than they wanted although they knew about modem methods of contraception. Many
were also not using available health care services during pregnancy, childbirth and early
childhood. Among those who had an unmet needfor contraception, there was a low awareness
of spacing methods, low exposure to various media channels and disapproval of family
planning by husbands. When asked directly, the main reasons for non-acceptance or
discontinuation of contraception were fear of side effects (which were due to inadequate and
incomplete information about contraceptive methods), poor knowledge and inadequate access
to spacing methods. Critical barriers to use of available MCH services were the poor quality
of care associated with shortages of supplies and drugs, non-availability of staff, particularly
female staff, improper behavior of staff, and lack of referral facilities. Cultural norms and



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 23
Country: India                                           Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
limited physical access were additional barriers experienced in some geographic areas. From
the perspective of health care providers, particularly at the grassroot level, constraints included
management pressures to achieve targets for acceptors for sterilization and IUDs, inadequate
mobility, shortages of supplies and inadequate support from supervisors, and inadequacy of
technical clinical skills and inter-personal counseling skills.
(b) Stakeholder analysis. The centerpiece of this project is the implementation of a policy reform
process that requires (i) a profound attitudinal and behavioral change in more than 280,000
managers and health care workers to focus on client needs, obtain and use client feedback, and
improve the quality of information and clinical care; (ii) institutional changes to support
decentralization at national level, 32 state government administrative levels and more than 500
districts that belong to a system that has a long tradition of top-down management; and (iii)
establishment of a dialogue between the public sector and NGOs. Furthermore, during the
period of project implementation, the Panchayati Raj Institutions are expected to assume
greater responsibility in the implementation of the FWP, particularly at the district and sub-
district levels, and it is clear that cultivation of responsive and responsible attitudes in
communities, especially among Panchyat members, towards reproductive and child health
would be necessary to enable them to become partners in the change. The project's Social
Assessment has provided the framework for setting in motion a participatory process of
dialogue between at least 17 categories of stakeholders as summarized in the next paragraph
(see Annex 11 for further details).
(c) Stakeholder participation in project design. Two parallel consultative processes that have
informed project design are (i) a series of public sector seminars, workshops and consultations
organized by the national MOHFW with state government and district officials, the medical
establishment, academia and technical institutions, grassroot service providers, the Department
of Women and Child Development (WCD), the Ministry of Rural Development and donor
agencies; and (ii) a series of nine NGO consultative regional meetings involving more than 250
participants from NGOs, women's groups, and nurses' unions organized by the NGO
community. Cross-fertilization between the two processes has been maintained through a
significant critical group of individuals who have participated in both processes. The
consultative process has developed the differential implementation strategy for the essential
package of RCH services to suit the differing cultural and institutional characteristics of
different regions in the country. It is also expected to contribute to greater state government
ownership and responsibility for FW program management, state flexibility for utilizing
private sector and NGO facilities for RCH, and flexibility in the use of monetary incentives or
compensation for sterilization. The involvement of other ministries and multiple donors in the
consultative process is expected to result in improved efficiency and effectiveness through
better coordination and synergy of investments.
(d) Scheduled tribes and castes, minority groups, families living below the poverty line and
gender issues. The consultative process also provided input to the development of strategies
to integrate gender concerns and needs of indigenous people in project design that is expected
to result in:
* increased responsiveness to local needs through the modified monitoring system;
* increased access to RCH interventions for poor women in scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes, minority groups, and urban slums by (i) specific investments to increase access to
such groups in selected districts and cities through the sub-projects, and (ii) ensuring that
interventions and monitoring focus special attention to these groups in all districts;
* greater attention to individual client needs and gender sensitivity through the design of
relevant training programs and the subsequent monitoring of service delivery;



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 24
Country: India                                         Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
* improved quality of clinical care and counseling through training and monitoring;
* stronger linkages between outreach workers of the FWP and WCD; and
* establishment of referral services from the community to appropriate levels of the health
system.
These measures are expected to specifically increase utilization of available RCH services,
reduce childhood and maternal illness and death among these disadvantaged groups.
(e) Beneficiary participation in project implementation. The project would support continuing
feedback from, and interaction with, project beneficiaries at the grassroot level through a
modified monitoring system to supplement the on-going service delivery data. The additional
monitoring would elicit client and community feedback through periodic client polls by
service providers, as well as rapid assessments of the community by outside agencies,
technical quality assessments of services, and involvement of third-party agencies and NGOs
in data collection. This mechanism is expected to contribute to more responsive activity
planning at the grassroot level, as well as to provide information for monitoring purposes. In
addition, two purpose-designed studies are being conducted during project preparation to
address issues not covered in available studies. First, a district modeling study is developing
and testing a tool kit for use by district level staff for rapid assessments of communication
needs in the community, and for developing locally specific communication strategies aimed at
appropriate behavior change. Second, a study of panchayats using focus groups and interviews
is analyzing perceptions and attitudes of panchayat members towards reproductive and child
health. The outputs of these studies are expected to be used during project implementation for:
  improved project responsiveness to local needs through strengthening district capacity for
IEC; and
*  improved community awareness and support for RCH concerns through systematic
sensitization workshops for Panchayat members.
18. Environmental Assessment. Environmental Category C
The proposed project would include improvements to existing facilities through (a) a provision of
generators, water supply, and upgrading of labor rooms and operation theaters; (b) a supply of approved
drugs, vaccines, medical and cold chain equipment; (c) strengthened capacity for management and
monitoring, training and IEC; and (d) increased participation of private sector and NGOs in providing
defined services. The project has been reviewed and was found not likely to have any major negative
environmental consequence. There would be no resettlement of any people.

20. Sustainability:
(a) The fiscal burden of the project following completion is manageable but will require an
increased financial commitment by GOI. The incremental recurring costs in the year following
completion of the project would be approximately Rs. 175 crores. This is equivalent to
around 16 percent of GOIs current annual own-expenditures on Family Welfare and 28 percent
of the expenditure on reproductive and child health (including compensation and subsidies for
contraceptives). For GOI to fully fund the incremental recurrent expenditures at the end of the
project would require the equivalent of an average annual increase in real departmental
allocations of 2-3 percent a year over the life of the project, in addition to any increases arising
from expansion of other programs and those required to fund salary increments. If GOI were
to maintain the real expenditures of the CSSM program and continue to increase the rest of the
Family Welfare budget at the average real growth rate of 1991/95, the incremental recurring
costs of the project would be equivalent to 9 percent of the total budget. While this is a
significant share, in absolute terms it is under 0.1 percent of total GOI revenue expenditures
and is less than the obligations resulting from the recently completed CSSM project. The
requirement for Government to progressively fund an increasing proportion of recurrent costs
through the life of the project (from 80 percent in the first year declining to 25 percent in the
final year) should help to ensure that adequate provision is made to maintain activities
following project completion. The incremental recurrent expenditures will of course be higher
if other major donors and GOI support additional expansion of the planned program.
(b) Several measures would contribute to sustaining the upgraded quality of the FW program.
First, pre-service training of health workers and medical doctors needs to be revamped to
reflect the upgraded competencies that would be expected of new recruits in the FWP.
MOHFW has recognized the need to upgrade pre-service curricula, but it would be more
difficult to implement change in the medical school curricula. However, the widespread
interest and debate generated by the GOI decision to remove its "targets and incentives" policy
has raised general awareness in the academic community and is likely to trigger a change
process. Second, as communities become more aware of health needs and more accustomed to
receiving better quality care, there would be increased pressure from communities to sustain
the supply of drugs and better quality care.
(c) Third, although the Family Welfare program is a centrally sponsored scheme, part of its
success depends on the quantity and quality of health personnel and drugs and equipment
funded by both the central and the state governments. The main onus for improving and
expanding basic health services would lie with the states' health budgets. One of the main sets
of criteria for states becoming eligible for the local capacity component is the requirement that
they at least maintain current shares of expenditures on health. This measure should ensure
that at least those states which are particularly interested and sufficiently organized to
implement additional programs are systematically improving their health service provision. In
addition, the Departments' State Health Systems projects require a similar undertaking as they
also aim to introduce some degree of cost recovery for those above the poverty line. As this
develops, the opportunity to charge for some proportion of the drugs for reproductive health
will increase.

weaker states                                      and for monitoring and troubleshooting by MOHFW (see

indicators and would include monitoring of risk factors. (see
Annex 1)
Overall project risk rating:
Overall risk that the project could fail to achieve its development outcomes is rated moderate.
(a) Some crucial but unpredictable factors that could affect development outcomes are beyond the scope of project design.
(b) Experience shows that some very large, but weaker, states (namely, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) that have the worst social
indicators also have the worst implementation record. Only moderate development outcomes are expected for such states.
However, the mission's current perceptions of commitment in some currently weak states, (namely, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh) suggest that they could show substantial improvement in performance in the near future. If this
perception is incorrect the overall development objectives may not be achieved.

Block 4: Main Credit Conditions
23. Prior to negotiations, the Government of India (GOI) completed the following:
(a) Procurement readiness. (i) The conclusion of an acceptable contract with RITES, the selected
national PSA for year one activities; (ii) an acceptable procurement plan including the
schedule, draft bidding documents and packaging of the bulk of items of drugs and equipment
to be procured during year one; and (iii) acceptable Letters of Invitation (LOI) including Terms
of Reference for the procurement of consultant services during year one in accordance with the
implementation plans of MOHFW and participating states; and (iv) an acceptable LOI for the
competitive selection of a national PSA for years 2-5.
(b) Updated nationwide and local capacity enhancement implementation plans in accordance with
agreements reached during Appraisal regarding (i) funds flow mechanisms, (ii) procurement
mechanisms, and (iii) implementation plans including recruitment schedules, procurement
plans and proposed facility designs.
In addition, GOI confirmed that:
(c) States that have been required to use Registered Societies for flow funds, have implemented
agreed benchmarks for the process of applying for registration of their SCOVAs under the
Societies Act.
(d) Its Expenditure and Finance Committee (EFC) had recently approved the continuation of
existing posts created under the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood project and approved the
list of critical consultants proposed under the budget for the enhancement of program
management as described in Annex 2. Thirty percent of such consultants for year one had
been identified and will be appointed shortly; the remaining 70 percent of the consultants
would be appointed during year one. The EFC has given approval, in principle, of additional
staff as given in Annex 2.
24. During Negotiations GOl provided assurances that:
(a) The Credit would be governed by a Development Credit Agreement between GOI and the IDA
(ITF), and a supplementary Letter of Undertaking acceptable to ITF between each participating
state and GOI. Receipt of the signed Letter of Undertaking would be a condition for GOI to
finance activities or supply equipment or drugs to any particular state.
(b) GOI would undertake to maintain its policy of removing method-specific contraceptive targets
for family welfare workers and non-health personnel, and implement its Family Welfare
Program in accordance with its Project Proposal and National Project Implementation Plan
dated April 1997.
(c) GOI would allocate and cause Project States to allocate each year sufficient resources for its
childhood immunization program without use of project funds for this purpose.
(d) The supplementary Letters of Undertaking (see item a above) would include provisions that
the state would:

Country: India                                        Project Title: Reproductive and Child Health
(i)  establish a mechanism acceptable to IDA, as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund,
for the transfer of funds from the Center to the project implementing agencies at district
or institutional levels; and
(ii)  agree to use MOHFW's PSA or appoint a PSA at state level in accordance with terms of
reference acceptable to the Administrator (unless agreed in advance with the
Administrator that the particular state would be exempted from appointment of the
PSA).
(e) Implementation of the project would be in accordance with the following conditions:
(i)  Policy commitments for the LCE component. GOI would obtain commitments from each
participating State that at least 75 percent of sanctioned ANMs of subcenters and PHCs
are in position before the start of the sub-project and a further 10 percent of such posts
would be filled within two years.
(ii) Use of agreed implementation criteria. MOHFW would utilize the agreed criteria to:
a.  assess and recommend any additional sub-projects under the LCE component, and all
State Implementation Plans not appraised by the Bank's Appraisal mission, and financing
of such sub-projects or implementation plans would be subject to the Administrator's

Detailed Project Description
A. Project Approach
Two-part financing. This project is a sector investment operation proposed to be the first in a two-
part ITF/IDA financing to support policy and program evolution. It would support the Indian nationwide
Family Welfare Program in the paradigm shift involved in adopting the "target free approach," now
known as the "participatory planning approach," and progressively evolving its programs towards a
wholly integrated Reproductive and Child Health program. The two-part financing would consist of two
overlapping 5-year projects (RCH 1 and RCH 2) covering an eight-year period. This approach is
intended to provide the flexibility as well as continuity required to for nationwide implementation of
fundamental program re-orientation and expansion of program scope across 32 states and Union
Territories that have varied institutional capacity and reproductive health needs.
Institutional strengthening and feedback loops. Initial focus would be on institutional
strengthening particularly in national and state level capacity for program management, implementing
new monitoring mechanisms, and experimental introduction of approaches to reach the hitherto
unreached community groups. Evaluation after the initial two years of RCH 1 would provide the
opportunity to make corrections and alterations in proposed RCH interventions prior to upscaling during
the remaining period of RCH 1 together with the additional financing expected from RCH 2.
RCH intervention packages. The interventions to be introduced would strengthen and build upon
previous interventions. Therefore training, IEC and program monitoring interventions would be
nationwide. For the service delivery interventions, all districts in the country have been categorized as
A, B and C districts based on selected social indicators (see Table 1). Three packages of reproductive
and child health interventions would be introduced nationwide (in 30 states and Union Territories) in
category A, B and C districts with progressive phasing in of blocks within each district. The packages
have been designed to suit the institutional capacity and reproductive health needs of the different
categories of districts. This approach is expected to allow each district to gain experience in a limited
number of blocks, identify local causes of failure and implementation bottlenecks prior to expansion on a
larger scale.
Local capacity enhancement. Parallel and additional to the nationwide approach, focused
investment would be made through specific sub-projects in 24 districts or cities with particularly weak
social indicators. The sub-projects are intended to increase access for particularly disadvantaged groups
such as scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, minority groups and urban poor. The sub-projects would
support health infrastructure expansion, additional mobility for health workers and iinovative
approaches, particularly through NGOs and community workers, designed to meet specifically identified
local needs.
B. Project Components
1. Improved management performance (US$48.7 million)
(a) Decentralizedplanning and modified monitoring system" (US$15.9 million) The objective of
this sub-component would be to increase coverage and utilization of services nationwide by more
responsive activity planning based on local community data rather than normative planning based on
estimated target populations. The project would finance expansion of the existing MIS to include
monitoring client and community feedback and service quality through regular client/community polls
and technical assessment of service delivery facilities and ANMs competence by service personnel, and
rapid assessments of community and NGO perceptions by independent agencies. The project would also



Annex 2
Page 34
finance training and technical support for more responsive decentralized activity planning based on local
data that would become available through the expanded MIS.
(b) Institutional strengthening (US$19.0 million). The objective is to improve program
effectiveness and efficiency through:
(i)    Procurement and technical support. (US$15. 0 million) The project would finance
Procurement Support Agencies (PSAs) to strengthen national and state level capacity for
procurement of goods, consultant and contractual services. Such procurement support
would be expected to improve resource utilization, timeliness and coordination of inputs,
and increase access to NGO and private sector skills and manpower. The project would
also finance Specialized (technical) Institutions and individual consultants to provide
technical support at national, state and district levels in areas such as training, IEC, civil
works monitoring and surveys and studies. Table 3 provides a summary of the critical
technical support that would be required during year one. Model terms of reference for
such agencies were reviewed and agreed during project appraisal. States that have a
poor record in transfer of funds to project entities would establish the existing State
Standing Committees for Voluntary Action (SCOVAs) as registered societies and utilize
such societies to transfer funds from the center to project entities. Tables 2 and 3 give
state by state details of the initially agreed mechanisms for improved funds flow and
procurement strengthening. Table 4 outlines the mechanism for reviewing these
procurement arrangements for subsequent years.
(ii)    RCH research for management. (US$4.0 million) The project would establish a
framework for facilitating the dissemination of research results and utilization of
research findings to strengthen program management. In parallel with the
implementation of the project, a broad array of research, particularly evaluative research
would be funded and implemented with inputs from several external agencies as well as
Indian research agencies. The project would strengthen MOHFW capacity by financing
workshops andpublications to promote priority agendas for such research, to
disseminate research findings to policy makers and managers, and to promote utilization
of research results. In addition, the project would also finance studies that would
evaluate RCH implementation.
(c) Enhanced program management capacity. (US$13.7 million) The RCH Program would be
largely managed by staff who formerly managed the CSSM Program whose job responsibilities
would be reviewed and revised to reflect the needs of the RCH Program while ensuring that
functions established under CSSM were not neglected. In addition, the project would enhance
MOHFW's capacity to cater for the additional demands that would be created by the enlarged
scope of the Program, by financing (i) additional staff for the MCH and Area Projects Unit at
MOHFW level, and for six state level Family Welfare Departments and sixty-four district level
Family Welfare Bureaus that did not receive this input under previous projects, and (ii) a
number of individual consultants to strengthen planning, monitoring and supervision capacity at
national, state and district levels. Table 5 provides a summary of (i) the proposed management
staff, and (ii) the number and categories of individual consultants.
2. Nationwide: Improved Quality, Coverage and Effectiveness (US$172.1 million)
Essential package of RCH services. The objective is to improve quality, utilization and access to
the RCH services by upgrading quality of Family Welfare (FW), and stronger convergence between FW
services and services of the Women and Child Development Department and Health Department
programs. Sub-components would be:



Annex 2
Page 35
(a)Training. (US$34.7 million) The project would finance training costs in all districts in the
country for family welfare workers from community, sub-center, primary health center and first
referral unit levels, and for block and district level managers. Training systems established in
most states by earlier and on-going Population Projects would be mobilized to upgrade
competency in (i) technical and clinical skills in all components of the RCH package of services;
(ii) interpersonal counseling; (iii) improving gender sensitivity in the provision of services; (iv)
program management related to RCH including convergence with Women and Child
Development services; and (v) IEC and community mobilization in support of RCH. The project
would fund district training plans guided by the Guidelines for Developing District Family
Welfare Training Plans, MOHFW, 1996.1 The plans would coordinate inputs from this project
with inputs from other external and GOI sources. The state specific estimated training load is
provided in Annex 12. Items eligible forfunding under the district training plans would include
allowances for trainees; training materials and equipment; trainer allowances; identified
refurbishment for clinical training sites; and establishment of district training teams in districts
not previously covered by other projects.
(b)IEC. (US$5.9 million) The objective of the IEC component would be to improve appropriate
health and care seeking behavior among target populations, and to increase community
participation and responsibility for reproductive and child health. Generic messages to support
RCH initiatives have been identified. The project wouldfinance district IEC plans including (i)
community surveys for communication needs assessments; (ii) local consultants; (iii) message
and materials development and media support; (iv) training of IEC staff at district and sub-
district level; (v) communication activities by NGOs and community groups; and (vi) rapid
assessments of effectiveness of district communication strategies and evaluation of behavior
change. The district action IEC plans would include expected annual outputs and benchmarks
for periodic evaluations.
(c) Upgrading service delivery. (US$131.5 million) The project wouldfinance approved eligible
lists of equipment and drugs, contractual services, referral funds, defined schemes to improve
access as given below, and minor renovations for sub-centers, primary health centers and
facilities such as community health centers and sub-district hospitals that have been identified to
be first referral units using criteria established by the recently completed CSSM project. The
actual selection of items for a particular state would be in accordance with general guidelines
provided by MOHFW that take into account the district categorization, previous or parallel
related investments from other projects, and phased start up of district activities. Using the
MOHFW guidelines, states have prepared state implementation plans that are expected to
operationalize the obstetric referral system for which much preparatory work and most of the
provision of equipment have been completed under the Bank-supported CSSM project, as well as
provide greater choice of contraceptives, early registration of pregnancy, better detection and
management of obstetric complications, abortions, reproductive tract infections, and common
childhood illness, and increased attention to the RCH needs of the adolescent. The state
implementation plans identify the specific facilities that would be upgraded each year, and
coherently coordinate the scheduling of service delivery inputs with the scheduling of training
and IEC within the state. Thirty state implementation plans have been reviewed jointly by the
IDA and GOI using agreed criteria, and approved with defined required amendments.

Items on the eligible list would include: (i) defined list of supplies, drugs, and medical equipment,
details of which are available in the project file; namely, kits approved under the CSSM Project as
Equipment Kits C, D, G, I, for a proportion of primary health centers that have midwifery trained
nurses and hemoglobinometers for sub-centers (see Annex 12), suction apparatus (equipment) for
medical termination of pregnancy and syringes for menstrual regulation, consumable items and
funds for drugs from an essential drug list for management of reproductive tract infections as has
been approved under the National Aids Control Program (see Annex 12), and items from an
approved list of drugs for essential obstetric care (see Annex 12); (ii) allowances or hiring of
contractual staff from the private sector to fill specific skill gaps, (notably additional female multi-
purpose workers for subcenters in some C category districts, midwifery trained nurses, laboratory
technicians, anesthetists, obstetricians and gynecologists); (iii) defined special schemes to increase
access in remote areas through use of community workers; (iv) small scale community managed
referral funds for transporting obstetric emergencies to referral centers; and (v) manuals, training,
and monitoring to implement quality assurance for sterilization, IUD insertions and safe abortion.
Taking into consideration the limitation of funding availability, as well as the need for phased
introduction of inputs and activities, the MOHFW guidelines limited the types and volume of items
eligible for financing for each category of district during RCH 1. The items approved by MOHFW
together with the suggested phased introduction are summarized in Annex 12.
3. Local Capacity Enhancement: Improved Access (US$91.2 million)
District and City Sub-projects. (US$91.2 million) The objective of this component would be to
focus investments in the most disadvantaged districts and urban slums in individual states. Project funds
would be allocated on the basis of approved sub-project proposals aiming at increasing access by
expanding and strengthening the physical infrastructure and human resources, optimizing the utilization
of existing resources, and implementing innovative approaches to meet the needs of local priority groups
(scheduled tribes, poor women and children from schedule castes, minority groups and urban slums).
Criteria. Sub-projects would be governed by (a) policy commitment criteria whereby states agree to
implement policy changes related to provision of adequate staffing and budget resources for RCH and
reducing reliance on incentive payments; (b) entry criteria whereby district or city sub-projects would be
financed only in districts and cities that have highest concentrations of the priority groups in the state,
and identified health, fertility and social indicators; and (c) appraisal criteria that have been agreed
between Bank mission and MOHFW to assess the quality of the sub-project proposal and its
implementation readiness. (See LCE Implementation Plan: Criteria for Appraisal of Sub-projects). The
following sub-projects have been reviewed by the MOHFW Advisory Panel, using the agreed criteria
with guidance from Bank missions, and approved for financing:

Each sub-project has a detailed proposal and an implementation plan outlining indicators, inputs and
outputs for achieving the objectives. The Appraisal mission reviewed the sub-projects and the
implementation readiness, and made the final recommendations. The following items are eligible for
financing under the sub-projects as required:
(a) defined refurbishment or upgrading of physical facilities in accordance with technical criteria that
have been defined in the RCH Civil Works Booklet and Design Manual, namely:
(i) electrical generator sets and water storage facilities for existing facilities,
(ii) "upgradation" of existing subcenters, PHCs and identified FRUs consisting of minor civil
works such as plumbing, wiring, repair of roofs, windows, etc.,
(iii) addition of staff residential accommodations at sub-center level for MPWF and at PHC level
for trained nurse-midwife,
(iv) addition or renovation of operation theaters, delivery rooms at PHC or FRU, and
(v) construction of new sub-centers, primary health centers or identified items for urban areas to be
decided on a case by case-basis.
(b) social marketing of contraceptives and other products related to RCH;
(c)  defined NGO schemes to increase access and community involvement;2
(d) honorarium for community health (link) workers; support for emergency transport; women's health
committee work;
(e)  consultant and contractual services;
(f)  vehicles;
(g) furniture, non-medical equipment and materials;

(h) medical equipment from the eligible list; and
(i) operations and maintenance.
C. RCH Program Management
Management structure at national level. This project would be managed by the existing core FW
program staff at national, aiid state level, who would be assisted with capacity enhancing consultancy
support that would be financed by the project. At national level the Family Welfare Department (FWD)
in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) would be the nodal agency. Within the FWD,
two units would have major responsibility for the monitoring and reporting on program activities: the
MCH division which was strengthened under the recently completed CSSM project, and the Area
Projects Unit that supervises externally funded projects was strengthened under the earlier Population
projects. The MCH Division would be responsible for coordinating and monitoring activities under the
nationwide component, and the Area Project Unit for the LCE component. The accompanying
organogram sets out respective relationship, existing staffing in the key units that would be responsible
for managemnent of activities that would be financed under the project, and constants who would be
appointed to enhance the capacity of the respective units. Other units responsible for family planning,
training, IEC, policy, logistics, social marketing, NGOs, rural health manpower and infrastructure, and
urban family welfare would all be responsible for providing technical guidance and support.
The Inter-ministerial Steering Committee and a Project Management Committee have been
established to coordinate and oversee the project at national level. Membership in the two committees is
shown in the chart below. The Project Management Committee is chaired by the Secretary (Family
Welfare), and includes all of the highest level key officials in the FWD, namely, both Joint Secretaries,
the Financial Advisor and all Deputy Commissioners.

Coordination of support from external agencies. An RCH Task Force with membership of
external agencies has been established by MOHFW at national level to coordinate external support for
the Family Welfare Program.
Management structure at State level. The Director, Family Welfare would be the Project Director
and the FW Directorate would be responsible for coordinating, monitoring, supervising the RCH
Program and providing technical guidance to the District FW Bureaus or, in some states, the Zilla
Parishads who would be responsible for implementing activities. At the state level, management
structure and coordinating committees would mirror those at national level. The states have provided
information about the specifics of management structure, procurement responsibilities, financial
management responsibilities, program activity responsibilities, and additional staff and consultants that
are planned to be appointed. It is expected that in most states existing staff including those whose posts
were established under the CSSM or IPP projects, would be able to manage RCH program activity
responsibilities. Consultants financed under the project would provide procurement support, technical
support for training, IEC and monitoring.
Management structure at district level. Distribution of project management responsibilities
between district FW Departments and Zilla Parishads differs from state to state, being governed by the
extent to which each state has devolved authority and funds to the Panchayati Raj institutions. The
project would provide flexibility to integrate changing institutional relationships.
Technical support. 'Specialized institutions' would be appointed as consultants to provide support
for upgrading program activities such as (a) improving training skills and evaluation of training, (b)
developing IEC particularly in areas such as communication needs assessments, IEC strategy
formulation, media development and impact monitoring; and (c) surveys and special studies to aid the
implementing agencies monitor the program impact. The 'specialized institutions' would include
institutions such as State Institutes of Health and Family Welfare established under earlier Population
projects, NGOs, private sector and academic institutions, or private hospitals that would provide referral
services for RCH. The appointment of such consultancies will require the careful preparation of TORs;
appraisal of the capacity of potential consultants e.g., to assess their experience, and, in the case of
institutions, their financial solvency and capacity to carry out the task; and ongoing monitoring of
performance. The task of carrying out the contracting would be handled by the Procurement Service
Agency(ies) as described in Annex 6.
Individual consultants would also be hired to provide technical skills as required. A particular
example would be the hiring of civil works professionals, or entering into arrangements with selected
members of PWDs, to help supervise civil works activities effectively. It is also proposed to use
individual consultancies to fill medical and other technical vacant posts. To facilitate the process,
standardized model TORs are being prepared as part of project preparation.
Functions. The MOHFW level would be responsible for defining program strategies, providing
technical guidance and quality standards, coordinating RCH activities, monitoring and trouble-shooting,
and controlling the flow of funds accordingly. Project related activities would be of two types: (a)
activities that could be considered an integral part of FWP activities such as service delivery, training,
IEC, logistics, and monitoring; and (b) those arising from IDA financing such as procurement,
submission of expenditure claims, and audit statements. The first category of activities as well as the
financial activities would be largely within the capacity of the existing staff augmented by individual
consultants. Procurement functions would be provided by a consultant agency the Procurement Support
Agency (PSA.)



Annex 2
Page 41
During project preparation, the capacity of the MOHFW has been demonstrated by the preparation
of manuals that provide technical standards for (a) training, (b) district level planning, (c) expansion of
the monitoring system, (d) social marketing, (e) NGO schemes, (f) civil works, and (g) quality assurance
for female sterilization, and are in the process of updating service delivery standards. (Copies of the
manuals are available in the Project File). The MOHFW has also provided guidance to states in
preparing state implementation plans (SIPs) and have reviewed the SIPs and the sub-projects proposals
under the LCE component.
During implementation, MOHFW would be expected to (a) plan and monitor the implementation of
procurement that is done at the national level, (b) review and approve the technical and commercial
aspects of civil works proposals in accordance with the agreed Design and Civil Works Manual, Bank
procurement guidelines, and state expenditure performance using agreed benchmarks, and (c) identify
state needs for technical and managerial support and arrange for such support.
Decentralized Planning. Planning for FW services has been decentralized to the PHC level. The
planning process is to be carried out annually and would utilize a planning format entitled "PHC Family
Welfare and Health Care Plan" (Form-3 in the TFA Manual). This Format contains estimated data on
service needs and PHC requirements in terms of equipment, staff and supplies to meet those needs. PHC
plans would be aggregated at district level to form the district plan, and district plans in turn would be
aggregated to form the state plan.
Modified Monitoring System. In accordance with the commitment to the "Target Free Approach,"
GOI has proposed a revised monitoring system which would replace monitoring by method specific
contraceptive targets. An MOHFW Task Force has suggested a monitoring system that would focus on
service coverage, quality of care and client satisfaction. Performance indicators and the monitoring
system proposed by the Task Force has been discussed in several consultative meetings held among
various stakeholders including NGOs, service providers, and state level managers. Their deliberations
have provided input for finalizing the design of the monitoring system.
The revised monitoring system consists of three components:
(1) Monthly Activity Reports from sub-centers, PHCs and first referral units (FRUs). (Forms 4.0,
10.0 and 1 1.0). Information from these three forms would be collated in a single reporting format
(Form 14) to be sent from district to state to the Evaluation and Intelligence (E & I) division of
MOHFW every month.
(2) Technical Assessment of sub-center level services by service staff. LHVs would carry out
technical assessments at the rate of one sub-center per month. The assessment checklist covers items
reflecting accuracy of ANM's records, observations on her technical skills, availability of equipment
and supplies and client's knowledge and perceptions of service delivery. LHVs are expected to use
these assessments for on the job training of ANMs under their charge. The assessments would also
be used at district level for identifying training and IEC needs.
Further developmental work required include: (a) the review of Technical Assessments results once
in six months at the District level and appropriate follow-up action initiated; and (b) the development
of formats be developed for collating and summarizing the data for use at the district level.
(3) Rapid Surveys of Clients and Facilities by Independent Agencies. For assessing coverage,
quality of care and client satisfaction, MOHFW would fund annual client surveys to be carried out in
each state by independent agencies. Organization of these surveys would be the responsibility of the
Joint Secretary responsible for managing the nationwide component of the RCH Program. The
surveys would be designed to be economical and rapid so that their findings would be available



Annex 2
Page 42
within two months. The surveys would cover about 20% of districts per year, representing different
regions in the state. All surveys would be carried out about the same time (e.g., August - October) of
each year to provide comparable data. Along with the client surveys, facility surveys would also be
carried out in the same sample of districts. Other sources of data to be used in project-end evaluation
are the National Sample Surveys, and NFHS type surveys if available.
MOHFW monitoring and feedback. Data from the three components of the modified monitoring
system would provide estimates on a wide range of indicators as given in the NPIP that would be used by
GOI for monitoring the RCH Program. Data on such indicators would be made available on request to
World Bank review missions. The Joint Secretary responsible for managing the nationwide component
of the RCH Program would organize annual workshops involving officials from the center and from
states as well as other stakeholders to discuss the progress and implications for program implementation.
Annual Performance and Work Plans: mechanisms for review and approval. It has been
agreed in principle to implement performance based funding during the project. Each state would
provide an annual performance report and annual work plan (for the nationwide components as well as
for each sub-project) in accordance with a model formats agreed with the Bank. MOHFW would be
responsible for reviewing the annual performance and proposed work plans, and for approving annual
budgets using criteria agreed with the Bank. Since there is limited experience in implementing
performance-based funding, the criteria to be used would be jointly reviewed by the Bank and MOHFW
from time to time to assess appropriateness and effectiveness, and relevant revisions would be agreed
whenever necessary. Such revisions would be documented and shared with all states.
Criteria for performance review. Two types of criteria have been identified: (I) scope of
activities to be monitored, and (2) critical performance benchmarks. The scope of activities for which
MOHFW would review the annual performance of each state, would include (a) establishment of the
newer elements of the monitoring system (activity reports, technical assessments, rapid surveys) and
utilization of data from such sources for district planning; (b) timeliness of funds flow, procurement
progress, appointment of staff, consultants and contractual services; (c) training; (d) IEC; (e) availability
of drugs, contraceptives and equipment; (f) provision of services coordinated with relevant IEC for
essential obstetric care, temporary methods of contraception, safe abortion, referral services for all
elements of RCH services; (g) timely completion, fumishing and equipping and staffing of new
constructions and renovations; and (h) local community and NGO mobilization initiatives. MOHFW and
the Bank would agree on critical performance benchmarks for each year. For states that fail to achieve
the critical benchmarks, MOHFW would reach agreement with the state on recommended remedial
measures, dates for achieving the recommended remedial measures, with a clear understanding that
failure to implement the remedial measure would result in reduction or withholding offunds for
activities plannedfor the subsequent year(s).
Critical performance benchmarks. For the.first two years, the critical performance benchmarks
that have been agreed are: (a) project management staff/director to be in place throughout the period; (b)
acceptable level of funds flow (% expenditure vs. allocated budget); (c) balanced expenditure in each
expenditure category; (d) availability of data on items specified in the agreed Annual Reporting Format;
(e) community surveys implemented in the 20 percent of districts; (f) technical assessments implemented
and reported in at least 20% of districts; (g) training of trainers on schedule for clinical skills, counseling
skills, district planning, and RCH content areas; and (h) establishment of the system of proficiency
certificate award for trainees. For subsequent years, critical performance benchmarks would be agreed
between MOHFW and Bank missions at least two years in advance.
Indicators for joint GOI/Bank monitoring. A sub-set of twelve indicators selected from the
MOHFW range of indicators has been agreed for joint GOI and World Bank monitoring. (See Annex 1).



Annex 2
Page 43
Since IDA financing is aimed at supporting the Family Welfare Program as a whole, the indicators would
reflect state-wide performance of the RCH Program and are not tied to specific inputs financed by IDA.
Six of the indicators would evaluate the achievement of Development Objectives and six would monitor
Implementation Progress. All states would use the same set of indicators. However, their baseline levels
and expected achievements will be differentially specified for each state. MOHFW would provide data
on the selected indicators on a six-monthly basis to the World Bank on a state by state basis. MOHFW
would provide baseline data on those indicators for which such data is already available, and to provide
equivalent data from surveys during year I for those where data is not available.
World Bank review process. The Bank would implement six monthly review missions with
MOHFW. MOHFW is expected to establish a system for coordinated Joint Review of the RCH Program
with all Extemal Agencies including the Bank. When such a system has been established, the Bank
review missions would be integrated into the Joint Review mechanism. Prior to each review mission,
MOHFW would provide data on the agreed 12 indicators together with a summary report covering the
areas identified in the scope of monitoring and the critical performance benchmarks for the year. During
review missions, Bank missions would make field visits and participate in review workshops.

Economic and Financial Analyses
Economic Analysis
I . Several pieces of economic analysis were undertaken during project preparation. In addition,
a number of recent studies completed by the division (SA2PH) for other purposes provided
information relevant to the assessment of the benefits and cost effectiveness of the proposed
project. While most of the analyses focus on the justification for intervening in the areas covered
by the project compared to interventions in other areas, some utilize detailed financial data to cost
and compare specific interventions.
Rationale for public investment
2.  Public investment in family welfare services can be justified in principle on the grounds of
both efficiency and equity. Some services have the characteristics of public goods e.g., IEC, and,
more importantly, several provide positive externalities or benefits to individuals beyond those
receiving the service. A general example is the improvement in maternal health and nutrition
which improves the survival chances and well-being of children leading in turn to lower fertility
leveis. Lower fertility may then lead to reduced infrastructure expenditure, higher savings and
other variables which the overall standard of living. In the absence of public financing, the
effective demand and provision of these services is likely in many cases to be below the socially
optimum level. Equity arguments in favor of subsidized health services are strong in India, where
the most recent survey of poverty suggests that over one third of the rural population has access to
just Rs. 5 or less a day. The public provision of health services, in addition to their financing, is
justified when private provision does not exist, the public sector is a more efficient provider or
consumers exhibit a clear preference for public services.
3.  Recent IDA sector work in India concluded that while some reproductive and child health
services may be provided by the private sector and NGOs, the public sector will have to continue
to play the central role, especially for the poor. According to the recent National Health and
Family Welfare Surveys, 79 percent of individuals using any form of modern contraceptive are
supplied by the public sector. Only 11 percent of all women and 6 percent of rural women who
have recently given birth did so in a private institution. Virtually all infant vaccinations are
provided by the public sector. Overall, the vast majority of the population in general, and the poor
rural population in particular are dependent on services provided by the public sector. Recent
extensive survey research in Uttar Pradesh indicates that of the large group of women with unmet
demand for contraception, the percentages who intend to use public (as opposed to private) sector
services in the future for sterilization, IUD, pills and condom supplies are 89, 81, 64 and 50
percent respectively. Among rural women, the percentages are significantly higher - 93, 87, 68
and 62 percent. Of 157,000 private practitioners, only 28 percent offer contraceptive services,
mainly pills and condoms, and under 15 percent of all private health service staff have received
any family planning training in the past three years. While the results are not presented with a
rural/urban disaggregation, it can safely be assumed that these percentages are significantly lower
for rural areas. In some areas of family planning and reproductive health, the private sector does
not provide services. When it does, the substantial use of the alternative public services,
particularly for clinical services, suggests that the financial charges are beyond those that can be
paid by many, particularly rural, families.

4.  Even if the public financing and provision of reproductive health services can be justified in
principle, there is a need to provide these services in the most economically efficient way. No
single, universally accepted tool of economic analysis exists to measure efficiency in the sector. In
project preparation, attention has been given to various measures of cost effectiveness, trends in
unit costs, simulations of cost recovery and cost reductions and to a very partial use of cost benefit
analysis.
Program and project benefits
5.  Specifying and quantifying the measurable benefits of the Family Welfare Program (FWP) in
general, and of the proposed project in particular, is problematic. There is greater information on
the costs. In the current analysis a variety of measures of both intermediate and 'final' benefits are
used, including couple years of contraceptive protection and births averted, savings in public
expenditures resulting from a smaller population, levels of reduced morbidity and mortality among
women and children and reductions in the unit costs of a given type of service or treatment.
6.  Among the benefits of the new approach to be adopted in the FWP which cannot be
realistically measured are the increased choice and women's' empowerment through control of the
timing and frequency of childbearing and the impact of increasing community participation in the
design and implementation of the program.
7.  The shift in emphasis from a population control program to a reproductive health program is
not intended to displace the goal of reducing population growth in those states where it remains
high. Rather, it is intended to provide a more effective pathway. It is a central hypothesis of the
project that a more client-oriented service which offers greater contraceptive choice and the ability
to give attention to reproductive health needs will, together with reductions in infant and child
mortality, increase the utilization of family planning services. Such service related improvements
will attract many millions of women with 'unmet contraceptive needs' whose fertility levels are
higher than they desire. The recent National Family Health Survey suggests that around 50
million Indian women are in this category. Benefits from improvements in family planning
services and the reduction in fertility to desired levels will go directly to those couples who use the
service. There will also be an intergenerational effect as existing children receive higher levels of
investment in the development of their human capital. In addition, economic and environmental
benefits will accrue to society as a whole from a reduced growth rate of population.
8.  As well as reducing high levels of fertility, the new approach supported by the project will
decrease the health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Around 19 percent of the total
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost resulting from the burden of disease for women in
India arise from sexual, maternal, and perinatal conditions. This is the highest share among all
causes. Recent detailed burden of disease studies across five states show a significantly higher
level of DALYs lost per 1000 population for women aged 15-44 years (158) compared to males in
the same age group (139). Moreover, the distribution of the causes of DALYs lost was quite
different with women suffering from a high share of pregnancy-related illnesses. Currently almost
two fifths of all pregnant women receive no anti-natal care-almost all of these are illiterate and
poor and depend upon public health services. In contrast, only four percent women with at least a
secondary schooling receive no care. Similarly, only twelve percent of illiterate women give birth
in any type of health facility compared to 57 percent of more educated women. By increasing the
quality of services for safe motherhood, the project will improve the quality of life for many
millions of, largely, poor rural women. There are also significant impacts of reproductive health



Annex 4
Page 51
interventions on child health. It is estimated that in India, one third of under-five mortality could
be prevented if mothers were more healthy and obstetric complications were appropriately
managed. Since child mortality levels are above maternal mortality levels, the benefits of
reproductive health interventions are likely to be greater for children.
9. As part of the project's support for the Government's reproductive and child health program,
it will also build upon the child survival initiatives developed by the recently completed CSSM
project through financing part of the costs of both quantitative and qualitative expansion.
Childhood illnesses continue to be widespread in India. Across the country, the childhood cluster
of diseases accounts for around seven percent of the total burden of disease. The recent burden of
disease studies indicate that the DALYs lost per 1000 population in the 0-4 years age group are
nine times greater than for the 5-14 years age group and five times greater than for the 15-44 years
age group. The high level of DALYs lost through early childhood diseases differs little across
states in spite of quite wide variations in per capita income (e.g., Andhra Pradesh and Punjab).
10. Finally, in addition to the direct benefits derived from new activities, the project also aims to
increase the effectiveness of past investments made by GOI, state governments and IDA in the
development of the health care and family welfare physical infrastructure across the country. For
example, many first referral units are underutilized due to the inadequacy of electricity and water
and essential drugs for the treatment of RTIs/STDs and EOC. Providing these services and
materials should increase the demand for a higher quality service while simultaneously reducing
the marginal and, hence, average costs. Similarly, additional inputs for training institutions will
increase the quality and the efficiency with which existing infrastructure is used.
Cost effectiveness
I 1. Analysis of the cost effectiveness of the interventions supported in the proposed project falls
into three categories. First, the cost effectiveness of overall interventions such as increased ante-
natal care and immunization is compared to other interventions in the health sector. This analysis
utilizes the concept of the $ cost per DALY saved. Second, the cost effectiveness of alternative
forms of delivery of the intervention such as contraceptive pill versus IUD is discussed.
Effectiveness in this approach is measured by couple years of protection. Third, trends in the costs
of service delivery over time and across states are calculated to broadly reflect changes in program
efficiency.
Cost per DALY saved
12. The major child health intervention in the FW program is the universal immunization
program for infants in their first year of life. The program was greatly expanded under the IDA-
supported CSSM project 1992-96 and it is intended to strengthen it further. The immunization
program follows the standard protocols recommended by WHO/UNICEF. These were evaluated
in the 1993 World Development Report as being among the most cost effective of all health
interventions. In low income countries, the cost per DALY saved through the EPI-plus (extended
program of immunization) set of vaccines was estimated to be between $12-17 (compared, for
instance, to $1000 for treating child leukemia). More recent estimates made for Andhra Pradesh
as part of SA2PH' s work on health sector reform has estimated the cost per DALY gained of the
universal immunization program at around $8. This was the ninth most cost effective intervention
out of seventy assessed. A similar recent study in Guinea has estimated the cost there at $25 - the
ninth most cost effective intervention out of forty assessed.



Annex 4
Page 52
13. The reproductive health interventions of the project are anticipated to achieve multiple
objectives. Broadly, these are (a) improved health status of women of child bearing age and of
their children, and (b) reduced levels of fertility and population growth. The cost effectiveness of
reduced fertility cannot usefully be addressed via the DALY methodology. Hence the focus here
is on women's health. The general estimations made in the 1993 WDR for low income countries
suggested that prenatal and delivery care had a cost per DALY gained of $20-30. The more
detailed and recent study for Andhra Pradesh suggests a wider range across different interventions.
The costs per DALY gained were estimated to be:
Referral care for pregnancy with obstetric complications $ 1.5
Attended normal urban delivery                    $ 16.5
Neonatal care for perinatal condition             $ 62.7
Attended normal rural delivery                    $100.2
14. Interventions surrounding pregnancy and delivery have a cost per DALY gained of $100 or
below. The much higher cost associated with rural attended delivery compared to urban delivery
suggests low levels of attendance in poor quality rural clinics.
15. Again, the costs appear to be much higher in Guinea than in India. Costs per DALY gained
there for similar interventions are estimated at:
Obstructed birth                                  $  8
Normal prenatal and delivery care at hospital     $127
Normal risk prenatal and delivery care at health center   $133
Trained birth attendant at delivery at health post  $261
16. Urban delivery appears to be ten times as expensive per DALY gained in Guinea as in India
and rural delivery, over two and a half times. Wages, as reflected by per capita income, are
around 60 percent higher in Guinea. Real costs in India remain lower. Everywhere, the types of
interventions in women's health being proposed in the project have a high payoff in terms of
DALYs gained. In India, the payoff appears to be particularly high.
Cost per couple year of protection.
17. One of the central features of the project is the encouragement of a greater choice of
contraceptive methods. In practice this would mean a relative shift away from, particularly
female, sterilization (terminal methods) to temporary methods which allow for control over the
spacihg of births. This raises the issue of cost effectiveness. Studies during project preparation
highlight the complexity of the issue, the measurement problems and the limitations of the
conventional approach. A study of the cost effectiveness of various forms of contraception in
slums and the surrounding rural areas yielded the following benefit/cost ratios (where benefits
were measured in terms of births averted).
Condoms                          2.96
Pill                             3.11
IUD                              4.39
Sterilization                    4.84



Annex 4
Page 53
Based on UNFPA cost estimates collected during project preparation, the cost per couple year of
protection by method was estimated at:
Sterilization          IUD              Pill          Condom
US $0.5            US $0.8          US $2.3         US$4.0
Cost comparisons across countries are fraught with problems. It is not clear for instance whether
the above costs include salaries or simply materials. However, in studies of Honduras, Mexico
and Thailand in the late 1980s the ranking of costs by method is similar (Janowitz and Bratt 1992).
The costs of clinic-based family planning services per couple year of protection were (1988 US$):
Sterilization          IUD               Pill
Honduras                  6.50                12.05            25.54
Mexico                    8.40                19.11            20.74
Thailand                  3.12                9.20             15.34
The costs of non-clinic based services per couple years of protection using community-based
distribution systems were (1988 US$):
Pill               Condom
Dominican Republic        8.8                 50.5
Honduras                  18.5                21.7
18. In all cases, sterilization was the most cost effective method, followed by IUDs then by the
contraceptive pill and finally condoms. The results are not surprising but require careful
interpretation. The cost per couple year of protection for sterilization tends to be low since the
operation is a single one and the effect is permanent. Similarly IUD insertion is semi-permanent.
Condoms and pills require regular use and the effects are temporary. The benefit/cost ratios are
subsequently lower. However, the characteristics of those couples using different forms of
contraception differ such that the methods should not be regarded as alternatives. In India, the
mean age of the women at the time of tubectomy is 29.9 years and at the time of IUD insertion,
27.8 years. Users of condoms and oral pill users are significantly younger and have lower parities.
The total fertility rate in India declined from 5.2 to 3.8 between 1971 and 1991. The rate of
decline was much greater in the higher age groups: for instance, declines of 49.2 percent for the
40-44 age group, 39.9 percent for the 30-34 age group and just 5.9 percent for the 20-24 year age
group. It is very clear that for a further decline in overall fertility in India, the behavior of those
couples in their 20s will need to change. Sterilization cannot help younger, lower parity couples
who wish to limit the number of children and control the spacing of births but who are not ready to
end childbearing. With the continued high rates of infant and child mortality, among other factors,
it will be difficult to sustain current levels of sterilization by focusing on the younger age group.
In all states there will continue to be a demand for sterilization for some time and in those states
where the fertility decline in the older age groups is lower than average, this demand will remain
strong. However, in order to serve the reproductive objectives of younger couples and to effect a
further reduction in overall fertility levels, the focus on non-terminal methods will need to increase
even though these methods are more costly and require a more efficient delivery system.
Consequently, a simple benefit-cost approach has limited relevance. The choice is not between
sterilization and the oral pill, for example, since the potential 'customers' for each method are not
necessarily the same.



Annex 4
Page 54
19. A shift to higher cost methods of contraception increases the importance of providing each
individual method at lowest cost and minimizing the overall cost per year of couple protection or
averted birth taking into account the different reproductive objectives of couples. The data
presented above indicated significantly lower costs for each method in India than in the other three
countries. Current comparisons between the family planning programs in India and Bangladesh
indicate that cost per couple served is three times higher in Bangladesh. An attempt to calculate
the overall costs across the major states was also made during project preparation. The results
suggest that costs vary substantially between states. The reasons may provide important lessons
for the higher cost states.
20. Initially, utilizing assumptions regarding couple years of protection for each method/cycle of
contraception, the coverage provided by the 1994/95 family welfare program was calculated for
each state. The unit cost of each intervention was used to calculate the share of total program
costs spent on each method by state. There are very significant variations. For example, of the
total costs, the shares utilized for each method in Bihar and Kerala are (%):
Sterilization      IUD           Condoms         Oral Pill
Bihar              65.2            11.0            20.4            3.4
Kerala             51.9             5.0            40.3            2.8
21. The protection effect of each method was converted into an equivalence of sterilization and
the family welfare program expenditures per sterilization (or total protection) and per acceptor
calculated for each method and in total. The variations between states are significant. Cost per
sterilization equivalent in the 14 major states ranged from Rs. 1233 in Karnataka to Rs. 3110 in
Kerala - apart from Bihar where the cost was Rs. 5474. The average was Rs. 2089. Cost per
acceptor ranged from Rs. 327 to Rs. 986 - again apart from Bihar where it was much higher.
22. Unit costs of acceptors, couple years of protection and births averted were calculated across
the country for individual years from 1991/92 to 1995/96 on the basis of the total cost of the
family welfare program (Rs.).
Per couple year of           Per birth averted
protection
1991/92                        98.9                         614.5
1992/93                        94.7                         586.4
1993/94                       107.3                         678.1
1994/95                       109.7                         680.3
1995/96                       128.5                         798.3
23. In 1995/96, the overall cost per couple year of protection was Rs. 128 or $3.6. In current
prices, the cost increased by 30 percent between 1991/92 and 1994/95 while the government
consumption deflator increased by 42 percent. These figures suggest that overall the program
became more cost effective. The variations in costs between the states in 1994/95, however,
suggest that while most of the major states had unit costs within Rs. 30 of the average, a few states
had significantly higher costs. The three most out of line were Bihar (Rs. 479), Kerala (Rs. 274),
Orissa (Rs. 270) and Rajasthan (Rs. 232). In the case of Kerala, higher costs probably reflect the
larger percentage of acceptors using methods other than sterilization while in the other cases, the
cause is more probably an underutilization of the existing widespread infrastructure. Greater



Annex 4
Page 55
utilization resulting from the project's measures to cater for individual client needs and to provide
more materials and better trained staff would lower unit cost in these states.
24. Finally, the results of studies in two other countries are reported to indicate changes in cost
effectiveness which India may face in the future in the absence of further policy change. A recent
study in Zimbabwe concluded strongly that the availability and quality of family planning services
in the community are associated with higher rates of adoption of modem contraceptives. The
introduction of a hospital, mobile family planning unit and community-based distributor to a
community would raise contraceptive usage from 30 to 40 percent (and be equivalent to the effect
of raising average education levels by seven years). Current contraceptive coverage in Zimbabwe
is 27 percent. In contrast, the well known study of Indonesia by Gertler and Molyneaux (1994)
concluded that changes in family planning inputs explained little of the change in fertility during
the 1980s. The interpretation of these results is that by the mid 1980s Indonesia already had a
dense system of infrastructure and family planning services and that while this had been important
in reducing fertility, additional investments of the same type displayed diminishing marginal
returns. These results support the shift in strategy which occurred. Government initiated an
aggressive program to increase the participation of the private sector in service delivery while
concentrating public investments in those areas where the private sector would not operate.
Apparently, as contraceptive coverage rates increase to much beyond 40-50 percent, the cost of
recruiting new acceptors increases. This is likely to be particularly the case in India where the
relatively cheap sterilization programs have dominated but must now be augmented by other, more
expensive, methods. In the medium term, an increased emphasis on social marketing using a
variety of providers will need to be pursued if public costs are to be contained.
Cost benefit
25. The benefits from those aspects of the project resulting from a reduction in fertility and
population growth cannot be measured through the calculation of DALYs gained. The many
attempts to calculate the economic benefits of a lower population have all been controversial and
even more so when these benefits have been compared to the costs of population control measures.
During project preparation, data were generated which allowed for a partial exploration of these
issues. The exercise is largely an illustrative one and the results are not definitive. The approach
was to compare the future public expenditures savings from a lower population to the costs of the
past family planning program. In principle, such an approach would allow for comparisons of the
returns with those from interventions outside of the health sector.
26. The analysis followed three steps. First, a population model provided estimates of population
with and without the family planning program from 1971 to 2000 using actual and predicted
values of the total fertility rate and life expectancy at birth by five year periods. To project
fertility in the absence of the program, data on contraceptive acceptors was utilized.
27. Without the family planning program it was estimated that the population by 1990 would
have been 63 million higher.
28. Second, for the period 1971 to 2000, the benefits of reduced population in terms of savings to
government through not having to provide social services and food subsidies were calculated using
the per capita expenditures on these at constant prices and the difference between the two sets of
population projections. Third, the cost of the family planning program between 1970 and 1990



Annex 4
Page 56
was calculated. Finally, the streams of costs and benefits were discounted and an internal rate of
return of 11.3 was derived. This is above the rate normally required to justify public investments.
29. The method described above suffers from a number of limitations. On the one hand there is
an assumption that the increased number of acceptors of contraceptives (and hence of the
reduction in fertility) resulted directly from their availability through the family welfare program.
The NFHS reports that 79 percent of users of all methods are supplied by the public sector and 86
percent of sterilizations. To the extent that the numbers of contraceptive users would have
increased in the absence of a public program and that increased contraceptive use does not result
in decreased fertility to the extent assumed, the reduction in population and hence the benefits side
of the calculation is overestimated. On the other hand, the social benefits of reduced population
growth are not limited to resulting savings in public expenditure. For instance, aggregate savings
rates are likely to increase resulting in higher rates of economic growth. The results of the
exercise, therefore, need to be regarded with caution and considered alongside other less ambitious
but more precise analyses.
Cost recovery and expenditure switching
30. Seventy nine percent of all contraceptive users are serviced by the public sector and 87
percent of rural users. Only six percent of rural women give birth in private institutions. The
1986/87 National Sample Survey showed that the choice of public and private facilities depended
strongly on level of household income. High levels of cost recovery in the public sector would put
significant stress on the poor and are likely to reduce demand. Recent sector work on health sector
reform in four states demonstrates that current government policy is to provide universal free
services for primary health care and free care in secondary and tertiary institutions apart from
patients who opt for relatively private rooms. Experiments to set some very low charges for all
patients above the poverty line (roughly 60 percent) in secondary care institutions and to charge a
nominal annual registration fee (Rs. 2) in primary health centers are being considered in a few
states. In line with these trends, the impact of introducing some small cost recovery measures in
reproductive health services has been assessed.
31. The illustration focuses on recovering part of the non-salary recurring expenditures of the
total family welfare program. These were calculated for each of the major fourteen states. As a
share of total expenditure they average 16 percent. The results of imposing charges equal to 10
and 15 percent of recurring expenditures were then calculated and compared to the FW
expenditure per couple year of protection for each state. The result is the additional couple years
of protection which could be provided within the existing budget. Recouping 15 percent of
expenditures could finance additional services equal to almost five percent of existing services in
Bihar and one percent in Haryana with an average across all states of 2.3 percent. To achieve this
overall level of cost recovery, the exemption of the forty percent of women in households below
the poverty line would require those women who do pay to contribute around 25 percent of the
recurring expenditures.
32. The level of charges discussed above (15 percent) would provide an additional Rs. 35 crores.
An alternative would be to reduce the government subsidy on contraceptives, which mainly goes
on condoms. While these expenditures have been falling in recent years, the allocation in the
1996/97 budget is Rs. 100 crores (around seven percent of total expenditure), two thirds of which
is for condoms. An additional Rs. 100 crores is budgeted for compensation, mainly for



Annex 4
Page 57
sterilization. The differences in subsidy across methods suggests that some better targeting is
possible. The 1986/87 NSS provided the following percentage breakdown:
Method         With incentive        Free           On payment
Sterilization         67               23                 10
IUD                9                44                47
Pill               3                28                69
Condom               4                38                58
33. Beneficiaries of the subsidies come disproportionately from the lowest income groups.
Forty-five and 32 percent of beneficiaries came from the poorest 20 percent of the population in
urban and rural areas, respectively. This still leaves a large proportion of subsidies being
consumed by the higher income groups.
34. The relative size of the financial amounts involved suggest that the effectiveness and the cost
effectiveness of these expenditures require review prior to the imposition of direct charges for
medical treatment.
Financial Analysis
35. The Family Welfare Program is a central scheme funded by the central government and
implemented largely by the state governments. The justification for central government funding is
mainly the spillover effects of high levels of fertilityffects which cannot be contained within any
individual state. Without such transfers, it is argued, expenditures would be lower than those
justified by the totality of benefits. Over the past three decades, program expenditures have
developed the physical and manpower infrastructures to implement an approach focused on family
planning with a restricted choice of contraceptive method. The new approach ernvisages wider
choice and more comprehensive reproductive health services. In the medium term, savings should
result from the re-orientation. Initially, however, more resources will be required. Following the
completion of the project, financial sustainability should not pose a significant problem.
Incremental recurring expenditures arising from the project will be equal to around 3 percent of
projected total departmental expenditures. In addition, there are opportunities for program savings
and for a small level of cost recovery.
36. Almost 90 percent of the budgeted resources are administered by the states. Expenditures on
the program in 1995/96 were Rs. 1525 crores. This represents almost a doubling of expenditure
over 1990/91 and a 40 percent increase in real terms. As a share of total GOI revenue
expenditures, however, they were just 1.12 percent compared to 1.26 percent in 1993/94.
Compared to most other Government programs, the family welfare program is substantially
supported by donor assistance and its share of total expenditures has been increasing from 21.9
percent in 1993/94 to 29.4 percent in 1995/96. For 1996/97 the projected share is lower (at 22.6
percent) but this results more from the structure and timing of donor-supported projects than from
any decrease in donor commitment to the sector. The proposed project will not add significantly
to the donor share of total expenditures since the IDA-supported CSSM project ended in
September 1996 and Population V and VI projects will be completed by mid 1997.
37. Of the 1995/96 budget for the Family Welfare program around Rs. 930 crores was for salaries
(largely channeled to the states through grants for the Rural Family Welfare Services); Rs. 215
crores was for free contraception, compensation for sterilization and IUD acceptors, and the social
marketing of contraceptives; and Rs. 200 crores was for donor-assisted area-specific projects.

Expenditure on the CSSM program was Rs. 280 crores. Of this, Rs. 56 crores was provided
directly by GOI and the remainder through IDA credit and UNICEF grant. Throughout the four
year project, GOI has contributed around 20 percent of the total. Following the end of the CSSM
project in 1996 roughly Rs. 200 crores a year will be required to maintain the existing CSSM
activities (immunization, micronutrient supplementation for pregnant women and infants, oral
rehydration salts, etc.). It is estimated that an additional Rs. 150 crores a year would be needed for
population growth, as well as expansion in coverage expected from the removal of excessive
emphasis on contraceptive targets, improved local management and increased focus on quality,
client orientation.
38. Most of the GOI Family Welfare budget is transferred to states. In turn, almost all of the
resources in each state government's Family Welfare budget are received from the central
government. Data for Gujarat provide an example. In 1995/96, 98 percent of the budget was
received directly from the Center, of which over half funded the grants for the sub centers,
including the salaries of ANMs. Of the rest, training and compensation paid to those willing to be
sterilized were the largest items. The distribution of the allocation for compensation between
methods (over 11 percent of the total) demonstrates the overriding dominance of tubectomy (Rs.
'000):
tubectomy        Rs. 6,76,00
vasectomy            44,10
IUD                  26,30
39. Over time, expenditures on family welfare have been increasing faster than total health
expenditures. As a consequence, their share increased from 14 percent in the mid 1970s to 18
percent in the mid 1990s. In some of the large northern states the share is over 20 percent. Prior
to the CSSM program, almost all of these expenditures were directed towards family planning. In
many rural areas, the provision of health services was dominated by the family planning program
(Dreze and Sen, 1995). Since the distribution of resources across states for the national program is
largely driven by population, it is not surprising that per capita expenditures are significantly less
unequal than for health expenditures as a whole (Tulasidhar, 1996). While not necessarily
reflecting the need for family welfare services, the distribution does at least allow the same level
of service in resource poor states as in the richer ones. This is not the case for other health
services funded entirely by state governments and which reflects central government's intention to
ensure that a program with large social benefits flowing across state boundaries is implemented
nationally.
40. Past budgetary allocations for the family welfare program have provided a physical and
manpower infrastructure appropriate for a family welfare approach which has concentrated largely
on the delivery of a very narrow range of contraceptive methods. The changing orientation
towards a wider approach requires some additional inputs which, to be effective, need to be
implemented in an integrated way. This justifies supplementary donor assistance. In the medium
term it will result in savings from some reductions in existing activities. Items to be funded
nationwide are: decentralized planning and expansion of the existing MIS to include
client/community surveys; an institutional strengthening package aimed at strengthening project
implementation capacity including procurement, project supervision and technical support;
training, and IEC, including community mobilization, equipment, drugs, and contractual staff to
support the progressive upgrading of the existing child survival, basic safe motherhood, and
family planning services to the essential package of RCH services, including adequate referrals.



Annex 4
Page 59
In addition, items to be funded in a number of districts and cities with particularly poor health
status and high fertility would include strengthening of healthfacilities (sub-centers, PHCs and
first referral units) so that such facilities would be able to provide the essential package of RCH
services. The total cost of the project is around $309 million of which 20 percent or $62 million
will be GOI counterpart funding over five years. Annually, counterpart funding would be
equivalent to around just 3 percent of GOI's own-expenditure on Family Welfare in 1995/96.
41. The activities to be supported under the proposed project are a subset of the total activities
planned for improving reproductive and child health for the next five years. Past budgetary
allocations for the family welfare program have provided a physical and manpower infrastructure
appropriate for a family welfare approach which has concentrated largely on the delivery of a very
narrow range of contraceptive methods. The orientation towards a more comprehensive approach
requires substantial additional inputs introduced in an integrated way. The new integrated
approach will be implemented largely through the maternal and child health activity of the Family
Welfare budget. The budgetary allocation for this item, plus compensation for sterilization, in
1996/97 is Rs. 450 crores out of an overall departmental budget allocation of Rs. 1550 crores.
Over the Ninth Plan period 1997/98 - 2001/02, the Department anticipates to increase expenditure
on reproductive and child health to an average of Rs. 1009 crores a year, with recurring costs of
Rs. 880 crores. Assuming that all activities apart from reproductive and child health remain
funded at their current real levels, the Family Welfare budget would require a 40 percent real
increase by the final year of the Ninth Plan if the overall planned expansion of RCH is
implemented in full.
42. The project which will support payment of only contractual staff has a very limited civil
works component. In addition to the training, IEC, and new planning/monitoring system
components the main areas of expenditure will be the equipment, drugs and supplies for enhanced
service delivery. The incremental recurring costs of the project in the year following project
completion are estimated to be Rs. 175 crores. This is equivalent to around 16 percent of GOI's
current own-expenditure on Family Welfare and 28 percent of the expenditure on reproductive and
child health (including compensation and subsidies for contraceptives). While this is under 0.2
percent of total GOI recurrent expenditure, it is a significant share of departmental expenditures
and will require the equivalent of an annual average increase in real departmental allocations of 2-
3 percent a year over the life of the project in addition to any other increases required to fund
expansions of other programs within the department, and salary increments. The requirement for
Government progressively to fund an increasing proportion of recurrent costs through the life of
the project (from 80 percent in the first year declining to 25 percent in the final year) should help
ensure that adequate provision is made to maintain activities at the end of the project. The
incremental recurrent expenditures will of course be higher if other donors also support the initial
costs of the planned expansion of the RCH program.
43. While the Family Welfare program is a central scheme, part of its success depends on the
quantity and quality of health personnel and facilities funded by both the central and the state
governments. Sector work completed by IDA in 1995 pointed to gaps in facilities and staff
according to the Government's norms. This project does not focus on these gaps in a major way.
The main onus for improving and expanding basic health service infrastructure will lie with the
states' health budgets. The local capacity enhancement component which focuses on those
districts/cities most in need does allow for some civil works and the employment of additional
staff under contract. However, the selection of districts/cities is governed by stringent criteria,
with a ceiling on funding for any one district/city whereby funding would be performance-based.



Annex 4
Page 60
One of the main sets of criteria for states becoming eligible for the local capacity component is
that they at least maintain current shares of total expenditures on health. This measure should
ensure that at least those states which are particularly interested, and sufficiently organized to
implement additional programs, are systematically improving their health service provision.
44. The new approach to reproductive health being implemented in the states through GOI will
result in some savings within the current budget. Expenditures on the free distribution of
contraceptives (Rs. 99 crores), compensation for sterilization (Rs. 100 crores) and health guides
(Rs. 10 crores) have all been reduced in real terms over the past two years and will be reduced
further during the project period. Currently, they are equal to around one sixth of GOI own-
expenditure. Savings are likely to exceed the possible income from cost recovery. Estimates of
the revenues from charges equivalent to 10 and 15 percent of the variable recurrent costs of the
whole family welfare program would finance an increase in services equal to 1.6 and 2.3 percent,
respectively (see section, Economic Analysis).

Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements
Procurement
1. Bank-financed works, goods and services would be procured following the Bank Guidelines and
the agreed standard bidding documents for India.
2. Procurement support agencies. The project would be nationwide and would have procurement at
three levels - national, state, and district. Procurement capacity would be strengthened by the
appointment of consultants to serve as Procurement Support Agencies (PSAs) at national and state level
to assist MOHFW or states to procure equipment, drugs and materials, and appoint individuals or
institutions as consultants. All states/Union Territories except those that are able to demonstrate past in-
house capacity to do procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines would be required to appoint a
PSA.
3. National level PSA. Taking into consideration the time that is required to appoint a consultant
agency as a PSA and positive experience with PSA services under the recently concluded Child Survival
and Safe Mother project, it has been agreed that at the national level, an experienced PSA with
nationwide capacity would be appointed on a sole source basis for Year 1, to be followed by competitive
selection of the national PSA for Years 2-5. When requested, the national level PSA would also assist
states with selection and appointment of state level PSAs and carry out procurement on behalf of states.
4. Procurement methods applicable to the various expenditure categories as well as the
administrative levels at which the different types of procurement would be done are summarized in
Tables below. It is envisaged that the project would support a large number of small contracts for
consultant services for supplementary staffing and for NGOs at district and sub-district level.
Where possible, standardized terms of reference and model forms of engagement would be
approved during project preparation for such contracts. Most of the medical equipment consists of
several standardized packages (kits) of small items for a large number of rural facilities. It is
envisaged that procurement of such packages would be done at national level. The medical drugs
to be used by a large number of small rural facilities will be selected from a standardized list for
which rates will be established through NCB.
5. Civil works. (US$45.3 million) Over 30 percent of civil works expenditures would be for
renovations of existing health facilities and for construction of small scattered facilities, including
subcenters and residences for multi-purpose workers and nurses and subcenters, and remaining civil
works would be for construction of primary health centers, community health centers, urban health
centers and additions of operation theaters and labor rooms to existing small hospitals. None of the
works contracts will exceed US$3 million and therefore there will be no ICB. Works estimated to cost
over US$25,000 equivalent or above would be procured under NCB procedures. Contracts for works
estimated to cost US$25,000 or less per contract in scattered and remote areas shall be procured by (i)
direct contracting up to an aggregate limit of $3 million; or (ii) on the basis of comparison of price
quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors eligible under the guidelines or unit/piece
rate systems to qualified contractors or Registered NGOs (or other beneficiary associations) not to
exceed aggregate limit of US$29.3 million; or (iii) by Force Account as a last resort in a manner
satisfactory to the Association up to an aggregate limit of $3 million.
6. Fumiture and Non-medical equipment. (US$9.7 million) These items would be purchased in
accordance with the phasing of project activities. Equipment comprises office equipment, electrical
generators, water storage equipment. Because of the phasing of the project, diversity of items,
destinations, and that no procurement will exceed US$100,000, ICB procedures would not be practical.
Contracts for equipment and furniture estimated to cost more than $25,000 equivalent would be awarded



Annex 6
Page 63
on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Contracts for equipment and furniture estimated to
cost less than US$25,000 may be awarded on the basis of on the basis of local shopping based on
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three national suppliers or under rate contracts of
Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D) or rate contracts of national level PSA.
7.  Medical Equipment and Drugs. (US$49.8 million) About 70 percent of the medical equipment to
be procured consists of a limited number of items that are provided in the form of standard kit to a large
number of scattered rural clinics. Details on the type of equipment and packaging are available in the
Project Implementation Plan provided by the Borrower. Procurement of the bulk of such equipment
would be done by the Procurement Support Agency at national level, and then provided as kits to the
project states. Contracts for such equipment and drugs would be awarded on the basis of ICB for
packages exceeding $300,000 and NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for packages over $25,000 but less
than $300,000. The other equipment would mainly be small items of supplementary laboratory
equipment intended to bring existing facilities to acceptable functional standards. Contracts for
equipment costing less than the equivalent of $25,000 would be awarded on the basis of local shopping or
under DGS&D rate contract. For items in this group costing between $50,000 or less per contract, rate
contracts provided by the NPSA should be followed.
8.  Medical drugs consist of a limited number of standard drug items to be supplied to a large number
of scattered rural sub-centers, primary health centers and small hospitals that would provide first referral
services. Details of the drugs and vaccines are available in the Implementation Plan provided by the
Borrower. Bulking requirements would not always be feasible due to limited shelf life of the medicines.
As a result, the individual purchases would be small and may not attract foreign bidders. Contracts for
drugs and vaccines estimated to cost more than $25,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of:
(a) NCB procedures acceptable to IDA; and (b) where bulk purchasing is feasible, packages exceeding
$300,000 equivalent would be contracted through ICB procedures. Contracts for drugs and vaccines
estimated to cost less than US$25,000 or less may be awarded on the basis of local shopping based on
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three national suppliers or under rate contracts of
Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D). However for items costing US$50,000
equivalent or less per contract, rate contracts provided by the national PSA may be followed. (Rate
contract of state Governments are not acceptable but they can be considered as one quotation).
9. Materials and goods (US$1.0 million) and LEC (US$5.9 million) would include materials and
equipment of IEC and training and books. No contract is expected to exceed US$ 100,000. Contracts
estimated to cost more than $25,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures
acceptable to IDA. Where the printers/publishers are on the approved list maintained by DAVP, IEC and
training materials may be directly procured from these printers/publishers for contracts estimated to cost
US$15,000 or less. Printing in different languages can be treated as separate contracts, possibly
requiring sole source in order to maintain quality. Otherwise contracts estimated to cost less than
US$25,000 may be awarded on the basis of on the basis of local shopping based on comparing price
quotations obtained from at least three national suppliers for national shopping or under rate contracts of
Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D) or rate contract of national level PSA. (Rate
contract of state Governments are not acceptable but they can be considered as one quotation).
10. Consultants and technical assistance. (US$47.4 million). Institutional and individual consultant
services would required under the project for the purpose of procurement support and for specialized
technical services such as training and IEC, and travel and daily allowances for staff and consultants.
Such consultants would be hired following procedures prescribed in the Bank Guidelines - Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. Terms of reference (TORs)
irrespective of value and single source contracts will be subject to prior review. Contracts for individuals



Annex 6
Page 64
and NGOs valued under $50,000 selected on the basis of agreed TORs, and model NGO schemes would
not be subject to prior review. Contracts valued at US$200,000 or more for consultant firms and $50,000
or more for individuals will be subject to prior review.
11. Contractual services. (US$42.0 million). Individual contractual services would be used mainly to
recruit the services of medical specialists (anesthetists, obstetricians) and laboratory technici-bns for rural
first referral units, lady medical officers and nurse/midwives for remote PHCs and private medical
practitioners to provide selected defined procedures such as the provision of medical termination of
pregnancy. Such contractual services would entail a very large number of contracts valued from about
US$350 to US$2000. In order to facilitate the award of such contracts in a large number of districts,
model terms of reference, selection processes and model contracts acceptable to IDA would be
employed, and no further prior review would be required. Institutional contractual services would also
be used for non-profit NGOs who would provide RCH services to defined remote communities or urban
slums. The award of such contracts would be on the basis of model schemes, selection process and
model contracts acceptable to IDA. After agreement on respective model schemes and contracts, and
selection procedures, a case by case prior review would not be required.
12. Additional Staff. (US$21.1 million) To allow for the additional demands that would be created
under the enlarged scope of the Program's transition from CSSM to RCH, management capacity at
the national, state and district level would be enhanced by adding (a) a limited number of additional
staff, and (b) a number of consultants.
13. Fellowship. Training. and Workshops. (US$38.0 million) This category includes expenses
related to training of professionals over the life of the project in respect of courses, workshops, travel
and subsistence allowances. It is estimated that more than 100,000 courses would be implemented
each attended by approximately 25 family welfare workers.
14. Referral Transport. (US$1.4 million) An innovative scheme to finance referral transport would
be tested on a pilot basis in selected districts and direct contracting procedures acceptable to IDA
would be followed. Funds would be set up to (a) pay honoraria to volunteer health workers per birth
reported to the health system; and/or (b) to fund emergency transport for women with obstetrical
complications. These would be done through standard contracts between the [state] concerned and
the community monitoring group.
15. Rental Costs. (US$5.7 million) Rented premises to be used for management and training staff
and service delivery would be financed 100 percent by GOI.
16. Vehicles. (US$3.1 million) Procurement of vehicles would be purchased on an annual basis over
the entire five years of the project in accordance with the requirements of the project activities as
additional districts are brought into the program. Because the project involves 32 states/Union territories
spaced over a five year period and the vehicles will be bought locally in a phased manner, no contract is
expected to contain more than ten vehicles. Such a purchasing plan does not lend itself to ICB.
Wherever possible, requirements would be bulked and purchased at the state level. For each contract not
exceeding US$100,000, DGS&D rate contracts or local shopping procedures would be followed,
comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices. Above this
threshold, ICB procedures would be followed for any contract.
17. Operation and Maintenance. (US$32.2 million). Funds for meeting the operational expenses would
cover reporting fees for TBAs, maintenance and hiring of vehicles and maintenance of equipment and
storage fees to MSDs.

Disbursement
1. Required Documentation. Disbursements for all civil works and goods over US$300,000
equivalent per contract, consulting firm contracts over US$200,000 equivalent, vehicles over
$100,000, and individual consultants over US$50,000 would be fully documented and all other
expenditures would be disbursed on the basis of statement of expenditure, with supporting
documentation retained by each state government for review by IDA during supervision mission. No
withdrawals of the proceeds of the credit shall be made for payments related to any Project state until
the State Implementation Society of that state has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding.
2. Special Account. In order to accelerate disbursement in respect of ITF's share of expenditures
pre-financed by GOI and the state governments, and to allow for direct payment of other eligible
local and foreign expenditures, a Special Account would be maintained in the Reserve Bank of India
in the amount of $12 million.
3. Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing in the aggregate amount not exceeding SDR 7.2
million equivalent would be allowed for expenditures incurred after September 30, 1996 and prior to
project effectiveness in the expenditure categories of: (a) consultant services including IEC, (b)
training and workshops, (c) surveys and studies, and (d) incremental salaries and operating expenses.
Project Accounts and Audits
4. Flow of funds. In some states, previous projects in the sector have suffered because of
bottlenecks in the flow of funds through State Finance Departments, with consequent difficulties for
expenditure and implementation. In such states RCH will attempt to obviate these problems by
channeling funds from MOI-IFW to the implementing agencies at district level through State
Committees on Voluntary Action (SCOVAs) which have been registered as Societies. (The
composition and terms of reference of SCOVAs are available in the Project Files). A condition of
disbursement of project funds to any State or Union Territory would be evidence acceptable to the
Bank of satisfactory transfer of funds under pervious projects or establishment of the SCOVA fund
flow mechanism.
5. Financial management. The project would be implemented by MOHFW, states and Union
Territories (UTs) and through registered societies. MOHFW would maintain an identifiable account
of project expenditure that will reflect its own expenditures and those incurred through states and
societies, by project components. The account would show amounts received by each agency and
expenditures against the same. For states/UTs and societies, the project director at state, district, city
and society level would be required to maintain an identifiable account ofproject expenditures,
clearly differentiating the Bank project funds from all other sources, and showing all inward and
expenditure transactions. Where the flow of funds to the project is through the state finance
department channel, the state would need to provide a separate budgetary grant for the project.
Where the flow of funds is via a registered SCOVA, the SCOVA will maintain separate accounts to
reflect project expenditure, clearly differentiating Bank funds from all other sources. In either case a
separate head of accounts classification, specific to the project, should be provided within the state
government or SCOVA accounts, respectively.
6. Each month field officers at district level, including Zilla Parishads where expenditures are
incurred through them, would use specially designedformats to submit reports to Project Directors,
by not later than tenth of the month following. The Project Director would consolidate the accounts
for the respective state on the basis of these reports, indicating both the monthly expenditures, and
the cumulative expenditure for the years up to the end of that month. Accounts of GOI and
states/UTs would be maintained in conformity with the accounting standards of the Comptroller and



Annex 6
Page 72
Auditor General of India. Registered Societies would maintain their accounts in conformity with the
requirements of the Registration of Societies Act.
7. Audit arrangements. Expenditures incurred by MOHFW and the states would be audited by
the CAG or his designated representative as in ongoing projects. The audit certificate for GOI would
be obtained by MOH4FW. At state level the FW Director (Project Director) would be responsible for
compiling and preparing disbursement applications, which will be passed through MOHFW/DEA to
the Bank. They would also be responsible for receiving expenditure reports from Drawing and
Disbursement Officers, the registered society and any other agency to which project funds have been
allocated. For any expenditures incurred through the registered society, the society would submit
compiled accounts to the Project Director for submission of disbursement applications.
8.  Each year the project director would be required to arrange for the accounts to be audited by
auditors acceptable to the Bank. In the case of Zilla Parishads, audits by the Examiner/Director of
the Local Fund Audit will be acceptable. Accounts of registered societies would be audited by
private auditors in accordance with Registration of Societies Act. The Project Director would
arrange for one consolidated audit report to be submitted to MOHFW within the stipulated period,
covering the project for the respective state as a whole. MOHFW would make a single submission of
its own and consolidate audit reports from all participating states within six months of the close of
the fiscal year.
9.  Experience with implementation of other projects. In the Health and Family Welfare sector,
there are 12 projects currently under implementation. Most of these have more than one participating
state and three are national projects covering the whole country. Including RCH, three more national
projects are currently being prepared. The accounting and auditing capacity varies across states. The
national projects have numerous (30 or more) implementing entities. This feature results in uneven
reporting compliance by participating entities, leading to delays in compliance. The recently
completed CSSM project (Cr. 2300-IN) had this problem, which in some cases was overcome by
exceptional arrangements like the use of private auditors. There is a risk that the RCH project would
experience similar problems.
10. One option that has been discussed is the use of private audit agencies acceptable to the Bank as a
supplement to the government auditing system, so that provisional audit certificates can be issued, and
disbursement expedited. It is unlikely private auditors would have access to state level documents which
show the advances from the center. Therefore, the provisional audit certificates issued by private
auditors would need to be ratified by the government auditor. However, even the use of private auditors
may not fully resolve the problem of timely audits where project accounts officers fail to submit
documentation punctually.

Institutional, Social and Technical Assessments
Introduction
1.  Several Economic and Sector Work studies (ESW) have provided the basis for development of the
RCH project. They are: (a) India: Towards a Reproductive Health Approach, June 1995; (b) India:
Issues in Women's Health, January 1996; and (c) India: Policy and Finance Strategies for Strengthening
Primary Health Care Services, May 1995. The first section of this Annex summarizes the linkages
between ESW and project design.
Linkage between ESW and Project Design
2.  Two fundamental issues affecting the sector have influenced project design: (a) inadequate slowing
of population growth despite a long established family planning program, and (b) major disparities
between different states and urban and rural areas in health and fertility, reflecting differences in socio-
economic status, level of political commitment and management capacity. Sector issues addressed by
the project are: (i) a heavy burden of disease among women and children for which highly cost-effective
interventions are available; (ii) high levels of unwanted fertility; (iii) underutilization of the existing
large infrastructure of public sector facilities and manpower while poor women and children continue to
have inadequate access to the services they need; (iv) program distortion caused by excessive focus on
method-specific contraceptive acceptor targets and use of financial incentives; (v) poor quality of care
associated with shortages of supplies, drugs and staff, particularly female staff, and improper behavior of
staff contributing to client dissatisfaction; (vi) inadequate funding, inflexible, poorly coordinated, top-
down management, and inadequate support for front line workers; and (vii) inadequate mobilization of
private and NGO resources. The chart below illustrates the linkage between the recommendations of
sector studies and project design.
Institutional Analysis
4.  Introduction. This section reviews critical issues related to: (a) the management of the Family
Welfare Program; (b) civil service rules that would impact on project implementation; (c) project
implementation capacity; (d) potential for NGOs and private sector; and (e) the relevance of the
institutional arrangements in the administrative and social context.
5.  Management of the Family Welfare Program. The issues addressed in this section are: (a)
management implications of the removal of contraceptive targets, (b) the changing role of MOHFW in
managing a centrally funded program within a context of progressive decentralization, (c) state capacity
for program and project implementation, (d) district capacity and the changes envisaged with greater
involvement of the Panchayat Raj system in program implementation, and (e) strategies to increase the
productivity of frontline workers.

6. Administrative structure. The Family Welfare Program in India is a 100% centrally funded program
implemented in all 32 states and Union Territories. The program activities are delivered in rural areas
through the primary health care system consisting of a network of sub-centers each with an outreach
female multi-purpose worker, primary health centers (PHCs) and community health centers (CHCs).
Managerial direction and supervision flow from the central MOHFW through State Family Welfare
Directorates which are part of the State Health and Family Welfare Departments, District Family
Welfare Bureaus, and Block-level PHCs. In urban areas, the infrastructure for delivering program
activities, as well as the administrative arrangements, are varied. In most cities where there are any
program activities, they are managed by Municipal Councils or their equivalent. The MOHFW provides
strong direction to the FWP, and managerial inputs provided at state, district and city levels vary
considerably between different states. District and sub-district hospitals that are envisaged to serve as
first referral facilities are state-funded and managed by the State Departments of Health and Family
Welfare. In some of these hospitals, there are post-partum units (PPUs) that are part of the 100%
centrally funded FWP, and the management of these PPUs is being integrated into the Obstetric units of
their hospitals.
7.  Removal of contraceptive targets - re-orienting management. The key management issue addressed
in the project is to implement the policy of removing the program distortion caused by the contrazeptive
targets system. Such a change requires the system to respond to client needs and concerns rather than
targets assigned from above. For this to happen, several factors are necessary: (a) continued political
commitment and support from national and state levels for replacing contraceptive- acceptor targets
with broader reproductive and child health RCH indicators; (b) strengthened capacity at district and
block levels for decentralized and participatory planning based on local data and client feedback, (c)
modified monitoring information (MIS) systems to monitor the RCH achievements; and (d) sensitization
and training of workers and managers in the FW system to focus on quality and client needs.
8.  Replacing targets. An initial experimentation period of releasing 1- 2 districts per state from the
contraceptive target system has been followed by the declaration in April 1996 to replace the
contraceptive target system nationwide with a "quality- and client-centered RCH approach."3 However,
there is widespread nervousness about the capacity to put in place alternatives that would improve and
not worsen system performance. The GOI reached agreement with all states and has issued a directive
that as of April 1, 1996, the Family Welfare program would no longer be monitored on the basis of
achievement of annual targets of acceptors of specific method of contrai,.eption. Also, the payment of
incentives to non-health personnel for recruitment of acceptors has been terminated. However, MOHFW
has agreed to state flexibility to enable a gradual transition from payment of individual incentives to a
system of "community awards" intended to increase community involvement.
9.  Decentralized planning. Based on the experience gained in several pilot projects funded by IHPP,4
ODA,s Ford Foundation, USAID and the Population Council, a Manual (the Target Free Approach
Manual) has been produced to provide guidance for sub-centers, PHCs, blocks, districts and states to
establish their own targets for meeting the RCH needs. As of April 1, 1996, all districts have been
instructed to implement this planning process, their resulting plans to be reviewed, approved and
monitored by the state FW departments. Based on the district plans, states would propose to MOHFW

Page 86
the expected annual program outputs and outcomes for the FWP in the state. MOHFW and the states
would monitor and report on progress in achieving such outputs and outcomes.
10. Improved coordination. At the central level, the MOHFW has responsibility both for central
vertical programs such as Child Survival, Safe Motherhood, and Family Planning, and for externally
funded projects that have built capacity to implement such programs in various states and districts.
Inadequate coordination between the vertical programs themselves and the externally funded projects has
resulted in competing demands in grassroot workers, wasteful duplication and a lack of synergy. The
project management arrangements for the RCH project at the Center, as well as at state levels, emphasize
coordination between externally funded projects, MCH and Family Planning as well as between vertical
programs themselves.
11. The role of MOHFW. The project provides a vehicle for change from the previous top-down
management culture to a more decentralized approach. Responsibility for coordinating the project and
ensuring that the various participating states are making expected progress towards the agreed levels and
quality of service will lie with the national MOHFW. States vary considerably in their current ability to
deliver services and in their capacity to improve and to manage large-scale projects. MOHFW would be
expected to identify what is reasonable to expect in the way of progress, and the processes by which
states will achieve such improvements. To sustain the innovations intended, MOHFW will need to
determine how it will intervene in those states and districts where population indicators do not improve
or even deteriorate. The project would strengthen the capacity of MOHFW for monitoring and
troubleshooting in states that have implementation problems. Several other external agencies, notably
ODA, UNFPA, UNICEF, USAID and the EC would also be supporting the strengthening of such
capacity in various states and in the Center.
12. State-level capacity. At the state level, FW Directorates would be strengthened under the project to
coordinate and monitor activities. In some states, previous projects in the sector have suffered because
of bottlenecks in theflow offunds through State Finance Departments, with consequent difficulties for
expenditure and implementation. In such states, RCH will attempt to obviate these problems by
channeling funds from MOHFW through SCOVAs which would now be registered societies. To
strengthen state level capacity, some procurement will be carried out through Procurement Service
Agencies (PSAs). Similarly for enhancing technical capacity, some training and IEC and other technical
services would be provided through specialized institutions such as NGOs, private sector and academic
institutions, or private hospitals that would provide referral services for RCH.
13. District capacity. It is intended that much of the operational implementation will be carried out by
the District Family Welfare Bureau or the new Panchayati Raj Institutions. In both, capacity for
decentralized planning would need to be strengthened. Various external agencies are expected to support
the project through developing management training programs complementary to its activities, and such
programs could include the monitoring and evaluation requirements. The Panchayati Raj institutions
represent a major shift in constitutional emphasis in India, with much more responsibility being given to
local assemblies at village (gram), taluk or mandal, and district (zilla) levels. However, these institutions
are still largely unfamiliar with many of the service management problems, and there are real risks that
national and state quality standards could be compromised, and there could be potential holdups where
state level functionaries must give approval before local proposals can be operationalized. Many local
rules and frameworks provide little scope for local discretion, e.g., rules concerning staff terms and
conditions of service, and it will take time before the introduction of Panchayat Raj institutions is
matched by updated regulations.



Annex 11
Page 87
14. Increasing productivity and access to front-line workers. The project would support a number of
measures designed to address this issue such as closer links with WCD, and the use of the Anganwadi
worker to extend the outreach capacity of the ANM; special schemes for NGOs and private sector to
deliver FW services; provision for contractual services of female medical officers for PHCs and nurse-
midwives to provide 24-hour service at PHCs in B category; and, ANMs to do private practice in C
category states.
15. Civil Service Rules. Decentralization of budgetary authority. One obstacle in project
implementation in several states is that project officers do not have sufficient authority and flexibility in
making financial management decisions. Although channeling of funds through SCOVAs is expected to
help overcome bottlenecks with cash flow, this will not completely resolve disbursement problems
unless adequate authority is given to allow officers more discretion to make decisions to resolve
problems as they arise. Although RCH attempts to address this problem, implementation is likely to vary
greatly between states. Another implementation issue is the inability of states to ensure that vacant HFW
posts are filled. A number of factors contribute: (a) failure to release funds and/or approve posts
because of cash flow and sustainability problems; (b) lack of sufficient incentives to attract staff to rural
areas; (c) local quota regulations restricting selection to certain groups or localities (e.g., Andhra
Pradesh's zonal rules); (d) poor human resource management systems; and (e) poor discipline resulting
in staff absenting themselves from the workplace. The RCH project proposes to address these problems
through (a) filling of posts through contract labor, and (b) eligibility criteria for sub-project proposals
which would include filling of at least 75 percent of ANM posts in the state and commitment to fill at
least a further 10 percent during the first two years of the project.
16. Project Administration Capacity. The project is to be implemented in all 32 states and Union
Territories. In order to facilitate full integration of the project with program activities, the project would
be managed by the core FW program staff at national and state levels rather than Project Implementation
Units. The project would strengthen the project management capacity at national, state and district levels
by financing Procurement Support Agencies, specialized technical institutions, and individual
consultants to assist in project monitoring. The distribution of project management responsibilities
between district FW Departments and Zilla Parishads will differ from state to state, being governed by
the extent to which each state has devolved authority and funds to the Panchayat Raj institutions. The
project would provide flexibility to integrate changing institutional relationships. Many states have
experience of previous World Bank projects such as the population projects, and there can also be
reasonable confidence that those states and MOHFW would have the capacity to implement the project
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. However, some states and UTs do not have such
experience and the MOHFW would be expected to indicate in their project implementation planning how
such states would be assisted.
17. During project preparation, a battery of technical guidelines and standards have been developed and
are being used. The technical standards and guidelines cover: (a) implementation of the modified
monitoring system and decentralized planing, (b) sub-project preparation and implementation, (c) civil
works including a design manual, (d) training, and (e) financial monitoring. Further guidelines are being
developed in technical areas of service delivery with input from WHO and UNICEF. It is also expected
that further input will be provided by UNFPA in preparing guidelines for training in interpersonal
counseling. An advisory panel set up by the MOHFW has been assisting states to prepare sub-projects of
acceptable quality. The project proposes to institutionalize this mechanism of an advisory panel to
provide continuous guidance during implementation.



Annex 1 1
Page 88
18. Audit arrangements. At state level the FW Director (Project Director) would be responsible for
compiling and preparing disbursement applications, which will be passed through MOHFW and the DEA
to the Bank. They would also be responsible for receiving expenditure reports from Drawing and
Disbursement Officers, the SCOVA, and any other agency to which project funds have been allocated.
For any expenditures incurred through the SCOVA, compiled accounts would be submitted to the Project
Director for submission of disbursement applications. The Project Director would be required to
maintain an identifiable account of project expenditures, clearly differentiating the Bank project funds
from all other sources, and showing all inward and expenditure transactions. A separate head of
accounts classification, specific to the project, would be provided within the state government or
SCOVA accounts respectively.
19. Each month, field officers at the district level, including Zilla Parishads where expenditures are
incurred through them, would use specially designedformats to submit reports to Project Directors by
not later than the tenth of the month following. The project director would consolidate the accounts for
the respective state on the basis of these reports, indicating both the monthly expenditures, and the
cumulative expenditure for the years up to the end of that month. Each year the project director would
be required to arrange for the accounts to be audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank. In the case of
Zilla Parishads, audits by the Examiner/Director of the Local Fund Audit will be acceptable. The Project
Director would arrange for one consolidated audit report to be submitted to MOHFW within the
stipulated period, covering the project for the respective state as a whole.
20. Two audit issues are likely to affect the project. First, the timely submission of audit certificates and
second, the quality of the audits. The project envisages a large number of implementing agencies
scattered throughout the country. There is a real risk that there will be considerable delays in obtaining
timely audit certificates from all project entities. One option that has been discussed is the use of private
audit agencies, acceptable to the Bank, as a supplement to the government auditing system, so that
provisional audit certificates can be issued and disbursement expedited. Such provisional audit
certificates issued by private auditors would need to be ratified by the government auditor. However,
even the use of private auditors may not fully resolve the problem of timely audits where project
accounts officers fail to submit documentation punctually.
21. Capacity for innovation. The "target free" strategy that underpins the project design is a major
innovation in itself. In addition, the project proposes a number of other innovative approaches: (a) the
use of procurement support agencies (PSAs), (b) the use of institutional consultants in the form of
"specialized institutions" to provide technical support, (c) individual consultants to enhance project
coordination and monitoring capacity, (d) the use of contract staff to fill va:ancies in health care
facilities, (e) registering SCOVAs for flow of funds, (f) the use of NGOs anu private providers to provide
specific services such as referral facilities and training support, (g) the use of Zilla Parishad structures for
project implementation, and (h) community managed referral funds. Operationalizing these innovations
would be the responsibility of state authorities. Within a prevailing management culture characterized
by inertia, such innovation would require a willingness of the bureaucracy at all levels to accommodate
innovation and deal with the risks involved, capacity of individuals at all levels to provide the leadership
and creativity required to cope with new situations, and the capacity of the Center to coordinate and
monitor the innovations country-wide. Such capacity is varied across states, and fluctuates in the Center.
It would be unrealistic to expect this five-year project to accomplish much more than initiating the
change process, and providing an umbrella within which innovative ideas can be introduced and tested.
22. Private sector and NGOs. Recent IDA sector work concluded that while some reproductive and
child health services may be provided by the private sector and PVOs, given the large section of the



Annex 11
Page 89
population under the poverty line and the special difficulties facing women in India, the public sector
would have to play a central role in financing these services. However, a systematic effort is being made
to increase the role of the NGO/community/private sector, in selected areas where they might have a
comparative advantage. The interventions that have been initiated during the project preparation process
include: (a) revision of the standardized MOHFW guidelines for NGO projects to be funded by GOI so
as to broaden their scope from family planning to reproductive and child health; (b) conversion of state
SCOVAs to registered societies to increase flexibility and provide built-in evaluation of projects at state
level; (c) revised guidelines for social marketing to enable support for state level social marketing
agencies; (d) contractual arrangements for utilizing staff and organizations from NGOs and the private
sector to enhance public sector capacity for service delivery; (e) contractual arrangements for utilizing
consultant services for IEC, training, monitoring and evaluation, and to provide social marketing; and (f\
emergency referral funds to be managed by the community.
23. Regarding sources of modern contraceptive methods, the public sector strongly dominates. There
are, however, significant variations by method. The public sector dominates sterilization (86-93
percent). Two thirds of IUD users are supplied through the public sector, one third of pill users and 15
percent of condoms. Differences also exist between states. Across the country as a whole, but most
particularly in the rural areas, the public sector remains dominant in the provision of RCH services,
although it is restricted in the quality of service provided and, hence, in the demand for services such as
institutional delivery.
Appropriateness of institutional arrangements in the social and administrative context.
24. The project fits into the existing Family Welfare structure and is therefore appropriate. However,
there are some concerns. First, planning, coordinating and monitoring a project spread across 32 states
and UTs represent a significant challenge. For the project implementation to be effective, the nature of
the relationship between the Center and different states would have to vary in accordance with the state
capacity for effective implementation. Examples would be situations created by the ongoing civil unrest
in Jammu and Kashmir, and acknowledged weak implementation capacity in certain states. The project
would enhance project management capacity at Center and state levels by providing consultancy support
and training, and would require regular detailed monitoring by the Center, as well as and the provision of
monitoring reports to the Bank. Second, the project is intended to focus on the needs of the poor and
disadvantaged which would require that within the overall framework of Family Welfare services,
special attention be given to scheduled tribes and castes, and to the urban poor. It is necessary to ensure
that detailed implementation strategies safeguard the interest of these groups whose need are frequently
subordinated to those of the better educated and more affluent. Third, the thrust of the project is directed
to promoting the health of women and providing services that are gender sensitive.
25. The project attempts to address these concerns through: (a) improved training, including a focus on
attitudinal change and gender sensitivity, (b) sub-projects under the LCE component, for which the
selection criteria include focus on tribal groups and urban poor, (c) special funds earmarked for
implementing strategies through the Tribal Welfare Departments at state level, (d) new monitoring
methodologies that include rapid community assessments, client feedback, and feedback from Zilla
Parishads which now have a mandatory 30 percent female membership, and (e) the use of Zilla Parishads
in project implementation thereby enhancing local ownership.
26. Donor community involvement. From its inception, this project has been planned as a
'framework' which would allow different donor agencies to contribute in ways which would utilize their
'competitive advantage' and maximize their impact through synergy. Considerable attention has been



Annex 1 1
Page 90
given, therefore, to ensuring that there is widespread support for the project design within the donor
community, and ensuring that other agencies' activities are likely to support the overall goals of the
project rather than compete for attention and resources at national and state levels. This should have the
further effect of ensuring that the project is more consistently monitored and implemented. Particular
support has been forthcoming from EC and ODA. The former are currently seeking to design a package
worth about $200 million for sector support. ODA, on the other hand, have indicated a desire to support
the aims of the RCH project, and, in particular, have indicated an interest in developing the management
training components, especially as they relate to decentralized planning and management, and further
analysis of the planning and management processes prevailing within the sector.
Social Assessment and Stakeholder Analysis
27. Characteristics of project beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries of this project are expected to
be women and children from disadvantaged groups in India for whom the project aims to reduce the
burden of disease and fertility. The 1991 Census and the 1992-93 National Family Health Survey
(NFHS) show that the scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) are particularly disadvantaged. In
several states, fertility rates among ST and SC are significantly higher than in the general population, and
the respective contraceptive prevalence rates are lower. Although there is some inter-state variation, in
almost every state, the percentage of illiterate married women among ST and SC exceeds that of the
general population. These groups have a lower median age at marriage, and in the isolated ST
communities, a mere 15 percent of women were able to report the legal age of marriage correctly. In the
four northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar where the age at marriage is
generally low, it is notably lower in tribal populations. Total Fertility Rate is highest among SC, as is
total wanted fertility rate. Compared with the general population, the percentage of illiterate married
women among ST and SC exceeds that of other groups, and is highest in the scheduled tribe population
which inhabits isolated pockets with low exposure to the media. The number of ST married women not
regularly exposed to the media is significantly higher than in other population groups, 70 percent vers'. s
43 percent.
28. Scheduled tribes. According to the 1991 Census, scheduled tribes constitute approximately 8
percent of the country's population. Seven of India's larger states account for more than 75 percent of
the tribal population. The Scheduled Tribal population as a proportion of the country's population is
largest in the northeastern states, notably Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, and the SC population is largest in
Jammu. The geographical dispersion of the more that 600 tribes in India has been a barrier to effo-tE to
improve conditions in health and welfare. The tendency of tribal populations to live in scattered
settlements or in very remote areas has resulted in restricted access to health service provisions. In
addition, many tribes are very mobile or have particular cultural characteristics that hamper service
demand.
29. Reproductive health needs. An analysis of the NFHS data from five states (Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu) that represent the five major regions of the country and
are illustrative of different levels of family planning and MCH program performance, showed a striking
similarity in the profile of non-acceptors of family planning:

30. A striking feature was that despite wide variation among the states in the proportion of women using
family planning, about half of the non users in each state reported that they wanted to use family
planning, indicating a high level of unmet need:
% currently married not using    % non-users reporting unmet
FP                             need
Madhya Pradesh                53%                             30%
Maharashtra                   37%                              18%
Orissa                        56%                              31%
Rajasthan                     61%                             32%
Tamil Nadu                    43%                             25%
31. Major factors associated with non-use and discontinuation of family planning appeared to be fear of
side-effects, poor knowledge of spacing methods, poor access to such methods, and opposition by family
members. Qualitative studies showed that excessive emphasis on method-specific contraceptive targets
led providers to focus on recruiting acceptors for female sterilization and more recently, IUDs,
neglecting to determine client needs or provide sufficient information and counseling on side effects and
how to deal with them. Furthermore, during the last three months of the year, all other program activities
slowed down so that workers could focus on meeting their quota of acceptors.
32. Poor utilization of services. The relatively low utilization of services by SC and ST groups is
illustrated in the following data from the NFHS:
Scheduled tribes    Scheduled       Others
castes
Infant mortality rate                90.2             107.3           82.2
Childhood immunization Pre-
natal coverage                    not available       47.7            66.0
Childbirth attended by medical or
paramedical staff                    18%           not available   not available
33. A review of 28 studies on quality of care funded by the Ford Foundation, USAID and the Population
Council showed that critical barriers to the use of available MCH services included poor quality of care
associated with shortages of drugs and supplies, non-availability of staff, particularly female staff,
rudeness of staff and lack of gender sensitivity, and lack of referral facilities. In addition, distance, lack
of transport and cultural norms were additional barriers in some regions. One beneficiary study
undertaken by GOI noted that inadequate hospital services in rural areas continue to persist, and bed per
population decreased from 0.41 per 1000 to 0.18 in tribal and rural areas.

34. A "Paradigm shift". The Government of India has recognized the constraints to further
improvement of reproductive and child health, particularly among disadvantaged groups, and has fully
associated itself with the findings and recommendations of the Bank's sector study, India: Toward a
Reproductive and Child Health Approach. Endorsing the recommendations of the ICPD Conference in
Cairo, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has articulated its strategy in a 1996 document entitled
"A Paradigm Shift" that summarizes its commitment to greater community involvement, the removal of
contraceptive targets and the introduction of decentralized planning, a focus on improving quality of
care, independent evaluation of quality and coverage, and expansion of the scope of the existing CSSM
and family planning programs into an integrated package of reproductive and child health services, and
state specific strategies for the introduction of the package of services.
35. Stakeholder Participation. While several studies have provided information from the primary
stakeholders, the project preparation process has involved a consultative process with an impressively
wide array of secondary stakeholders. This consultative process is viewed as particularly important
because of the fundamental attitudinal change among managers and providers at all levels that would be
required in implementing the "Paradigm Shift." Those who have actively contributed include: (a)
representatives of grass-root providers and NGOs involved in Family Welfare, (b) officials from various
vertical Family Welfare program, and from the Ministries of Women and Child Development and Rural
Development, (c) state government, district and block level officials, (d) the medical establishment, (e)
technical and research agencies, and (f) the many external agencies which support the program in India.
36. Project preparation has involved a very complex participatory consultative process. Attachment 1
provides an overview of the many stakeholders involved in the project and the mechanisms used for their
involvement. In order to give a flavor of the process, the following paragraphs describe two specific
participatory activities and their outcomes in greater depth.
37. The target free approach requires a fundamental re-thinking of the FW program. Initially the
approach was perceived as merely implementing an alternate package of indicators linked to quality were
to replace the old system of monitoring contraceptive acceptors. The target free approach was
implemented experimentally in selected states and districts in India. Simultaneously, a multi-stage
consultative process led to an in-depth examination of the issues related to implementation of the new
client centered approach, and it was realized that an almost revolutionary change in attitudes and
behavior would be required.
38. There was a general fear that the removal of numerical targets would lead to a decline in
performance. Experience in some pilot districts confirmed this concern. However, pilot programs in
Tamil Nadu achieved marked success.6 Further, the outstanding success of -3cial mobilization for the
national pulse polio campaign during which 87 million and, subsequently, 93 million children of ages 0-
6   Initially in 1991-92, Tamil Nadu abolished sterilization targets in two districts. By the end of the financial year
both districts had surpassed their sterilization targets. When the target free approach was extended to another
two districts, there was no decline in sterilization figures. In one year, one of the districts went on to have the
best sterilization performance in a decade. The target free approach was implemented in two stages
throughout Tamil Nadu: first, through abolishment of targets for revenue and rural development staff and,
second, through abolishment of targets for all health staff. The first step was ordered in 1994-95 with
remarkable results. The state met its targets in all types of contraception for the first time in thirty years. In
addition, it saved Rs. 3 crores in traveling allowance and motivator fees. The second stage of reforms was
instituted in 1995-96. As of September 1995, there had been no fall in sterilization figures. In addition,
acceptance of temporary methods of contraception had increased.



Annex 11
Page 93
3 throughout the country were given polio drops on two designated dates, gave the government a new
sense of confidence in its ability to mobilize efforts at the grassroots level. In light of the pulse polio
campaign, the effort required to spread the message of the client-centered approach appeared less
daunting, and it was decided to implement the target free approach nationwide as from April 1, 1996.
39. A GOI Committee on Quality Indicators reviewed experiences from states like Maharashtra, Tamil
Nadu, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh prior to developing an alternative monitoring system, participated in
field visits and had discussions with ANMs and LHVs. A consultative meeting of NGOs and women's
advocates reviewed the recommendations of a GOI task force and emphasized the critical role of ANM.
It was recognized that implementing the new approach required involving personnel at all levels of the
FW program, and developing new RCH training and IEC approaches. The target free approach is now
being integrated with the process of decentralization and involves all managers and service providers.
The features of the current approach are:
*  A new set of indicators, focusing on quality of care, client satisfaction and service coverage.
These indicators involve monitoring on three levels: (i) a monthly activity report by the ANM;
(ii) a technical assessment report by the supervising LTV; and (iii) client-based information
collected in annual rapid surveys by an independent agency. The client-based records evaluate
the quality of services and clients' health-seeking behavior and introduce an independently
monitored, client-centered approach in recordkeeping.
*  Sensitization training at all levels of management and service delivery of the FWP to change the
target-oriented culture. Sensitization workshops are currently in progress. Sensitization
workshops on reproductive health are also being conducted by the Population Council in West
Bengal, and involve NGO partners and other key constituencies such as training institutions,
obstetricians, gynecologists, and panchayats. A proposal to expand these workshops to all states
is currently being considered.
*  Integration of training into the project itself with the focus on building management capacity for
every category of worker. Training has started under GOI funds and will continue to be
enhanced as project funding becomes available.
40. NGO consultations. The NGO community, financially supported by GOI, the Bank and some other
external agencies, is managing a series of nine consultative meetings entitled "Health Watch Regional
Consultations" which focus on the perspective of the client. The consultations involve NGOs work in
the areas of health, women's advocates, women's empowerment, livelihood, thrift and credit, and
education; premier development, health, and population institutions; selected experts; officials of GOI
and state governments; and officials of donor agencies. These consultations enable NGOs to have direct
access to government officials and other key policymakers and, therefore, broaden their influence on
policy and program design and implementation. The consultations will consist of a national meeting,
seven or eight regional consultations to be organized by nodal NGOs, and one concluding meeting.
41. The first consultation has already provided useful feedback on the Target Free Manual prepared by
the MOHFW for use at the grassroot level. The on-going series is expected to provide more feedback by
articulating alternative strategies from the perspective of clients - especially that of poor women in rural
and urban areas. They will also examine mechanisms to weave a women's empowerment approach into
program design and management. The consultations enable NGOs to have direct access to government
officials and other key policymakers and, therefore, broaden their influence on policy and program
design and implementation.



Annex 11
Page 94
42. Strategies for remote populations, in particular, tribals. In the proposed project, several
proposed strategies are aimed at improving RCH services in remote areas, particularly those in which
there is a concentration of tribal population. It is envisaged that the State Tribal Welfare Departments
would be involved in the implementation of these strategies as follows:
(a) Expansion of the role of the traditional birth attendant (TBA) through training to cover all major
components of the RCH program. Given the importance of the TBA in tribal populations, the
potential benefit of an expanded role for her could be substantial.
(b) Contracting of unemployed female health workers (FHW) as private health providers to be
deployed in the area where they live in order to provide services such as ante-natal care,
immunization, conducting safe deliveries, and reporting cases of vaccine preventable diseases.
(c) Encouraging community-based RCH facilitators in order to supplement the FHW's IEC function
by training private individuals to disseminate information about RCH. In tribal communities
where the IEC context is markedly different from mainstream areas, the value of these
facilitators would lie in their extending the reach of IEC channels (since tribals are normally
outside the reach of mass media) and making the information relevant to local idiom, beliefs,
attitudes and practices. A pilot project in Andhra Pradesh is experimenting with training and use
community workers nominated by tribal villages to provide basic RCH services. Other states
will be encouraged to look for locally relevant strategies.
(d) Improving referral systems-a community-administered fund will be placed in the sub-center
and at PHC levels to enable patients in need to be quickly transferred to the referral unit.
(e) An important area of convergence between the Ministry of Rural Development and MOHFW's
programs would be the Clean Delivery Room (CDR) being constructed in every village. Given
that institutional deliveries are being encouraged and residence of the ANMs at sub-centers in
remote locations has been a problem, CDRs represent a new initiative aimed at increasing the
community's role in influencing the choice of where deliveries should occur. The CDR is also
where the TBA or FHW will conduct ante- and post-natal checkups, screen for RTI/STD and
insert IUDs. It is expected that CDRs should be particularly effective in tribal areas because the
design of the facility will acknowledge the cultural identity of the community being served, and
because of the involvement of the community.
43. Gender concerns. The RCH project builds on principles and strategies from the ICPD at Cairo and
the Women's Conference at Beijing, and gender issues are integrated into every aspect of the project
design.
44. Several aspects of RCH highlight its increased responsiveness to gender concerns:
i Quality of care: Gender issues have been integrated into the project as a key component of
improving quality of care. Quality of care in the project has several aspects. In addition to the
service delivery, informational, technical, and interpersonal aspects of quality of care, the FW
staff are responsible for social aspects that focus on gender issues. Staff of PHC and sub-centers
are required to examine several questions in evaluating quality of care of FW services:
* Are services gender sensitive?
* Are there male participation and responsible sexual behavior?
* Do women have a role in the program?



Annex 1 1
Page 95
Asking such questions helps service providers recognize the gender-specific needs of all of their
clients.
*  Women's involvement: RCH monitoring has been modified to include client feedback. Female
and male beneficiaries will be interviewed to assess quality of services and client satisfaction. In
response to concerns raised in Cairo and through meetings with NGOs and women's groups, the
questionnaires have been designed to examine issues such as women's perceptions and health
seeking behavior, the responsiveness of services to women's special needs (such as appropriate
clinic hours for working women) and 'invisible' women's health problems, such as RTIs.
Women's involvement in the project will also be expanded through working with the Panchayati
Raj structures. By amendment to the constitution, thirty percent of Panchayat members must be
women. Therefore, the Panchayats offer a ready-made opportunity to work in collaboration with
influential women at the community level. Female service providers will also improve the
project's responsiveness to women clients. The project will employ, on a contractual basis, the
services of female doctors.
*  Service content and delivery: The content of the Essential Package of RCH services has been
modified to include neglected concerns of women. RTIs have become a major focus of the
project. As a result, RTI services will not be confined to clinics for at-risk population and will
be more accessible to all women. Safe motherhood has been strengthened through consultations
with medical specialists regarding essential obstetric care services. The reproductive health
needs of adolescents have also received additional emphasis. Service delivery mechanisms have
been improved in response to women's needs. ANMs will be provided with 'safe' areas of
residence so that 24-hour midwifery services will be available in PHCs. Clean facilities will be
established in remote areas to improve accessibility of maternal health services.
*  Training: Managers and service providers at every level of the FW system will receive
sensitivity training on the target free approach. The training focuses on the client perspective
and emphasizes women's concerns. The sensitization workshops on reproductive health
concerns stress key cultural and social factors affecting the demographic and health outcomes of
women, men and their children. These workshops involve NGOs, training institutions,
obstetricians, gynecologists, and Panchayats in West Bengal and are planned to be expanded
throughout India.
*  Men's involvement: Male staff will be employed under the project to improve project
responsiveness to male-specific concerns and to increase the participation of men in reproductive
health. Male involvement will also be promoted through IEC strategies.
45. Studies. The plans to decentralize program planning require capacity building, particularly at the
grassroots level. As the new planning process is aimed at working from the bottom-up approach, a
critical stage will be conducting a beneficiary assessment to gather information about the needs of the
clients in the target area. This is to increase the emphasis on client orientation and community
involvement in monitoring, resulting in an opportunity to make RCH more responsive and accountable to
its primary stakeholders - its project beneficiaries. To support this initiative, RCH is supporting a study
of current experience with the use of Panchayat Raj structures to plan and implement Family Welfare
activities to identify approaches in training and communications that can be used to strengthen the
capacity of these institutions to participate in the decentralized planning process envisioned for the RCH
project. The study will include an analysis of the current and possible future roles of the Panchayat in
increasing utilization of services, community involvement in service delivery, and the availability and



Annex I 1
Page 96
quality of services. In addition, Panchayat involvement in monitoring staff attendance, availability of
drugs and vaccines, and availability of transport will be explored. An assessment of the knowledge and
attitudes of Panchayat members with regard to their future role as facilitators will be included in the
study as well.
Technical Assessment
46. Population and Fertility. India has made substantial progress in lowering its fertility rate, which
has been the main factor in the high rate of population growth. India is currently two thirds of the way
through the transition to a replacement-level fertility rate of 2. 1, which it hopes to achieve by the tum of
the century. Looking ahead, three factors will influence future population growth in India: (a) unwanted
fertility, i.e., births to women who say they want to space or not have additional children, but who are not
using a method of fertility regulation; (b) desired family size; and (c) demographic momentum, which is
the effect of age composition relative to high fertility in the past, and the cause of continued population
growth even after replacement fertility is achieved.
47. Data from the NFHS show that unwanted fertility accounts for about half of the difference between
India's current fertility rate (3.4) and the replacement-level rate of 2.1 births. Unwanted fertility occurs
in all states, ranging from 1 in 10 births in Andhra Pradesh to 1 in 3 births in Uttar Pradesh. Preliminary
analysis of the underlying causes of unwanted fertility reveal a wide range of factors, including health
concerns, distrust of service providers, and opposition by husbands and other family members. Many of
these factors could be addressed by improved access and service quality, better information and choice of
methods, and by increased focus on client needs and male involvement. Most people are aware of
methods and their availability, but again, there is substantial variability between and within states, so that
strategies need to be tailored to local conditions.
48. Even if unwanted fertility could be eliminated (or substantially reduced), India still faces a
substantial population increase resulting from high desired family size and momentum. These factors
need to be addressed through broad social policy and investments in human development, including
girls' education, creation of economic opportunities for women, and increased child survival. In the case
of demographic momentum, girls' education is of special importance because it is the main variable
affecting the age of marriage and initiation of childbearing, in addition to the effect that it has on desired
family size. One of the main breakthroughs in India's new population policy framework is its
recognition of the need to focus family planning effort on meeting client needs, while addressing
population growth through a range of social policy initiatives, including education, women's status, as
well as health and family welfare.
49. The project would implement the recommendations of the International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD), 1994, and appropriately focuses on the reduction of unwanted fertility which
accounts for about half of the difference between India's current fertility rate and the replacement level
of 2.1 births. Through the re-oriented focus of the FWP, as described in the Institutional Assessment,
and the implementation of the Essential Package of Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) services, as
described later in this section, the project would assist the Government of India to address underlying
causes of unwanted fertility including health concerns, distrust of providers and opposition by husbands
and family members. Improved access and service quality, better information and choice of methods,
increased focus on client needs and male involvement are among the factors addressed by the project.
50. Addressing the burden of disease of women and children. The Project would progressively
upgrade the existing configuration of Family Planning and Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM)



Annex 11
Page 97
services to the Essential Package of Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) services. The services to be
provided at different levels in the primary care system are described in Attachment 2. The RCH package
of services addresses conditions that are responsible for a heavy burden of disease in India and consists
of interventions recommended in the 1993 WDR as highly cost effective. Several of the interventions
were initiated under the recently completed CSSM project, and it is recognized that implementation of
the child survival interventions have been generally more effective than the Safe Motherhood
interventions, and there are significant variation between states and districts within states. The technical
challenge of the project is to improve implementation of the interventions in situations of varied
institutional capacity and epidemiological conditions, within costs that are affordable and sustainable.
Further, two new interventions, namely management of rcproductive tract infections and adolescent
r_.productive health would be introduced. The following paragraphs provide details on how the services
would be provided.
51. The child survival component will be maintained by ensuring adequate and timely supply of drugs
and vaccines to front-line workers. strenlgthened by improving the referral system and case management
of childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness at PHCs, referral facilities, and the private sector, and
upgrading the capacity for cold-chain maintenance. The safe motherhood component will move towards
providing essential obstetric care (EOC). See Attachment 3 for a brief description of EOC. States have
been categorized as "A, B, and C" in accordance with health and developmental status and the essential
package of RCH services would have a differential implementation focus in each category. (Attachment
4 provides details on the categorization of states). Every state would provide all components of EOC, in
particular, information and counseling, community mobilization, pre-natal care and defined referral
procedures, community transportation for emergency referrals, and client-oriented gender-sensitive first-
referral facilities. Existing services for childbirth and referral would be upgraded and strengthened with
a differential focus adapted to the needs and capacity of states in the different categories. In each state
the focus would be on upgrading the weaker districts and blocks to at least the average level achieved by
the state.
52. Recognizing the existing cultural and physical access barriers that contribute to a very high
occurrence of childbirth at home attended by untrained helpers in C category states, the focus of
additional investments in C category states would be to ensure that every childbirth is attended by a
person with midwifery skills, and that delivery takes place in clean surroundings. For this purpose,
clinical midwifery skills of auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) would be upgraded, currently unemployed
ANMs would be provided initial short-term support to establish private midwifery practices in
underserved villages, and a "clean delivery" room to be managed and maintained by the community
would be constructed under the Minimum Needs Program (MNP) in the more inaccessible villages. In ED
category states, where there is an increasing trend towards institutional delivery, the focus of additional
investments would be to make institutional delivery more accessible and acceptable to rural and urban
poor women by re-activating existing PHCs (1 per 30,000 population) and urban Post-Partum Centers
(PPCs) to provide good quality care for childbirth. For this purpose, midwifery skills would be
upgraded, 24-hour midwifery services provided at PHCs, field areas of PPCs re-orientated to focus on
urban poor communities, and links between PHCs and FRUs strengthened. In A categorv states, more
than 50% of deliveries are already institutional, and the focus of additional investments would be to
make first-referral care more accessible and effective. Systematic programs of quality assurance of
clinical care with audits of maternal deaths would be introduced.
53. Improved quality and increased client choice in contraceptives would be provided by improving
staff skills in clinical and counseling services, particularly for spacing methods, increased focus on male
involvement and use of male methods, systematic monitoring of quality of clinical and counseling



Annex 11
Page 98
services especially for sterilization and IUDs. To further encourage condom use, Government multi-
purpose workers would be permitted to sell condoms and retain the profits. Access to safe abortion
would be improved by liberalizing the prerequisites for certification of facilities, increasing the
availability of equipment and drugs, and clinical and counseling training and gender sensitization for
providers in certified facilities.
54. Management of reproductive tract infections (RTI). There is limited international and national
experience in implementing the RTI interventions in developing country situations. Regional and state
differentials in political commitment, cultural barriers to access, infrastructure and resource availability,
and institutional capacity provide further implementation challenges. Therefore, introduction of RTI
management into the FWP would be gradual and allow for progressive sharing of lessons learned.
Initially, the focus would be on information and counseling to raise awareness of RTIs and information
on public and private sector facilities that could provide appropriate management. In A category states
that have a known high prevalence of RTIs, investments would be made for increasing capacity of health
facilities to manage RTIs. Also, in four B category states, capacity for RTI management would be
strengthened through the IDA-supported State Health Systems projects.
55. Clinical, counseling and referral services proposed to be provided at community, sub-center,
primary health center and first referral levels have been reviewed and found to be appropriate from
clinical, social and gender perspectives. Further work is on-going with technical assistance from WHO
and UNICEF to review the existing clinical guidelines and to develop additional clinical guidelines,
particularly for referrals and for clinical management at first referral-units. Simultaneously, training
materials will be reviewed and progressively upgraded, both in terms of clinical content as well as in
terms of information to be provided during counseling of clients. Based on the identified services, lists
of medical equipment. drugs and supplies that would be funded under the project have been constructed
(Kits A - P as given in the Project file). Many of the items were also provided to some districts in the
recently completed CSSM project, and all items have been technically reviewed and approved with
assistance from UNICEF and WHO during project preparation. (Further detailed technical assessments
of particular aspects are provided in separate papers listed in the Annex 8 of the Project Appraisal
Document).
56. Strengthening of referral services. The recently completed CSSM project developed criteria for
the establishment of first referral units, financed medical equipment for 4-6 per district in the weaker
states, and developed guidelines for clinical skill training of staff in the FRUs. In some states, other
projects financed by the Bank (Population 6, 7 and 9, and the State Health Systems projects) have
financed civil works and other equipment for upgrading the FRUs. The RCH project will build upon
such inputs by (a) IEC and community mobilization in support of referrals, (b) establishing referral funds
for emergencies, (c) training in clinical skills, counseling and gender sensitivity for staff at various levels
in the system, (d) filling essential skill gaps (such as anesthetists at FRUs and female medical officers at
PHCs) by financing part-time services from the private sector or NGOs, and (e) ensuring continuity of
supply of drugs for EOC. The Bank-financed State Health Systems are also establishing referral systems
in several states. The implementation of the RCH project will be closely coordinated with those projects.
The outreach activities of the FWP are expected to benefit from the closer coordination that is expected
to develop between the Health and Family Welfare Programs in those states, and the resulting support for
outreach activities from hospitals. It is also envisaged that further essential facility renovations for FRUs
would be financed not only through the project but also through funds from the Ministry of Rural
Development.



Annex I 1
Page 99
57. Training. Previous and other on-going Bank projects have established training systems with wide
networks of training institutions in most states. Recognizing the problems arising from multiple
uncoordinated training initiatives funded through the various donors who support the FWP, MOHFW has
defined a coordinated in-service training strategy with technical inputs from WHO and SEARO. The
strategy would address recognized weaknesses, particularly in clinical skills, interpersonal counseling
skills and gender sensitivity and provide technical guidelines and standards for training. Districts and
states would use the training strategy to prepare annual implementation plans. Details are provided in
the MOHFW's Training Guidelines (summarized in Attachment 5). Recognizing that many states and
districts do not have the capacity to adapt the strategy to local training needs and implement high quality
well-focused training, the project will finance specialized institutions to provide consultant assistance in
assessing training needs, adapting curricula, training trainers, and supporting on-going evaluation of
training.
58. Information, Education and Communication. There is a recognized capacity in the country for
widespread information dissemination as evidenced by the almost universal knowledge of contraception
among Indian women (NFHS, 1993). Also, MOHFW has demonstrated its considerable capacity for
social mobilization and use of NGO networks for activities implemented in a campaign mode, as
illustrated by the National Immunization Day of Pulse Polio Immunization where coverage rates of over
95% were reported by evaluation surveys. This is also the case with the "sterilization camps" that are
highly utilized in most states.
59. The challenge now is for IEC to move from aiming at knowledge dissemination to promoting
behavior change, and to develop capacity not merely for the campaign mode of activity, but to integrate
good quality IEC as an integral part of local action plans for RCH. GOI has recognized the need to
strengthen IEC capacity, and is strengthening the Health Education Bureaus at state level to provide
leadership and the basic infrastructure needed for such development.
60. Recognizing the varied audiences for whom RCH related IEC would be needed, capacity needs to
be developed to do audience segmentation research, and to develop and implement relevant IEC
strategies. There is considerable information on existing information gaps related to contraception, safe
motherhood and essential obstetric care, and RTI/STD. The project would support two approaches for
the development and implementation of IEC. First, recognizing that the outreach workers (multi-purpose
female and male workers, traditional birth attendants, and Anganwadi workers) would be crucial in
reaching out to the disadvantaged groups who have limited access to mass media, and also be critical in
providing the in-depth counseling needed to promote behavior change, the project would support training
in counseling. It is expected that other agencies such as UNFPA would provide technical support to
improve the quality of such training. Also training for IEC staff at District and Block level would aim at
improving the quality of IEC planning and implementation. Second, the project would finance
consultant technical inputs for audience research, media development and support.
61. Civil works to be funded under the project consists of refurbishment of existing sub-centers,
primary health centers (PHCs) and hospitals that have been identified as FRUs (4-6 per districts) through
provision, where necessary, of water supply and electricity, the addition of operating theaters and
delivery rooms, and residential accommodation for nurses to enable 24-hour maternity service. To

Safe Motherhood
What Is EOC?
I. Readers may have become confused by the variations in terminology around 'essential' and
'emergency' obstetric care. Sometimes the two terms appear to mean the same thing and sometimes
something different.
2. At a recent meeting of the Inter-Agency Groups (IAG) for the Safe Motherhood Initiative, this issue
was discussed and clarified. The meeting brought together the original co-sponsors of the Initiative -
UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, The World Bank, WHO, the Population Council and the International
Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) along with the country participants involved in safe motherhood
programs, researchers and scientists.
3. Participants agreed that "essential" obstetric care should be taken to mean management of obstetric
complications, that is:
-  surgical obstetrics (cesarean delivery, treatment of sepsis, repair of high vaginal and cervical
tears, laparotomy, removal of ectopic pregnancy, evacuation of the uterus, intravenous oxytocin,
amniotomy, craniotomy, symphsiotomy);
-  medical treatment of (sepsis, shock, eclampsia, anemia)
-  anaesthesia;
-  blood replacement;
-  manual procedures (removal of placenta, labor monitoring including partogarphy, repair of
episiotomies and perineal tears, vacuum extraction, partography);
-  management of women at high risk (intensified prenatal care); and
-  family planning methods such as sterilization, IUD insertion and removal, and Norplant insertion
and removal.
-  neonatal special care (resuscitation, etc.)
4. Not every case requiring essential obstetric care will be an emergency. Essential obstetric care will
be needed for cases classified as high risk, either because of factors present at the beginning of the
pregnancy (previous cesarean delivery for example) or for those arising in the course of a pregnancy or
labor (obstructed labor, pre-eclampsia). Interventions such as the management of hypertensive disorders
and severe anemia, or elective cesarean delivery, can be planned for in advance. Other conditions, such
as retained placenta, shock, and postpartum hemorrhage, are obstetric emergencies that cannot be
planned for. Thus, essential obstetric care incorporates, but is not reducible to, emergency obstetric care.
5. Because of the confusion in terminology which has arisen, it was agreed that in general the term
'essential' obstetric care should be used to describe all the interventions needed to manage obstetric
complications, some of which - but not all - will be emergencies. The term "basic maternity care"



Annex 1 1
Page 109
should be used to describe the interventions needed for the management of normal pregnancies and
deliveries.
6. All pregnant women should receive basic maternity care. Essential obstetric care will only be
needed for the minority of women who have difficult or problem pregnancies or who develop
complications.
7. As a whole, all the procedures needed to manage obstetric complications should be available at that
first referral level - the district hospital. However, many can and should be performed at lower levels of
the health care system in health centers. These places are concerned primarily with ambulatory patients,
capable of providing preventive and curative services more advanced that those which can be provided as
part of community health action, but less are sophisticated than those which require the technical
capacity and facilities available only in hospitals.

Summary of Training Strategy
Integrated approach. Recognizing that the current method of conducting ad hoc training under the
different components of Family Welfare is neither cost effective nor effective in producing the desired
behavior and attitudinal change in service providers, MOHFW developed a strategy for an integrated
training approach for Family Welfare interventions. The strategy has been discussed and accepted by all
states. Each district is expected to develop a training plan to implement the strategy, which is summarized
below.
Minimum package. The strategy defines a minimum package o) core training for all categories of
workers, based on the relevant competencies expected for delivering the defined package of RCH services
at the levels of the community, sub-center, primary health center and first referral units. Recognizing that
considerable training in several aspects of the RCH services have been implemented under various
programs during the past decade, the minimum package focuses on identified areas of weakness in each
element of RCH services, in particular clinical and counseling skills. Table A outlines some of the critical
elements recommended for designing the district level training for each category of worker. For the
clinical skill components, proficiency standards are recommended for critical clinical procedures. Using
the recommended outline, the strategy provides flexibility for (a) adding segments and topics, (b)
determining priorities for topics and modules, and (c) splitting the total duration of training into blocks, to
meet local needs. The total estimated training load in each state is given in the Project Implementation
Plan.
Special training needs. In addition to the minimum core package, special training needs have been
identified for (a) senior managers, (b) IEC personnel, (c) midwifery training for nurses, (d) training of all
staff in monitoring quality of care (observing skills and practices, facility check list and community
opinion surveys). Further, the training strategy requires implementation of systematic continuing education
for which an additional day is recommended to be added to the district monthly meetings and a program of
topics is suggested.
