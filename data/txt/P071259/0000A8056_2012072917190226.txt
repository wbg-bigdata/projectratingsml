                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Zambia Water Sector Performance Improvement Project (WSPIP) is proceeding in a less than satisfactory manner. About 56% of the overall funds have
                         been disbursed with 12 months from closing date. However, if the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company improve performance over the next 3 months, the Project could close on
                         time, with all funds disbursed.
