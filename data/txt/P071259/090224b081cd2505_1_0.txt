                         The implementation of the Zambia Water Sector Performance Improvement Project (WSPIP) is proceeding in a moderately satisfactory manner. About 69% of the overall funds have
                         been disbursed with 1 months from closing date. An Implementation Completion Report will be publicly available to fully capture the implementation experience and lessons from the
                         project in December 2013. Preliminary results show a significant impact on water and sanitation services in Lusaka Province and on the financial viability of LWSC. At the time of
