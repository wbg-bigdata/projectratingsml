                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Zambia Water Sector Performance Improvement Project (WSPIP) is proceeding in a moderately satisfactory manner. About 62% of the overall funds have
                         been disbursed with 7 months from closing date. However, if the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company improve performance over the coming months, the Project should close on
                         time, with all funds disbursed.
