                         According to successive epidemiological surveillance surveys the HIV epidemic in Mozambique appears to be stabilizing. Over the past 5 years, the Government has made
                         considerable progress in two critical areas: (i) rolling out anti retroviral treatment (ART); and (ii) strengthening prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT). As of April 30,
                         2011, nearly 234,000 AIDS patients were on ART or roughly 47% of HIV+ individuals who need ART. Over 900 health facilities in Mozambique are providing PMTCT services to

                         The 2009 data from the national serological and behavioral survey appear to indicate that, over the past 5-6 years, the proportion of people aged 15-24 who had sex with a non-
                         regular and non-cohabiting partner and those who had sex before the age of 15 decreased. Likewise, condom use for 15-24 year olds during the last time they had sex with a non-
                         regular partner increased. Further analysis of these data will need to be done to assess the magnitude of these changes.
