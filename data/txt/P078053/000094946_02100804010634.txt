EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
The proposed project is a part of the Multi Sectoral Project to fight against HIV/SIDA in Mozambique and
the development objective will be to reduce HIV/SIDA prevalence and its impacts on persons infected or
affected by HIV/SIDA. In this frame, the handling, the collection, the evacuation and the management of
wastes affected by the HI V/AIDS constitute the most important environmental question of this program.
In relation to this, the objective of this present study is to identify the level of health Care Waste
Management that will be relevant to help implement and enforce proper health and environmentally
sound, technically feasible, economically viable, and socially acceptable systems for management of
health care waste in Mozambique.
PRESENTATION OF REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
The republic of Mozambique is located at the sub-eastern of African Continent. Tanzania borders it at the
North; Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland at the West; South Africa at the South and Indian
Ocean at the East. There are 799,380 km2 of national territory including inland bodies of water. The
country is relatively flat particularly in the coastal regions. Mozambique's population is approximately 17,
600,000 and the natural growth rate is 2.4%. Administratively, the country is divided into 10 provinces
and Maputo City, the national capital, which has the status of a province.
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
The Mozambican National Health Service comprises the public sector, the private profit-making sector
and the private non-profit-making sector. It is organized into four levels: level I and 2 are the most
peripheral, implementing the Primary Health Care strategy and receiving referrals for clinical conditions
which cannot be treated at level 2; level 3 and 4 are fundamentally designed for more specialized curative
care, and can receive referrals from the low levels. The health facilities network include 4 Central
Hospitals, 12 Provincial or General Hospitals, 25 Rural Hospitals, 276 Health Centres and 736 Health
Posts. In 2000, health human resources is as follows: 583 Higher, 1 489 Medium, 4635 Basic, 1679
Elementary, 5 030 Auxiliary and 1 510 other agents.
HEALTH CARE WASTES (HCW)
The quantity of HCW was estimated 2 214 kg/day. The composition is as follows: syringes, needles;
empty bottles; plastic objects (gloves, blood pockets, urine pots, tubes etc...); cotton, compresses, empty
bags ; other wastes (plaster, human organs, etc...).; and liquids waste.
HEALTH CARE WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT
Institutional and legislative aspects
There is no specific policy, laws and technical regulation on HCW management. However, a proposed law
on medical waste management is being to be approved and should be improved by specific technical
guidelines.
Actors mainly involved in the HCW management
Many categories of actors are involved in HCWM
-  Technical services of the State (Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Environment): their
responsibility is to set on foot an environmental and healthcare policy; they generally have at their
disposal competent human resources in health and environment issues, and master the management
techniques, but they have no important and specific actions about HCWM in health facilities, and they
action are a bit limited because of lack of material and financial means;
- Health facilities : they are the main HCW generators, but health staff has little concern for the daily
management of the HCW, which is seen a second priority besides medical emergencies;



2
- Local collectivities: they are responsible for household littering management but their landfills
disposal often receive HCW which constitute infection sources for scavengers and children;
- Private sector: intervenes in household littering collection in some institutions, and even some
healtihcare facilities; but is not yet motivated enough to get involved in HCW management;
- NGO and Community Based Organizations: most of them intervene in environmental and health field,
and have a great experience in population awareness, mainly about HIV/AIDS; they could support the
project in these issues;
- Donors : most of them intervene in the field of health. Even if all of them recognize the importance
and the interest linked with HCW, and the necessity to lead actions in this way; very few of them have
specific programs for HCW.
HCW management in health facilities: segregation, collection, transportation and treatment
Many constraints are noticed in HCWM in health facilities, among them : the HCW mingling with
household littering; the lack of efficient HCW segregation; the healing staff carelessness and the training
lack about HCWM; and the helpers of nurses, lack qualification; the lack of security equipment for
cleaners and waste collectors; the lack of pre collection, collection and storage dustbins; the lack of
efficient treatment system in general (90% of the hospitals dispose their wastes inside the hospital, 7%
transport their wastes in a municipal landfill and 15% use incineration). The lack of waste segregation is
certainly the main constraint and it is necessary to built the HCWM strategy on this principle in order to
reduce strongly the volume of infectious wastes to be collected and treated.
KNOWLEDGE, BEHAVIOR AND PRACTICES IN HCWM
The actors directly exposed to infection risks of HCWM are : health establishments staff (medical staff,
paramedical, help-nurses, the cleaners); collectors staff; scavengers; population using recycled objects or
living near landfills disposals. Medical and paramedical staff has fairly acceptable knowledge about
HCWM. But it is even worse with help-nurses and cleaners, who are in daily contact with the HCW, and
whose knowledge and education level are generally weak. The same is noticed in private and municipal
collectors, scavengers, and mostly, street children playing on disposal sites.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACT
Impacts on the staff
The persons mainly exposed in the process of HCWM are : the medical and paramedical staff; the helps
and others cleaners, charged of wastes collection or incineration in the health facilities, etc.; the wastes
collection agents of private societies; the informal scavengers and populations in general, living by the
side of the landfills (mainly the children) or using recycled objects from wastes. The risk linked with bad
HCWM are: risks of accident for health staffs, children and scavengers; serious intoxication and
infections, such as HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis.
Impacts on biophysical environment
The most negative practices for the environment concerns the HCW treatment methods: landfill disposals,
burial, burning at open air and craft incineration. Globally, the waste potential impacts on biophysical
environment are : esthetical pollution, air pollution and unease during waste open air burning; waters
pollution. So, for incinerator installation, it is better to choose, inside the health facilities, places distant
from the admission rooms and health care rooms; concerning the noise and harms in operation, it is better
to start incineration by night, to reduce harm caused by smokes. In addition, the promotion of the use of
non-chlorine plastic containers is a recognized means of reducing the pollutant products from solid waste
incineration. In this way, they should be recommended as dustbins for waste collection. As for the large
central disposal sites, wire fencing and lock could be realized to reinforce security and to minimize the
access of scavengers and children.

Social and cultural impacts
The execution of the HCWM Plan might have negative social impacts on scavengers earning their daily
living at landfills, mainly when segregation is done at the source. It is possible, through partnership with
health centres, to give non-infectious reusable objects (such as empty bottles) directly to scavengers, or at
least authorize them to come and collect them according to well-defined modalities. There are cultural
issues relating to disposal of anatomical wastes (amputated body parts, placenta, etc.), about which
communities may be strongly sensitive. These cultural aspects should be taken into account in the action
plan, to better ensure the populations involvement in the implementation.
ASSESSMENT AND CHOICE OF HCW TREAMENT SYSTEMS
Solid HCW treatment systems
The technological choices should be done according to the following criteria: technical efficiency;
environmental viability; easiness and simplicity in settling and operating; availability of exchange parts;
investments and operation costs; social acceptability. The main systems analyzed are: Autoclave,
Microwave irradiation, Pyrolyse, Pyrolitic incinerator (modern incinerator), craft incinerator made in local
materials, Chemical disinfection, burial in municipal landfills, Burial in the premises of health centres,
Open air burning, encapsulation. The comparative analysis, based on the above mentioned economic and
technical criteria, allows the recommendation of: modern incinerators in Central, general and provincial
hospital, because of its fairly low cost; craft incinerators in rural hospital, health centres and health posts,
because of its very low cost and small quantities of HCW produced in these facilities.
However, inadequate incineration, or incineration of non-incinerable (halogenated plastic,
radioactive waste, reactive chemical waste, silver salts or radiographic waste, mercury or cadmium, heavy
metals, etc.) waste can release pollutants into the air and causes diseases. That is why waste incineration is
fundamentally based on segregation at source, to reduce maximally the infectious wastes and prevent the
contamination of other wastes (papers, plastic objects, etc.).
Whenever incinerators become an increasingly difficult option to use, the following treatment
systems should be proposed : Chemical disinfection, which gives a highly efficient disinfection, but
requires highly qualified technicians for operating and it is inadequate for pharmaceutical, chemical and
some types of infectious waste; Disposal at municipal landfills: In case hazardous health-care waste
cannot be treated or disposed elsewhere, direct burying in the municipal landfill should be recommended.
It is a temporary solution before more suitable treatment methods are found; Burying inside hospital
premises: In health centres where the FICW production is rather little, a ditch should be dug. Anyway, in
all cases, the principle of waste segregation at their sources of production must be seriously respected, to
minimize the contamination of general wastes by the infectious ones.
The other systems (autoclave, microwaves, etc.) are too expensive and need highly qualified staff
to handle them, though they are more secure for the environment. In case of malfunction, the exchange
parts are not always available locally. So, these types of technologies should not be recommended in
Mozambique, given the present economic situation.
Liquid HCW treatment system
As for the liquid wastes, there are many treatment systems among which: physic and chemical treatment;
intensive biological systems (activated mud system; biological disk; bacterial field, etc.); septic pits;
disinfection; decanting and digesting basin; lagooning, etc. Disinfection is clearly the most efficient way
to deal with liquid infectious wastes. That is why this option should be favored among the other
interventions, because the HCWM plan is focused especially on HIV/AIDS related waste management.
Consequently, a combined system (disinfection then storage in septic pits) is recommended for the
provincial hospitals, district hospitals and health centres, which don't produce much liquid waste. For the
central and general hospitals, a physic and chemical treatment, comprising a disinfection system, is
recommended. The implementation of this option requires a feasibility study.
PRAVATES INVOLVEMENT AND FUNDING

To allow the HCWM market to be attractive enough to interest private collection societies, there should be
safe guaranteed payment of the collecting service. In fact, if it is not matter with health private cabinets in
general, it is not the same with public health establishments, the budget of which are somewhat limited. To
ensure the HCWM sustainability, it is necessary to provide, toward this activity, sufficient financial
resources to health facilities.

HCWM PLAN
The HCWM Plan will focus the positive actions, which, in the long term, will allow a change of behavior,
a sustainable HCW management, and a protection of actors against risks of infection. In this line, the
strategy of intervention should axed oni the following ineasures: lead training activities for actors
concerned (health staff, HCW  handlers, municipal collectors of wastes, managers of publics landfills,
etc.); lead information and education campaigns for populations about HCW; reinforce the institutional
and technical capacities and better the existing regulations; support initiatives of partnership between
public, privates and civil society .in HCWM.
These actions should be accompanied by complementary measures, mainly initiated by governmental
programs, in terms of HCWM      bettering in healthi facilities (segregation and collection materials;
protection equipments; systems of treatment).

INTRODUCTION
1. BACKGROUND
The Mozambique HIV/AIDS Response project will support the goal of the national HIV/AIDS strategy
of the Government of Mozambique, which is to reduce the spread of HIV infection in the country. As a
means of achieving this goal, the project will also support the following areas : (i) mitigation of the
health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels thus
sustaining an economically productive population and; (ii) build strong and sustainable national
capacity to respond to the epidemic. The handling, collection, disposal and management of HIV/AIDS
infected materials are the most significant environmental issue in this project. A Medical Waste
Management Plan, which will be appropriately costed with clear institutional arrangements for its
execution, will be prepared during project preparation. Inappropriate handling of HIV/AIDS infected
materials constitute a risk not only for the staff in hospitals and other health care centers, but also for
families and street children who scavenge on dump sites. Some aspects of project implementation
(HIV/AIDS voluntary counseling and testing clinics, purchase of equipment by communities for home
care of people living with HIV/AIDS, promotion of the use of condoms) could potentially constitute an
increase in the environmental and health risk associated with handling of HIV/AIDS infected waste.
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project will have the following components: (i) Capacity Building; (ii) Public Sector Initiatives with
the two sub-components of a) National Initiatives and b) Municipality Initiatives; (iii) Civil Society and
Private Sector Initiatives; and (iv) Project Coordination. The Capacity building component will support
capacity building for both the public sector and the civil society/private sector initiatives. The public
sector initiative component will support the HIV/AIDS activities of line ministries and municipalities
while the civil society /private sector initiatives component will support the activities of civil society
organizations and the private sector. The project coordination component will support the functions of the
National Committee to combat AIDS and its Secretariat, including the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
3. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
The objective of the study is to identify the level of Health Care Waste Management that will be relevant
to help implement and enforce proper health and environmentally sound, technically feasible,
economically viable, and socially acceptable systems for management of health care waste in
Mozambique. The examination of the current practices with regard to the handling of hospital waste wvill
verify both the management of waste withiin the hospitals, clinics and other health care centres as well as
the management by local authorities once the waste has left the source. It will also look into the level of
knowledge among health care staff and local authorities about safe disposal practices to be adopted for
medical waste and into the availability of capacity to deal with this type of waste.
4. METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY
The adopted methodology has been structured around the following research axis : (i) collection of
document already published about HCWM in Mozambique: laws; legislative texts; regulations;
technical documents, etc.; (ii) meetings with categories of actors mainly involved in HCWM, at central
as well as at provincial levels (technical services of the state, technical services of local communities,
private societies, health facilities staff, etc.). Meetings are in a form of individual or collective
interviews; (iii) visiting sites: health facilities, on the grounds of samples reflecting their typology
(public, private) and the hierarchical level (central level, provincial and local) ; public and wild
landfills.

B. PRESENTATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
1. GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION
The republic of Mozambique is located at the sub-east of African Continent. Tanzania borders it at the
North; Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland at the West; South Africa at the South and Indian
Ocean at the East. There are 799,380 km2 of national territory including inland bodies of water. The
country is relatively flat particularly in the coastal regions. From the coasts to the interior in an east-
west direction, there is a coastal plain (40% of the territory with the highest population density);
plateaus with altitudes of 200 to 1000 meters and finally high plateaus and mountains over 1000 meters
high. Mozambique's Indian coastline stretches for approximately 2500 km. Mozambique frequently
suffers from floods, cyclones and droughts that some times reach disastrous proportions, causing death
of people and animals, mass population displacement, negative effects on agricultural production, etc.
The proximity of the sea and the richness of the Mozambican River basins favor small scale and
industrial fisheries. The country is rich in wildlife and natural resources, such as coal and natural gas.
Mozambique's population is approximately 17, 600,000' and the natural growth rate is 2.4%. The
proportion of children under 15 years old, projected for 2001, is 44.5% of the population and about
75% of the population lives in rural areas, but in the past 10 to 15 years, there has been significant
migration to cities due to the war (19976-1992). The groups that formed around the cities and towns
have been settled there, causing problems of urban organization, sanitation and waste management.
Administratively, the country is divided into 10 provinces and Maputo City, the national capital, which
has the status of a province.
2. SOCIOECONOMIC AND SANITARY INDICATORS
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in Mozambique was estimated at 230 USD in 2000.
Agriculture, manufacturing industry and commerce are the largest areas in the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors. The variables that determine poverty are: (i) slow economic growth until the beginning
of the 1990s; (ii) low educational level of economically active household members, particularly
women; (iii) high rates of dependency within households; (iv) low family agricultural productivity; (v)
lack of work opportunities both within and outside the agricultural sector; (vi) poor development of
infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Some indicators illustrate this situation: the incidence of
poverty is 69.4% (72.2% in rural zone and 62% in urban zone); the number of doctors for 100 000
inhabitants is 6; Up to the end of 1998, there were 1 140 000 persons infected by HIV with a
prevalence of 14.5% among the adult'population (over 15 years old).

C. THE NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM
1. HEALTH SECTOR POLICY
The health policy goal of the government is for all Mozambicans to have access to quality health care.
The national health policy sets out the following objectives for the health sector: (i) reduce mortality,
morbidity and suffering, specially among high risk groups such as women, children and those displaced
due to war and natural disasters; (ii) keep primary health care as the basis for the provision of good
quality and sustainable health care and make it accessible to the majority of the population; and (iii)
develop the Ministry of Health's technical and managerial capacity for planning, implementing and
evaluating health care and support services. The Health Sector Strategy Plan defines the health sector's
contribution to poverty reduction through interventions: health care provision; strengthening
individuals and communities; and advocacy.
2. HEALTH SECTOR ORGANIZATION
The Mozambican National Health Service comprises the public sector, the private profit-making sector
and the private non-profit-making sector. Until now, the public sector is the National Health Service's
major health care provider at the national level. It is organized into four levels : level I and 11 are the
most peripheral, implementing the Primary Health Care strategy and receiving referrals for clinical
conditions which cannot be treated at level I (complications in childbirth, etc.); level Ill and IV are
fundamentally designed for more specialized curative care, and can receive referrals from the low
levels. Over the past ten years, the referral system has been distorted, resulting in the poor performance
of the most peripheral units. These levels operate below the minimum standards, mainly due to the war
and the economic situation in the country over the past two decades. In the health units, this situation is
characterized by chronic shortages of supplies essential for health care provision, which has negative
repercussions on quality, particularly in rural areas. The weakness of the most peripheral levels (health
centers and rural/general hospitals) can also be attributed to (i) inequalities between health teams,
particularly the poor qualifications of professionals working in the most remote regions; (ii) continual
and chronic lowering of employees' morale, motivation and professional ethics, as result of difficult
working and living conditions and low salaries; (iii) unhygienic infrastructure in poor state of repair;
(iv) a lack of basic equipment, or poorly functioning equipment; (v) inadequate supervision by higher
levels; (vi) users' perceptions that health care is of poor quality.
The profit-making private sector is developing gradually, especially in the great cities. There has been
a growth in private individual and collective practices specializing in different areas. The continued
growth of these businesses is dependent on an increase in household incomes.
Foreign Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and some religious groups, in agreement with
MOH essentially provide health care in the non-profit-making private sector.
3. HEALTH SECTOR SITUATION AND HEALTH FACILITIES
The health system in Mozambique served some 2 millions people in 1997, through a network of 4
central hospitals, 12 provincial hospitals, 25 rural hospitals, 276 health centres and 736 health posts. It
is estimated that about 50% of the population have access to basic preventive and curative health
services and live within 10 km of a facility. The National household survey of 1996/97 indicates that
the closest medical service is the traditional healer, located an average 1.5 km from the rural
household. In the other hand, doctors are an average 46 km away, and a health post 19 km away.
Traditional healers treat 94% of the people in the villages; nurses treat 17%, midwives 20% and

doctors only 2%. The following boards indicate the health facilities network and the human resources
in the national health system.

D. HEALTH CARE WASTES
1. DEFINITION
The health care wastes are biomedical ones and are constituted of liquid or solid wastes presenting
risks of infection as they are generated by: products for diagnostics; treatment, prevention, or
researches in matter of health. In the sanitary structures, we identify two types of biomedical wastes:
the liquid wastes and the solid ones.
a. The liquid wastes
They are composed of blood remnants, of liquid chemical products, and are generally treated like the
used domestic waters: they are evacuated through bottomless pits, or on the nature without being
treated before hand. These wastes are sometimes toxic and need special care despite their weak
quantity.
b. Solid wastes
We can identify two categories:
-   The wastes comparable to household littering, produced by the health staff or those who watch
over the patients (generally members of their family) : they can be remnants of food, papers and
bags unspoiled, hygienic papers, wastes from administrative services, etc.
-   The wastes produced in special services in health establishments such as : hospitals, health centres,
clinics, medical cabinets, laboratories for medical analysis, centres making products for chemistries
and veterinary cabinets; they are composed of:
-  Anatomic wastes (tissues from human organs; fetus, placentas, amputated organs, and other
physiologic liquids, etc.)
-  Toxic wastes (chemical substances from diagnostics, cleaning or disinfecting (mercury and
mercury compositions, radiographic films, etc.)
-  Sharp wastes (saw blade, needles, syringes, lancet, tubes for blood perfusion, glasses having
contained blood, or any other object able to cause a wound)
-  Remnants of bandages (cotton and spoiled compresses, blood pockets, and the plasters)
-  Pharmaceutical wastes (chemistry products, expired and unused medicines).
Those types of solid wastes are mainly the category, which presents risks of infection by HIV/AIDS,
particularly the sharp wastes. The present study will focus it in priority.
2. PRODUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION
a. Production
Biomedical wastes generation depends on numerous factors, such as established waste management
methods, type of health-care facility, the proportion of patients treated daily, the degree of
specialization of the health facility. For a correct estimation of the waste production, the following
parameters need to be considered: number of hospital beds; number of in-patients and out-patients;
range of services provided; any other activity causing biomedical wastes generation. According to the
study realized by the DEH of the MOH in some hospitals, nearly 1100 kg of health care wastes are
generated in 4 hospitals during 2 weeks. That represents approximately a daily rate of 20 kg by
hospital. In this line, if we take into account the results of field mission in health facilities, we can
estimate the daily rate generation in the other health establishments, as follows:
-   Central hospital               :     40 kg/day
-   General and Provincial hospital  :   20 kg/day
-   Rural hospital                 :      10 kg/day
-   Health centre           :      3 kg/day
-   Health post             :      I kg/day

b. Characterization of biomedical wastes
Generally, the composition of biomedical wastes is the same in the health facilities, with some
variations in central and general hospitals, where the wastes specifically abound because of high
production in these centres. The most courant items seen are: syringes, needles; empty bottles for
injection liquid; plastic objects (gloves, blood pockets, urine pots, tubes etc...); cotton, compresses,
empty bags ; other wastes (plaster, human organs, etc...).

E. HEALTH CARE WASTES MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH FACILITIES
The collection of field information in the health centres has been realized on the grounds of a sampling
reflecting the types of health facilities (public and private) and the hierarchical level (national,
provincial and local). So, the boxes in the annex 1.4 describe the situation of HCWM in some health
facilities in Mozambique: Maputo City, Province of Maputo and Province of Gaza. The results of these
field visits globally indicate that:
-   nearly 80% of health facilities mix the HCW with the other non-infectious wastes;
-   up to the half of health facilities mix the needles with the other wastes;
-  only one health facility uses an incinerator for HCW treatment;
-   nearly 30% of the health facilities burn their HCW at open air;
-   nearly 70% of health facilities dispose their HCW in the nature or in an open hole;
-   nearly half of the health facilities have appropriate and sufficient dustbins for HCW storage;
-  nearly 70% of the health facilities staff have got security equipment for HCW collection.
In urban hospital (such as in Maputo city) and in rural and provincial health centres, the situation is
nearly the same : no selection at the source; general mixing of the HCW with the non-infectious ones;
lack of collection and treatment equipment; lack of security equipment for the staff charged to manage
the HCW. These field results confirm the main conclusions of the study realized by MOH and MOE, in
2001, on HCWM, in some hospitals located in the following provinces: Niassa, Nampula, Zambezia,
Tete, Maputo Province, Gaza, Inihambane, Manica and Sofala. The main conclusions of this study are:
Waste segregation and staff training:
-   in nearly 34% of HCW points of generation, the selection of waste is done, while in nearly 15 %
of these points, it is partially done and in nearly 47%, the selection is not done at all;
-   in nearly 32% of hospitals where selection is done, it (selection) is done in an appropriate manner
-   in 84% of cases, a waste management audit has been performed
-   nearly 25% of the staff in the hospitals have received a training about the management and correct
handling of medical wastes
-  only 20% of the staff in the hospitals (including cleaners) have received a training about safety in
the correct handling of toxic products
-   only 17% of the staff in the hospitals (including cleaners) have received a training about safety in
the containierization of wastes
-   only 28% of the staff are trained in the selection of wastes
Handling, treatment and disposal:
-   in 52% of the hospitals, there is not an adequate supply of safe containers for medical waste
-   83% of the hospitals manage sharp objects inside their frame
-  90% of the hospitals manage HCW inside their frame
-   in 59% of the hospitals, only re-useable needles are used
-   in 89% of the hospitals, there is no separate containers for sharp objects
-   only 4% of the hospitals use coded colors on waste containers, or other forms of labeling to
distinguish hazardous from non-hazardous wastes
-   only 10% of the hospitals have nominated a person who coordinates wastes management
-   7% transport their wastes in a municipal landfill
-   15% use incineration method for the HCW treatment
-   22% store their wastes more than 48hours
-   up to 62% have accidents register for the staff

F. HEALTH CARE WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT
1. INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF HCWM
a. Policy and Ie_al framework in HCWM
Presently, there is no specific policy of HCWM in Mozambique. The Strategic Plan for the Health
Sector does not specifically include the HCWM issues. However, this plan has some dispositions about
quality assurance: gradual introduction of quality management at all levels of the National Health
Strategy, definition of norms to adopt appropriate instruments and increase provincial capacity,
encouragement of the creation of quality assurance groups in the central and provincial hospitals, etc..
But these dispositions are theoretical in general and little implemented in reality. However, in 2001, the
MOH and the MOE have realized a waste management audit in some hospitals of Mozambique. The
audit concerned the staff training in waste management, the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes,
security and accidents.
As for the legal aspects, there are no specific texts about legislation and regulation, presenting
dispositions in terms of collection, treatment and disposal of biomedical wastes. Only the
environmental law n 20/97, of October 1, 1997 deals with this question. This law (prepared in July 30,
and approved in October 1, 1997), defines some legal basis for a correct use and a viable management
of environment and its components, in order to establish a system of sustainable development in
Mozambique. This law forbids storing or disposing toxic pollutant products on the ground, the
underground, on waters and in the atmosphere. It also recommends the Government to establish
environmental quality standards in order to ensure the sustainable use of the Nation's resources. This
law contains chapters about environmental pollution and environmental quality standards. It focuses
the necessity of realizing environmental impact assessment (EIA) for projects and programs having
negative effects on environment or public health. In this field, the MOE had elaborated directives about
EIA, including the main component of the study and the approval procedure.
Globally, this law deals with general principles, and the text suffers a lack of application. It does not
include specific dispositions on HCWM. That's why the MOH and the MOE have elaborated a
proposed law about a rational management of biomedical wastes. The document is presently in the
process of being approved (according to the responsible of the DEH of the MOH, the text will be
approved later at the end of July 2002). The objective of this regulation is to ensure compliance with
the environment act and its subordinate regulation for the protection of the environment, health care
workers and the public, by establishing systems of management for medical wastes to minimize the
impact of medical wastes on the environment, on the safety and health of population and on workers'
health.
The proposed law determines the institutional competence in biomedical wastes management: the
MOH must (i) determine a system of management of medical wastes, with the other institutions
involved (ii) guarantee that contagious and infectious wastes will be treated before destruction, (iii)
approve the plans of biomedical wastes management elaborated by the health facilities, (iv) guarantee
that the dispositions will be taken to avoid negative impacts from final disposal of medical wastes, on
the environment and public health, (v) organize training and capacity building in medical waste
management; the MOE must (i) elaborate and disseminate obligatory directives for the health facilities
in HCWM, including transportation and disposal, (ii) give authorization, in agreement with MOH and
municipalities, for the installations and areas for the medical wastes transportation, treatment and
disposal. In addition to this, all health care facilities must develop a medical waste management policy,
as part of their compliance with the environment act. Some articles include important dispositions
among them : the choice of a responsible in each facility to manage medical wastes and to provide



14
training and guidance for the other staff; the segregation of medical wastes; the storage of medical
wastes in specific containers; the disposal methods; the storage and transportation of medical wastes.
If this law is approved, it will allow a rational management of HCW in the health centres. Nevertheless,
the proposed law has some shortcomings: the liquid wastes management is not mentioned and good
practices of medical waste management are not enough defined, mainly those conceming staff in the
health centres. The technical aspects are not always practical and directly applicable. The document
does not include the following detailed specifications: legal framework covering safe health-care waste
management, hospital hygiene and occupationial health safety, limitation for the emissions of
atmospheric pollutants and protection of water resources; responsibilities of the heads of the health-
care facilities, those of the scattered smaller health-care waste producers, and of the heads of any public
waste disposal agencies involved ; details of application of safe practices for waste minimization,
segregation, handling, storage and transportation of health-care waste; recommended treatment and
disposal methods for each health-care waste category and wastewater. That is why it is necessary to
improve the proposed law by elaborating specific technical guidelines about HCWM.
b. Actors involved in HCWM
The HCW management sector gets many categories of actors involved:
i)     The technical services of the State
The technical services of the State, particularly the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of
Environment (MOE) have the responsibility to define and to elaborate an environmental and healthcare
policy.
At the central level, these two ministries generally have got competent human resources in
environmental health issues. For example, the experts of the Department of Environmental Health
(DEH) of the MOH and the National Direction of Environmental Impact Assessment of the MOE, who
have elaborated the proposed law about medical waste management (MWM) and the environmental
law. These specialists master fairly well the environmental health management issues, but their scope
of action is a bit limited because of lack of material and financial means to carry out all their mission,
mainly on medical wastes management.
The MOFI supervises health care facilities, which are the main producers of infectious biomedical
wastes. The DEH is responsible of sanitation issues, hygiene and environment. However, the level of
competence in MWM is not very high in provinces and districts. The MOE has not any decentralized
services yet, while the MOH has got them in provinces and districts, but they often don't have enough
competent human resources.
According to the Strategic Plan for the Health Sector (2001-2010), human resources problems in the
health sector can be summarized as follows : disproportional repartition of professional, with most
qualified staff concentrated in urban areas; poorly qualified work force, where only 18% of staff have
higher and medium level training; low quantity and quality of professionals in the management field.
About health facilities, the sector still has a significant shortage of qualified staff. The shortage is
particularly acute in the areas of general and specialized hospital health care. Shortages are even more
severe in management and administration fields, where the situation has globally, negative effects on
the National Health Service efficiency, particularly at district level. Another illustrated fact is that the
proportion of elementary staff has not changed significantly and the reduction of the proportion of
basic level staff is mainly due to their promotion to the medium level by means of formal training. This
has had consequences for the health units, which employ, at this basic level nurses and other staff who,
unfortunately, leave to participate in medium level courses".



15
Thoughi these two ministries' missions have been clearly defined, their mutual services neither take
enough initiatives nor perform field actions in HCWM. This situation reveals their limited vision and
understanding of responsibilities in HCWM.
In the MOH, the DEHli has an organization covering quite all the sectors of hygiene and sanitation
(water sanitation and hygiene promotion, health and urban development, environmental health impact
assessment, occupational hygiene and chemical safety, etc.). The staff comprises agents specialized in
environmental health, but their activities are mainly led at the central level. The agents generally stick
to daily administrative tasks and don't really support the provincial services and municipalities in
HCWM issues. But, in some health facilities, the MOH has built craft incinerators, with the support of
development partners or NGOs. In addition, the Central Hospital of Maputo has got two modern
incinerators with the financial support of the African Development Bank. Despite of this, the HCW
collection and treatment equipment needs are far from being covered in the health facilities.
The MOH has got a department charged of staff training (Department of Training), but its mission is
more oriented to the bettering of the professional capacities in field of health care. The training
sessions aim at recycling health staff for a better health care performance: they don't sufficiently take
into account environmental and sanitation issues, such as HCWM. However, in the framework of
struggle against HIV/AIDS program, the Department of Training has elaborated a strategic document
(draft) with includes a component about human resources training based only on issues related to
HIV/AIDS (characterization of the virus, mode of transmission, impacts of HIV/AIDS on health, tests,
etc.), but not to HCW.
As for information and public awareness, the MOH has a service (Department of Public Education)
charged of public education about health. This structure has got qualified staff and appropriated
materials for conceiving didactic elements for iiformation and awareness. It helps the health facilities
and the provincial health services to elaborate and diffuse health messages (posters, radio messages,
etc.). The activities, hardly cover the public education needs, and most of the time, they pretext the lack
of means. The actions led in the HCWM are insignificant and are most often oriented to sickness
prevention .
The Ministry of Environment's mission is to elaborate and to implement an environmental policy,
which will serve as a strategic orientation framework. This ministry has elaborated a National
Environmental Action Plan, an environmental law and guidelines on environmental impacts
assessment. These strategic documents hardly refer to the HCWM. In the health care waste
management process defined by the proposed law, this ministry has a role of control and monitoring.
Particularly, it must follow the procedures of Environmental Impact Assessment up. In this process, the
National Direction of Environmental Impact Assessment is the mainly involved structure, but this
direction does not bring enough HCWM support to provincial services, municipalities and health
facilities.
ii)    The health establishments
The health facilities are the principal HCW producers, but the healing staff has little concern for the
daily management of the HCW, which is considered as a second priority besides the huge medical
emergencies. In fact, the medical staff (mainly doctors, nurses and midwives) is little involved in
HCWM, while it should be the basic element in the sustainable HCWM process.
As well in urban health facilities as in provincial ones, there are no technical guidelines permitting to
the staff to manage correctly the health care wastes, or to have safe behaviours. Despite of this
situation, nearly all the health centres are characterized by a remarkable state of cleanliness. However,
certain health facilities have a bio-security commission, which is very involved in infection prevention



16
and security, and sometimes, an agent is appointed to follow the waste management up. Finally, the
lack of financial resources constitutes limiting factor to the ensuring of a good health care waste
management (no specific budget for this management).
iii)   The municipalities
The municipalities are responsible for the management of household littering and legally, they must not
manage the HCW. However, in the practice, the landfills (or the publics containers) of household
littering, which they manage, often receive the HCW from health facilities or domestic cares. In
Maputo for example, the Municipal Council collects irregularly the containers of general wastes
(mixed with health care wastes) in the Central Hospital, and all these wastes are disposed in the public
landfill. In this way, the municipalities must be involved in the HCWM, even if their interventions in
this field are somewhat weak. In Maputo city, an area is reserved in the public landfill to receive the
HCW, but there is no specific treatment of these wastes. This situation constitutes a serious threat both
for the public health (neighboring populations, scavengers, etc.) and the environment.
iv)    The private sector
In Maputo City, there are three main private companies working in littering collection within the
institutions, private services and private clinics, but they don't intervene in household littering
collection. However, even if they collect in private clinic, none of them is specialized in HCW
collection. They have no adequate equipment for that, and the infectious nature of the wastes from the
clinics, don't motivate them enough to get involved in the HCW management.
v)     The scavengers
The level of poverty (nearly 70% of the population overpasses the margin of monetary poverty) and the
lack of economic alternatives push a large part of the populations towards survival strategies, mainly in
suburban zones. In this framework, informal scavenging or recycling activities in the littering
disposals, are opportunities for poor masses to earn a living, and the sector of recycling is too lucrative,
to justify such an interest. The scavengers are mainly present in the public landfills, (such as that of
Maputo City), but they are also active in general waste public containers and many other wild sites, in
which they often find HCW mixed with general wastes. That is why their activity includes serious
sanitary risks: infection, cutting and other injuries caused by sharp objects.
vi)    The traditional healers
In Mozambique, the non-allopathic sector includes practitioners of traditional medicine, herbalists, etc.
That is why the national health policy includes in its strategy, the collaboration with that sector, but in
fact, little progression has been made apart from some research actions into medicinal plants. The
MOH does not have the instruments to fulfill its mission of protecting citizens against certain
practitioners who pretend to be able to treat illnesses such as AIDS. These traditional healers are
mostly frequented by a large part of the population, particularly the poor people. In these fields, the
practices of scarification and excision are very often. So, the instruments used can be infected, and the
risk of infection by HIV/AIDS is highly potential, if the patient bears the virus. The awareness of these
traditional doctors of the risks linked to the handling of their instruments is not obvious. That is why
they must be targets of information and education programs.
vii)   The NGOs and Community Based Organizations
The national NGOs are gradually developing and implementing essential community health care
programs in the field of prevention, disease control, education and information. They have developed
partnership with the MOH, but their activities do not cover the most disadvantaged regions. Health care
could be theoretically increased by the involvement of health informal actors, such as retired people,
supported by MOH. Many national NGOs and Community Based Organizations (CBO) are actively
interested by environmental and health issues. Generally, they don't either intervene in the waste



17
management, or in the HCWM. Nevertheless, some NGOs and CBO are very active in public
awareness and training programs about environment and health, mainly in activities of struggle against
HIV/AIDS. They have great experience in this field. They could be very useful during the
implementation of the activities of this project, particularly when it is necessary to involve the local
populations in the HCWM. The CBO are more inclined to act in local development. They have the
advantage of residing in the locality, and enjoy the trust of local populations. The civil society must be
an important partner for the project, and the emergency of this category of actors, doing social and
proximity activities, constitutes an opportunity in the implementation strategy of the HCWM.
viii)  The partners for development
Most of partners for development act in the field of health. Even if all of them recognize the
importance of interests linked with HCW and the necessity to lead actions in this way, very few of
them have got specific programs about FICW. Only some interventions are noted in terms of
infrastructures and equipments. For example, the African Bank for Development has financed the
acquisition of two modern incinerators in the Central Hospital of Maputo. But these equipments are not
working presently because the administration has not decided their localization. The World Health
Organization (WHO), in its biennium 2001-2003, intends to support the Environmental Health
Department of the MOH, by recruiting a consultant charged of the elaboration of a Health Care Waste
Management Plan in three Central Hospitals. The cost of this support amounts to 23 000 USD. But, the
Terms Of Reference of these studies are not yet elaborated.
2. ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF HCWM
a. Or2anization
The sector of HCW is characterized by a multitude of production sources, difficult to spot mainly the
private cabinets and the health care at home. In nearly all the health facilities, there is no plan or
procedure of HCWM. And, few facilities (10% of hospital, according to study realized by the MOH),
have designated an agent to look after the biomedical waste management, which is not enough. In
addition to this, all over the national territory is noticed an absence of liable information about the
quantity of biomedical wastes produced, though good initiatives of characterization and waste
management appraisal have been realized by the MOH and the MOE in some hospitals.
b. Wastes segregation- collection and transportation
In the health centres, major constraints (in pre-collection, collection and evacuation) are the following:
-  no efficient segregation of HCW;
-   HCW mixing with household littering mainly by help-healers, the care takers, cleaners;
-  The carelessness of nurses and the deficiency or lack of training about HCWM;
-  The lack of qualification of cleaners and helpers charged of the handling of HCW dustbins;
-  dustbin for needles are inappropriate and lack security;
-  The insufficiency of pre-collection bowls (needles dustbins, dustbins for cotton, etc.)
-  The lack of enough and appropriate protection equipments for the cleaning and collecting staff.
If these results illustrate the situation in some main hospitals, we can say that the waste management at
local level is more deplorable, particularly in rural hospitals, health centres and health posts. Among
these constraints, the absence of an effective discrimination (segregation at the source) of HCW, is a
major preoccupation not only at the technical field, but also at the environmental and sanitary one. In
fact, in the health facilities, it has been noticed a mingling of all types of HCW contaminated or
infectious, along with non-toxic ordinary wastes, (comparable to household littering). Separation is not
always done to avoid this dangerous blend which increases the volume of contamination.



18
According to the study realized by the MOH/DEH, in nearly 34% of HCW  points of generation,
segregation of waste is done, while in nearly 15 % of these points, it is partially done and in nearly
47%, segregation is not done at all; in nearly 32% of hospitals where segregation is done, it (selection)
is done in an appropriate manner.
T he separation of wastes minimizes this volume, maximizes the protection of public health, and makes
easy the process of treatment to be adapted. When we know that the wastes contaminated, represent
nearly 20 % of the total production generated, (against 50 % for the other non-toxic wastes), we
understand easily the lost efforts, in terms of material and financial means of collection of the whole
spoiled wastes. Until this situation is seen and understood as a paradox and a real danger for all, it is
certain that the HCW will still be thrown in public or savage landfills, while no appropriate measure is
taken to protect the sites, the managers of landfills and the scavengers. In these conditions, the
infectious wastes are collected carelessly as if they were household littering. Most of littering landfills
have no restriction in terms of access or admission of wastes, and the managers don't give any report
on the nature and quantity of wastes handled. The absence of vigilance about these landfills certainly
means, for the managing staff and scavengers, an absence of danger linked with the wastes. And this
perception can prevent them from protecting themselves correctly. In addition to this, there is no
special disposition, taken to master the risk generated by contaminated medical wastes and toxic waste
on the environment.
Added to this, the use of recyclable materials (drug containers and other plastic materials) is a serious
option in minimizing the volume of waste, because it would potentially reduce the solid waste to be
incinerated. The discrimination of these kinds of wastes can be more formal if a cooperation between
scavengers active in landfills and the responsible of health centres is set up. This option will help to
reduce infectious risks in the landfills.

c. Treatment - disposals
According to the study realized by the MOH/DEH, 90% of the hospitals dispose their wastes inside the
hospital, 7% transport their wastes in a municipal landfill and 15% use incineration.
i)     The wastes burning at open air
When incinerators are not available, the burning method constitutes the most adopted practice in most
of the health centres. It is performed by 30% of health facilities visited during the mission, in urban
hospitals as well as in rural ones, and is done at open air, into holes or on the ground. This practice has
negative effects on the environment because it pollutes the air and disturbs the populations around
(when burning, plastic elements release much carbon dioxide). In addition to this, such a method leaves



19
a good deal of wastes unburned; so the problem of elimination is not totally solved, because it is hardly
if 30 % of wastes are really burned.
ii)    The burial of wastes
The wild burial, which consists in digging holes without any care, is practiced by 66% of health
facilities, during the field mission, mainly in Health Centres and very probably in Health Posts. Once
the hole is full, another is dug nearby. With this practice, there are real threats of polluting the
underground waters, particularly the very shallow napkin easily reached. By the way, there can be real
risks of being prickled by needles or other sharp objects, since the burial is executed in an anarchical
way by care staffs or cleaners (there is no sign or visible indicator to show burial places). In this case,
not only there are risks of being hurt and affected by "tetanus", but also one can be infected if the
germs or virus are alive in the burial ground.
iii)   Collection by a structure and wild disposal
This practice is noticed in big cities, essentially in Maputo, where the general wastes of some private
clinics are collected by private structures, in a paid collection service. In these clinics, HCW are mixed
with general wastes, and stored in public disposals or littering holes. In the Central Hospital of Maputo,
the municipality collects in the same containers, general and health care wastes. At provincial and local
level, there are no private collection structures and HCW are eliminated by the mean of other systems.
iv)    Wild disposal
The direct rejection of biomedical wastes in the nature, on the ground, sometimes mingled with
household littering, at the verge of inhabited areas, is a very common practice in the health facilities,
particularly in provinces and districts. This practice constitutes an environmental and sanitary risk both
for nature and population, mainly the children and the scavengers who frequent these savage disposals.
v)     Incineration
Incineration is practiced by 15 % of hospitals (only one health centre, during field mission), and this
percentage is certainly lower in the health centres and health posts. The reason for this situation can be
explained by the fact that efforts of equipment implementation, mainly incinerators, concern the central
and provincial hospitals. In the other hand, the cost of these incinerators (the modern ones) is rather
high, and cannot be supported by the weak budget of the health facilities in Mozambique. During the
mission, we have identified two new modern incinerators in the Central Hospital of Maputo, but they
have not been installed because the administration has not decided on the spot. The same model is
found in the Provincial Hospital of Gaza, but it was not working because of unknown breakdown.
Concerning the craft incinerators built with local material, they are not efficient and do not work
normally: manufacturing defects, inadequate stabilized materials, lack of care, lack of follow up,
unburned wastes, etc. Cement is used as basic material and generally the structure is broken because of
high temperatures. Recently, the WHO has tested a new model of craft incinerator, very efficient, able
to reach high temperatures, at a low cost (800 USD). However, the incinerated wastes contain needles
and other sharp objects, which can be not melted in the incinerator. Even if these metallic wastes are
sterilized and deprived of infectious elements, they remain dangerous and can cause wounds with risks
of tetanus when they are disposed in areas near the population (children are more exposed). In health
facilities, with craft incinerators having got holes for ashes, the needles and other sharp objects are
thrown in the hole. What might happen in this case is a premature filling up of the hole. In this case,
another hole should be dug. In case the place was already used, there may be risks of wound by dug out
sharp objects. Nevertheless, given the small amount HCW incinerated in the health centres (provincial
and local level), the holes could stay longer before being filled.
3. KNOWLEDGE - BEHAVIOUR AND PRACTICES



20
The categories of actors directly concerned by the risk of being affected by HIV/AIDS contaminated
HCW are: (i) the staff of health establishments (medical staff, paramedical one, helps care takers,
cleaners, etc.); (ii) the collection staff (municipal employees, private collectors); (iii) The scavengers;
(iv) the populations near the disposals. It is also necessary to evaluate their awareness about HCW.
a. Health Care facilities Staff
The health staff is composed of medical agents, paramedical staff, helpers and cleaners. These persons
are the first to be in direct and permanent contact with HCW. This cohabitation in the long run makes
the agents careless about the HCW, (despite of acquired experience). Generally, the medical and
paramedical (doctors, nurses, midwifes) staff is conscious of risks linked with HCW handling, even if
the great majority has not been trained in HCW management. Nevertheless, in the practical field, one
can notice some carelessness or sometimes blame worthy behaviours mainly in paramedical agents
whose knowledge and consciousness of HCWM is visibly less high than that of the doctors.
According to the study realized by the MOH of the DEFI : (i) some 25% of the staff in the hospitals
have received training in the management and correct handling of medical wastes; (ii) only 20% of the
staff in the hospitals (including cleaners) have received training in occupational safety with respect to
the correct handling of toxic products; (iii) only 17% of the staff in the hospitals (including cleaners)
have received training in occupational safety with respect to the safe containerization of wastes; (iv)
only 28% are trained in segregation of wastes.
The basic training of this staff does not include the topic of biomedical waste management. In fact,
health employees (medical and paramedical staff) are preoccupied by more urgent medical tasks, and
that explain the little interest accorded to HCWM, which is not seen as an absolute priority, regarding
to the high number of patients to be consulted daily. If we add to this the necessity of tackling all these
problems together with HCW, the result is that the management of wastes is a second plan activity. It is
nearly too much to ask them to treat the sick and to manage correctly the HCW. Facing such a
situation, there is an emergent need and necessity to get a responsible involved in the HCWM (only
10% of the hospitals have nominated a person who coordinates waste management).
The helpers and cleaners (who are in charge of the collection of HCW dustbins) have a slight idea of
dangers in the handling of HCW, and generally ignore the sickness or diseases they might contract.
Their awareness rising often does not overpass the immediate perception of danger during the handling
of wastes. Though they have received a superficial awareness, most of them don't always respect the
advice and indications helping them in the separation of wastes. These employees are the most exposed
of the health centres, because they have no qualification when recruited, and their level of education is
generally weak. The most often, these agents are not supplied protection equipments (gloves, boots,
uniforms, masks, etc.).
b. Solid Wastes Collection Staff
Two categories of actors intervene in waste collection outside the health facilities: municipality staff
and private societies staff (mainly in Maputo). Conceming the private societies, which assure a paid
collection service for private clinics, the technical staff understands the gravity of the HCW
problematic, even if they haven't received any training in the sanitary field. This staff is relatively
conscious of the risks, but their financial efforts are very modest in terms of investments to acquire
adequate materials or safe protection equipments for field workers. The financial profit seems to be
their major preoccupation and nobody motives them to be interested in the HCWM.



21
In the municipalities, the solid wastes collectors and the managers of municipal disposals (such as
public landfill of Maputo), who are in permanent contact with infected wastes, are unqualified hand
workers whose education level is very low and often practice scavenging. Most of them don't see any
difference between the household littering and HCW, and they work in precarious hygienic and
protection conditions: the equipments are neither enough nor secure. The possibility of risks is all the
larger than, the private medical cabinets and health-care home practitioners mix the HCW with the
household littering. The technical staffs of collecting teams are aware of risks in the daily handling of
solid wastes mixed with littering. But the collectors themselves do not perceive all the risks and they
receive no training or awareness programs about the dangers linked to HCW handling.
c. Scavengers
The scavengers frequent these disposal sites looking for reusable or recyclable objects (empty bottles,
etc.), not only in the public landfill (such as in Maputo), but also in the public containers reserved for
household littering. With their so low standard of living and their weak education level, they hardly
realize the dangers in the handling of wastes and don't accept to leave the wastes in which they earn
their daily living. They have got mean protection equipments and seem to be at ease in the undesirable
situation. The absence of protection of the landfill areas lessens the perception of danger so scavengers
don't feel the need to protect themselves correctly.
d. Traditional Healers
They are mostly required by a large part of the population, particularly the poor ones. In these fields,
the practices of scarification and excision are very useful. So, the instruments used can be infected, and
the risk of infection by HIV/AIDS is highly potential, if the virus contaminates the patient. The
awareness of these traditional doctors is not evident concerning the risks linked to the handling of their
instruments. That is why they must be aimed in information's programs.
e. Populations
Populations mainly involved are : the scavengers looking for useful objects, children playing on the
landfill or looking for toys, the population usinig recycled objects, the population performing or
receiving home health care, populations living near the landfills and these ones using recycling objects.
As for the public in general, its knowledge of risks linked with the handling of HCW is particularly
weak. Populations living close to the wild and public landfills (in Maputo, the landfill is located inside
the urban area, between hiouses) are generally ill informed of the dangers the face in cohabiting with
the wastes. Though these people are conscious, they can't do without this situation for they haven't got
the means to go somewhere else. Their children are the most exposed, because they often play on
landfills and are hardly exposed to infections. For these actors, it is necessary to elaborate a program of
Information, Awareness rising and Education about risks linked with HCW.

f. Training and Public Awareness rising Needs
The following board indicates the level of appreciation of knowledge, behavior and practices of the
categories of actors involved in the HCWM. These assessments have been realized on the basis of the
field visits during the mission.

G. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS
1. HEALTH IMPACTS
The persons mainly exposed in the process of HCWM are: (i) the medical and paramedical staff (ii) the
helps and cleaners, charged of wastes collection or incineration in the health facilities ; (iii) the wastes
collection agents of private societies; (iv) the scavengers and (v) populations in general, living by the
side of the landfills (mainly the children), or people using recycled objects from wastes. The risks
linked with bad management of health care wastes are globally the following:
-  accidental wounds : risks of accident for health staffs, for children playing on disposals and for
unaware scavengers;
-   serious intoxication and infections, affecting the health staff and collectors.
As for infections, we can cite three categories:
-  viral sickness such as HIV/AIDS; Viral hepatitis B (VHB) and viral hepatitis A. For these
sicknesses, the exposed persons are the health agents, those who watch over the sick, the care
takers and populations near the disposals (children, scavengers, etc.);
-  microbial or bacterial sickness such as tuberculosis, streptococci, typhoid fever etc.;
-   parasite sicknesses, (caused by dung coming from health centres and thrown in public disposals
near habitations) such as dysentery, etc.;
Concerning the risks of wounds, sharp objects (comprising syringes, broken glasses and blades) can
tear open human bodies and cause infections. For example, the used syringes can be recycled by
unconscious practitioners, or used as toys by children. This may be potential source of HIV
transmission. Other types of harm might affect people, for example cancer (by radio active products);
the burns and skin irritation (by radioactive and toxic chemical products), but they present no risk of
HIV/AIDS infection. The savage disposals in popular districts are often used as toilets (mainly by bare
foot children), which exposes the users to contamination and mostly to accidents caused by needles and
other sharp or cutting objects. In the same way, informal health cabinets, home health care performers
and healers exercising at home, certainly throw HCW in household littering containers, which exposes
the members of their families, and first of all children playing with used medical instruments. The risks
of wounds have increased mainly with enlarged vaccination programs, which generate important
quantities of needles because of the new "single injection syringes". According to the study realized by
MOH and MOE in HCWM in some hospitals, injuries caused by needles occur in 55% of cases, while
injuries due to sharp or cutting objects are 47%, and up to 62% register accidents.
Another category of impact concerns the potential contamination of the food chain. In fact, the
ignorance of the waste handlers (in health facilities), the insufficiency of collection and storage
equipments, lead to a mixing of HCW with other non-infectious wastes, particularly in the landfills
which are very frequented by domestic animals looking for food. Such a situation can cause sicknesses
and contaminants introduction through the food chain. At last, winds can transport dangerous germs
coming from inappropriate waste storage inside the health facilities and the open landfills.
The following boards indicate the risks for neighboring populations, and the risks of contraction of
HIV/AIDS through HCW.

2. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ASPECTS IN HCWM
The average poverty rate is 69.4% in Mozambique. With this high poverty level, scavenging activities
provide daily financial resources for the numerous scavengers. The disposal sites are their working
places. The implementation of an efficient system of waste management can disturb their activities and
reduce their earnings, because reusable objects don't reach them any longer. Another cause of
perturbation is: when regulations are issued to forbid scavenging; or when they are victims of
measures adopted to dismiss them from disposals sites.
The social and cultural aspects linked with HCWM should be taken into account in the strategic action
plan, to ensure populations' involvement in the program implementation. For example, in case they are
driven away, the action plan should propose measures, taking into account these social issues. Those
populations should be helped by the management plan, to get new opportunities of earning their living.
To avoid loss of incomes for scavengers, the management plan should devise measures such as
authorization of scavenging at the source (in health centres) and forbidding waste collecting staff to
scavenge.



25
At last, populations are generally sensitive with certain types of wastes, mainly the anatomic ones
(body amputation, placenta, etc.). Often they are very watchful about how such kinds of wastes are
eliminated, and it is unacceptable to throw them in littering disposals. In most of the health centres,
there are pits to receive these types of wastes. These social and cultural beliefs should be seriously
taken into account in the process of HCWM to be proposed; and this not only to respect the culture and
traditions of the persons concerned but most of all to ensure their involvement in the project.
3. BIOPHYSICAL IMPACTS
In Mozambique, the most negative practices for the environment concerns the HCW treatment
methods: landfill disposals, burial, burning at open air and craft incineration.
Landfill disposals, (or rejection in public household littering containers), constitute an easy solution
requiring few efforts. With this method, the risk of infection is shifted from one point to another and
also increases. In addition, the contact of HCW with other wastes stretches the chain of environmental
contamination and the transmissionI of sicknesses.
The savage burial in a hole dug inside the health centres is very current too, particularly of the needles
and sharp objects. This method can have negative impacts on the environment if the holes are not
protected and stabilized to avoid water napkin contamination. If the holes are not well covered, the
HCW so buried will become a source of harm to the direct environment, mainly for children looking
for toys.
The open air burning is very often done in health facilities. It is surely the most polluting method for
the atmosphere because of emanations of gas and particles containing toxic substances (chlorine acid,
sulfur oxide, dioxin, furans, benzene chlorine), if waste segregation is not done at the source.
Incineration is a also practiced because of its efficiency, but it can be a source of pollution and harm if
technical dispositions are not taken. For example, waste segregation must be done to avoid burning
plastic elements, chemical products and heavy metals. Also, localization, smoke purifying system,
length of the chimney, and operating periods must be seriously studied.
Globally, the potential impact of wastes on biophysical environment are: (i) esthetical pollution,
pollution of the atmosphere and unease during open air waste burning; (ii) pollution of water surfaces
and underground waters; mainly the shallow water napkin in some zones; and (iii) pollution of the soil,
with a consequence for its use for agriculture.

H. HEALTH CARE WASTES MANAGEMENT PLAN
1. PROBLEMATIC
a. There is no operational strategy in the HCWM
The institutional framework is characterized by a lack of national strategy in HCWM: there is no policy
document or any formal management procedure in health care wastes. The proposed law on HCWM is
being prepared without a proper policy framework. That is why it is necessary to get an institutional
and legal package including policy document which should outline national goals and the key steps to
achieve these goals. It must contain the following: description of health and safety risks resulting from
mismanaged health-care wastes; reasons for safe health-care waste management practices in health
facilities; listing of approved methods of treatment and disposal for each waste category; warning
against the most unsafe practices, such as disposing of hazardous health-care waste in municipal
landfills; management responsibilities inside and outside health-care facilities; assessment of health-
care waste management costs; the keys steps of health-care waste management: waste minimization,
separation, identification, handling, treatment, final disposal. Technical specifications for the
implementation of each step could be describe in separate technical guideline; record keeping and
documentation; training requirement; rules governing workers health and safety protection.
b. The legal framework has HCWM deficiencies
The legal framework deficiencies, stressed mainly by an absence of internal regulations in the health
facilities, do not ensure a sustainable HCWM. That situation doesn't help to determine in a clear and
precise way, the roles, responsibilities and field competency of actors involved in the HCWM. The
present laws and regulations don't allow a standardization of HCW collection, transportation, storage
and treatment procedures. To make these legal documents more operational, they must reinforce the
technical guidelines about HCWM, implement a specific regulation for each health facility and settle
procedures of control. In addition, the laws and regulations, elaborated at the central level, should
allow the municipalities to legislate locally about the HCWM.
c. The knowledge and good behavior in HCWM are generally insufficient
In general, we notice an insufficiency of knowledge, good behavior and practices in hospital staffs,
wastes collectors and populations, as far as HCWM is concerned. If the paramedical staff (doctors,
midwives, nurses) has knowledge and fairly good behavior in HCWM, efforts will be necessary, to
train and make the other staff aware, such as cleaners, etc. For these types of employees, HCW are not
well known, that is why very little attention is paid to their handling. This is very often source of
accidents causing wounds and infection. The level of ignorance of people handling the wastes in
hospitals and clinics, the inappropriate and weak storage equipments, collection and HCW disposal,
cause an extraordinary mixing of HCW with other solid wastes (less toxic). Also, winds full of dust can
carry dangerous pathogen germs coming from inappropriate HCW storage in hospitals, clinics and
open-air landfills. For this sake, we should inform the health staff, the public agents and populations in
general of dangers related to a bad management of HCW. Apart from this, HCW management must be
included in the training programs for agents involved in the handling of HCW (hospital staff, wastes
handlers, municipal collectors, landfills managers, etc.). There should also be an implementation of a
national program for training trainers about sanitary risks, good behavior and practices linked with
HCW management.



27
As for the public in general, its knowledge of risks linked with the handling of HCW is very weak,
particularly: (i) the scavengers looking for useful objects, (ii) children playing on the landfill or
looking for toys, (iii) population using recycled objects, (iv) population performing or receiving home
healthi care, (v) people living near the landfills. For these actors, it is necessary to elaborate an
information and awareness rising programs about risks linked with HCW. In this field, the proximity
information should be given a priority, mainly with the support of NGOs and BCOs enjoying a large
experience in proximity communication and health activities; in addition, very often, they know what is
going on in the localities and are trusted by the population.
d. The private societies are not involved in HCWM
In Mozambique, very few private societies intervene in solids wastes collection: municipalities
generally manage the households littering. In Maputo, only three private societies are active in this
field. That is a constraint in the process of health care wastes managing in a professional manner. So,
the proposed management plan must develop a professional approach generating incomes and profit. It
should also support private initiatives and develop a partnership between public and private sector with
civil society. In the same way, the solid waste management suffers a lack of financial support from the
state and local collectivities. This is the reason why major constraints are met through all the process:
collectors are not motivated, equipments are hardly replaced, collection is irregular, etc. Without a
regular budget allotted to HCWM (mainly in health facilities), it is nearly impossible to improve the
management. Presently, the financial resources for HCWM are symbolic in health centres: priority is
given to the health care services (they prefer to buy medicines rather than dustbin or incinerator). To
solve this problem, it is necessary to develop specific financial resources. In addition to this, the
technical and management capacity of public and private partners should be reinforced, to motivate
them in get involved in HCWM. The use of private services in HCWM system is necessary because of
inability of health care facilities to raise needed capital. In addition, they expected greater experience
than public facilities. But the main advantage is the increased efficiency resulting from competition
among service providers on the market.
2. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF HCWM PLAN
To better the HCWM in a sustainable way, the plan should take into account the main constraints met
during the field mission : absence of specific operational policy about HCW; lack or insufficient
regulations; weakness of budgetary resources; limited qualified human resources; absence or
deficiency of management equipments; insufficient knowledge about HCW; undesirable behavior and
practices, etc. The HCWM plan should initiate a process and support the national response to these
questions. It focuses preventive measures, mainly the initiatives to be taken in order to reduce the
health and environmental risks related to present practices. It will also focus the positive actions,
which, in the long term, will allow a change of behavior, a sustainable HCW management, and a
protection of actors against risks of infection. In this line, the strategy of intervention should axed on
the following measures:
- lead training activities for actors concerned (health staff, HCW handlers, municipal collectors of
wastes, managers of publics landfills, etc.);
- lead information and education campaigns for populations about HCW;
- reinforce the institutional and technical capacities and better the existing regulations;
- support initiatives of partnership between public, privates and civil society .in HCWM.
These actions should be accompanied by complementary measures, mainly initiated by governmental
programs, in terms of HCWM bettering in health facilities (segregation and collection materials;
protection equipments; systems of treatment).



28
3. THE COMPONENTS OF THE ACTION PLAN
a. Objective 1: Improve the organizational and technical framework in HCWM
The policy and legal framework will be bettered withi the adoption of the proposed law on HCWM.
However, this proposed law has some shortcomings (detailed in section F.I.a), that is why it is
necessary to elaborate specific technical guidelines for the health centres in terms of responsibilities
definition, good practice of HCW, reduction, selection and separation at the source, storage, handling,
transformation, treatment and disposal. The technical guidelines should be practical and directly
applicable, and include the following specifications, with a sufficient degree of detail: legal framework
covering safe health-care waste management, hospital hygiene and occupational health safety,
limitation for the emissions of atmospheric pollutants and protection of water resources may also
address here; responsibilities of health-care facilities' heads, of the scattered smaller health-care waste
producers, and of the heads of any public waste disposal agencies involved; safe practices for waste
minimization; segregation, handling, storage and transport practices of health-care waste;
recommended treatment and disposal methods for each health-care waste category and waste water.
As for the institutional responsibilities, presently, there is no sufficient clarification of the roles of the
MOE and the MOH in HCWM. However, the proposed law, which is being approved, says that inside
the hospitals, HCWM depends on MOH while HCWM outside depends on MOE. But, it is not
specified what departments of MOE or MOH are involved, and what kind or roles they must play. That
is why the roles of the MOE and MOH at central level need to be more clearly defined.
Activity 1.1  Regulate the HCW management in health facilities
-   Define the roles and administrative responsibilities in the HCW management;
-   Implement, for each health facility, a internal HCW management plan;
-  Implement and adopt procedures of positive and negative sanctions of the staffs, according to
their practice in the HCW management;
-   Schedule financial provision for HCWM in the health centres budget
Activity 1.2.  Set up procedures of control in HCW management
-  Elaborate specific guidelines of EIA for wastes management, including HCW
-   Implement clear directives for health control agents;
-   Set up a registering of HCW quantities produced by health centres;
- Define the mechanisms of control in needles and sharps collection and disposal process;
-  Organize regular monitoring by technical staff in Provincial and District Health Directions.
It is necessary to clarify the conformity of the HCWM Plan with the governmental strategy, mainly the
institutional framework and the responsibilities of institutional actors involved.
i)     Institutional framework
At the institutional level, the HCWM Plan is included in the governmental strategy of struggling
against HIV/AIDS of which it is an important component. The implementation must be coordinated by
the MOH, in concordance with the National Committee to combat AIDS (CCS-SIDA) and its
Secretariat, including the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The MOE and the local collectivities must
participate to supervision activities.



29
ii)    Responsibilities
Improving the HCWM means to clarify the responsibilities and the fields of competencies of each
institutional actor involved in this process.
At the central level, the MOH is responsible of the national health policy and ensures the
guardianship of the health facilities, through the National Health Direction. In this Direction,
the Department of Environmental Health should lead the implementation of the plan, because
(i) it is part of their mission, (ii) it has already realized activities in HCWM, (iii) it has
competent staff in this field, and (iv) it has decentralized services at provincial level. This
direction may be supported in the MOH, by the service charged of Health Education,
concerning all the activities of public information and awareness rising, and by the Training
Department. In the other ministries, it can be helped by the MOE. The MOVI is responsible of
HCWM only within health facilities.
At provincial and local levels, the coordination of the monitoring will be exercised by the
Health Direction in Provinces and Districts.
The Director of each health facility is responsible of HCWM in his establishment. He must
watch over the respect of procedures and regulations for good practices. He must designate the
teams charged of HCW segregation, collection, transportation and treatment.
The MOE is responsible of HCWM out of the health facilities. It must watch over the means of
collection, transportation and destruction of the wastes. In addition to this, the MOE must
watch over the respect of environmental norms and procedures, mainly the Environmental
Impacts Assessment.
The municipalities must take some dispositions to make sure that, in their public landfills, the
HCW are not mixed with general wastes. This in concordance with the health facilities and
private societies of solid wastes collection. They should also give their opinion about all the
activities of the HCWM Plan, which may have negative impacts on population's health.
b. Obiective 2: Population awareness rising
Concerning information and population awareness, no public education in the field of HCWM  is
covered within other health education programs, which are often oriented in health issues, rather than
HCWM. The actions led in the HCWM are insignificant and are most often oriented to the prevention
of infections and on some diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrhea, etc. All these programs
about population awareness do not include HCW issues and the hazardous linked with them and they
need strengthening in the way to cover these aspects. Awareness programs should mainly aim
scavengers, children playing on the landfills, population performing or receiving home health care and
those using recycled objects people living near the landfills. NGOs and BCOs enjoying a large
experience in proximity communication and health activities must conduct them.
Activity 2.1.  Inform population of dangers linked with HCW bad management of and reuse of
scavenged objects
- monthly messages on television (about darigers related to the handling of HCW)
- weekly radio messages (mainly in local languages);
- national awareness rising campaign (posters in health facilities, banderoles, monthly public
animation sessions in the provinces and districts).



30
c. Obiective 3: Train the hospital staff and wastes handlers
Activity 3.1.  Elaborate training programs and train trainers
-   Identify the training need and the groups to be trained in the health facilities and train trainers.
Activity 3.2.  Train all the operators acting in solid waste management
-  Train leading agents, doctors, nurses, health and sanitation technical teams at provincial and
district level, municipal technical services supervisors and supervisors of private societies
involved in wastes collection;
-  Train wastes handlers in health facilities (nurses, midwives, nurses' helps, cleaners, etc.).
Training modules should be adapted specifically to each category of concerned staff.
Activity 3. 3. Evaluate the training program implementation
Effective HCW control and monitoring in health facilities should be carried out regularly to supervise
periodically the training programs implementation, in order to improve waste management and to
ensure that good practices are actually performed after the training. Measures should be adopted to
ensure that problems and risks involved are identified while enhancing safety and preventing the
development of future problems. Enforcement and compliance with legislation shall be ensured
through a co-ordinating and regulatory body. Supervision should concern the following : segregation,
collection routinies and labelling, internal treatment system, internal storage of HCW, transportation,
worker safety measures, disposal at sanitary landfill, etc.
In addition to this, it is recommended to update pedagogical references of training institutions in
medicine, midwives and nurses schools, by taking into account HCWM issues in the programs.
d. Obiective 4: Support the private initiatives and partnership in HCWM
Activity 4.1.  Reinforce the managing capacities of privates societies involved in solid waste
management
Support the training of top ranking staffs in the following fields: choice of appropriate collection
equipments; efficient waste collection system; HCW handling; mastering of technologies' costs.
Activity 4.2.  Set up framework and partnership mechanisms between public sector, privates
and civil society involved in HCWM
-  Define the intervention fields and actors responsibilities in HCWM.
e. Objective 5: Improve HCWM in health facilities
Activity 5.1.  Supply health facilities materials and equipments for HCWM
-  Supply the health facilities HCW appropriate collection and storage materials;
-  Implement an efficient HCW treatment system (for example modem incinerators for central,
general and provincial hospitals; craft incinerators in the rural hospital, health centre and health
posts);
-  Realize liquid waste treatment systems in health facilities (septic pits with a chemical
disinfection system for the provincial hospitals, district hospitals and health centres; as for
central and general hospitals, a physic and chemical treatment is recommended).



31
Note: The health centres must be supplied specific boxes for needles and other sharp objects. Already
used empty bottles (flacons, mineral water bottles, etc.) could replace these boxes. Plastic containers
for temporary storage should be supplied to health care rooms.
Activity 5.2.  Promote the use of recyclable materials
The use of recyclable materials (drug containers and other plastic materials, flacons, empty bottles,
etc.) is a serious option in minimizing the volume of waste, because it would potentially reduce the
solid waste to be incinerated or treated in other ways. Packaging materials can be recycled (paper and
cardboard, glass, metal containers, plastic wrapping, etc). However, consideration should be given to
segregation of recyclable materials, according to the market opportunities. In this view, the
discrimination of these kinds of wastes can be more formal if a cooperation between scavengers active
in landfills and the responsible of health centres, is set up. This option will help to reduce infectious
risks in the landfills. Materials should only reused if they are designed for re-used. Plastic syringes
should discarded after use. The use of non-chlorine containing plastics will help to reduce the pollutant
products of solid wastes incineration.
f. Obiective 7: Ensure that HCW from home care are well-managed
The HIV/AIDS project would support community based and multisectoral activities outside the health
sector. Presumably, home based care and community care would be supported. Advances in medicine
now allow monitoring health family and treating some sickness at home. Such activities do have the
effect of introducing infectious wastes closer to households. These health care wastes include : used
needles, syringes and lancets, medicine unused or outdate, broken thermometers, etc. They must also
be managed at home where health cares are practiced, to avoid their mingling with household littering
and hazard risks. For example, it is noticed that razor blades are widely used at home (scarification,
etc.) and they can be sources of infection if they are not well managed. For this sake, it is necessary to
elaborate information and awareness programs (radio televised) towards the health agents or the
amateurs (professionals and clandestine) who exercise in the houses. The targeted actors must be
advised to have specific containers for needles, sharp objects (box, empty bottles, etc.) and other HCW
(cotton, gloves, bandages, etc.) and not to mix the HCW with the general wastes.
Used needles, syringes, lancets and other sharp may be safely disposed with other home solid wastes,
provided that special care is taken while packaging them. The safe packaging of these wastes may be
done very simply at home : one can use rigid plastic bottles (with a tight fitting lid), such as empty
laundry detergent bottle; and one must not put sharp objects in any container to be recycled or returned
to a store; needles and syringes don't need to be recapped. The rigid bottle will minimize possible
needle pricks and when they are full, the lid should be tightly fixed and the bottle placed with other
solid waste for disposal.
Unused and outdated medicines stored at home are considerable risks for children and careless people.
These medicines may be safely disposed when thrown into toilet. A thorough cleansing of empty
medicine containers with warm water should be done. After that, put the lid tightly then dispose with
other home solid waste. Medicines should be out of reach of children who should not play with unclean
empty medicine containers.
Contaminated bandages, pads, gloves, etc., may be double bagged in standard plastic waste bags and
securely fastened. This material may then be combined with other household waste for disposal.
As for condoms, they are not considered as Health Care Waste (they are protection materials against
HIV/AIDS infection). Anyway, it is possible, in the programs for public awareness rising, to draw
people's attention on the necessity of managing very well these wastes : not to throw the condoms



32
everywhere; after use, throw them into toilets, bury them safely or keep them in an appropriate place
and ensure that they will be destroyed after.
More specifically, health agents who exercise at home must have collection containers, which they
must carry to their health centre or in the nearest one. They should also have sterilizing product. The
amateurs (populations, non-professional, clandestine, etc.) must sterilize all the HCW before their
disposal. The needles must be buried if there is place for this inside the house; if not, they must be put
into bottles or other closed boxes, then evacuated to the public landfills. The other HCW (cotton,
gloves, bandages, etc.) could be disposed in the public landfill after sterilization. The gloves must be
torn to prevent people from re-using them.
g. Objective 6: Support the execution of HCWM Plan
Activity 6.1. Validate the HCWM Plan
-  Organize a national workshop to inform actors and to validate the HCWM Plan;
Activity 6.2.  Plan activities
- starting evaluation (wastes characterization and identification of needs);
- documents for activities implementation.
Activity 6.3. Follow the execution up, and evaluate the HCWM Plan
-  monthly control and monitoring at regional and national level;
- halfway appraisal (end of 2nd year);
- final appraisal (end of 5th year).

5. TRAINING AND AWARENESS STRATEGY
a. Health agents and collectors training:
The training and awareness program aims at: making operational the HCWM strategy; promoting the
emergence of experts and professionals in HCWM; raising the sense of responsibilities of people acting
in HCWM; safeguarding health and security of health staff and waste handlers. The training strategy
will be articulated around the following principles:
-  Training trainers: it means to train the top responsible in health centres (doctors, sanitation agents,
and technical services' supervising staff in municipalities and private societies).The training
sessions will be held in every health region;
-  Training health care staffs in health centres (medical staff, paramedical), by the already trained
responsible above mentioned. These training sessions will be held province by province and will be
perforned by the already trained key staff;
-  Training HCWM    staffs in health centres (nurses, helps caretakers, cleaners). These training
sessions will be held in health centres and will be performned by already trained key staff.
The training modules will deal with risks in the handling of HCW : sustainable management process
(collection, storage, transportation, treatment, disposal) ; good behaviors and practices ; caring for
installations ; protection measures. The training of medical and paramedical staffs remains a priority if
we want it to have a major impact in HCWM. The following axis will indicate the content of these
training modules:
Training module for wastes manageinent operators
- Information on the risks; advice about health and security
- Basic knowledge about procedures of wastes handling, including the management of risks.
- The use of protection and security equipments.
Training module for wastes transportation staff
- Risks linked with waste transportation;
- Procedures of wastes handling: loading and unloading;
- Equipments such as vehicles for wastes transportation;
- Projection equipments.
Training module for treatment systems operators
- treatment and operating process guidelines;
- healthi and security related to the operating system;
- procedures in emergency cases and help;
- technical procedures;
- caring for equipments.
- control of wastes productions;
- watching over the process and the remnants.
Training module for disposals managers
- Information about health and security
- Control of scavenging activities and recycling of used instruments;
- Protection equipments and personal hygiene;
- Secure procedures for the management of wastes at the disposals;
- Measures concerning, emergency cases and help.
b. Population awareness
The awareness rising strategy will aim at the population and scavengers. They must be informed about
dangers in HCW   handling. This objective can be reached through information and awareness
campaigns through local radio and television, but mostly, by animation sessions in popular districts
(organized by NGOs and CBOs acting in the health and environment management). These actions can
be reinforced by education campaigns (banderoles, posters) in highly frequented places.

6. TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES
a. Appraisal criteria
The HCW treatment systems should be efficient, environimenitally sound and accessible, so as to protect
persons from voluntary or accidental exposition to waste during the treatment process. Technology
choices should de done according to the following criteria:
- Performance and efficiency of treatment
-   Environmental viability.
-   Easiness and simplicity in the settling, the operating and care.
- The exchange parts should be available, easy to get.
- Costs of investments and operating.
- Social acceptability
In addition to this, proximity criteria must be taken into account. In fact the HCW treatment must be
done, as near the places where they are produced, as possible, whenever it is technically and
environmentally realizable.
b. Solid HCW treatment systems
i)     Microwave disinfection
This method is used to disinfect bio-medical waste in stationary or mobile plants. The waste is heated
by means of microwave energy. This option needs highi investment and operating costs and therefore
not recommended for use in health facilities.
ii)    Autoclave sterilization
This type of treatment is used in health facilities (medical analysis laboratories) for the sterilization of
reusable medical equipment. In this process, a dry heat sterilizer is used and heat of 1 80C is made to
act for 30 minutes or longer, for activating vegetative microorganisms and most bacterial spores. It
allows for only limited quantities of waste and therefore commonly used only for highly infectious
waste such as microbial cultures from clinical or researches laboratories. Autoclaving is
environmentally sound, requires fairly high investment and moderate operating costs and ensure good
disinfection efficiency under appropriate operating conditions. However, it cannot be used for all type
of waste and generates contaminates wastewater. In addition, operation requires qualified technicians
and shredders subject to frequent breakdown.
iii)   Incineration
Waste incineration is a thermal treatment, which aims to destroy waste organic parts, by
oxidation. It consists in burning correctly the HCW . We notice:
- Pyrolyse: its treatment capacity is from 500 to 3 000 kg wastes daily, at a combustion temperature
of 12000 or 1600 C ; it costs very expensive when investment and care taking are considered.
Also, highly qualified staff is needed. The remnants of wastes are sent to the disposals;
- Pyrolitic incinerator (modern incinerator): its treatment capacity is from 200 to 10 000 kg/daily,
with a combustion temperature from 800 to 9000 C ; its investment and care taking are somewhat
high; it needs qualified staff; the remnants are sent to the disposal sites;
- The incinerator with combustion room (Incinerator realized in a craft way, with local materials); Its
investment and care taking costs are relatively low; it can work, even with a little qualified staff.
Incineration provides very high disinfection efficiency and drastic reduction of weight and volume of
waste, is relatively low costed and no need qualified staff for operating. But it generates significant
pollutants emissions.



36
iv)    Chemical disinfection
Chemical disinfection, frequently used in health facilities to destroy microorganisms on medical
equipments, floors and walls, is now being extended to the treatment of biomedical wastes. Chemicals
are put in the waste to destroy or inactivate the pathogenis. This treatment usually is more efficient as in
disinfection than in sterilization. Chemical disinfection is most suitable for treating liquid waste such as
blood, urine, stools or hospital sewage. Solid (and even highly hazardous) biomedical wastes, including
microbiological cultures, sharps, etc., may also be disinfected chemically. Chemical products such as
hypo chlorine and other acids are used to destroy pathogen, before wastes are thrown or burned in
disposal sites. T he most frequent chemical disinfecting are:
-   chlorine which is a universal disinfecting, very active against micro-organisms. In case of possible
HIIV/AIDS infectious, concentration of 5 g/liter (5000ppm) of chlorine are recommended;
-   formaldehyde which is an active gas against all micro-organisms except at low temperature
(<20C); the relative humidity must be near 7 %. It is also sold in the form of gas dissolute into
water at concentrations of 370 g / liters. This disinfecting product is recommended for Hepatitis
and Ebola virus (but not for HIV/AIDS). A part from this, the formaldehyde can cause cancer.
-   The drawback of this system is that the disilfected wastes are still there and other methods of final
elimination must be devised.
This method gives highly efficient disinfection in good operating conditions, and some chemical
disinfectant are relatively inexpenisive. But it requires highly qualified technicians for operating the
process.
v)     Burial in municipal landfills
This practice consists in putting the FICW directly at municipal disposals. In fact, it is not a treatment
system: the wastes are stored with household littering. This system requires very low investments, but
it presents huge health and environmental risks, if wve consider the undesirable scavenging practices at
public landfills. However, landfilinig is better than leaving hazardous wastes accumulated at hospitals
or other publicly accessible places. More suitable treatment methods should immediately be envisaged.
vi)     Burial inside health facilities
The burial at the very place of HCW production, is another form of elimination mainly used in health
facilities where there is no treatment system or means of waste transportation to public landfills. The
risk in this case is that the destruction of infected wastes is not sure according to the burial place. Also,
there is always the risk of digging out wastes, most of all, the sharp objects.
vii)   Open air burning
When done at open air, the burning of HCW constitutes a factor of pollution and harm to the
environment. Since it is generally burned in a hole, the destruction is never complete: often quantity of
unburned constitutes 70 % of wastes. This encourages children and scavengers to look for toys and
reusable objects.
viii)  Encapsulation
This method consists to dispose wastes to land, by filling metal or plastic container to 3/4 with waste and
fill up with plastic foam, bituminous sand, cement mortar or clay material. The process is cheap, safe
and very appropriate for health centres that cannot envisage other methods to treat sharps, chemical and
pharmaceutical waste. Encapsulation is not recommended for non-sharps infectious waste. The main
advantage is to prevent even more effectively the risk of scavengers getting access to landfills and to
reduce mobilization of toxic substances.

d. Recommendations
The comparative analysis, based on the above mentioned economic and technical criteria, allows the
recommendation of:
- modern incinerators in Central, general and provincial hospital, because of its fairly low cost;



38
incinerators built with local material, in rural hospital, health centres and health posts, because of
its very low cost and small quantities of HCW produced in these facilities.
However, inadequate incineration, or incineration of non-incinerable (halogenated plastic, radioactive
waste, reactive chemical waste, silver salts or radiographic waste, mercury or cadmium, heavy metals,
etc.) waste can release pollutants into the air. The incineration of materials containing chlorine can
generate dioxins and furans, which are classified as possible human carcinogens and can have other
adverse effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal contents (in particular: lead,
mercury and cadmium) can increase the spread of heavy metals in the environment. Dioxins, furans
and metals are persistent and remain in the environment. Materials containing chlorine or metal should
therefore not be incinerated.
That is why waste incineration is fundamentally based on a strategy of segregation at source, to reduce
maximally the infectious wastes and prevent the contamination of other wastes (papers, plastic objects,
etc.). All types of wastes must not be incinerated, mainly the non-incinerable ones above mentioned.
So, the waste segregation will allow the non-contaminated, non-infectious and non-incinerable wastes
disposal at municipal landfills. Only the contaminated wastes (needles, sharp objects, blood stained
cottons, etc.) are reserved for incineration. The latters don't produce  (or produce a little) toxic
elements. In addition, this system of treatment allows a complete melting of needles, which are the
main vectors of accidental transmission of HIV/AIDS.
Modern incinerators, with special emission-treating equipment, are able to work at 800-1000 C, and
can ensure that no dioxins and furans, or only insignificant quantities are produced. Smaller models,
built with local materials and able to operate at these high temperatures are currently being field-tested
and implemented in some countries.
In the health centres, the quantities of HCW produced are insignificant. If the segregation is really
performed, the quantities to be incinerated will be more reduced and the negative impacts on
environment insignificant. In addition, the promotion of the use of non-chlorine plastic containers can
reduce pollutanit products in solid waste incineration.
Even if incinieration is more and more criticized, it is difficult to choose another system for developing
countries such as Mozambique, given the economic and technical conditions. It is necessary to precise
that we should not incinerate all solid urban waste (household littering, industrial wastes, etc.), but only
the selected contaminated health care wastes. In addition, this technology is not totally disapproved by
the WHO. In fact, during vaccination campaigns against tuberculosis in Togo and Benin (West African
countries), the WHO has implementing, since 2001, craft incinerators (made of local materials, cement
with clay), in order to destroy the syringes' needles. Beforehand, the WHO had organized a specific
workshop in Bamako in 2001, to train some African technicians in the building of these types of
incinerators. These models can reach very high temperatures (800 C) able to get the needles and sharp
objects melted (the model is shown in the annex of the report).
Presently, there are not in fact any environmentally sound options at low-cost for safe disposal of
infectious wastes. Incineration of wastes has been widely practiced, but alternatives, which may be
preferable under certain circumstances, are becoming available, such as autoclaving, chemical
treatment and microwaving. Landfilling, when safely practiced, may also be a viable solution for part
of the already segregated wastes.
Autoclave, microwaves systems are surely more efficient and environmentally sound, but more
difficult to realize too; they are very expensive and require qualified staff for operating. They cannot be
used for all types of waste and generate contaminated wastewater. Chemical disinfection requires



39
chemical products permanently and qualified staff for operating; the so disinfected wastes should be
sent to landfill disposals or other systems of disposal.
The Maputo CHU has got two modem incinerators which are not yet installed because of
environmental preoccupations about this system ; the result is that a large area of the hospital yard has
become a wild landfill; because of dangers related to infectious wastes, the collection by municipal
services is not regular; so, it is a source of harms for the hospital staff, the patients and visitors. This
kind of situation is worst than the impacts of incineration.
It is therefore important that where incineration is recommended, it should be accompanied by: (i)
appropriate skills training of those who will operate the incinerators; (ii) appropriate and continuous
monitoring of level of inflammability and type of waste incinerated.
Whenever incinerators become an increasingly difficult option to use, the following treatment systems
should be proposed:
Chemical disinfection:
-      This method gives a highly efficient disinfection, and some chemical disinfectants are not
expensive. As for drawbacks, the method requires highly qualified technicians for operating
and it is inadequate for pharmaceutical, chemical and some types of infectious waste. In
central, general and provincial hospitals, which produce rather important quantities of HCW,
the latters should be disinfected with chemical products, then evacuated to the public landfills
where specific areas have been prepared before hand.
Disposal at municipal landfills:
-      In case hazardous health-care waste cannot be treated or disposed elsewhere, direct bury,ing in
the municipal landfill should be recommended. To prevent the important disease burden
currently created by these wastes, it is necessary : to prepare specific areas for that, to limit
access to this place (wire fencing and lock) and to bury the waste quickly to avoid a contact
with people or animals. It is a temporary solution before more suitable treatment methods are
found.
Burying inside hospital premises:
-      In health centres where the HCW production is rather little, a ditch should be dug. Its bottom
and walls must be cemented (or stabilized) to ovoid the water napkin contamination and
prevent the walls from collapsing. The HCW thrown in the ditch must be covered with sand.
The same procedure is repeated every time a new quantity of HCW is disposed, until the hole
is full; in such a case, another hole is dug nearby. The hole must be protected to avoid access
and accidents. The main drawback is that burial places are not always available inside the
health centres.
Anyway, in all cases, the principle of waste segregation at their sources of production must be
seriously respected, to minimize the contamination of general wastes by the infectious ones.
The other systems (autoclave, microwaves, etc.) are too expensive and need highly qualified staff to
handle them, though they are more secure for the environment. In case of malfunction, the exchange
parts are not always available locally. So, these types of technologies should not be recommended in
Mozambique, given the present economic situation.



40
e. Sharps and needle treatment
Plrobably the most frequent risk is created by sharps (needles, scalpel blades, bloods vials, glassware,
etc.) in contact with infectious germs. In the health facilities, needles and sharps should be collected in
non-reusable containers, such as puncture-proof "sharps boxes", specific cardboard, metal or plastic
boxes, or in empty rigid plastic bottles (with a tight fitting lid), if financial resources are not available).
One must not put sharp objects in any container to be recycled or returned to a store.

The melting of sharps in incinerators is very efficient. Whenever incinerators become an increasingly
difficult option to use, encapsulation (filling metallic or plastic containers up to 3/4 with wastes then
filling up with cement, bituminous sand, etc.), chemical disinfecting, storage in specific containers
(then landfill burial), should be recommended because of their very low cost. Autoclaving is a very
efficient system, but it is very expensive.

f. Liiuid wastes collection and treatment
As for the liquid wastes, there are many treatment systems among which: (i) physic and chemical
treatment; (ii) intensive biological systems (activated mud system; biological disk; bacterial field, etc.);
(iii) septic pits; (iv) disinfection; (v) decanting and digesting basin; lagooning, etc.

- No investments in infrastructures
Disinfection is clearly the most efficient way to deal with liquid infectious wastes. That is why this
option should be favored among the other interventions, because the HCWM plan is focused especially
on HIV/AIDS related waste management. Consequently, a combined system (disinfection then storage
in septic pits) is recommended for the provincial hospitals, district hospitals and health centres, which
don't produce much liquid waste. For the central and general hospitals, a physic and chemical
treatment, comprising a disinfection system, is recommended. The implementation of this option
requires a feasibility study.
g. Choice of landfills sites
In Maputo, the incineration remnants, which are considered as household littering, can be disposed in
the public municipal landfill, if specific burial areas are prepared, mainly to receive sharp objects not
melted during the process. These types of waste hurt scavengers and street children even though they
are sterilized during incineration. At provincial and level, the remaining wastes after buming can be
buried inside health centres.

7. PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK AND FUNDING
a. Involved actors' potential field of intervention
The national strategy of struggle against HIV/AIDS relies on the involvement of all-public and private
sectors, NGOs, Associations and civil society. So it necessary to establish a partnership framework to
determine the roles and responsibilities of each category of actors.
Table 13      Potential field of intervention
Actors                                      Potential field of intervention

organizations    and -  participate in information and populations awareness
other   environmental -  help in the mobilization of populations

b. Involvement of private societies in HCWM
The HCW collection is a major preoccupation for all the public and private health facilities. According
to the regulations about environment, the health facilities must ensure a sustainable management of
their wastes. In Mozambique, the Health facilities have very limited financial resources. No public
health establishment has a paid collection service of wastes. But in Maputo, certain private clinics have
such type of service. For the health facilities having got incinerators, the collection does not matter. For
the private cabinets, the major constraints are the absence of alternative solution for their present
practices consisting in: HCW mingling with general wastes; anarchical disposal. Most of them can't
afford appropriate equipment for treatment. They all manifest their will and availability to participate
to an institutional arrangement, in order to treat their HCW, in a system where the costs are shared in



43
common agreement. In this line, a system of public-private partnership can be devised on the basis of
following principles:
-  supply of incinerators to publics health facilities, in order to polarize a referential area;
- obligation of health centres equipped with incinerators, to polarize private cabinets located in their
area and to receive their HCW, in a system where the costs are shared in common agreement;
- obligation of the private health cabinets, so polarized, to contract a paid collection service.
To better ensure the privates' involvement in the process of HCW collection, it is necessary to get
incitement measures ready, mainly reinforcement of their capacities in HCWM. It is also necessary to
improve financial resources allotted to HCWM in the hiealth facilities.
8. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MEASURES
a. Measures for reduction of incinerators and landfills negative impacts
The operating of incinerators has negative impacts on environment and health. Anyway, when we
consider the very reduced quantities of FICW to be incinerated daily by every establishment, it is
obvious that the environmental and health impacts are not significant and the harm caused will not be
big. Nevertheless, the following measures should be taken: for the installation, it is better to choose,
inside the health facilities, places distant from the admission rooms and health care rooms; concerning
the noise and harms in operation, it is better to start incineration by night, to reduce harm caused by
smokes.
Moreover, the promotion of the use of non-chlorine plastic containers is a recognized means of
reducing the pollutant products from  solid wastes incineration. In this way, they should be
recommended as dustbins for waste collection.
As for the large central disposal sites, wire fencing and lock could be realized to reinforce security and
to minimize the access of scavengers and children. These protection measures will allow (i) to control
and regulate the access to the landfill, (ii) to identify the scavengers and (iii) to put the users aware.
b. Social measures
The execution of the HCWM Plan might have negative social impacts on scavengers earning their
daily living at landfills. Their income may decrease with a well-organized management of HCW,
mainly when segregation is done at the source. It is possible, through partnership with health centres, to
give non-infectious reusable objects (such as empty bottles) directly to scavengers, or at least authorize
them to come and collect them according to well-defined modalities.
For the populations neighboring the landfills, the risks of being driven away and resettled in other areas
are minor. Generally, these populations did not come to settle around the landfills : instead, the
disposals sites have been created inside these districts.
There are cultural issues relating to disposal of anatomical wastes (amputated body parts, placenta,
etc.), about which communities may be strongly sensitive. These cultural aspects should be taken into
account in the action plan, to better ensure the populations involvement in the implementation. For
example : the placenta could be buried or put in septic pits, as it is the case presently in some health
facilities; generally, anatomical wastes such as the body parts are buried inside the hospital; they can
also be given to the patients or their family if they claims for it; liquid wastes from washing of the dead
are generally evacuated in septic pits. Generally, people don't find any harm in these methods.

9. THE MONITORING PLAN
a. Principles
To measure the efficiency of the HCWM Plan, as far as the reduction of infections is concerned,
mainly in the health centres, the mentioned activities should be monitored and evaluated, in
collaboration with of the institutions concerned : MOH, MOE, municipalities, NGOs, etc.
b. Methodolo2y
The HCWM Plan will be executed in 5 years and the implementation monitoring will be the following:

d. Institutional arrangements for the implementation
The execution of the HCWM Plan components means to clearly define the institutional arrangement
for the implementation. In fact, the training and capacity reinforcement needs should be defined on the
ground of the actors' responsibilities. In addition to this, we should verify if the required human and
institutional capacities are available or not. So, the following institutional arrangements are proposed:
i)     Improvement of regulation in HCWM
In this component, the technical guidelines about HCWM should be improved in the health facilities.
National consultants having acquired a large experience in HCWM, under the control and supervision
of DEH must realize this task.
ii)    Training
The training activities should be led by the Training Department of the MOH, but this structure hasn't
the require competence in HCWM and will be obliged every time to rely on the DEH. So, the training
activities may be co-piloted by these two institutions: the DEH ensuring technical expertise and the
Training Department ensuring that activities are in conformity with the training strategy of the MOH.



46
At regional and local levels, control of training activities should be assigned to the Provincial and
District Directions. The specific training activities will be done in the first two years of the program.
National Consultants will train trainers in health facilities, but also in the other institutions
(municipalities, private societies, etc.). Then, the so trained key staff should train their employees.
The DElI and the Provincial and District Directions haven't got enough human resources to prepare
and diffuse the training courses about HCWM. The DEH could prepare the TOR, and do the control
and supervision at national level while Provincial and District Directions would assure the monitoring
at local level.
So, the following is proposed:
-      The DEH prepares the Terms of References of training programs,(with the support of The
Training Department of MOH), and does the control and supervision at national level;
-      National Consultants having acquired a large experience in HCWM will prepare the training
courses;
-      In each province, a training trainers workshop will be held and will be animated by national
consultants having acquired a large experience in HCWM, under the supervision of Provincial
Directions. The latter's must prepare periodical reports to be sent at the central level
(DEH/MOH);
-      In each health facility, the supervising staff trained in the provincial workshops will ensure the
training of medical and paramedical staff, cleaners, etc. The heads of the health establishments
must supervise this work and prepare periodical evaluation reports.
iii)   Population awareness rising
The Department of Public Education of the MOH will lead the activities intended to make the
populations aware about the HCW. At local level, Provincial and District Directions will do the
supervision. These activities will cover the 5 years of the program, through district animations, radio
and television messages, posters, etc., and will be done as follows:
-      The Department of Public Education of the MOH will elaborate, with the help of the DEH, the
content of these messages, of posters and district animation;
-      The televised messages will be diffused by the National Station;
-      The radio messages will be diffused by the local radio stations, in Portuguese and local
languages, under the supervision of Provincial and District Directions;
-      Private societies (printing enterprises) will make posters to be dealt in the health centres;
-      Public animation sessions will be led by NGOs acting in the health and the environmental field,
under the supervision of Provincial and District Directions.
iv)    Strategy for privates involvement and partnership
The elaboration of motivating measures for private societies acting in waste management, and the
mechanisms intended to get them involved in HCWM, will be coordinated by the MOH, in
concordance with the other ministries.
v)     National workshop for launching the HCWM Plan
The National workshop for launching the HCWM Plan will be organized by the DEH/MOH. It will be
an occasion of realizing a national consensus around the Plan.
vi)    The starting evaluation and planning of activities
National consultants, controlled by Provincial Directions under the supervision of DEH, will realize the
starting evaluation, which must be done at the beginning of the project. During this step, the



47
consUltants will indicate the situation prevailing presently in the health facilities, elaborate evaluation
criteria, and prepare the execution plan.
vii)   Control and monitoring of the execution of HCWM plan
At provincial level, it is recommended that the control should be done by Provincial and District
Directions which will ensure the monthly monitoring, while the yearly follow up will be realized by
DEH.
viii)  Evaluation of the HCWM Plan
It is recommended to assign this evaluation to international consultants, to ensure its neutrality. This
evaluationn must be done halfway over (at the end of the 2nd year) and at the end of the project.
e. Timetable
The following timetable indicates the implementation schedule of HCWM Plan.

Before such an elaborate plan is implemented, certain activities can be started immediately, and the
others realized in medium/long term.
The following actions could be realized immediately:
-      elaboration and dissemination of technical basic guidelines in HCWM
-      elaboration of in HCWM training program
-      elaboration of public awareness rising modules and supports
-      planning of starting activities
-      set up HCWM procedures in health facilities, including health staff responsibilities
In short term:
-      training trainers
-      training all the stakeholders involved in the HCWM
-      diffusing of public awareness rising modules
-      assessment of training program implementation
-      halfway appraisal
In medium/longer term:
-      bettering the HCWM in the health facilities
-      Support the private initiatives and partnership in HCWM
-      Monitoring and evaluation of the HCWM plan

10. THE HCWM PLAN COSTS
The Management Plan is meant to initiate a process of proper handling, disposal and management of
medical waste, and as such, one should not expect that an HIV/AIDS project will totally assume the
responsibility of baring all the cost involved. Instead, the project should embark on the following
aspects: (i) Training of hospital workers, waste handlers, municipal waste collectors, dump site
managers, pickers and other; (ii) Awareness building programs of the general public and government
officials; (iii) Consultation with the relevant Government authorities to initiate policy formulation and
formulation of rules and regulations which are enforceable; and (iv) Help initiate private /public/ civil
society partnerships for waste collection and management. Under this view, the proposed plan is
oriented only towards the HIV/AIDS related waste management within the health sector (and not
towards the whole health sector). It is structured in the way where the project will be assigned specific
functions. So, the HCWM Plan *focuses institutional and legal framework, training and public
awareness, at a cost of $1.177 million and it should be totally financed by HIV/AIDS program.

11. COSTS OF HCWM PLAN COMPLEMNTARY MEASURES
Other aspects such as HCWM improvement in health centres should be left to central Government
(MOH and MOE). It is up to them to take these aspects into account, in the framework of a health
project or a waste management project. These complementary measures for HCWM plan, which cost
$1.260 millions, are necessary in the process of bettering HCWM in health facilities (provision of
incinerators or other treatment systems, dustbins, security equipments, etc.). They constitute a
framework of potential intervention for the governmental institutions (MOH, MOE) which could
realize these activities according to their priorities and their financial resources. These long-term
aspects should be left to governmental institutions.

The handling, collection, disposal and management of HIV/AIDS infected materials are the most
significant environmental issue in this project. A Medical Waste Management Plan which will be
appropriately costed with clear institutional arrangements for its execution will be prepared during project
preparation. Inappropriate handling of HIV/AIDS infected materials constitute a risk not only for the staff
in hospitals and other health care centers, but also for families and street children who scavenge on dump
sites. Some aspects of project implementation, for example the establishment of HIV/AIDS voluntary
counseling and testing clinics, the purchase of equipment by communities for home care of people living
with HIV/AIDS, and the promotion of the use of condoms etc. could potentially constitute an increase in
the environmental and health risk associated with handling of HIV/AIDS infected waste.
Proiect Justification
The HIV/AIDS epidemic now poses the paramount threat to development in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Responding to this development crisis, the Africa Region of the World Bank adopted a new strategy,
Intensifyilng Action Against HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa. In order to outpace the epidemic and to
avert its potential consequences, the Africa Region has designed the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program
for Africa (MAP), of which the Mozambique HIV/AIDS Response project is a component. scales up
successful interventions to comprehensive national programs encompassing multiple sectors and
implementers, thus elevating HIV/AIDS beyond the health sector to a fundamental development issue.
The consistent and streamlined approach in the MAP framework throughout the region would enhance
the effectiveness and efficiency of Bank interventions in contributing to nationbuilding efforts in Sub-
Saharan Africa in general and Mozambique in particular.
Project supported activities will complement the activities of existing programs financed by various
donors and NGOs which are already engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Mozambique. The
project will channel resources through both the public sector (line ministries and municipalities) and the
private sector ( both for-profit and not-for-profit).
Detailed Project Description
The project will have the following components: 1) Capacity Building; 2) Public Sector Initiatives with
the two sub-components of a) National Initiatives and b) Municipality Initiatives; 3) Civil Society and
Private Sector Initiatives; and 4) Project Coordination. The Capacity building component will support
capacity building for both the public sector and the civil society/private sector initiatives. The public
sector initiatives component will support the HIV/AIDS activities of line ministries and municipalities
while the civil society /private sector initiatives component will support the activities of civil society
organizations and the private sector. The project coordination component will support the functions of the
National Committee to combat AIDS (CCS-SIDA) and its Secretariat, including the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU).
Study Objective
The objective of the study is to identify the level of Health Care Waste Management that will be relevant
to help implement and enforce proper health and environmentally sound, technically feasible,
economically viable, and socially acceptable systems for management of health care waste in
Mozambique.



(J
Thie examination of the of the current practices with regard to the handling of hospital waste will verify
both the management of waste within the hospitals, clinics and other health care centers as well as the
management by local authorities once the waste has left the source. It will also look into the level of
knowledge among health care staff and local authorities about safe disposal practices to be adopted for
medical waste and into the availability of capacity to deal with this type of waste.
Scope of the Study
Task I
Assess the Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework as well as the Regulatory Framework on
health care waste management and treatment /destruction facility in the country including air emission
standards which are currently required by law and which would likely be required in the next say ten
years.
*      Identify permit requirements, including environmental building, and other permits and
procedures that health care waste treatment/destruction facilities would need to address.
*      Outline any public participation or public hearing requirements and procedures. For each
requirement, list the lead agency to be contacted.
Assess the typical time demands for proposed facilities to obtain permits and address environmental
impact requirements and public participation requirements.
Identify all healthcare facilities in the country and include basic information for each facility, such as
number of beds, bed occupancy rate, specialization, divided into categories such as: National Hospitals,
Regional Hospitals, etc.
Assess the health care waste generation at (i) the two national hospitals in Mozambique; (ii) one other
general hospital (e.g. Sal) and; (iv) one private clinic. The details should include the minimum weight
of total waste generated at each health care facility per week. Composition of the waste should be
determined through segregation at the waste end point and extrapolation of the results to cover the
entire country.
Assess the level of scavenging, if any, or recycling taking place inside health care facilities, along
transportation routes, and at final disposal sites. Determine social issues in relation to scavenging
taking place.
Review and analyze existing health care waste storage, collection and disposal systems with due regard
for level of separation, the frequency of collection; and environmental and health impacts for existing
treatment.
Task 11
Determination of Technology and Siting Facility:
Determination of Technology
For the types and quantities of health care waste generated in the study area, assess alternative
technologies and facility sizes for treatment and destruction. The assessment shall compare the
alternatives on the basis of capital cost, operating cost, ease of operation, local availability of spare
parts, local availability of operational skills, demonstrated reliability, durability, and environmental
impact. The technologies to be considered include: safe land filling, incineration, sterilization
(Autoclave and Microwave ) and Chemical disinfection. On the basis of this assessment, recommend a
process flow for economic and environmentally sound treatment and final disposal of health care waste
leading to selection of appropriate technology. The final decision on choice should be made by the
Government and /or facility.
Determination of Disposal Sites
If site for disposal exists, collect all existing plans of suitable sites to be considered for the locations of
the treatment facility(ies) and review general transport and traffic systems relative to appropriate sites.



Consider (a) accessibility to the site; (b) distance from hiealth care facilities to the site; (c) distance to
sensitive areas; (d) future development plans of the area; (e) possibility to acquire the area; (f) cultural
and historical sites; (g) public opinion; (h) noise and dust impact to nearby areas. Public consultation
/hearing must be held as part of the final assessment for siting of the treatment facility.
Analysis of site
Analyze the above information to determine whether there is sufficient appropriate material on site for
daily and final cover, whether the site soil, hydrological and geo-hydrological conditions would ensure
adequate protection of any ground and surface water used for drinking and/or irrigation. If the sites
prove to be unsuitable, inform the client stating the reasons.
Financing
The National Government or local government, potentially in conjunction with other municipal solid
waste treatment and disposal activities, may finance a regional facility. An alternative approach is for
the private sector to provide the health care waste treatment and disposal activities or waste transport
for the entire region/island.
Assess private sector participation as service provider.
* Assess public-private partnerships and cost recovery at the national, island or municipal level, based on
the polluter pays principle, where each health care facility contributes according to the volume of waste
generated.
Task Ill
Review existing training and public awareness programs on health care waste management at hospitals
and other health care establishments and prepare training needs assessment.
Working in conjunction with the relevant government institutions and Municipalities, prepare a costed
training program and a well targeted Awareness Building Campaign Program including the general
public, and more specifically health care workers, municipality workers, dump site managers, nurses,
scavengers/pickers, families and street children. The design of the material required for the awareness
building programs should be discussed with the relevant authorities and the general public to ensure that
their concerns that are deemed appropriate are incorporated in the design of the program, siting layouts,
mitigation measures and community communication programs. The Training and Awareness Building
Program and the Management Program shall be appropriately costed and the Plan shall be presented in a
National Workshop.
