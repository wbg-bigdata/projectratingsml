1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       As Mozambique entered the new millennium it was estimated that the country had one of
the fastest growing AIDS epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa with an adult HIV prevalence rate of
roughly 12 percent (2000). 1 Multiple factors converged to create an environment of high
vulnerability, including: a long and protracted civil war, large population movements, proximity
to high prevalence countries which hosted its refugees (e.g. Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland,
Malawi and South Africa), and a deterioration of the physical infrastructure and social fabric.
The highest prevalence rates were found along the major trade corridors and in areas with migrant
miners, while the North had the lowest rates.

2.      HIV/AIDS was prioritized as a major development issue in both Mozambique‘s Five
Year Program, 2000-2005 and its Poverty Reduction Strategy. With a per capita GNP of only
US$210 there was broad-based recognition that tackling HIV/AIDS would require a multi-
sectoral approach which dealt with poverty and vulnerability, the underlying causes of the
epidemic.

3.      The Bank‘s 2001-2003 Country Assistance Strategy (Document 20521) cited HIV/AIDS
as the single largest threat to Mozambique‘s development prospects and proposed this US$55
million operation to establish the foundation for the national response when few partners were on
the ground. The project was part of the second phase of the Multi-country AIDS Program for the
Africa Region (MAP), launched in 2000, which aimed to ―dramatically increase access to
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs, with emphasis on vulnerable groups‖.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

4.       After the first case of AIDS was detected in 1986, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
established the National AIDS Control Program in 1988 and developed three medium term plans
over the following decade. The Council of Ministers adopted the first Strategic Plan to Combat
HIV/AIDS and STDs, 2000-2002, (PEN) which was developed in a consultative and participatory
fashion. A National Council to Combat HIV/AIDS (CNCS) was established in May 2000 with
the following strategic directions: (i) to focus on priority vulnerable groups (e.g. young girls; and
highly mobile populations including soldiers, miners, prisoners, truck drivers and commercial sex
workers); (ii) to ensure relevance (i.e. interventions should be efficacious); (iii) to empower
people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and contribute to reducing stigma; and (iv) to target the
major trade corridors (Maputo, Beira and Nacala) and the surrounding communities.

5.       The campaign against HIV/AIDS was originally led by the MOH, but with the approval
of the PEN the leadership shifted to the CNCS. Professional staff was assigned to each province
and national coordination fora were held annually. Thematic groups were formed on the main
strategic areas (e.g. prevention, home-based care, VCT and orphans).

6.     The timing of the HIV/AIDS Response Project (HARP) was opportune as Mozambique
had few partners and large funding gaps. 2 The operation provided critical support following up to


1
  Adult prevalence estimate was based on the first national surveillance data (MOH, 2000). For Maputo city,
which has most data available, adult prevalence increased from 1 percent in 1988, to 9.9 percent in
1998,and further to 13.0 percent in 2000.
2
  While donors had originally pledged around US$120 million for the PEN, this funding was not
forthcoming and HARP was the first large contribution towards its implementation.


                                                    1
the Health Sector Recovery Project, which supported the country‘s health sector rebuilding
efforts. During implementation many DPs came on board to support the national response, of
which the largest included PEPFAR and GFATM, which brought with it the country coordinating
mechanism (CCM).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.       The Project Development Objective, as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
is to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and mitigate the effects of the epidemic
through prevention and care activities. While the Development Grant Agreement (DGA)
articulated the PDO in a slightly different way 3, the version in the PAD is the one which was used
for tracking implementation progress and project performance.

8.      The original key outcome/impact indicators are as follows:
         By 2008 HIV prevalence amongst pregnant women in the 15-24 age group has been
           reduced by 25% from 2000 levels.
         By 2008 the age of sexual debut has increased by one year over the 2002 age.
         By 2008 the number of sexual partners outside of primary union in last 12 months for
           persons 15-49 has declined by 25% from 2002 level.
         By 2008 the rate of condom use in sexual encounters outside of the primary
           relationship in last 12 months by persons 15-19 has declined 25% from 2002 levels.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.      The project was restructured in June 2007 to take explicitly into account that IDA was
only one player in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The revised PDO is: ―to contribute? to slow the
spread of HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and mitigate the effects of the epidemic through prevention
and care activities.

10.     There were also changes made to key outcome indicators. The indicator concerning the
drop in HIV prevalence was dropped, as the Bank project could not be held accountable for such
an outcome. To better align outcome indicators to the standard United Nations General Assembly
Special Session on AIDS (UNGASS) indicators that the national program adopted, several other
adjustments were made as discussed below under the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) (Section
2.3).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     Given that Mozambique had a generalized epidemic it was expected that the entire
population would benefit from information education communications (IEC) and behavioral
change communications and other advocacy and awareness creation interventions, as well as




3
 In the Development Grant Agreement the PDO is to ―assist the Government of Mozambique to finance the
implementation of its National Strategic Plan to Combat HIV/AIDS and STDs. The strategy is designed to
slow the spread of HIV/AIDS infection and mitigate the effects of the epidemic, through prevention, care,
treatment and mitigation activities.‖




                                                   2
targeted voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), promotion of condoms, and improved access to
HIV health services. The project would benefit high risk groups, including young people
especially girls; PLWHIV, orphans, highly mobile workers, teachers, soldiers, miners, prisoners
and commercial sex workers. It would also benefit populations in high transmission geographic
areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.     The project had five components:

Component 1: Community and Civil Society Initiatives (US$ 28 million). This component would
empower communities to respond effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A central activity
would be mobilizing communities, promoting local initiatives and strengthening the capacity of
local actors. A Community and Civil Society Facility held by CNCS would be created to finance
appropriate HIV/AIDS related activities carried out by eligible applicants, such as community
and faith based organizations, NGOs, the private sector, associations and other organizations. The
management of the Facility would be decentralized to the provincial level.

Component 2: Capacity Building for the Civil Society HIV/AIDS Response (US$5.5 million)
would support efforts to create AIDS competent communities by improving skills and increasing
implementation capacity of implementers, supporters, and target groups active under the
Community and Civil Society Initiatives. Activities to be funded would include hiring and
training ―Facilitating Agents‖ in each province, courses and activities to build awareness and
capacity for leadership in the public sector, civil society and private sector, and the formulation
and distribution of training modules and packages of IEC materials.

Component 3: Government Multi-sector Response (US$ 7 million): Ministries and subordinate
institutions would be supported in the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS related
programs directed toward their own personnel (particularly high risk staff such as soldiers, police,
extension agents, teachers, health workers) and their families, as well as programs directed
towards their clients. The program would concentrate on non-health ministries and other key
public sector institutions to effectively respond to the epidemic, with emphasis on prevention and
care for infected and affected families. In each ministry a Focal Point would be appointed. With
guidance from provincial Government and Ministry of State Administration, District
Administrators would be engaged to foster development of District HIV/AIDS plans.

Component 4: Strengthening and Scaling Up Health Sector Services for HIV/AIDS (US$17.5
million) aimed to scale up the response of the health sector to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to
provide technical leadership on treatment and care for people living with HIV/AIDS. The
component would support (i) strengthening of the Integrated Health Network providing voluntary
counseling and testing and HIV/AIDS related services in four central provinces; (ii) increasing
the supply of HIV related drugs and supplies, condoms, drugs for opportunistic infections, anti-
retroviral for the prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) of HIV and post-exposure
prophylaxis; (iii) strengthening clinical laboratory capacity for CD4 monitoring and diagnosis of
opportunistic infections; (iv) measures to enhance bio-security; (v) measures to enhance blood
safety; (vi) training and anti-retroviral drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis for health workers;
(vii) improved management of opportunistic infections; and (viii) monitoring and evaluation of
the component and the overall progress of the epidemic.




                                                 3
Component 5: Institutional Development for Program Management (US$6 million) supported
the Executive Secretariat of the CNCS, strengthening its capacity to lead the country in the
campaign.

1.5 Revised Components
13.    The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.      Three significant changes are noteworthy over the life of the project. The first set of
changes was made in the initial years (2004-2006) of the project to fine-tune the design, to better
adapt to evolving country needs, to improve implementation and performance. This involved
several minor amendments to the DGA. The second set of changes which took place in the final
years of the project (2007-2009) was probably the single most important as it involved
modifications to the PDO, outcome indicators, and financing modalities. The August 2007
restructuring required Board approval as it involved a modification to the PDO. 4 It also
introduced an innovative financing modality whereby IDA funds were pooled in a Common Fund
with those from other development partners, reducing the transaction cost for the government.

15.      The final set of changes resulted in modifications to the institutional and governance
structures for the project and national program. The October 2009 amendment took into account
the new Grant Management Agency (GMA) established in MOH to channel funds and facilitate
implementation of project activities in participating ministries, CSOs and sub-grant beneficiaries.
This resulted in a new governance structure as the GMA would take over some of the roles and
responsibilities of the CNCS which would now focus on coordination, facilitation and oversight
of the national response. 5

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     The project was prepared in an efficient manner to respond quickly to the government‘s
request for support. Many of the early lessons from MAP II 6 were effectively incorporated into
the design of this operation. Project preparation focused on implementation arrangements,
engaging civil society groups, piloting of community based programs, and strengthening
fiduciary capacity of the CNCS. PEN I had been prepared by Government and development


4
  The August 2007 restructuring consisted of: (i) a modification of the PDO; (ii) a change in the Results
Framework to ensure that indicators were better linked to project activities; (iii) a change in the funding
mechanism allowing IDA funds to channel funds to the Common Fund of the CNCS, pooling funds with
bilateral and other multilateral organizations; (iv) a reallocation of funds between categories; and (v)
extension of the closing date to December 31, 2009.

5
 This final amendment also aimed to strengthen the links between reproductive health and HIV with most
of the funds to be used to procure commodities. It also extended the closing date by one year.

6
 Key lessons from MAP I included: (a) lack of project readiness slowed down implementation, (b)
exceptional procedures were needed to engage CSOs, (c) national AIDS council should focus on
coordination rather than control or implementation, (d) monitoring and evaluation is critical, (e) there was
need for funds for knowledge management, and (f) intensive Bank supervision was needed.


                                                      4
partners (especially UNAIDS) in a highly participatory way and commitment and enthusiasm for
the Plan were strong which provided a conducive environment for the Bank project. Bank
financing would be the first substantial contribution to the CNCS. By introducing firmer
fiduciary arrangements it provided confidence to other donors to channel funds through the public
sector. While the project included the standard MAP components the flexibility of the MAP
instrument, and the ―learn by doing approach‖, proved to be a good mechanism to use in the
Mozambique context. In spite of these positive aspects, the speed of preparation (i.e. 10 months
between identification and approval) may have compromised readiness, as reflected in subsequent
delays. Furthermore, as was the case with other MAPs, insufficient attention was paid to M&E
which was reflected in weaknesses in the Results Framework (discussed below).

2.2 Implementation

17.      The project suffered from numerous implementation delays which stemmed from several
factors, including insufficient readiness; weak institutional capacity in relation to the ambitious
agenda; high staff turnover, and cumbersome procedures. As a result, the project was often in
problem status during the implementation phase. Although Mozambique was politically stable
and top leadership changed infrequently, just below the top managerial level high staff turnover
and lengthy vacancies were the order of the day. Low capacity of virtually all agencies adversely
affected the implementation of numerous activities. Nevertheless, in spite of numerous problems
and delays, the government with the Bank team identified innovative solutions throughout the
project cycle and repeatedly explored options for addressing these shortcomings. As a result, by
project completion implementation was considered largely successful with most targets achieved.
Several notable examples are cited below.

18.     The effective implementation of the main component of the project, which aimed to
empower communities to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, was impeded by weak
implementation capacity and cumbersome procedures which surpassed the capacity of most
CSOs, for many till the end of the project. CNCS did not have the capacity to manage thousands
of sub-projects, which caused delays in approvals and replenishments. 7 Moreover, much
capacity building needed to be done for civil society organizations which had limited experience
in project and financial management. Fiduciary requirements were heavy for rural communities
where banking was virtually inexistent and three quotations hard to obtain. The 20 percent
contribution originally requested from the NGO own resources also caused difficulties for many.
The concept of sub-project was new and initially the Mozambique Tribunal Administrativo got
involved in approval of each. Finally, reporting requirements were too heavy for most CSOs.

19.    Many of these issues were successfully rectified during the life of the project. UNAIDS
and others, including private firms, were brought in to provide capacity building to CSOs for
proposal writing and sub-project implementation; and to provide technical assistance to CNCS.
As Mozambique received large contributions from PEPFAR 8 from 2006 onwards there was a


7
 CNCS would contract CSOs for sub-projects, which could vary from as little as less than US$1,000 to
over US$20,000 (Category A: below US$1000, Category B: between US$1000 and 20,000, and Category
C: over US$20,000). In total HARP supported 3771 sub -projects (Category A 179 sub-projects, Category B
776, and Category C 2816 sub-projects).

8
 According to the PEPFAR website, Mozambique received $835.6 million to support comprehensive
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care programs from FY 2004 to FY 2009.




                                                  5
shift towards supporting stronger NGOs with higher levels of capacity, and an effort to increase
the average size of the sub-projects. Following the 2007 restructuring a Grant Management
Agency was contracted to handle the selection of CSO sub-projects. While this was good idea in
principle, it did not work out as expected given that the CNCS management could not agree to
relinquish these responsibilities; as a result the GMA resigned after one year and the CNCS
continued to handle these functions until the end of 2009, diverting attention from its main
responsibility of coordinating the national response.

20.     Activities funded under the public sector multi-sectoral response component, which
reached close to 40 institutions, also faced similar capacity challenges which were reflected in
implementation delays and disbursement lags. Focal points, at central and provincial level, were
part-timers and did not receive any additional payment in the spirit of mainstreaming. CNCS
provided training at central and provincial level which partly improved the situation. With the
creation in 2007 of a new Ministry of Civil Service, an HIV/AIDS strategy for civil servants was
developed and funds were received to target prevention activities in 12 priority institutions.

21.      While the health sector component was implemented relatively well as the MOH had
experience with implementing Bank projects through a strong project unit (GACOPI) that also
managed the Bank-funded Treatment Acceleration Project (TAP) 9 some implementation
challenges arose with changes in the leadership of the MOH. Given the constrained
implementation, especially of the contracting of CSOs a consultation was held with the Prime
Minister and agreement was reached to: (i) procure commodities through the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) which had a strong track record and would be in a position to
efficiently procure the additional US$12 million allocated to the MOH to scale up HIV and
related supplies; and (ii) establish a Rapid Results Fund (RRF) to be managed by UNDP to focus
attention on prevention, reproductive health, and TB/HIV integrated care. Taking the lessons
learned by CNCS into account, UNDP contracted CSOs with more capacity and the average size
of contracts for sub-projects would more than double. Smaller CSOs and NGOs could only
participate through joint ventures with larger organizations. Following these changes, the
implementation of the health component became more strategic but some delays persisted,
highlighting the challenges of channeling funds to civil society groups. Finally, it should be
noted that the drop in ARV prices led the Bank to allow procurement of these drugs for life
saving AIDS treatment. 10




9
  The regional Treatment Acceleration Project (TAP, P082613), which was a first for Bank-financing of
ART, had a Mozambique component. HARP‘s design included only procurement of drugs for opportunistic
infections and ART for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) and post -exposure prophylaxis
(PEP). TAP showed that NGOs could play an important role in rapid expansion of ART and provided
MOH with a framework for the contracting of NGOs with clear objectives for service delivery and
measurable targets.

10
   The dramatic price drop for ARV over the project‘s life from over US$10,000 to only US$100-400 per
year had a significant impact on the treatment policy of GOM and WB support. While in the beginning of
the project the Bank would only finance treatment for opportunistic infections and ART only for PPTCT,
towards the end first line ARV were also allowed to be procured for general purpose although this did not
happen on any large scale, as other sources of funding were used for it. It did however fundamentally
change the way civil society organizations could provide care to PLHIV.




                                                    6
22.      To address cross cutting capacity constraints, HARP provided substantial support for
capacity building and staffing of the CNCS in management and administration; fiduciary
arrangements; technical, communications and M&E. In turn, CNCS provided considerable
training to implementing agencies, journalists, youth groups, and the CNCS sub-structures at the
provincial level. Bank support was instrumental in the development of PEN II and III, which
were inspired by the AIDS Campaign Team for Africa (ACTAfrica) new Agenda for Action,
2007-2011 as well as support from the Bank‘s AIDS Strategy and Action Planning service
(ASAP) that helped to prioritize national interventions to be supported under the plans.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

23.     Design. While implementation of a multi-sectoral response for a ‗learning by doing‘
operation would require a well-developed monitoring and evaluation system, the M&E
architecture and the institutional arrangements of the national response and of the Bank project
were still largely under development at the inception stage. CNCS had a small M&E unit and all
provincial nuclei had only one Database Agent. The weak start was exacerbated by the fact that
during implementation the planned international TA was never hired. This hampered especially
CNCS‘s role to collect and analyze periodic reports of implementers, and prepare annual
implementation reports on the national response in the effort to combat AIDS.

24.     There were discrepancies between the articulation of the large number of indicators in the
DGA and in the PAD. 11 Several indicators from the PAD were not in the DGA and were never
measured and were subsequently dropped. Other indicators were also dropped during the various
amendments as knowledge about the selection of indicators improved and there was a greater
emphasis on outputs rather than process indicators (e.g. approval of a national strategic plan); a
move away from indicators for which an individual project could not be held accountable (e.g.
reduction in HIV prevalence).

25.      During project preparation, the M&E unit of CNCS received Bank support on
budgeting/costing, financial planning and program monitoring. Guidelines were developed and
indicators defined. With Bank support, data bases were established at national and provincial
levels. The heavy focus on fiduciary matters, especially for grant management purposes, was to
be expected for a project which needed to set up systems, but it may have taken attention away
from collection of core epidemiological and behavioral data at baseline.

26.    Implementation. With external support from the UN, a National M&E Framework was
developed and published in 2006 in the context of the preparation of the second phase of the
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. CNCS received support from WB Global AIDS Monitoring
and Evaluation Team (GAMET) in 2005-2006. However, in 2007 CNCS still lacked dedicated
information technology experts for programming, database design and maintenance and
computer-based communications. Hiring of international technical assistance was recommended
and eventually funded by USAID. For its provincial nuclei CNCS recruited M&E officers from
2007 onwards, which would allow for capacity building in decentralized program planning and
implementation.


11
  For example, the legal agreement stated: By 2008, the percentage of young men and women aged 15-24
who have had sex with a non marital, non-cohabitating partner in the last 12 months has declined by 10%
from the 2002 level‖, but the text in the PAD was as follows: ―By 2008 the number of sexual partners
outside of primary union in the last 12 months for persons 15-49 has declined by 25% from the 2002 level‖.
The indicator was dropped at the fourth amendment.


                                                    7
27.     Since 2007, CNCS was ―beginning to be able to fulfill its mandate‖ regarding M&E.
CNCS was able to report reliably on about two-thirds of the M&E indicators in the National
Framework. CNCS and its provincial nuclei were able to report on grants made and amounts
disbursed for the sub-projects, and on most of the output indicators reported by a sizable number
of the civil society implementers. Information about activities of the public and private sector s
and data on activities of entities not receiving funding through CNCS were incomplete.
28.      A national M&E framework was developed with an implementation plan for the second
phase of the National Strategic HIV/AIDS Plan (PEN II). The plan outlined the key indicators,
defined data sources, responsibilities of various partners, and information flows. Implementation
required a lot of training and the cooperation of all development partners. Efforts to develop an
integrated work plan proved challenging. As a result, a functioning M&E system in accordance
with the Three Ones principles 12 is still not fully in place. At present CNCS‘ data sets are still
incomplete as many donors do not report their assistance systematically and neither do the
implementing agencies. Only organizations executing sub-projects financed by CNCS reported
regularly. CNCS still faces enormous challenges to report on all activities in the country.
29.     One of the important contributions of the Bank, in collaboration with other development
partners was to strengthen knowledge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mozambique. Some large
surveys were conducted which provided good information on levels, trends and patterns in
HIV/AIDS as well as knowledge, attitudes and sexual practices 13 . Likewise, with GAMET
support considerable analytical work was done on the drivers of the epidemic. 14
30.      Data Use. CNCS was able to publish annual reports since 2001 on its activities and these
reports have gained in comprehensiveness over time. A technical working group on M&E,
jointly chaired by the MOH and CNCS and with wide participation from many stakeholders
including the Bank, helps with analysis and drawing conclusions from the data. The group was
especially active during Annual Reviews and contributed to preparations of various reports,
including the UNGASS report. The task team and other units of the Bank have provided much
technical assistance over the years to strengthen the strategic focus of the national response
through better M&E. The discussions helped to redirect attention towards prevention, including
the need to reduce concurrent sexual partnerships and unsafe sex and boost condom use, all
activities supported under the project. Data sharing by DP is, however, still an issue and CNCS is
reviewing options to encourage data sharing.
31.    The private sector sub-component was thoroughly evaluated after the two-year contract
with the managing firm ended. The lessons learned through this evaluation could not be
immediately applied as a second generation of sub-projects with the private sector did not take
place.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



12
  UNAIDS‘ Three Ones principles refer to: (a) One agreed HIV/AIDS Action Framework that provides the
basis for coordinating the work of all partners, (b) One National AIDS Coordinating Authority, with a
broad based multi-sector mandate, and c) One agreed country level Monitoring and Evaluation System

13
     DHS (2004), INSIDA (2009)

14
     See for example Aide Mémoire June, 2007 mission.




                                                    8
32.      The project triggered the safeguard policy regarding Environment Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01) and was categorized as Category B. The assessment revealed serious
deficiencies such as: lack of efficient management of health care waste, carelessness of clinical
staff, insufficient waste containers, lack of security for collectors, and lack of an efficient
treatment system (e.g., 90% of the hospitals disposed of their wastes within the hospital
compounds through burial or incineration). A comprehensive environmental action plan (which
went beyond this project) was developed in a participatory fashion and included infection control
and waste management guidelines. The national plan, estimated at US$ 42.5 million, had two
components: (a) strengthening of the regulatory framework; and (b) provision of equipment for
selection, sorting and treatment of health care waste of public health care facilities. Medical
supplies and waste treatment equipment, such as incinerators, were procured for some hospitals,
but there was limited evidence of any systematic follow-up by the Bank of the implementation of
the environmental action plan.
33.      Financial Management (FM): Mostly with USAID support an accounting system was put
in place to respond to the needs of both Government and donors, recording donations and use of
funds. The system was installed and staffed at the center and in all provinces. The project had
three Special Accounts, two of which were managed by CNCS: one for operating costs and one
for sub-projects. Due to the volume of funds to be managed under component 4, a separate
special account was established for MOH, administered by GACOPI which would also carry out
all procurement for MOH, and for CNCS in case of ICB, under the project.
34.      The FM procedures put in place proved to be overly complicated: two special accounts
resulted in 33 project accounts at provincial level. Payment procedures were too complex for the
provinces and the small community organizations which sometimes were unable to open a bank
account. This resulted in delays in implementation of sub-projects under component 1. In some
cases, the provincial nuclei of CNCS would manage the finances for the CSOs on their behalf,
presenting a potential of conflict of interest. The 20% contribution required from Government
hampered implementation and added to the complexity of the procedures, as it required special
bank accounts. The 20% contribution was abandoned in 2007. Over the years the number of
accounts managed by CNCS decreased from 27 to just 7.
35.     At the beginning of the project the Bank was the main financier of the PEN. However,
this dramatically changed over the life of the project. This provided good opportunities for
pooling resources. After the fourth amendment became effective, the Bank joined the Common
Fund, a pooling arrangement of various bilateral donors and GFATM. This Fund financed CNCS
and with the Bank‘s involvement the financing became better linked to CNCS‘ operational pla ns.
In 2007 the Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with several bilateral partners to join
the ―Common Fund‖ which would support the public components of the project, especially
CNCS. The RRF was also financed together with other donors.
36.     Procurement: The CNCS Secretariat was charged with oversight for the whole program
and hired a procurement officer for this task. Larger packages requiring international competitive
bidding and all packages pertaining directly to component 4 would be handled by MOH which
had contracting experience in this area. The provincial nuclei of CNCS carried out procurement
of small value including recruitment of local staff with prior approval of the central Unit.
Procurement plans of good quality were regularly sent to the Bank. Record keeping, however,
was not always in good order.
37.     The contracting of CSOs under component 1 would be done by CNCS, using the
Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-based Investments, under the title
―sub-projects‖. The sheer number of subprojects to be contracted through CNCS was clearly
beyond the capacity of the young institution. It also pulled it away from its main area of focus:



                                                9
coordination of the national response against HIV/AIDS. Procurement by MOH was relatively
smooth in the beginning of the project, but later suffered as well from weakening capacity in
GACOPI.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38.      The Bank considered a follow-on operation, named “HIV/AIDS Response II‖, but this
plan was abandoned, as many development partners had entered the AIDS arena, injecting
substantial resources into the national HIV/AIDS program. The Bank therefore decided to focus
its follow up support on health sector reform which would address systemic issues in the sector,
complementing support for HIV/AIDS from other DPs.
39.     Given that the Bank‘s contributions towards the end of the project were largely flowing
through pooling arrangements with other development partners and since these arrangements will
continue to exist, the project activities will not come to a halt with the end of HARP although
some activities may be scaled down. There was concern amongst donors that with the Bank out
of the pooling arrangement fiduciary oversight might suffer in the future. The DPs hoped that
WB will use its influence with the Ministry of Finance to keep HIV as a priority at
macroeconomic level which has in fact occurred. The private sector initiatives of component 1
evolved into a self-standing initiative led by the private sector itself. CNCS continued to meet
through ECoSida 15 with the private sector, proving sustainability beyond the project support. 16

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
40.      With a rapidly rising and generalized epidemic, the project‘s objective was highly
relevant to Mozambique‘s development agenda and continues to be so, as the impact of
HIV/AIDS on human development and poverty is well documented. The project‘s design to
rapidly scale up through the involvement of CSOs and to adopt a multi-sectoral approach were
also appropriate, as AIDS had become a national emergency that required broad based
participation. The decision to implement the project largely through CSOs was an appropriate
strategy, given that these institutions have a solid knowledge of their beneficiaries. Moreover,
CSOs were well placed to support the design of interventions to address the precarious situation
and vulnerability of their constituencies. Although the project was originally maybe overly
ambitious and implementation arrangements not always well adapted to the local conditions, a
series of amendments to the DGA and adjustments in implementation arrangements responded to
these shortcomings so that relevance could be maintained or enhanced. Following the 2007
restructuring there was a gradual shift in main focus from mitigation to prevention with the
establishment of the RRF. The relevance of the public sector interventions could have been
further enhanced by a more targeted approach both in terms of the number of institutions
involved and the type of activities that were supported. Finally, it should be noted that the
analysis of the HIV/AIDS situation in Mozambique in the appraisal document correctly flagged




15
   ECoSIDA is a national Mozambican private sector initiative in the fight against HIV/AIDS, mainly
financed by the private sector itself. It has around 50 active members.

16
     In 2010 it attended 88 meetings to mobilize managers and 21 firms started work place interventions.




                                                      10
the urgency and gravity of addressing the epidemic, particularly as AIDS was almost always
deadly, as ART was still prohibitively expensive. 17
41.      Relevance is rated high as the project reflected a proper diagnosis of AIDS as both a
major public health problem and a development priority, and over the life of the project the
Government and Bank team made adjustments in the implementation arrangements to maintain or
further enhance its relevance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.       The achievement of the PDO is rated as substantial. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in
Mozambique appears to have stabilized over the past decade. While data from two comparable
data resources are not available the HIV estimates appear to suggest that the epidemic has been
contained, given the sizable resources injected into the national response, including the
contribution from IDA through this project. According to the first and only nationally
representative survey (INSIDA (2009)) of HIV prevalence and knowledge, attitudes and practices,
Mozambique has an HIV adult infection rate of 11.5 percent with slightly higher rates of female
infection (females: 13.1 vs. males: 9.2 percent). As noted in the PAD, the baseline figures which
came from the 2000 surveillance data showed a national adult prevalence of 12.2 percent, with
the South Region 13.2, the Center 16.5 and the North 5.7 percent. For INSIDA these figures are
17.8, 12.5 and 5.6 percent respectively. While it is not possible to establish a counterfactual, there
is no reason to think why Mozambique would not have reached the very high prevalence rates of
all its neighboring countries in the absence of the PEN, which the Bank supported.

43.     It should be noted that not only did the project contribute to slow the spread of
HIV/AIDS but it also assisted to put in place the systems and capacity for the implementation of
the PEN, as it was its first large financing and was instrumental in attracting sizeable financing
from other multi- and bilateral donors.

44.      As summarized below, there was generally good progress on many of the PDO indicators.
The percentage of 15-25 year-olds who had sex before the age of 15 declined from 60 percent at
baseline to 25 percent in 2009. The end of project target (i.e. less than 20 percent) was therefore
well within reach and may have been achieved by project closing. Unfortunately, more recent
data are not available.

   The subsequent steep decline in prices of ARV changed this picture completely and due to new
interventions AIDS became for many a chronic disease.

condom at the last time they had sex with         2003-2005)
a non-regular partner, has increased by
20% from 2002 levels.
45.     The percentage of young men and women aged 15-24 who had sex with a non-marital,
non-cohabitating partner in the last 12 months declined dramatically from 60 percent at baseline
to 4.2 percent for women and 16.4 percent for men, according to INSIDA (2009). The MICS
(2008) found similar results with only 4.7 percent of 15-24 year old females reporting having sex
with more than one partner in the last 12 months. While there may be some issues with the
comparability and reliability of this self reported data, nevertheless, it appears that messages
about HIV behavior change and the need to reduce multiple concurrent sexual partners, one of the
main drivers of the epidemic, were paying off.
46.     The percentage of young women and men who used a condom when they last had sex
with a non-regular partner increased from 31 at baseline to 35.1 percent (women 33.1 percent and
men 37.2 percent). The MICS (2008) found a similar but even higher level of condom use with
some 44.4% of women aged 15-24 reporting condom use during their last sexual relation with a
non-marital or non-cohabitating partner. The target for condom use appears to have been
achieved for males. 18
47.      In summary, for the three PDO indicators the targets were largely achieved. For the 17
intermediary indicators 11(65 percent) were achieved, 2 (12 percent) were partially achieved, and
4 (23 percent) were not. The achievements demonstrate the substantial impact of the project‘s
initiatives. The numerous activities of the project in communities, firms and institutions raised
HIV awareness enormously (by project end over 98 percent of both men and women had heard of
HIV, according to INSIDA (2009)) in an effective manner, leading to the intended behavioral
changes. The qualitative results of a 2006 beneficiary assessment (see annex 5) also showed how
well the project was rooted in the communities.

3.3 Efficiency
48.      Many of the sub-projects under the civil society component of the project aimed at
alleviating the difficult conditions of people living with HIV/AIDS, and showed how a small
amount of money can go a long way to provide relief to needy individuals and communities.
From a generally accepted strict public health perspective it would have been more efficient, at
least in the short term, to have the majority of projects in areas with highest risk of transmission
(hot spots) and to focus more attention on prevention, and on groups most at risk. This occurred
but only in later years of the project, when the national program improved its targeting strategies
and focused on specific groups (―the window of hope‖ for the HIV-negative youth). However,
some CSO projects which had started with impact mitigation interventions later included
prevention measures. Indeed, the civil society projects which focused on impact mitigation


18
  According to the project documents, the end of project target for this indicator was 51 percent. However,
the target value appears to have been incorrectly stated as it confuses percentage with percentage points.
The correct target (i.e. a 20 percent increase over 2002 levels) implies an target of 37-38 percent which was
indeed achieved for men.




                                                     12
enabled a discussion in communities on HIV transmission and related risks, and therefore often
could provide the platform for prevention efforts with broad community ownership.
49.      Under the RRF a strategic approach, delivering high impact proven specific prevention
interventions was gradually scaled up with a specific focus on larger organizations with greater
potential which fostered efficiency. The private sector component of the project was successful
but ran only for a two-year period, diminishing its potential efficiency. Efficiency of the public
sector component may have been diluted by the large number of ministries that were involved.
When the RRF was established, it was decided that only priority ministries could equally apply
for ―sub-projects‖. This was especially important for the newly established Ministry of Public
Service.
50.      The project provided urgently needed resources to address the dramatic impact of HIV on
the health sector. It provided substantial resources for staff training for both preventive and
palliative care. The training programs were well implemented and largely according to plan. The
MOH was also very efficient in mainstreaming the HIV/AIDS interventions. As a result, VCT
centers were set up in much larger numbers than originally planned, as the services were
integrated in the general health services. Similarly, the PPTCT program grew quicker than
anticipated, although further improvements are needed as coverage of ante-natal care services is
still too low and characterized by high drop-out rates. The sharply declining prices for ARVs
during the project‘s life made it possible that about 28 percent (UNGASS, 2008) of patients who
needed ART could receive treatment, thus positively impacting on the efficiency of the project
although it financed few ARV itself. Integration of HIV and TB services during the latter half of
the project led to further gains in efficiency in fighting both TB and HIV. A reallocation of Grant
funds towards MOH during the 2007 and 2009 restructurings made it possible that the Grant was
almost fully disbursed.
51.      In conclusion, the project‘s activities were largely appropriate, as was the allocation of
funds, but efficiency of the project could have been further enhanced if: (a) delays had been
reduced, (b) the public sector interventions had concentrated on a limited number of ministries
and institutions with the largest potential impact on slowing down the epidemic, and (c) the
private sector initiatives had been implemented for more than just two years. Therefore efficiency
is rated only as modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Area            Rating
Relevance       High
Efficacy        Substantial
Efficiency      Modest
Overall         Moderately satisfactory

52.      The project‘s objectives were highly relevant to the country‘s development and two out
of three PDO targets have been achieved while the target for the third is within reach. The results
for several intermediate indicators have exceeded the targets. All these results can be attributed to
the PEN, within which framework the national response is being implemented and to which the
Bank support has contributed in a critical manner as its first large external financier; HARP
helped to craft the national structures and implementation arrangements. The overall rating for the
project could be satisfactory. However, given moderate shortcomings in efficacy and the modest
rating for efficiency, due to delays and maybe the project‘s too broad of a focus, the overall
rating is moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
53.     It is generally recognized that activities under component 1 made a considerable impact
on the alleviation of poverty, as many sub-projects dealt with mitigating the effects of the
epidemic, including income generating projects. Social impacts are also considerable, as for many
communities, the sub-projects represented the very first time that communities organized
themselves around a certain theme and had to take decisions together. Moreover, in the context of
HARP several impact mitigation projects were later developed to include prevention efforts.
Beneficiaries also recognized that the success of the VCT or ART services delivered by the MOH
was mostly due to the awareness creation and stigma reduction through the community projects.
54.     Gender aspects were well addressed
for some (sub) components. For example,     A grandmother lives with her eight orphaned
over 20 percent of the civil society sub-   grandchildren close to a truck stop. She lets

focus. The income generating projects for   die of AIDS. It‘s the same thing. ―
women also contributed to female
empowerment in the communities. However, the special needs for men having sex with men were
never considered under the project.
55.     Male circumcision, since a few years well known to have a highly protective effect on
HIV transmission, is traditionally common in the North and coastal areas of Mozambique, but no
concerted effort has taken place by Government to take the intervention to scale at national level.
So far the RRF supports two sub-projects. A campaign to promote circumcision has just started
under the title ―Tira chapeu‖ (take off your hat).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
56.      The institutional development impact of this project and its long-term impact on
institutional capacity are substantial for the CNCS, but also for other organizations. The project
was very helpful in establishing sound fiduciary processes in the Council and to set-up of
planning and programming functions, and M&E systems, all of which are now beneficial to
national and international partners. CNCS‘ staff carried out numerous training sessions and
capacity building efforts in project management for the NPCS, CSOs, NGOs, private sector, and
public sector agencies.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
57.     Probably the most important and very positive unintended outcome of the project was
capacity building at community level. In many places, the project presented the first occasion that
funds were channeled directly to communities, thereby causing them to organize themselves. This
very grass roots level capacity building may not always have been the most efficient way of
dealing with the AIDS epidemic, but was groundbreaking and meant an enormous step forward in
community organization.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
58.     During the ICR mission various groups of PLHIV who benefitted from the sub -projects
were interviewed. People were tremendously grateful, especially for livelihood support provided.



                                                14
Several noted that it was easier to listen to IEC messages regarding HIV transmission if the
activities were part of a comprehensive set of services that went beyond the narrowly defined
window of HIV only. As the number of very small projects had been drastically reduced over the
last year when UNDP took over the management of sub-projects, many people showed great
concern with the phasing out of their specific project.
59.     Health workers interviewed showed a very positive impact of the bio-security support
provided by the project, through which they received training and supplies, such as gloves,
needles, syringes, condoms, but also larger equipment for incineration, blood transfusion
equipment, and vehicles.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
60.     The risk to development outcome is rated substantial. The structures which were set up
by GOM to fight the epidemic are now well established and there is considerable continued
support for HIV/AIDS from the donor community. 19 However, due to the present international
financial crisis the development assistance for AIDS from bilateral and multilateral partners may
be declining, while the needs for resources, especially for ART are increasing. Mozambique is
heavily dependent on external aid. The Bank‘s continued support for the health sector‘s systems
will somewhat mitigate this risk. Health systems strengthening efforts will be needed to provide
ARV for the masses in need of treatment and to continue prevention efforts and scale up efforts to
link especially TB and HIV programs.
61.      The Government‘s continued commitment to fight HIV will somewhat mitigate the
development risk by maintaining HIV as one of the priority areas in the subsequent phases of its
poverty reduction strategy. The battle has been led from the beginning by politically high profile
figures. The previous and present president both provided strong leadership, speaking out on
many occasions on the importance of fighting HIV.
62.     Importantly the epidemic seems to be contained in the center and northern parts of the
country, where HIV prevalence rates have stabilized or even moderately declined over the last
few years. In the South this is not yet the case, and the sub-region warrants additional and focused
interventions to further reduce the spread of the epidemic.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: moderately satisfactory
63.      Recognizing the multi-sectoral character of the operation, the Bank‘s first three team
leaders for the project were not health specialists. The preparation team was truly multi-sector
and included staff from the education, health, agriculture, and rural development sectors. The
preparation team was well organized and one of the first in the Bank to set up a web site
http://afr/aftr1/mozambiqueaids/ making all relevant documents easily available to all team
members and stakeholders.




19
  So far, Mozambique has received US$244,980,748 in approved funding for HIV/AIDS from GFATM,
according to the official website of GFATM. Through PEPFAR, Mozambique received $835.6 million to
support comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care programs from FY 2004 to FY 2009.


                                                15
64.      The fact that the design of the project, even after five amendments to the DGA and three
National Strategic Plan (PEN I, II and III), remained basically the same, is testimony to its
robustness and its good fit with the national structures. At the same time, the MAP instrument
with its learning by doing approach proved to be highly flexible and allow modifications to the
country context.
65.     The operation was prepared on a fast-track basis, and as a result some unresolved actions
which were pushed forward to implementation. The numerous conditions of effectiveness and the
delay in effectiveness are an illustration of this.
66.      The Bank preparation team may have been too optimistic in its institutional assessment of
the CNCS. Not only did it overestimate the capacity to perform the management of the sub-
projects, but these responsibilities also took away from its major responsibility to monitor,
coordinate and guide the national response – a role for which it also was not yet fully equipped.
67.     The project was selected for the Bank‘s Sixth Quality at Entry Assessment (2003). The
review took place in the period between Board Approval and project Effectiveness. The panel
gave the project generally high ratings. It liked especially the good fit of the national and MAP
approach and the strategic relevance of the operation. However, it was concerned about the
implementation readiness, as the planned pretesting of fiduciary processes had not proceeded as
planned, and about possible conflicts between CNCS and participating ministries, which would
feel disempowered. The number of conditions for effectiveness and readiness were concerns
which in fact materialized.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: moderately satisfactory
68.       Aide-mémoire often started with a review of the status of the epidemic, thereby keeping
a strategic focus on the main drivers of the epidemic and the eventual development impact.
69.     The various restructurings and amendments to the FA are evidence of responsiveness of
the Bank team to address implementation issues. Allowing for the closing date to be extended
twice made it possible that most of the project targets were achieved. In order to get or keep the
project out of problem status, intense and frequent supervision efforts took place. This was
possible since experienced FM staff and the TTL were field based and headquarter staff travelled
frequently to Mozambique. ACTAfrica also supported the task team and the implementers on
various occasions.
70.       But there were also delays in finalizing several arrangements. After the Bank signed on
March 4, 2006, a Memorandum of Understanding with Government and the Common Fund
Partners (Canada, DFID, Denmark, GFATM, Ireland and Sweden) it still took almost 16 months
for it to process the agreement internally. After the approval of the fifth restructuring package, it
still took several months for the Bank to approve the sole-source contract with UNFPA.
71.     M&E did receive extra attention during supervision and the Bank, through its Global
AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET), provided considerable assistance to the
program. Several missions were joined by an M&E expert and the Bank held many conceptual
and strategic discussions with CNCS on capacity for M&E. However, reporting was not well
done, and only the last supervision report contained a table with the relevant indicators.
72.     From the very first Implementation Status and Results Report the formulation of the PDO
was raised as an issue, as the team realized that it would take more than the 5-year project cycle
to change behavior and consequently slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, when the
PDO was reformulated in 2006, the change was modest (i.e. focusing on the Bank‘s contribution




                                                 16
to the slowing down of the spread of HIV) but did not shift the focus towards measurable outputs
(e.g. coverage and utilization of core HIV services and interventions).
Fiduciary:
73.     During implementation financial management arrangements and compliance were well
supervised. Without exception, missions were accompanied by a WB FM specialist. The issues
raised in previous missions and audits were followed-up systematically. While there were
numerous problems (e.g. need for extra efforts to improve accounting systems, providing
supporting documentation by implementing agencies, formulating the budget and execution of
component 4 of the project, and managing the designated accounts) they were followed up
rigorously. World Bank FM specialists put in considerable extra effort in training staff in the
CNCS and MOH to strengthen procedures and internal controls. When the Bank joined that the
pooling arrangements with other development partners for the Common Fund (CF) and RRF
additional FM design efforts were needed to make the Bank a participant in pooling arrangements.
After the Bank joined these pooling arrangements partners soon started relying on the Bank for
fiduciary oversight.
74.      Procurement for such an operation with multiple implementers and large scale civil
society involvement was challenging, both on the Mozambican and the Bank‘s side. The Bank‘s
guidelines had a steep learning curve. The institutional procedures and the urgency of taking
programmatic action were not always in line, and there were numerous implementation delays.
75.     While it is commendable that during preparation a comprehensive Environmental Plan
was developed to deal with the public sector, beyond what would be strictly needed for an
HIV/AIDS project, a truly effective plan would also need to look at handling of medical waste in
the private sector clinics. Moreover, the ambitious plan was not systematically implemented.
76.      During implementation monitoring of environmental arrangements and compliance was
virtually nonexistent as not a single mission was joined by an environmental specialist, and none
of the supervision reports paid any significant attention to these aspects. At the same time
compliance with the environmental requirements was consistently rated as ―satisfactory‖.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
77.      All five Bank task team leaders were familiar with Mozambique and were fluent in
Portuguese. Five amendments and two extensions to achieve the PDO demonstrated the
perseverance and extra effort made by the task team. GAMET support to strengthen M&E for the
national program showed that the Bank‘s team went the extra mile. The appreciation of other DP s
for the Bank‘s fiduciary oversight also speaks volumes about the design and the actual
implementation of the arrangements. The in country presence of the TTL for most of the project‘s
life made support to the government counterpart team possible in a much more intense format
than would have been the case from headquarters. All these considerations would lead to a fully
satisfactory rating. However, since: (a) there was not much apparent focus during supervision on
the results framework or (b) safeguards issues, and (c) delays on the Bank‘s side in processing of
some restructurings, the rating is lowered to moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory
78.      Political commitment to fight HIV has been high in Mozambique from the start of the
project. In public speeches Presidents often spoke about the epidemic and ways to fight it. A
national multi-sectoral council was set up early on. The National AIDS Council under
chairmanship of the prime minister met regularly to discuss the general strategy and follow up on


                                               17
international commitments. HIV is a constant theme in Government‘s subsequent poverty
reduction strategies.
79.      From the start of the project, the CNCS was overwhelmed by its many duties. The task of
management of the CSO sub-projects was huge and took away from its main duty of coordinating
the national response. Donor attention for HIV/AIDS was rapidly increasing and the Council had
to attend to many missions and carry out the necessary preparation work in order to receive large
amounts of funding from other DPs. CNCS often suffered from high staff turnover as a result of
which important positions remained vacant for a considerable time. Especially towards the end of
the project when Component 1 was managed by the UNDP the provincial nuclei of CNCS would
sometimes hardly monitor what interventions were supported by the RRF, let alone the projects
supported directly by development partners.
80.     MOH performed relatively well, although there were some FM issues. The health sector
component achieved well beyond its targets. Thanks to the use of UN agencies towards the end of
the project, major procurements for the MOH could be largely completed on time. The Ministry
took advantage of other support available to it and as a result targets for VCT and ART were
achieved.
81.    The performance of other ministries and public institutions varied greatly. The lack of
true mainstreaming in most ministries beyond health shows that the multisectoral character of
HIV has not taken hold in the mindset of most ministries.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: satisfactory.
82.    CSOs and NGOs performed well during the project. The organizations may have been
very small sometimes, with little capacity, but they were highly motivated and eager to learn how
to comply with HARP‘s sub-project requirements. The capacity building efforts by the CNCS
were well appreciated. The resilience of these organizations implied that they continued to
implement the sub-projects even when confronted with challenging administrative procedures.
83.      The agency hired to implement the private sector component also performed well. In total
557 vs. a goal of 250 sub-projects were contracted, which targeted workers in general, workers
living with HIV, their family members, the neighborhood of the firm, and orphans of deceased
workers. According to the evaluation, the large majority of the projects made a significant impact
on workers knowledge, safe sexual behavior and reduction of stigma. These awareness raising
activities also contributed to HIV testing seeking behavior. With the benefit of hindsight more
efforts could have been made to involve trade unions and local authorities.
84.     After the fifth amendment two UN agencies implemented important sub-components of
the project which enhanced performance and accelerated implementation. UNDP was contracted
by MOH to manage the contracting of CSO and NGO to implement sub-projects in civil society,
which became increasingly focused on both prevention and mitigation. Public agencies and firms
were also allowed to submit proposals for funding. UNFPA was contracted by the MOH for a
very large procurement (US$9.4 million) of medical and reproductive health equipment and
supplies–almost all delivered on time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
85.    The overall borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory reflecting the
enormous efforts on the side on CNCS, private sector, some Ministries and especially the small
CSOs to fight HIV in accordance with their capacity and responsibility, in spite of shortcomings
and implementation delays.



                                               18
6. Lessons Learned
86.       The main lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:
         It makes sense for the Bank to develop framework operations such as the MAP. The
          flexibility of the MAP instrument and the “learn by doing approach? proved to be
          effective in the Mozambique context. The Bank responded swiftly and appropriately to
          addressing the HIV/AIDS situation in Mozambique when there were few development
          partners on the ground and limited financing. The fact that the basic design of the project
          could be maintained through five amendments to the DGA proves that the MAP
          instrument was used in a flexible way and could respond to the country‘s evolving needs
          as the national strategy developed and new partners came on board.
         The project development objective needs to state clearly for what an individual project
          can be held accountable even if it is part of a series in Adaptable Program Lending
          (APL). While the MAP was originally designed as a 12-15 year APL, in practice HARP
          ended up as a self-standing operation and now needs to be assessed in that light. The
          QAG (2003) panel in its assessment warned against setting HARP‘s (and MAP‘s in
          general) expectations too high, when it declared: ―While this well crafted and broadly
          supported ―process‖ operation is likely to achieve its important institutional
          development/capacity building objectives, achieving the stated Human Development
          outcomes will require critical behavioral changes and sets of interventions that are
          outside the main scope of this operation and for which other actors are responsible. These
          outcomes may or may not be achieved, but success or failure cannot and should not be
          ascribed to this single operation.‖ Fortunately HARP instigated behavioral changes, as
          the results for the PDO indicators show, but one may wonder if one hereby holds the
          project to a fair standard.
         Pooling of Bank resources with resources of other partners has multiple benefits. HARP
          was truly unique in that it involved pooled financing with other donors through the
          Common Fund and it also used a joint financing modality (RRF) to channel funds to
          NGOs and CSOs. Such pooling of resources reduces transaction costs for Government. It
          also enhances the prospects for sustainability. The Bank‘s participation in the pooled
          funding mechanism enhanced the government‘s ability to mobilize substantial donor
          resources. Bank participation in these joint funding mechanisms implies that even after a
          project closes many of these activities can continue to be funded although probably not
          always at the same level. Finally, the Bank can play a critical role in bolstering fiduciary
          systems. In the case of HARP, the Bank assisted the government to put in place fiduciary
          systems and procedures which contributed to better management of the national HIV
          response. This support was well appreciated by other development partners who
          subsequently used these reinforced systems to channel their own financial support. When
          the Bank entered the RRF other DP soon appreciated much the fiduciary responsibilities
          which the Bank took for the management of the fund, a role which it continues to play
          after project closing.
         Projects need to be well tailored to institutional capacities and training needs to be
          timely and extensive if a discrepancy exists between the projects demands and the
          implementer’s capacity. The fact that the HARP was often in problem status during the
          implementation phase reflects a combination of factors, including lack of readiness,
          difficulties in mastering IDA procedures, but above all insufficient capacity building up-
          front and during implementation. Especially the implementation of the civil society
          component was hampered by difficulties of smaller organizations to adhere to Bank




                                                  19
        procurement and financial management procedures.           It is hard to underestimate the
        training needs of civil society in projects as HARP.
       Governments need to focus more attention and resources on understanding their HIV
        epidemics and adopting more targeted approaches. The Bank and other development
        partners assisted Mozambique to build M&E capacity and conduct surveys which
        enhanced understanding of the drivers of the epidemic, and allowed for prioritizing
        interventions in high transmission areas and high risk groups. HARP shows that holding
        strategic technical discussions during supervision missions and provision of Bank
        assistance for M&E may lead to a more evidence-based national response.
        While a strictly technical public health approach would direct resources from the start
        towards targeting interventions to geographic areas and population groups with the
        highest HIV prevalence, that direction may from a longer term perspective not always be
        the right one. Money came to the Mozambican communities because of AIDS. As a
        result, communities organized themselves. They were empowered to begin to take
        control of their lives. The income generating activities assisted vulnerable groups to
        better cope with their vulnerability, and demonstrated that a small amount of money
        could go a long way. They focused on the enormous and immediate needs of orphans
        and vulnerable children. These impact mitigation efforts opened the door for an open
        dialogue in the communities on the risks for HIV infection and laid the foundation for a
        community-based approach to prevention. Active involvement of civil society means that
        one must be prepared to finance its priorities, even if these are not immediately and
        evidently perceived as the most cost-effective to curb the epidemic. Nevertheless, more
        should probably have been done in capacity building to make these investments results-
        oriented and to adopt from the start a more integrated approach, providing a
        comprehensive package of prevention, mitigation and care and treatment to communities.
       HIV/AIDS financing can also be used for broader health systems strengthening. As
        Mozambique was part of MAP II, there was a concerted effort to incorporate this lesson
        of the first series of MAP project into the project design. The MOH was one of the key
        beneficiaries of the operation and this helped to further bolster its capacity and avoid the
        kind of problems which occurred in other countries where national HIV/AIDS councils
        undermined health ministries. HARP funded a wide range of activities which bolstered
        overall capacities, including undergraduate training (e.g. nurses, laboratory technicians,
        and radiologists), procurement of pharmaceuticals, and technical assistance to strengthen
        planning.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Community and Civil Society Initiatives (US$ 28 million). This component would
empower communities to respond effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A central activity
would be mobilizing communities, promoting local initiatives and strengthening the capacity of
local actors. A Community and Civil Society Facility held by CNCS would be created to finance
appropriate HIV/AIDS related activities carried out by eligible applicants, such as community
and faith based organizations, NGOs, the private sector, associations and other or ganizations. The
management of the Facility would be decentralized to the provincial level.

Under component 1, the main component of HARP, CNCS contracted CSOs for sub-projects,
which could vary from as little as less than US$1,000 to over US$20,000 (Category A: below
US$1000, Category B: between US$1000 and 20,000, and Category C: over US$20,000). In total
HARP supported 3771 sub-projects (Category A 179 sub-projects, Category B 776, and Category
C 2816 sub-projects). The concept of sub-project was new and in the beginning the Mozambique
Tribunal Administrativo was involved for approval of each, as if it concerned a World Bank
supported project, causing undue delays. CNCS was overwhelmed by the hundreds of sub-
projects, which caused further delays in sub-project approvals, monitoring and then in payments
to implementing agencies. Besides this, much capacity building needed to be done on the side of
small emerging NGOs applying for grants but which had little or no experience in project or
financial management. Often the reporting requirements were heavy for CSOs which didn‘t even
have a computer. Some sub-project fiduciary requirements seemed inappropriate for the
Mozambican rural reality where e.g., a banking system was inexistent and three quotations
impossible to obtain. The 20 percent contribution requested from the NGO‘s own resources also
caused difficulties for many. Given the immediate needs of communities, the high level of
poverty, and the demand-driven character of the sub-projects, many focused on mitigation of the
impact of HIV infection and thus turned into income generating projects, limiting the focus on
HIV prevention. There was some targeting on geographic areas with a high risk of HIV
transmission such as border areas or truck stops, the so called ―hotspots‖.

In total 179 projects in Category A were approved. For category B and C the numbers were 776
and 2816 respectively. The table shows that the sub-projects were remarkably well distributed
over the country. Their number peaked early on in 2005 after which they declined greatly,
reflecting the capacity constraints at the center and the entry of other donor funding. The aim for
national coverage was in line with the goal of the first phase of the MAP.

From 2006 onwards Mozambique would receive large contributions from PEPFAR (US$70
million in 2006 and US$ 150 million in 2007) which transformed the national response. The
support was given to larger, often international, NGOs with higher levels of capacity, thereby
complementing but also sometimes sidelining CNCS-financed smaller local CSOs. The support
also allowed MOH to dramatically increase its support to ART beyond PPTCT to include eligible
PLHIV in general. CNCS encouraged small CSOs or NGOs to form joint ventures or liaise
otherwise with larger NGOs. This would allow for economies of scale and smaller CSOs could
spend more of their time on actual project implementation, and struggle less with project
preparation and reporting of expenditures. The larger NGOs would receive project funding for
capacity building of their smaller partners.

After two years of discussions and a major restructuring of the project in 2007 a Grant
Management Agency (GMA) was contracted, supported by various donors and the Bank (a so
called Common Fund). It would take over the recruitment of CSO for civil society sub-projects,
which had stretched CNCS‘ capacity. The hiring happened only after protracted negotiations, as
CNCS leadership only reluctantly let this responsibility go. The difficult relationship between
CNCS and GMA continued after the hiring and almost a year into the contract the GMA resigned,
due to disagreement on the objective and the price of the contract, giving CNCS the opportunity
to keep funding sub-projects of non-state actors until end of 2009. As a result managing sub-
projects continued to take away from CNCS‘ main responsibility of coordinating the national
response.

Given the continued slow implementation progress, a consultation was held with the Prime
Minister and as a result another major restructuring of the project took place by mid-2009. This
restructuring (a) reallocated US$12 million to MOH for scaling up HIV and syphilis testing,
expanding condom distribution, strengthening the links with reproductive health, and improving


                                                25
bio-safety and nutrition. Procurement for related commodities would be done through the United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); (b) established a new funding mechanism for non-state
actors through the creation of a Rapid Results Fund (RRF) of US$3 million for prevention. The
fund was supported by various donors and managed by UNDP which would call for proposals
focusing on multiple concurrent sexual partnerships, reproductive health and HIV, TB and HIV,
and male circumcision; (c) continued financing CNCS through the Common Fund; and (d)
allocated US$0.7 million for evaluation of innovative programs, such as post-test counseling, call
for proposals and male circumcision.

For the RRF, UNDP was contracted by MOH, not by CNCS which had hired the GMA. When
management of the sub-projects moved from CNCS to UNDP —and the funds moved from a
Special Account administered by CNCS to an account with MOH— after the fifth amendment of
the FA, the component became more strategic with greater focus on prevention but without
increased focus on geographic areas with the highest HIV prevalence. UNDP would contract
CSOs with more capacity and the average size of contracts for sub-projects would more than
double. Smaller CSOs and NGOs could still participate through joint ventures with larger
organizations but this did hardly happen. As coordinators, CNCS and its provincial nuclei
(NPCS) would officially maintain a participatory role in the recruitment of the CSOs but in
practice, especially at provincial level, the NPCS were little aware of the activities of UNDP-
contracted agencies. Towards the end of the project MOH planned a nutrition intervention> A 6-
month food basket would be provided to patients starting on ART through the World Food
Program. The intervention never took place under the project as government took a long time to
decide on the final target districts for the intervention. Government had requested a third project
extension (in a letter dated June 17, 2011) for the implementation of just this contract. The Bank
did not agree and instead it was decided that the intervention would be financed through another
Bank operation, the HCSP.

The program supported initiatives in private firms under the project Avante. One agency was
hired to manage sub-projects in companies nation-wide. The companies ranged from multi-
nationals with over 200 workers to small enterprises with less than 20 employees. HARP
supported 557 sub-projects against a target of 250, thereby reaching an estimated 45,000 workers
and family members. At the end of the two-year contract an evaluation, which reviewed 30
percent of 102 sub-projects, showed that most sub-projects dealt with information, education and
communication (IEC), peer education, distribution of condoms, VCT. Little attention was given
to legal support, evaluation, or care and treatment. The appreciation for the sub-projects was great
amongst the workers, who for the large majority considered the support very important for them;
the sub-projects mostly did not involve managers both in the design and implementation, nor
spouses of workers or surrounding communities. VCT services were not fully utilized in this
component because of stigma and fear of lack of confidentiality. Sub-projects often suffered
from delays due to weak financial management. The two-year duration of the contract of Austral
hampered the implementation of subcontracts towards the end of the period as the remaining
implementation time became simply too short. Sub-projects tended to be more successful where
the management of the company provided active support and allowed e.g. for activities during
working hours. The evaluation could have led to a better designed second generation of sub-
projects with the private sector, but such a second phase was never implemented as CNCS did not
renew the contract with the originally hired firm or sign a new contract with another agency.
However, CNCS continued to meet through ECoSida 20 with the private sector, proving
sustainability beyond the project support. In 2010 it attended 88 meetings to mobilize managers
and 21 firms started work place interventions.

Component 2: Capacity Building for the Civil Society HIV/AIDS Response (US$5.5 million)
would support efforts to create AIDS competent communities by improving skills and increasing
implementation capacity of implementers, supporters, and target groups active under the
Community and Civil Society Initiatives. Activities to be funded would include hiring and
training ―Facilitating Agents‖ in each province, courses and activities to build awareness and
capacity for leadership in the public sector, civil society and private sector, and the formulation
and distribution of training modules and packages of IEC materials.

The implementation of component 1 required much capacity building amongst CSOs and NGOs.
Facilitating Agents were hired for this purpose and the implementation of component 1 started as
a pilot in 3 provinces: Sofala, Manica and Tete. UNAIDS especially was helpful in providing
capacity building to CSOs for proposal writing and sub-project implementation; it also provided

   ECoSIDA is a national Mozambican private sector initiative in the fight against HIV/AIDS, mainly
financed by the private sector itself. It has around 50 active members.

technical assistance to CNCS. Three United Nations Volunteers helped in the coordination of
civil society initiatives

The MOH had a role in the technical supervision of NGOs involved in the implementation of
health activities. Technical assistance was hired to assist CNCS in the development of a standard
contract in which it is set out how an NGO interested in carrying out health sector related
activities with HARP financing had to behave: (a) in obeying the MOH rules and regulations –
also with regards to medical waste management; and (b) in reporting relationships with both
CNCS and MOH.

Component 3: Government Multi-sector Response (US$ 7 million): Ministries and subordinate
institutions would be supported in the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS related
programs directed toward their own personnel (particularly high risk staff such as soldiers, police,
extension agents, teachers, health workers) and their families, as well as programs directed
towards their clients. The program would concentrate on non-health ministries and other key
public sector institutions to effectively respond to the epidemic, with emphasis on prevention and
care for infected and affected families. In each ministry a Focal Point would be appointed. With
guidance from provincial Government and Ministry of State Administration, District
Administrators would be engaged to foster development of District HIV/AIDS plans.

Under the Government Multisector Response component focal points were selected in 18
Ministries and also public or para-statal organizations such as the National Institute of Health, or
Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique, the national airline, were financed for a truly multisectoral public
response. Some claim that too many agencies were involved, thereby diluting the efforts. In total
38 agencies were supported. Disbursements were often far below expectations, showing lack of
commitment of their leadership. Focal points in the agencies, at central and provincial level, were
part-timers and did not receive any additional payment for their HIV-related work. CNCS
provided training at central and provincial level; it considered the hiring of extra technical
assistance to jumpstart some of the programs but this never happened. Often the component did
not result in activities beyond AIDS in the workplace activities or handling of personnel issues. It
did not consider the strategic role a ministry could play in the national response; exceptions being
the incorporation of HIV/AIDS in the curriculum by the Ministry of Education (with support
from other development partners), or the development of anti-discriminatory legislation by the
Ministry of Justice –Lei 5/2002. As Government is the largest employer in the country, and civil
servants are amongst the most highly educated citizens, workplace activities were certainly
justified to safeguard the human capital. CNCS could have brought the better performing
ministries, such as the Ministry of the Interior or Defense, together with poorer performing ones
to improve implementation. The Ministry of Women and Coordination of Social Action was one
of the largest grant recipients of the public sector component. The Ministry‘s HIV/AIDS
programs included support for orphans and vulnerable children and income generating projects
for women affected by HIV. A new opportunity arose with the creation in 2007 of a new Ministry
of Civil Service, which also received support from a Bank financed Public Sector Reform Project.
An HIV/AIDS strategy for civil servants was developed and the Ministry received US$ 1 million
to finance prevention activities in 12 priority ministries and public institutions. At project closing,
efforts were underway to mainstream these activities in the agencies‘ regular annual budgets and
work plans. Ministries would now receive support from the Civil Service Ministry rather than
from CNCS.

Examples of specific sectoral activities or initiatives supported under this component are:
 For Higher Education: creation of a HIV/AIDS Group for students of the Eduardo Mondlane
   University; short term training for some members of the group; production of a biannual


                                                  28
    newsletter; support for training by this group of local training institutions in the provinces to
    enable them to set up their own HIV/AIDS Groups; awareness workshops; set up of a local
    clinic (mainly for VCT services); supply of equipment and IEC materials.
   The Ministry of Education received project support for a program called ―Direct Support to
    Schools‖, which helped decentralization efforts so that schools could plan themselves in
    planning of HIV/AIDS activities. The Ministry received a lot of support from other agencies
    as well, including UNICEF, UNFPA and DANIDA.
   Ministry of Agriculture: thanks to mainstreaming this ministry had its own funding to finance
    its HIV efforts, which included an economic impact assessment, a study into ―Adult mortality
    in rural households in Mozambique and Implications for Policy‖. CNCS helped in training of
    educators and the development of strategic plans for the sector. The Ministry used its role in
    food production to encourage diversification of crops and diets aimed at boosting the immune
    system. Programs to build home farms and school gardens were carried out. The large
    PROAGRI program included HIV/AIDS activities in the work program of extension workers.
   Ministry of Transport and Communication incorporated HIV/AIDS activities for construction
    workers as a requirement in contracts for its infrastructure projects. Such activities included
    theatre, workshops, counseling, and condom distribution.

Originally the component was not included under the grants component of the DGA, and its
activities could not be considered as sub-projects. This meant that regular Bank procurement and
FM requirements would apply. CNCS procedures sometimes also formed a barrier since it only
approved quarterly plans and only disbursed per activity, thereby making it impossible to apply
for any interventions other than isolated events or equipment. The laborious procurement process
brought unnecessary centralization and was responsible for the majority of disbursement delay,
although other factors also played a role, such as the lack of capacity, the 20 percent requirement
in co-financing, and the part-time character of the focal points in each ministry (except for
Education). After the 4th restructuring the public sector interventions of component 3 would also
be considered as sub-projects and could be funded just as interventions under component 1.

Component 4: Strengthening and Scaling Up Health Sector Services for HIV/AIDS (US$17.5
million) aimed to scale up the response of the health sector to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to
provide technical leadership on treatment and care for people living with HIV/AIDS. The
component would support (i) strengthening of the Integrated Health Network providing voluntary
counseling and testing and HIV/AIDS related services in four central provinces; (ii) increasing
the supply of HIV related drugs and supplies, condoms, drugs for opportunistic infections, anti-
retroviral for PPTCT of HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis; (iii) strengthening clinical
laboratory capacity for CD4 monitoring and diagnosis of opportunistic infections; (iv) measures
to enhance bio-security; (v) measures to enhance blood safety; (vi) training and anti-retroviral
drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis for health workers; (vii) improved management of
opportunistic infections; and (viii) monitoring and evaluation of the component and the overall
progress of the epidemic.

For the fourth component MOH was the implementing agency. The component was implemented
relatively well --especially during the first half of the project-- as the ministry had experience
with implementing Bank projects and used a project unit (GACOPI), which also manage d the
TAP. However, with changes in MOH leadership and resulting shift in responsibilities from
GACOPI to various departments in the ministry, a lack of coordination resulted in disjointed
activities and delays, as the regular departments were not acquainted with donor requirements.
The program focused on bio-security.

Human resources development for MOH received much attention. First a training of trainers
course was developed, together with didactic materials, before training programs for health
workers in safe practices could be implemented largely as scheduled. The training programs
were implemented with only minor delays. MOH had the facilities and the experience of
contracting these institutes for project-financed training and it was able to pre-finance some of the
training if project funding was not immediately forthcoming. The courses included training for
doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, dentistry, etc. The MOH also had a role in the technical
supervision of NGOs involved in the implementation of health activities (see component 2).
Standards were developed in five areas: VCT, home-based care, day hospitals, treatment of
sexually transmitted infections, and prevention of parent to child transmission.

Blood banks received training in bio-safety. Materials for IEC campaigns were developed and
campaigns for blood donations took place in cooperation with schools and churches.

MOH performed especially well in the set-up of VCT. Originally it was foreseen that separate
VCT services would be set up, but by mainstreaming these services the number of locations could
be dramatically expanded to 359, much beyond the original target of 100. Provision of ART was
expanded much beyond the original target of PPTCT because of reasons mentioned above and
ART is now available in all districts.

Minor civil works for the rehabilitation of VCT centers, laboratories, blood banks. Given        the
general status of much of the health infrastructure demand for this sub-component                 far
outstretched resources. This and the need to make sure that the rehabilitations would benefit    the
health services in general and not just HIV services, required very careful planning. Most of    the
works were related to the proper installation of equipment.

Procurement of goods, such as vehicles, laboratory equipment, medical supplies such as
disposable syringes, test kits, reagents, and pharmaceuticals, condoms and medical and
sterilization equipment was done with some delays and Bank staff provided extra procurement
training. HARP disbursements declined in 2005-2007 as the Common Fund, supported by other
donors, became available and its procedures were easier to follow for MOH than the Bank‘s.
During the second half of the project implementation slowed down. In order to fully utilize the
project resources still available to MOH, UNFPA would be contracted on sole-source basis for
major procurement of medical supplies and goods, as was possible after the 2008 restructuring,.

The dramatic price drop for ARV over the project‘s life from over US$10,000 to only US$100-
400 per year had a significant impact on the treatment policy of GOM and WB support to it.
While in the beginning of the project the Bank would only finance treatment for opportunistic
infections and ART only for PPTCT, towards the end first line ARV were also allowed to be
procured for general purpose although this did not happen on any large scale, as other sources of
funding were used for it. It did however fundamentally change the way civil society
organizations could provide care to PLHIV.

Component 5: Institutional Development for Program Management (US$6 million) supported
the Executive Secretariat of the CNCS, strengthening its capacity to lead the country in the
campaign.

 HARP provided much support to capacity building and staffing of CNCS in management,
administration, FM, procurement, but also in technical areas such as communication and M&E.
ACTAfrica supported such training by bringing MAP implementers together from various
African countries. The training provided practical guidance and an opportunity to share


                                                 30
experiences in (a) implementation challenges, (b) procurement management, (c) FM, (d)
administration and documentation, and (e) country action planning. The community-driven
development approach of component 1 required extra fiduciary training.

HARP financed staffing at central level and for all provincial nuclei of CNCS. Technical
assistance for organizational development was hired to work with the provincial coordinators on
the budgetary planning process, and focused on the demand-driven concept of funding civil
society and community initiatives. CNCS and development partners provided also considerable
support for monitoring efforts in the provinces.

Technical assistance was provided to CNCS to develop a communications strategy for central
level and also for the provinces. A Technical Working Group comprising communication
specialists from 12 public sector institutions and a Communications Working Group of
development partners provided assistance. Such strategy had been deemed so important that it
had been made a legal covenant in the Grant Agreement. It included a range of methodologies,
messages and materials. The Communications Strategy focused on awareness and knowledge of
prevention, treatment and care for HIV, behavior change, recognition of vulnerability and stigma,
and HIV and cultural norms. As a result of the capacity building efforts, CNCS was able to
organize a lot of training programs in the various areas for implementers, journalists of radio, TV
and written press, community leaders, religious leaders, public and private companies, youth
groups, its provincial nuclei etc.

M&E received much support from development partners. Besides M&E policy development the
project financed M&E staff, equipment and operational costs at central and provincial level.
Although planned from the start, the project was never able to recruit international TA for M&E.
The CNCS officers would make regular supportive visits to the provinces. Three M&E working
groups were established: (a) one led by CNCS to facilitate dialogue around strategic planning,
monitoring, evaluation, research policy and technical issues; (b) one led by MOH to focus on
epidemiology and health service statistics; and (c) a multi-sectoral working group including the
M&E officers of most ministries, focusing on the multi-sectoral response. At provincial level
M&E officers were hired to monitor especially the interventions of the CSOs and NGOs.

Bank support was further used for the development of PEN II and III, to which the Bank‘s AIDS
Strategy and Action Planning service (ASAP) also contributed.

MOH‘ GACOPI –its staff being paid for by the project-- provided FM and procurement services
for the all project components, as it was well-versed in World Bank procedures. During
implementation the unit suffered major blows in its capacity when as a result of leadership
changes at the top of the ministry contractual staff was replaced with regular civil servants
without a good transition plan. GACOPI was handling many other donor projects in the health
sector and therefore required a separate HARP coordinator.

For the provincial directorates it was agreed that CNCS would do financial and procurement
management, as they lacked the capacity as well to fulfill the DP requirements.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A special beneficiary survey was not carried out for this core ICR. During the ICR mission‘s
interviews, a picture emerged in which beneficiaries were very grateful for the support, but also
expressed major concern about the short duration and limited scope of many of the civil society
projects. CNCS expressed its great appreciation for the groundbreaking support from the World
Bank, which had been crucial in getting the national response going.

In 2006, a study was carried out of the sub-projects with civil society organizations, titled
―Evaluation of the Efficacy of the sub-projects financed by CNCS under the National Response
against HIV/ AIDS in the Republic of Mozambique‖. We summarize here the opinions of the
beneficiaries of the sub-projects, as reflected in the report.

For the study, 217 projects from categories between US$1,000 to over 20,000 per project had
been selected from all provinces. By far the greatest focus of the projects was on mitigation, with
prevention a distant second. A small number of projects focused on advocacy, stigma, treatment,
research of community involvement.

The beneficiaries were evaluated through group interviews. They had been selected by the
members of the implementing agencies. The beneficiaries were a varied group in terms of gender,
age, HIV status or affiliations with a religious group.

In general the beneficiaries knew well what they had received from the project and were mostly
satisfied and happy with the material support, as they had no work and the project gave them
something to eat. Besides recognizing that the projects improved their lives, it was very often
mentioned that more assistance was needed and that many people in need were not benefitting
from this or a similar project. Beneficiaries were afraid that the project would be interrupted and
asked for more projects to reach more people. Such requests were especially frequent for projects
with children, as many districts have large numbers of orphans in need. Often the numbers of
children in need were greater than the project could cover and the most vulnerable had to
prioritized, such as double orphans. Exclusion of some children was not always well accepted by
the communities.

The majority of beneficiaries had gotten in touch with the project through the community leader.
It was him who presented the project to the community and who indicated which people should
participate in the project or which should receive a home visit. The leader‘s involvement showed
how well the project was rooted in the community – an aspect which is very important for its
sustainability.

Questions about the needs of PLHIV provoked various reactions in the different groups of
beneficiaries. In some groups people said that one should not know the status of beneficiaries but
should only look at the needs of people. It was clearly difficult to discuss this theme in public. In
other communities the beneficiaries were surprised as they had not realized that the project was
linked to the national AIDS strategy. Again in other groups the discussion about HIV became
very lively and people had many questions about treatment and the protective effect of condoms.

In projects where PLHIV were involved there was a greater openness to discuss the problems of
infected and affected people. The most frequently mentioned issues were poverty, lack of jobs,
discrimination of PLHIV, lack of access to health services and insufficient nutrition for people on
ART and treatment for opportunistic infections.



                                                 36
Several problems mentioned by the beneficiaries were linked to delays in disbursements which
delayed the beginning of the projects or had a very negative impact in case of late arrival of
critical elements such as seeds or school materials. Other issues were: the premature closure of
projects because CNCS funding dried up; the lack of markets to sell the products produced by the
projects; the lack of transport to bring patients to the hospital; the low number of projects in the
communities with many needs; the quantity of products or supplies distributed was almost always
insufficient.

              Evaluation summary by CNCS, Implementer of the project

1. General context

Mozambique was one of the African countries that benefited from World Bank funding
under the Multi-country AIDS Program, to strengthen its national response against
HIV/AIDS.

The objective of the MAP project was to assist the country reducing the rate of new HIV
infections and mitigating the adverse effects of infection, through prevention, care and
treatment.

The budget for this project was estimated at US$55.00 million, to be invested in five
main areas:
 Community and civil society initiatives - US$ 28.0 million;
 Capacity building of civil society - US$ 5.5 million;
 Public sectoral response (Ministries and Provincial Directorates) - US$ 7.0
 Strengthening and expansion of the Health Sector response (managed by MOH) -US
   $ 17.5 million;
 Institutional development for the implementation of the program - US$ 6.0 million.

The design and negotiations for the Project took place between mid-2002 till early 2003.
It was required that from the beginning, the minimal institutional capacity was in place to
guarantee the funding. Therefore CNCS, as host organization, recruited qualified
technical staff for important areas, such as financial management, procurement, planning
and monitoring as well as communication.

The 2003 functional analysis and the readjustment affected interventions, professional
posts, profiles and functions. These changes were reflected in revisions and exemptions
to some articles of Decree 10/2000 (March). These actions were much appreciated by the
Bank, as they reassured it to finance the national response against HIV/AIDS.

After WB financing was secured, the project approved and Grant Agreement signed, the
CNCS worked diligently to meet the following Grant Conditions:
 Finalization of a Operations Manual (including the components of monitoring and the
   Health sector, as well as the respective annexes);




21
     In Mozambique HARP was known by the acronym MAP.



                                            39
   Establishment of a financial management system in line with the Operations Manual,
    as well as the design and execution of a training program in program ming and
    financial management for the pilot provinces - Manica, Tete and Sofala - to test and
    validate the system;
   Filling of key positions, especially for procurement, monitoring and evaluation and
    fund management at provincial level;
   Preparation and submission of a procurement plan covering all project activities,
    including contracting and procurement of goods and services;
   Contracting of an independent auditor for the Project;
   Opening of a Special Account for the MAP Project.

After having satisfied the above conditions in a timely fashion, the Project was declared
effective in August, 2003.

2. Challenges in the Implementation

The implementation of the MAP experienced several challenges, some more critical than
others, as described below:
 The start-up of implementation, above all the scale-up to national coverage, would
   have to be assured by facilitating agents. Their hiring was a slow process, because the
   contracts needed to be reviewed by the Administrative Tribunal and because not all
   had the required skills (many overstated their potential on paper, but reality on the
   ground was different);
 The prior review by the Administrative Tribunal formed often a bottleneck to the
   accelerated implementation, in line with the emergency character of the operation;
 The banking network and financial systems in the country were not sufficiently
   developed to satisfy the project‘s requirements (financial transactions only through
   banks, i.e. checks and bank transfers);
 Lack of experience and poor interpretation of bidding documents on the side of
   implementers and facilitating agents;
 Misrepresentation by implementers;
 Inexperience of some provincial nuclei in managing contracts and the demand for
   services that these generate;
 Weak technical qualifications of the project staff both in civil society and in the
   Public Sector to deal with the strict requirements of the Map project;
 Inappropriateness of the strict procurement requirements imposed by the World Bank,
   through the MAP, in view of the rudimentary state of the market for goods and
   services in the rural and peri-urban areas (strongly dominated by the informal sector,
   without accounting record systems and without issuing of invoices, pro-formas,
   receipts, etc.).
 Difficulties of the implementers in satisfying the requirement to contribute up to 20%
   of the total value of a subproject as demanded for MAP financing;
 Management overload because of the existence of two parallel financial systems for
   the same target groups and sometimes the same beneficiaries of the same
   organizations (Common Fund and MAP);



                                           40
    Deficient and unclear communication by the Bank about the criteria for the rating of
     performance of the Bank‘s portfolio. This made it difficult to take adequate measures
     to change the poor ratings‘ flags (red or yellow) which were often given to some
     aspects of the subprojects;
    Lack of flexibility for disbursement, which caused delays in the installments to the
     organizations and caused on their part some discouragement;
    Weak financial absorption capacity of many civil society and public sector
     organizations.

3. Decisions and its effectiveness

During the implementation of the project, the World Bank tried different approaches that
it thought could galvanize the performance of the project, but which proved not very
productive. In early 2004, one tried out financing through the Rapid Results Initiative.

In theory it seemed that the World Bank would be willing to relax some of its austere
procurement requirements, e.g., by increasing the thresholds for purchase categories
without invoice (direct procurement or shopping) and so forth. This turned out not to be
the case. The management of these projects soon deplored that the World Bank itself was
not prepared to show results in 100 days. Just the deliberations in Maputo and the
requirement of no-objections to proceed took more than two months.

Already in the final years of the MAP funding, when it was fully incorporated in the
Common Fund and CNCS showed a noteworthy performance, an unsuccessful attempt
was made to hire a grant management agency.

Later, the World Bank decided to withdraw part of the financing and reallocate it to a
new Rapid Results, Initiative, this time managed by UNDP. This administrative measure
substantially modified the management processes for subprojects and warrants in time an
objective evaluation.

4.      Lessons

    The MAP Project truly leveraged the energy for a dynamic real multisectoral
     response and for the capacity building of civil society to address the adversities
     imposed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

    The MAP will have been, while it lasted, a learning exercise for the CNCS and for all
     stakeholders that benefited from its financing, because of its rigorous rules of
     financial management, scrupulous observance of procurement processes and its
     orientation towards results. It erred by exaggerating with its zealous austerity and
     requirement of banking transactions even where a bank didn‘t exist, and by failing to
     adapt to the objective development conditions of the country.




                                            41
   For CNCS the Project inspired the confidence of other international partners. The fact
    that the World Bank assumed the risk to initiate financing the response has been
    instrumental in mobilizing many other partners.

   To some extent, the mandatory aide memoire, the rigorous requirements, the
    imposition of its functional models and operational systems and all the pressure that
    came with it being exerted on the national structures, contradicted part of the
    principles of the Paris Declaration, namely National Ownership and Alignment.

   HIV prevalence at the start of the MAP was estimated at 15%, with an epidemic
    causing 500 new infections daily. ART was embryonic (with experience limited to
    the contribution of the Comunità di Sant'Egidio), and prevention of parent to child
    transmission --not to mention pediatric ART—was barely incipient. The community-
    based approach against the disease faced widespread taboos and prejudices. The
    massive scale-up of the response that the MAP provided allowed to demystify many
    issues and to take the message of prevention to many homes and families, schools and
    clubs. While it is true that the rate continues to rise, the project‘s contribution towards
    this pandemic, which actually demands a cultural revolution, is not to be
    underestimated.

                                 CNCS Comments of ICR

We would first of all like to express our gratitude for the quality of the evaluation
undertaken. Indeed, the evaluation reflects a thorough analysis of the Project
accomplishments over the period of the Project implementation. It also raises critical
issues in a deep and comprehensive understanding of the course of HIV and Aids
epidemic in Mozambique, the national response as well as the general international trends
and approaches. Overall the evaluation is balanced as it indicates areas of positive
outcomes as well as those of poor accomplishment and does also address what failed to
be considered in order for the response to be different.

Notwithstanding the above, there are aspects of the project development that deserve a
more in depth clarification. Also there are actors that have played an instrumental role
over the course of project implementation which have been left out in this evaluation. In
some parts, credits are given to actors that have not performed what the evaluation seems
to have perceived on the ground.

In order for it to also bring on board issues we consider important for a clear
understanding of the contours the project has described over its lifespan, as well as a fair
judgment of some events that have shaped up the implementation, below are comments
we deem worth to consider:

1.      Under point 18, it should be mentioned that delays in replenishment of accounts
had also to do with lack of absorption capacity from the implementing agencies – which
has not been mentioned in any point of the evaluation – as well as delays in
replenishment of CNCS‘s accounts by the World Bank (the evaluation has pointed out



                                              42
the Bank delays in reacting to issues that needed urgency as the project dealt with
emergency situation under point 71).

2.      Under point 19, it should be pointed out that the evaluation has been unfair in
leaving out a mention to KPMG and Ernest and Young, two consult organizations that
were contracted in by CNCS to strengthen project planning and management capacity of
both CNCS and the implementing organizations. Under the same point, the mention to
UNAIDS as an organization that has given technical assistance to CNCS is, somehow,
surprising. In fact we have worked with UNAIDS as a valid partner within the broader
context of partnership under which collaboration from other entities is always welcome.
It is a broader collaborative effort in place that boosts up the national response. A
mention to one partner leaving out others is, indeed, unfair.

In the same point, the evaluation has found reluctance of CNCS in contracting a GMA.
This, from our point of view, is just a simple judgment with no fundaments. It should be
recalled the various negotiations‘ meetings - all with minutes given no objection by the
World Bank - to settle an agreement with the GMA which ended up being difficult to
come to an agreement. Critical issues most of which of fiduciary nature did not allow to
consider what the GMA had proposed from their Inception Report which is available for
the evaluation to consult, should the consultant deem it worth to do so. Some of t he issues
proposed in the Inception Report, taking them on board, would change the scope of the
ToR for contracting a GMA with all implications for an international competitive bidding
that should be transparent and give equal consideration and treatment to all competing
agencies from the onset of the contract throughout its implementation up to the end.

3.      Under point 20, it should be clarified that there was no any king of agreement for
provision to Ministerial Focal Points of additional payment, beyond their monthly
salaries, due to their involvement in HIV and AIDS coordination in the Ministries. The
idea of mainstreaming HIV in the sectoral plans was put in place in order to create
capacity and sustain it for years to come.

4.      The point 21 does not report fairly the facts. It would be more understandable to
separate the treatment given to the Health Sector from that of the changes in the project
direction which ended up with the contracting of UNDP to act transitorily as grant
making agency. We believe that the contracting of UNDP and the whole procurement of
medicines and other commodities deserve a fair more critical assessment which should be
more impartial and better documented by all supporting documentation. By the time the
evaluation team was undertaking the project assessment UNDP had less than 30%
disbursements to project implementing agencies and that was even beyond the time
period agreed upon for this agency to close the project.


The evaluation seems to praise the way UNDP has entered into the scene and the
strategies adopted to finance the Civil Society organizations. However, it fails to mention
that CNCS‘s experience was crucial in the effort. The selection of organizations and their
endorsement in the provinces was coordinated by the CNCS Provincial Nucleus, which



                                            43
the evaluation does not mention at all. The Steering Committee of the Program
spearheaded by the Minister of Health counted variably on the experience and expertise
of CNCS‘s technical staff that had experienced working with all kind of organizations.
The minutes of the committee are available and can be consulted any time. It was CNCS
who suggested that for the lifespan of the initiative it would be good to strategize and bet
on organizations that have some stability, and this needs to be clearly recorded. That was
based on CNCS‘s experience with the so called Facilitating Agencies.

5.     The evaluation of the Private Sector outsourcing needs to be deepened. The
project evaluation seems to give a positive impression of the perform ance of the
component, which it is not the position CNCS shares.

6.      The point made by the assessment on point 71 was a common ground throughout
the implementation of the project. One should add contradicting positions coming from
the World Bank Project Team (management and procurement from the WB) which in
most of the cases delayed project implementation. An example is the Result Based
Management project, which after launching in 2003 had no objection three months later,
despite being considered a 100 days result experience.

We hope the above mentioned comments will be taken on board in this evaluation of the
MAP Project.
