ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
POWER SUBSECTOR PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal indigenous sources of energy in Thailand are hydro-
power, natural gas, petroleum, lignite, large but as yet uneconomic oil shale
deposits, wood fuel, charcoal, paddy husk and bagasse. Geothermal explor-
ation is being carried out in the northern part of Thailand near Chiangmai.
Hydro Potential
1.02      Hydro potential (excluding that of two international rivers, the
Mekong and the Salween) is estimated at about 9,300 MW of which 1,270 MW are
now in operation; 2,100 MW in thirteen projects are under construction or
programmed for installation before 1991; 635 MW in 13 projects are in the
prefeasibility or feasibility study stages and about 1,900 MW in 12 projects
have been selected by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
for conceptual studies. Ninety-three major sites with a potential of about
3,290 MW have been preliminarily assessed by the National Energy Administra-
tion (NEA). NEA is carrying out desk studies for about 25 mini-hydro sites.
A mini-hydro study is included under the Second Accelerated Rural Electrifi-
cation Project of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), the loan agree-
ment of which was signed in November 1980 (Loan 1871-TH).
1.03      The Mekong river, which forms the border between Thailand and Laos
and then flows through Kampuchea and Viet Nam has a total hydro potential in
seven projects of about 19,000 MW with an annual energy output of 110,000
GWh. This would be equal to 9 times Thailand's electricity consumption in
1979 and 3 times the consumption forecast for 1990. The Mekong's development
is governed jointly by Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand and Viet Nam and construc-
tion is likely to await the resolution of the current political problems in
the region. Substantial resettlement problems would arise from the develop-
ment of the first major hydro site at Pa Mong on the Mekong, about 60 km west
of Vietianne where the river forms the border between Laos and Thailand. An
organizational and financial study of the Pa Mong project is being carried
out by consultants. In addition, the numerous tributaries to the Mekong
River in Laos are tentatively estimated to provide another 18,000 MW of hydro
potential to the region.
1.04      Based on a desk study made by NEA, a dam site on the Salween river
at the border of Thailand and Burma has a hydro potential of 5,800 MW with
an annual energy output of about 47,000 GWh. Recently there have been minis-
terial level exchanges and the two Governments agreed in principle to coop-
erate on the development of the Salween River. The Thai Government is con-
scious of the fact that unless these international rivers are developed,
Thailand's energy requirement for power generation in the 1990s would again
depend on imported energy.

Oil
1.05      Thailand's proven petroleum reserves total about 1.1 million barrels
in the Fang province of Northern Thailand. Production at present is less
than 100,000 barrels a year, about 0.1% of total domestic consumption.
Intensive exploration is currently being undertaken in the northeast region
of the country and offshore in the Gulf of Thailand where natural gas has
already been found (see para. 1.08). There are extensive oil shale reserves
(about 2,500 million mt), mainly in the remote areas of Tak province but oi.l
production from shale is still uneconomic. The Government is considering
the establishment of a pilot shale oil extraction plant under a technical
cooperation agreement with countries possessing such technologies.
1.06      Thailand has large areas of sugar plantations and has initiated
studies of the feasibility of making ethanol by using the alcohol that can
be produced from sugar cane. The studies are at an early stage but will be
followed with interest by the Bank.
Coal
1.07      Lignite (low-grade coal) reserves are currently estimated at around
770 million mt located at Mae Moh (650 million mt), Krabi (100 million mt),
and Li (20 million mt). Of the lignite reserves at the Mae Moh site,
350 million mt are proven and probable reserves which are sufficient to
sustain a total generating capacity of about 1,500 MW for about 25 years to
be developed during the 1980s. EGAT is constructing units 4 and 5 of 150 MW
each at Mae Moh (150 MW are currently installed) which the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) is helping finance and the Bank has recently made a loan of
US$72 million for the complementary lignite development (Loan 1852-TH). The
Department of Mineral.Resources is undertaking a drilling program for all
the lignite bearing basins in the country with the exception of Mae Moh,
which are still under the responsibility of EGAT. Preliminary indications
are that the reserve potential at Mae Marat in the province of TAK could be
substantial but possibly at a considerable depth underground.
Natural Gas
1.08      Seven promising gas fields have been discovered in the Gulf:  the
two best-delineated being structure "A", about 425 km offshore, by the Union
Group; and structure "B", about 595 km offshore, by the Texas Pacific Group.
Union has four other fields close to structure "A", and total Union gas
reserves (proven and probable) are about 5 trillion cubic feet (tcf); Texas
Pacific reserves from its "B" and "E" structures are about 8 tcf. The
concessionnaires will undertake the development of these reserves, and the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) will take delivery at the offshore
production platforms. In the initial years much of the gas output will be
contracted to EGAT, while a portion will be available to industries along the
onshore pipeline route. The Bank made a loan of US$107 million (Loan 1773-TH)
to PTT in February 1980 for the first phase of development of the pipeline
which by late 1981 will carry the natural gas to the Bang Pakong station,



- 3 -
currently under construction about 60 km southeast of Bangkok, and to the
Bangkok metropolitan area. The substitution of natural gas for imported oil
would considerably reduce the demand for fuel oil for power generation
(para. 6.04). EGAT has in its development program 2,700 MW of generating
capacity to be converted or newly installed in the next few years. It is
expected that by 1991 about 37% of EGAT's total generation would be from
thermal stations using natural gas.
1.09      Sponge iron smelting and petro-chemical plants are in the
feasibility study stage with a view to using the natural gas more economically
than for power generation. However, it is anticipated that substantial quan-
tities of gas will always be available for power plants. A gas utilization
study is being undertaken under Loan 1773-TH to determine the extent of
industrial usage of natural gas.
Energy Consumption
1.10      Total energy consumption in the FY70-79 period increased from about
7.4 million tons of oil equivalent (77.2 trillion kcal) to 15.6 million tons
(162.8 trillion kcal), an average annual growth rate of 8.6%.
1.11      Energy consumption by forms of energy in FY79 is shown below:
Energy consumption                       Percent
(trillion kcal)

1.12      An energy master plan study is being undertaken by NEA, financed
by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with ADB as the
executing agency. The objectives of the study are to define a program to
meet Thailand's energy requirements up to the year 2000. The study is
expected to be concluded by end 1981.
1.13      An energy sector review has been carried out by Bank staff
including an analysis of the commercial energy sector as a whole. The draft
report (No. 2813-TH) was reviewed with the Government in July 1980. The
broader institutional issues relating to the improvement and change of the
present structure to take account of the changing role of energy in the
economy have been addressed in the energy sector review and would be
pursued by the Bank in the next integrated energy project.

Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.14      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 19.3% and 2.4% of GDP respectively.
1.15      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Thailand-s
economic development. Between FY70 and 79, when GDP grew at an average rate
of about 7.3% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an average
rate of about 14.0%. The elasticity coefficient of 1.9 is reasonable and
comparable to countries at a similar stage of development.
Sector Organization
General
1.16      The power sector consists of eight government agencies, three
state utilities, the ministries to which they report, and four private
franchises which are so small as to be insignificant (para. 1.22).  The
three state utilities supply nearly all of the electricity consumed in the
country, the private franchises and self-generating industries represented
about 14.7% of the installed capacity in FY79 (para. 1.40).
1.17      The state-owned utilities are the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Highlights of the EGAT, MiEA and PEA
operations are shown in Annex 1.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
1.18      EGAT, the proposed Borrower, was established in 1968 as a wholly-
owned Government corporation for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of
electricity supply throughout the country and coordinating the generation
and transmission systems and is responsible to the Prime Minister's Office.
EGAT generated 95% of all electric energy in Thailand in FY79; the balance
was generated by PEA, NEA, private franchises and self-generating industries.
The Provincial Electricity Authority
1.19      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly-owned Government
corporation under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for providing
and distributing electricity in all provinces of the country except in the
areas served by MEA.  PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from EGAT but
also generates small quantities in areas not yet connected to the grid. In
FY79, PEA purchased, 4,678 GWh and generated 82 GWh; 4,254 GWh were sold to
1,574,000 consumers. Compared with FY78, GWh sold and the number of
consumers connected increased by 16.2% and 16.3%, respectively. System
losses were about 10.6% in FY79. This is acceptable considering the size
and load density of its service areas.



5-
1.20      PEA is the Government agency responsible for implementing the
accelerated rural electrification program (para. 1.46). The program only
substantially began with Loan 1527-TH made by the Bank to PEA in 1978 for
the first major phase which will provide electricity to about 4,560 villages
by the end of 1982.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority
1.21      MEA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government corporation
under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for supplying electricity
to the Bangkok Metropolitan Area covering the provinces of Bangkok, Thon
Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY79, 7,606 GWh were sold to 678,000
consumers. Compared with FY78, energy sales and number of consumers
increased by 11.7%. Distribution losses were about 4.3% in FY79. All of
MEA's power is purchased from EGAT. The Bank has never been asked to assist
MEA, as foreign fund requirements were provided by ADB, in the past.
Private Franchises
1.22      Following the fuel crisis and the Government's policy of restrict-
ing tariff increases, most of the franchises asked to be taken over by PEA.
Since FY76, 52 franchises have been purchased leaving four in private hands
at the end of FY79; two of them purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA
and one directly from EGAT.
Government Agencies
1.23      The eight Government agencies which have a direct interest in the
power sector (para. 1.16) are as under:
- Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD);
- Budget Bureauz
- Tariff Rate Committee (TRC);
- National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB);
- Ministry of Finance (MOF);
- National Energy Administration (NEA);
- Foreign Loan Committee (FLC); and
- Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT).



These agencies review: tariff recommendations; capital project proposals and
budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual financial perform-
ance; and requests for Government equity and loans. None of them has overall
policy responsibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after all the
agencies including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system is
designed to ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly controlled,
but the fiscal emphasis of the approval process has constrained sector deve-
lopment in the past. The interest of PTT in the sector arises from the fact
that EGAT, as the utility responsible for generation, will be the predominant
customer for natural gas and is PTT's largest customer for fuel oil.
Sector Policy
1.24      The national policies in the power sector are:
(a) to ensure the sufficient production and supply of electricity
in accordance with the economic growth throughout the kingdom;
(b) to diversify electricity generating sources by promoting the
use of new sources of energy such as natural gas and lignite
in place of imported oil;
(c) to encourage international cooperation for the development of
water resources and other natural resources for power generation
and the establishment of an international transmission system
interconnection; and
(d) to regulate the tariff within a reasonable range in order to
encourage efficient use and conservation of electricity.
1.25      These policies are in line with the findings of a Bank energy
sector mission (para. 1.13). However, EGAT's emphasis on developing hydro
and lignite and increasing the use of gas for power generation would reduce
the demand of fuel oil and cause a major change in Thailand's refinery
configuration. This is under study by consultants employed by the
Government.
Sector Issues
1.26      Two sector issues were identified by the Sector Review in 1976
(Report No. 1794-TH), institutional and financial. The institutional issue
concerns sector coordination; the financial issues concern tariff levels and
pricing policy.
Sector Coordination
1.27      The need for sector coordination arose from the fact that too many
agencies had a part in sector decision-making causing decisions to be reached
as a compromise of views (para. 1.23) rather than the best decision in the



interests of the sector and Thailand as a whole. In 1977, the CPPD was
formed at cabinet level to oversee the functioning and development of the
power sector and provide overall control. However, CPPD has not developed
into a decision-making body with sufficiently broad competence to exercise
control or to provide the required focus for sector planning. A Ministry of
Science, Energy and Technology was established in 1979 to assume responsi-
bility for the development of nonconventional energy and new uses of existing
energy sources, but so far, it has played a minor role in the larger sector
issues.
1.28      In the context of the loan for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project,
it was agreed that a study of power sector coordination will be carried out by
consultants.  Financing for the study is included in the loan for the Khao
Laem Hydroelectric Project which was not signed until June 17, 1980 due to
delays in implementing the proposed tariff increases (paras. 1.31 and 1.32).
The Government is in the meantime looking into the matter by itself and has
under consideration a number of proposals, i.e., merging of MEA and PEA, the
two distribution entities; merging of EGAT, MEA and PEA; or leaving the
three institutions intact but reporting to one ministry. Another
alternative suggested by the Bank's energy sector mission would be the
creation of a separate energy ministry to which all the energy related
institutions (EGAT, MEA, PEA, NEA and PTT) would report. The energy master
plan study (para. 1.12) being undertaken by NEA includes a review of the
existing institutional framework and organizational arrangement of the
energy sector as a whole and will recommend any changes as necessary. It
was learned lately that the interim report of the study is dealing primarily
with the demand and supply aspects of the energy sector. The institutional
analysis will not be completed until August 1981.  It was decided during
negotiations that the Government and the Bank should await the recom-
mendations of this study on the institutional issues before undertaking study
for power sector coordination.
1.29      The most important function in sector coordination is the cross-
funding between EGAT, MEA and PEA. To improve the financial soundness of
the sector, EGAT's bulk tariff to MEA and PEA should be adequate to generate
sufficient internal cash to finance its larger expansion program. A pro-
vision has been included in the documents of the proposed loan (para. 5.16)
to ensure that sector resources are shared among the three utilities accord-
ing to their needs and that these tariff levels are reviewed periodically
and adjusted as necessary.
Tariff Levels and Oil Subsidies
1.30      Tariff levels proved adequate throughout the late 1960s and the
early 1970s, and the financial position of the sector remained strong.
During the sixties and early seventies, the electricity sector enjoyed
substantial economies of scale, shifts to hydro and large steam generation
coupled with rapid increases in demand and numbers of consumers.  Tariffs
were reduced from time to time during these years. The fuel crisis in
1973/74 and economic slowdown in 1974/75 necessitated large increases in



-8-
tariffs but the political changes in Thailand, which coincided with those
developments, left the country ill-prepared for fully implementing such
increases. Tariff increases took place in 1974 (50%) and 1977 (29%) but were
not sufficient to ensure the financial viability of the sector.
1.31      During 1979, fuel oil prices increased some 115%./1  In an attempt
to cushion the impact of accelerating inflation, the Government chose to
delay passing through the rising costs of electricity to consumers. In
1978, prices of petroleum products were adjusted so that a greater proportion
of the oil price increases were borne by gasoline consumers to the benefit of
fuel oil consumers. However, by mid-1979 this arrangement proved inadequate
to cover the increasing costs of fuel oil to EGAT, and the Government, faced
with mounting criticism of its handling of the economy, introduced direct
budgetary subsidies, estimated to cost about US$9.0 million a month. The
Government s attempts to raise tariffs in November, 1979 by about 56% were
thwarted by strong political opposition and widespread public demonstrations.
Despite these difficulties, the Government managed in February 1980 to
increase the power tariffs by 50% at the bulk supply level and 38% at the
retail level and increase the prices of gasoline, diesel, kerosene and cooking
gas ranging from 24-51%.
1.32      The Government was aware of the need for timely tariff increases to
eliminate the oil and other subsidies to the sector as soon as possible and to
enable the investment program to continue unhindered by financial constraint.
A plan of action was agreed under the Mae Moh Lignite Project (Loan 1852-TH)
to remove subsidies and restore the sector s financial viability. It consists
of the following specific steps:
(a) adjustment of electricity tariffs for bulk power in two or
more steps to remove all oil subsidies to the sector not later
than January 1, 1981;
(b) a further tariff increase for bulk power around April 1, 1981 to
achieve a 2% rate of return for FY81;
(c) procedures to avoid infrequent and large-scale tariff adjustments
in the future, whereby the Government, together with the
Bank and EGAT, would review every six months, commencing from
October 1980, the tariff requirements of the sector for the
next two quarters and introduce agreed adjustments; and
(d) adjustments to the tariff schedules of the three utilities
through the respective fuel adjustment clauses, to be
introduced promptly after oil price increases are announced
by the Government.
/1 Oil-fired thermal units, diesel sets and gas turbines produce in aggre-
gate about 75% of EGAT-s total generation.



- 9-
1.33      Based on tariff reviews in July/August 1980, the Government
announced power rate increases on September 30, 1980 on average of
43.0% at the bulk supply level and 35.0% at the retail level to be
implemented in two stages; two-thirds of the increase was effoctive from
October 1, 1980 and one-third of which was implemented as planned on
January 8, 1981. These tariff increases had eliminated fuel oil subsidy
based on fuel oil prices at that time.
1.34      However, fuel oil prices were further increased on January 20,
1981. During negotiations, it was agreed that as a condition of Board
presentation, the Government would need to implement tariff adjustments on
April 1, 1981 sufficient to (a) enable EGAT and the sector as a whole to
earn a rate of return of 2% in FY81; and (b) remove oil subsidies caused by
the fuel oil price increase in January 1981, and that in case the tariff
adjustments were to be made in two steps (April 1 and July 1), the implemen-
tation of the second tariff adjustment (July 1, 1981) would be a condition
of loan effectiveness.  The Government succeeded recently in implementing
tariff increases by an average of about 19% at the retail level effective
April 1, 1981 in one step, thus fully fulfilling the requirements stipulated
in the plan of action. Only modest increases in tariffs would be required
to achieve an 8% rate of return for FY82 (para. 5.16).
Energy Pricing Policy
1.35      After the removal of all oil subsidies, PTT will charge EGAT and
the consuming public at cost in accordance with international oil prices,
so the current distortions in pricing would be eliminated. Any oil price
increases in the future would be taken care of by the fuel adjustment clause.
1.36      The objective of natural gas pricing is to secure a suitable
linkage between the price of natural gas charged EGAT and the international
price of fuel oil to ensure that the gas is priced at close to its economic
value in the future. A provisional agreement was reached between PTT and
EGAT subject to RTG's confirmation that (a) the natural gas will be priced
at US$3.75 per million BTU from October 1, 1981; and in the subsequent years,
the price of natural gas will be adjusted by taking into consideration the
price of gas purchased by PTT from the gas fields including additional
PTT's expenses for the operation of the gas pipeline system, provided that
the gas sale price, in relation to the posted price of fuel oil in
Singapore shall not fall more than 10 percentage points below the price
level applicable on October 1, 1981.
1.37      The same principle would also apply to the pricing of lignite, the
economic cost of which should be the breakeven cost of imported steam coal
with 3% sulphur content on a plant-to-plant basis taking into account the
differences in capital investment, transmission line penalty, transmission
losses and heat rate. A study is being carried out by consultants under the
Mae Moh Lignite Project (Loan 1852-TH), to determine the long-term forecast
transfer price of lignite. The study is expected to be completed before
December 31, 1981.

Bank Participation in the Sector
1.38      The Bank has made ten loans to EGAT and its predecessor totalling
US$442 million to help finance power plants and transmission facilities and
two loans totalling US$100 million to PEA to finance its Accelerated Rural
Electrification Projects. The first six projects of EGAT have been
completed and are all operating satisfactorily. The Seventh Power Project,
Srinagarind (Ban Chao Nen) Hydroelectric Project, was completed in March
1980 as scheduled. The implementation of the Eighth Power Project (Pattani
Hydroelectric Project) is on schedule. A loan of US$80 million for the
Ninth Power Project (Loan 1690-TH, Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project) was
signed on August 9, 1979 and became effective on May 23, 1980. A loan of
US$80 million for the Tenth Power Project (Loan 1770-TH, Khao Laem
Hydroelectric Project) was signed on June 17, 1980 and became effective on
September 17, 1980. Both projects are proceeding satisfactorily. PEA's
First Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1527-TH) is under
implementation with about 1,090 villages electrified and another 1,000
villages entering into construction. A loan of US$75 million for PEA's
Second Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1871-TH) was approved
by the Bank on June 12, 1980 and signed on November 14, 1980. Another loan
of US$72 million (Loan 1852-TH, Mae Moh Lignite Project) was made to EGAT
in June 1980 for lignite production (para. 1.07).
1.39      To date only one project performance audit report has been pre-
pared in respect of EGAT's operations. This report dated March 1978 for the
South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH) indicated that the
main objectives of the project had been met and that the project was
completed on time and within the original cost estimate. No difficulties
were encountered during project implementation. For this project some
financial advantage to the Borrower resulted from exercising an option to
purchase duplicate generating equipment provided in the contract for Unit
No. 3 at the same generating station. This action was previously agreed
with the Bank. No other particular lessons were learned from this
conventional thermal project that could be applied to the proposed loan.

1.42      Total energy consumption was 12,492.0 GWh in FY79 or 271 kWh per
capita: 2,715.0 GWh (21.7%) were used by residential consumers; 1,856.6 GWh
(14.9%) by commercial consumers; 7,822.2 GWh (62.6%) by industrial consumers
and 98.2 GWh (0.8%) by street lighting and others. Total system losses were
about 14.9% including station services.

/a This percentage is lower than that of population with electricity
(33.8%) because it is not unusual in Thailand to have one meter

Rural Electrification
1.45      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Since 1968 the number of consumers
increased at an annual average rate of 13.5% and the energy sales rose by
21.5% p.a. The proportion of population electrified increased from 9.5% in
1968 to 26% in 1979. PEA expects the rapid growth rate to continue for some



- 13 -
time due to its large village electrification program (para. 1.46) and the
acceleration in conversion of diesel engines to electric power brought about
by increases in fuel prices and shortages of diesel fuel.
1.46      RTG directed PEA to plan an Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program in 1973 and to give priority to the more backward areas.  The annual
rate of villages connected rose from 940 in 1974 to 2,980 in 1979. In
accordance with the directive, PEA originally planned to electrify all the
villages (about 49,000) in Thailand in about 25 years but now plans to do so
by the late 1980s. In view of the magnitude of PEA's rural electrification
programs now under implementation, this target is believed to be not
unrealistic. It is expected that by 1985 and 1987 respectively, PEA's peak
demand and energy sales will exceed those of MEA, reflecting the progress
made in the provincial areas in general and in rural electrification in
particular.
2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be EGAT, established in 1968 by a merger of
three generation and transmission authorities. It is a well organized and
operated utility under the control of competent management. EGAT and its
predecessors have received a total of US$442 million in ten loans from the
Bank since 1957. Loan proceeds have helped finance the expansion of the
main generation and transmission system in Thailand. Although the proposed
loan will assist in financing the eleventh Bank project in partnership with
EGAT, growth of demand continues at a high level; the rural electrification
program as well as agricultural and industrial development are increasing
the need for generation and transmission facilities; and concentration on
the development and use of indigenous non-oil resources for generation
requires substantial investment which cannot yet be financed from commercial
sources alone. Continued Bank assistance is therefore required.
Organization and Performance
2.02      EGAT is organized and functions as a modern public utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy and is charged with the operation of the
power generation and transmission installations under its jurisdiction and
the establishment of such new facilities as may be required for the Thai
power grid down to transmission voltages of 115 kV and 69 kV. It does not
have responsibility for isolated diesel or mini-hydro generation or for
transmission and distribution below 69 kV.
2.03      The Board of Directors consists of a Chairman and not more than
ten other members, including the General Manager. All Board members
act in a part time capacity, with the exception of the General Manager,
and they are appointed by the Council of Ministers.



- 14 -
2.04      EGAT is a power utility which can compare its operating efficiency
with most of the better run utilities in the developing world. The past
trend of EGAT's performance is indicated in Annex 1. It is a borrower that
in general requires little or no institution building assistance from the
Bank (see Annex 2, the Organization Chart). There are no major internal
problems that would be the subject of special treatment under a subsector
loan.
Planning
2.05      EGAT has a well-staffed planning department responsible for survey,
site investigation, planning of generation and transmission projects; economic
studies; power development programming and system planning; and financial
forecasting. It uses consultants whenever necessary to assist in the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies of large hydroelectric or multipurpose projects.
It reviews and revises if necessary, the load forecast and the power deve-
lopment program at least once a year based on the principle of least cost to
cope with the changing economic conditions and the known primary energy
resources available to the country (see para. 3.03 on load forecast and
paras. 4.01 and 4.03 on investment program).
Engineering, Design and Construction
2.06      EGAT uses consultants for the engineering and design of major
hydroelectric and thermal power projects. Construction of generation
projects is undertaken by contractors under the supervision of EGAT's staff
assisted by consultants. EGAT installs the equipment for power stations and
substations using its own work force under the supervision of the manufac-
turers. Transmission lines are constructed by the suppliers on a supply and
erect basis. EGAT has an excellent record on project implementation and
management. Its dam safety instrumentation and monitoring program is
normally prepared by the consultants, put into operation and inspected and
reviewed periodically by EGAT's staff.
2.07      Since 1974, EGAT has retained the services of an International
Board of Consultants (IBC) for geological investigation and foundation
treatment of a rockfill dam for the Srinagarind Hydroelectric Project, a 360
MW installation on the Quae Yai river and subsequently for most of the major
hydroelectric projects in Thailand. The Board's services have been
satisfactory.
Procurement
2.08      EGAT has been borrowing from the Bank since 1957.  During the past
23 years, EGAT has followed the Bank's procurement guidelines. Processing
of tenders and award of contracts is undertaken equitably and expeditiously.
No problems are expected for the proposed subsector loan.

Management, Manpower and Training
2.09      Management and staff are able, competent and well-qualified.  EGAT
had a total of 17,301 employees at end-FY79. Manpower has grown at an
annual rate of about 8% to meet the needs of the system expansion. The
following table shows the manpower evolution by categories during the last
five years:

2.10      The number of staff reflects the fact that EGAT carries out most
of field investigation, survey and geological exploration using its own staff
and maintains a large construction force for access road construction, site
preparation works and installation of equipment, etc. (para. 2.06).
2.11      Training is handled by the authority's training and development
division which arranges courses and seminars for all levels of staff. About
4,000 trainees attended different programs during FY79. Recent increases in
the number of projects under construction and the increased size of
generating units in thermal power stations, have caused temporary shortages
of some categories of staff but the problems are being resolved by an active
program of recruitment and training.
Accounting and Audit
2.12      Accounting is based on the US Federal Power Commission's system
which is operated and administered by a well-qualified and competent staff
on EGAT's computer.
2.13      The audit is performed by the National Audit Council, the Govern-
ment organization responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The
international accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand, is retained as financial
consultants to cooperate with the Audit Council and issue a separate report
on the annual accounts. Reports have been submitted on time and the
performance of the consultants has been satisfactory. Provision for the
continued employment of independent external auditors has been included in
the loan agreement.

Tariffs
2.14      Under the Pattani Hydroelectric Project, the Government and EGAT
agreed to carry out a tariff study on a marginal cost basis using a team
from the various agencies and utilities that cover the power sector. The
study was substantially completed by mid-1979 with the following findings:
(a)  the marginal costs of power supply are higher than the current
average tariffs; and
(b)  though the long-run marginal cost based tariffs will be the
long-term target of the Government, it would be difficult to
implement such tariffs in the near term. The study recommended
instead a series of tariff increases by steps which would
revitalize sector's earning power to the extent necessary to
comply with the Bank's covenant for financial viability. It also
recommended the following structural changes most of which have
already been carried out in the recently implemented tariff
adjustments:
(i) an increase in maximum demand charges to reasonably reflect
the higher cost of peak load generation;
(ii) the introduction of increasing energy block charges for
residential consumers to encourage energy conservation;
(iii) the elimination of declining block tariffs for industrial
consumers, or at least a reduction in the rate of decline
of energy charges applicable to increasing consumption;
(iv) the application of the fuel adjustment clause to reflect
changes in international cost of fuel oil; and
(v) the initiation of a study to establish the feasibility of
"time of day" metering to promote off-peak consumptions.
This study is being carried out by consultants financed by
ADB under the Mae Moh (No. 4) Power Project.
Energy Conservation
2.15      Energy conservation measures are being carried out by the Govern-
ment through the mechanism of the energy pricing policy, setting of realistic
national targets of economic development, promotion of less energy-intensive
production modes and also the launching of a major public education program.
The Government has recently established a national energy policy committee
under the chairmanship of a deputy prime minister. This Committee is now
planning to formulate more substantial energy conservation measures both
short and long term. During negotiations, it was agreed that EGAT's current
public information program should be expanded and an amount of USU0.3 million
has been provided under the proposed loan to procure equipment necessary for
carrying out such program.



- 17 -
Insurance
2.16      In FY79 EGAT shifted to a self-insurance program and established a
sinking fund with the amount that it would have paid for insurance premiums.
The appraisal mission discussed with EGAT the advisability of an expert review
of the adequacy of this policy. During negotiations an agreement was
reached that EGAT will hire an expert to evaluate its self-insurance policy
and procedures and present for Bank's comments a report with the expert's
recommendations before December 31, 1981.
2.17      The need of a risk analysis by experienced and knowledgeable
insurance consultants for large, complex and high-risk projects to identify
the risks attendant to the project and to assess the most appropriate and
economic insurance coverage and EGAT-s risk management program in general
was discussed during negotiations. Since such a study is being carried out
for a major hydroelectric project in the East Asia and Pacific Region, it
was agreed that EGAT would review the findings of this study with the Bank.
Taxes
2.18      EGAT does not pay income taxes.  Custom duties are paid and
reimbursed by Government in the form of equity contributions.
Environmental Aspects
2.19      Thailand has an Office of National Environmental Board (NEB)
responsible to the Prime Minister-s Office to review the environmental
aspects of power projects including the protection and management of
ecological systems, control of pollutants and wastes and protection of the
public-s health. Any projects to be undertaken by EGAT would have to be
reviewed and cleared by NEB. During negotiations, it was agreed that an
environmental training program will be implemented under the proposed
loan. It would include US$0.4 million to procure necessary equipment for
air monitoring station and laboratory, and US$0.6 million to provide 18 man-
months of environmental consultant services estimated at US$12,500 per man-
month inclusive of travel and other expenses and 100 man-months of on-the-
job training for EGAT staff.
Resettlement
2.20      EGAT has carried out successful resettlement programs in the past
for the Srinagarind and Pattani Hydroelectric Projects. The resettlement
program for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project is being executed. The same
practices will be followed for the future power projects. Normally two com-
mittees (Compensation Committee and Resettlement Committee) will be set up
consisting of members from related Government agencies and the local
governments to ensure that the resettlement will be carried out successfully
in accordance with the Government policy.

Present Facilities
2.21      EGAT had a total of 2,883 MW in service at the end of FY79
made up of:
Type of Plant             MW          %
Hydro                     909.0/a   31.5
Thermal (steam)         1,777.5      61.7
Gas turbine                165.0      5.7
Diesel                      31.6      1.1
Total              2,883.1    100.0
/a  Srinagarind plant (360 MW) was commissioned
in March 1980.
2.22      EGAT-s grid is modern and efficient.  Power is transmitted at
three voltage levels; 230 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV with a total length of 9,580
circuit kilometers at end-1979. One hundred substations were in operation
with an installed capacity of 4,474 MVA. Annexes 3 and 4 give additional
details and the map attached shows the location of generating plants and
transmission lines.
Summary
2.23      In conclusion, EGAT follows the various procedures required of a
borrower by the Bank; it has demonstrated competence in the areas of planning,
operation and project implementation. Its institutional capability is fully
suitable for a subsector loan.
3. THE POWER MARKET
Background
3.01      EGAT-s market covers all of Thailand and comprises the Greater
Metropolitan area of Bangkok served by MEA; the provincial areas served by
PEA; and industries and other large scale or specialized consumers that it
has been directed to supply by Royal Decree, including Electricite du Laos
(EDL)./l EGAT-s sales in FY79 were as follows:
/1 EGAT purchased 658.9 GWh of energy in FY79 from Nam Ngum hydro station
of EDL in Laos and sold 6.7 GWh to EDL for distribution in the Thakhek
and Suvannakhet provinces.

3.62      The power market has had a long history of steady growth, the
av-rage annvial increase in peak and energy demands being 13.6% and 15.4%
respectively over the period FY70-79. Demands grew rapidly in the early 1970s
due to rising investments, favorable world rice markets, and an expanding
economy. As a result of the oil crisis and world economic recession, the low
point was reached in FY74 when peak and energy requirements increased by only
4.8% and 5.6% respectively.  However, system growth has recovered rapidly
since FY75. Peak and energy growth are shown below:

Load Forecast
3.03      EGAT's load forecast is based on the consolidation of forecasts
made by MEA, PEA and the direct consumers after taking into account the
effects of load diversity, system losses and station services. The load
forecasts for MEA and PEA were derived by a study of historial growth trends
of different categories of consumers by the time series analysis method.
The major consumer categories were: (i) residential, (ii) small business;



- 20 -
(iii) medium business; (iv) large business; (v) street lighting; and (vi)
others. PEA's load forecast had already taken into consideration the power
requirements of the accelerated rural electrification program and its impact
on PEA's annual load factor.
3.04      The previous load forecast was made in August 1980 by a Load
Forecast Working Group consisting of representatives from NESDB, NEA and the
three utilities./l This load forecast was recently revised by EGAT as an
interim approach by taking into account the actual load growth in 1980 and
the impact of energy conservation and price elasticity. The revised load
forecast from FY81-90 is shown below:
Fiscal       Energy Generation           Annual           Peak Generation
year     GWh         % Increase    load factor        MW         % Increase
1980   14,753.7 (actual) 5.7/a           69.7       2,417.4(Actual) 7.2/a
1981   16,512.0           11.9           70.0       2,692.8         11.4
1982   18,950.0           14.7           70.0       3,090.3         14.7
1983   21,315.9           12.5           70.0       3,476.2         12.5

1985   26,465.5           11.5           70.0       4,316.0         11.5
1986   29,509.0           11.5           68.0       4,953.8         14.8
1987   32,624.0           10.5           67.1       5,551.8         12.1
1988   35,254.2            8.0           67.3       5,978.5          7.7
1989   38,034.8            7.9           67.5       6,428.6          7.5
1990   40,967.1            7.7           67.7       6,902.9          7.4
Average FY80-90             10.6                                      10.9
/a  Load was suppressed due to constraints in generating capacity and
effects of energy conservation.
3.05      EGAT's peak and energy generation would increase from 2,417 MW and
14,754 GWh in FY80 to 6,903 MW and 40,967 GWh in FY90. The average annual
growth rates would be about 10.9% for peak generation and 10.6% for energy
generation which would level off to about 7.4% and 7.7% by FY90, respectively.
It was agreed by EGAT and the Bank that this revised load forecast will be
used as an interim basis for formulating the power development program and the
consequent financial projections. An in-depth review of the load forecast is
being carried out by consultants in the long-term study for future generation
and transmission projects subject to review by NESDB (para. 4.03).
/1 The Working Group, besides the normal micro-analysis, uses also the
macro approach by correlating the load forecast with the projected
growth of GDP as an independent check.



- 21 -
Supply
3.06      To meet the increasing generation requirements, EGAT-s system has
to be expanded continuously. The system load requirement and the capability
available to meet the demand is given in Annex 5 and shown graphically in
Annex 6.
3.07      The reserve margin in the past was based on the criterion that the
system will maintain supply to consumers with the largest unit out of
service. EGAT had been able to maintain this criterion because annual
scheduled maintenance of large thermal units can be carried out when system
peaking capability is ample and because it has hydro plants with large
reservoirs which can be drawn down in the event of the forced outage of
large thermal units.  It has been decided, however, that with a greater
number of large thermal units being added to the system, a modification of
the reliability criterion will be necessary. EGAT has therefore decided
that reserve requirements would be based on the largest and the second
largest units being out of service simultaneously which will provide a
gross reserve margin of about 25%-35% of the system peak load over the
period FY80-86 (See Annex 5). An analysis by EGAT indicates that
loss-of-load probability (LOLP) /1 in FY82 and FY83 is about three days per
year, improving to about one day in three years for FY85 and thereafter.
This level of reliability is subject to review under the long-term study of
generation and transmission projects (paras. 3.05 and 4.03).
3.08      The system will be short of energy by about 3% of the total energy
generation required from March to June in 1983, if it happens to be a dry
year; the commissioning of the first 550 MW unit at the Bang Pakong thermal
power station scheduled for July 1983 will improve the situation from July
1983 and thereafter. A well-planned maintenance program for the generating
units coupled with special measures to reduce electricity consumption at
critical periods should be able to reduce the adverse impact on the economy
to a minimum.
/1 LOLP is the probability of not being able to meet the load due to
shortage of generating capacity under emergency conditions.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
General
4.01      EGAT's power development program is based on the principle of the
least-cost sequence of development, following an extensive study of the
alternative generation and transmission projects using the computer programs
available in-house. This program as demonstrated in the appraisal report of
Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project, is firm up to FY84 only; beyond that year
further studies and optimization are necessary contingent on the availability
of primary energy resources. EGAT's power development program up to 1990 is
formulated in accordance with the national policy: (a) to minimize the
dependence on imported oil, indigenous natural gas and lignite resources
will be fully developed; (b) hydro development will be accelerated to the
extent that it is economically justified and within EGAT's implementation
capability in planning and construction; (c) imported coal will be used in the
late 1980s for the purpose of diversifying the energy sources. Since natural
gas and lignite are required by the system, they are supplemental to each
another, no comparison between the two would be necessary. The justification
of hydroelectric projects and the comparison of lignite and imported coal are
compared on a program basis as shown in Annex 14. It indicates that both Lang
Suan and Chiew Larn hydroelectric projects are economically justified and that
earlier lignite development is the least cost solution inspite of the high
capital investment and long transmission line involved.
4.02      This program has been independently reviewed by a Bank energy
sector mission in the context of long-term national priorities and found to
be the optimum program, concentrating on renewable hydropower and indigenous
resources of natural gas and lignite.
4.03      EGAT, however, considers that there are areas where consultancy
services might be helpful in the optimization of the program. Under the
Bang Pakong thermal power project (Loan 1690-TH), EGAT agreed to undertake a
long-term system study for future generation and transmission projects
including: an in-depth review of the load forecast; comparison of thermal
alternatives including imported coal, indigenous lignite-fired thermal units
and nuclear power development; a review of reserve margins and reliability
criteria; and formulation of a comprehensive development program for a period
of 20 years. The terms of reference of this study were finalized during
appraisal of this proposed loan (see Annex 7). The study is being carried
out by Chas T. Main International, Inc. of Boston in association with a local
firm, Team Consulting Engineers Co., Ltd. and is expected to be completed
by late 1981.



- 23 -
System Strategy
4.04      The present power system in Thailand is divided into four regions
as shown on the map attached. While Region 1, 2 and 4 are interconnected,
Region 3 operated in the past in isolation. All generation in Region 3
(South) is predominantly thermal (oil-fired, lignite-fired, diesel and gas
turbines), but Pattani hydro (3 x 24 MW), which the Bank helped to finance,
is under construction. A 150 kV transmission line has been completed
recently to link Region 3 to the main grid, financed under an ADB loan;
reinforcement of the interconnection is also planned by constructing a 230
kV line from Ban Pong 2 to Prachuap Khiri Khan. In Regions 1 (Central/west)
and 4 (North), base-load is provided by the thermal plants located around
Bangkok, the major load center, and by the Mae Moh lignite plant in the
North; hydro generation (Bhumibol, Sirikit and Srinagarind from 1980) covers
the intermediate and peak load requirements. Region 2 (Northeast) is mainly
served by local hydro generation and by energy imported from the Nam Ngum
hydro plant in Laos. A 230 kV tie line between Region 2 and 4 is under
construction to improve the reliability of the power supply for Region 2.
Although load dispatching and control is being performed on a nation-wide
basis, regional balances in demand and supply would reduce transmission
losses and a strong link between regions would result in operational
flexibility and economy. An extra high voltage (EHV) transmission line
study is being carried out by consultants for the Mae Moh-Bangkok line.
The FY80-86 Program
4.05      EGAT's FY80-86 power development program comprises the following
components:
(a) ongoing projects under construction with financial arrangements
finalized;
(b) new generation and transmission projects to be completed before
the end of FY86, with financing being sought; and
(c) future generation and transmission projects to be initiated in
this period but completed after FY86.
4.06      The details of EGAT's power development program, FY80-86, including
ongoing projects totalling 2,498 MW, new projects totalling 768 MW, and
future projects totalling 2,471 MW, are summarized in Annex 8.
Justification of a Subsector Approach
4.07      The justification of a subsector approach is based on the
following assessments:
(a) EGAT's investment program FY 80-86 is well formulated and is the
least cost to meet the country's development needs (para. 6.07);



- 24 -
(b)  Over the years, EGAT has demonstrated its competence in
planning, operation and project implementation to carry out its
development program (paras. 2.05 and 2.06);
(c)  EGAT will select individual projects or subprojects for Bank
financing based on agreed investment criteria (para. 4.15); and
(d)  EGAT follows Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures
(para. 2.08).
4.08      The proposed loan would be made only to EGAT to support the
generating and transmission subsector because: (i) EGAT accounts for more
than 83% of the sector investment; (ii) MEA has never borrowed from the Bank
and sees no need to do so; and (iii) PEA has just obtained a loan of US$75.0
million for the Second Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan
1871-TH).
Scope of the Project
4.09      The proposed project consists of three subprojects (para. 4.16),
selected in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank (para. 4.15),
from EGAT's new generation and transmission program to be completed before
the end of FY86, as shown in Table 4.1 and EGAT's energy conservation and
environmental training programs.

4.10      The proposed Bank loan of US$100 million would help finance a
three-year time slice (FY82-84) of EGAT's expenditures and commitments for
expenditures for subprojects (para. 4.16) undertaken by EGAT during this
period, selected in accordance with the agreed investment criteria (para.
4.15) and EGAT's energy conservation and environmental training programs
(paras. 2.15 and 2.19). This arrangement would allow greater flexibility to
EGAT and disbursements would be faster than under a normal project loan.

4.12      The cost estimate is based on end-1980 price levels.  Physical
contingencies were included in accordance with EGAT's experience for diffe-
rent types of projects ranging about 20% for civil works, 5% for equipment
and 10% for transmission facilities. The price contingencies for foreign
costs were calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of escalation:
9% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983-85 and 6.0% for 1986 and there-
after. The price contingencies for local costs were assumed to be 16% for
1981, 12% for 1982-83, 10% for 1984, 9% for 1985 and 8% for 1986 and there-
after.

4.14      It is EGAT's normal practice to use suppliers'/export credits
for the financing of major equipment such as boilers and turbine-generators;
bilateral credits or loans from international institutions such as ADB and
the Bank for the financing of civil works, engineering services and equip-
ment and materials which are not suitable to be financed by suppliers'/
export credits. The balance of the foreign fund requirement will be met by
loans from commercial banks.

Selection of Subprojects
4.15      The following criteria were discussed and agreed during
negotiations:
(a) technical soundness - consultants with qualifications and under
terms acceptable to the Bank have been used in the feasibility
study, engineering and design studies for major hydro and thermal
projects. The Bank would also review the work done by consultants
employed by EGAT;
(b) economic justification - any subprojects to be selected for
Bank financing should be the least cost when compared with other
alternatives with an equalizing discount rate of not less than
12%;
(c) financing arrangements - appropriate financing arrangements for
the subprojects have been made; and
(d) Government's prior approval has been obtained, signifying that the
subprojects form part of the national development program.
4.16      The subprojects proposed by EGAT for Bank financing consist of
the following:
(a) Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project (3 x 80 MW);
(b) Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project (3 x 45 MW); and
(c) Transmission System Expansion Project No. 5.
4.17      The feasibility study and engineering design for the Chiew Larn
and Lang Suan projects were prepared by reputable consultants acceptable
to the Bank and these studies and designs have been reviewed by the Inter-
national Board of Consultants. An independent review by the Bank staff
confirmed that these hydroelectric projects are technically sound and
economically justified and the works carried out by the Consultants were
satisfactory. The resettlement plan for the Chiew Larn Hydroelectric project
has been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.
4.18      Project description, cost estimate and financing plan for the three
proposed subprojects are given in Annex 9. These subprojects meet the agreed
criteria with the exception of the Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project for which
the environmental and ecological investigations are still being updated, the
resettlement program is under preparation and therefore the Government
approval of the project is pending. A provision has been made in the legal
documents
/1 Major hydro projects: 50 MW or above in installed capacity or for
projects where dams are to be constructed. Major thermal projects:
120 MW or above.



- 29 -
(Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement) that any of the subprojects may be replaced
by agreement between EGAT and the Bank (para. 4.24) by any of the other
subprojects included in Table 4.1 as long as the agreed criteria (para. 4.15)
are met. The Government has agreed to provide funds or cause such funds to be
provided to EGAT which would be requim.k d for carrying out the project.
Procurement
4.19      The proposed loan would be used to cover payments of foreign cost
of the following items for the selected subprojects:: (a) civil works; (b)
equipment and materials; and (c) consultant services and training.
4.20      Civil works and equipment and materials to be financed under the
proposed Bank loan will be procured under international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. For contracts for
civil works and equipment and materials expected to cost above US$2.0 mil-
lion, prior review of the tender documents and prior approval of bid award
by the Bank would be required. For equipment and material contracts less
than US$2.0 million, prior review would be at the option of the Borrower.
A preference of 15% (or custom duties, if less) will be granted to local
manufacturers of equipment and materials. In the case of minor items of
equipment and materials expected to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent each
and not exceeding, in the aggregate, the equivalent of US$2.5 million,
contracts may be awarded in accordance with local procurement procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
4.21      Disbursements for equipment and materials would be made against
100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment; 100% of
ex-factory cost for equipment manufactured locally; and 85% of total expendi-
tures for imported equipment procured locally off-the-shelf. Disbursements
on civil works would be 55% of total expenditures. For consultant services
and training, disbursements would be against 100% of the foreign expenditures.
The disbursement schedule is given in Annex 10. The loan closing date will be
June 30, 1985. Disbursements will be made against full documentation in res-
pect of EGAT's expenditures or commitment for expenditures made prior to the
end of EGAT's FY84.
4.22      No withdrawals will be made in respect of payments made for expen-
ditures prior to loan signing, except that withdrawals in an aggregate amount
not exceeding US$1.0 million may be made on payments incurred after April 1,
1981 for environmental monitoring equipment, equipment for public information
programs, consultant services and training. No disbursement will be made in
respect of Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project prior to Governmental approval of
the said project.
Project Implementation
4.23      EGAT will be responsible for implementing all the subprojects
financed under the proposed loan. During negotiations it was agreed that



- 30 -
where dams are to be constructed for hydroelectric projects, the layout and
design of the project will be reviewed by an international board of
consultants acceptable to the Bank. IBC would also inspect the site from
time to time throughout the construction period of the project.
4.24      It was also agreed that:
(a)  EGAT will, not later than August 31, 1981 submit for the Bank's
review and comment an environmental and ecological investigation
report and a resettlement plan for the Lang Suan Hydroelectric
Project; and
(b)  Should the Government not approve the Lang Suan Hydroelectric
Project before June 30, 1982, EGAT will seek the Bank's agreement
to replace the said project by September 30, 1982 with any of the
other subprojects that meets the agreed criteria (para. 4.15).
Risks
4.25      EGAT uses extensively the services of IBC whose advice will be
sought should any unusual technical problems arise in connection with the
construction of hydroelectric projects. To minimize problems during
construction for hydroelectric projects, EGAT has initiated socioeconomic
surveys to develop comprehensive resettlement programs and to establish
acceptability by the communities involved. The Government has acted
promptly to adjust tariffs to reflect increases in production cost,
particularly fuel prices. Remaining risks are judged not to be significant
enough to preclude proceeding with the loan.
Completion Report
4.26      In order to inform the Bank and the Borrower about the performance
of the project, and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion
report is required. EGAT should undertake not later than six months after
completion of the subprojects financed by the Bank or such later date as may
be agreed for this purpose between the Borrower and the Bank, to prepare and
furnish to the Bank a report, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank
shall reasonably request, on the execution of the loan, the performance by
the Borrower and the Bank of their respective obligations under the loan
agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the loan.

5.02      During the period FY76-79 EGAT consistently generated operating
surpluses in spite of large increases in fuel costs and the Government-
imposed constraints on tariff adjustments as a part of the Government's
anti-inflationary measures. Before FY80 EGAT's debt service coverage on an
annual basis was not lower than 1.4 times. EGAT managed to accomplish this
performance through greater efficiency resulting from increases in hydro
generation and larger steam plants.



- 32 -
5.03      From FY78 EGAT started to feel the impact of several external
factors, namely reduced water availability for generation, higher operating
costs due mainly to large fuel price increases and for some time limited
availability of fuel. EGAT's financial results for FY79 reflect this
situation. Government attempts to raise tariffs to the required level met
with strong public opposition and only a modest increase of 38% at the
retail level (50% at the bulk supply level) was implemented in February 1980
(para. 1.31).
Present Financial Position
5.04      EGAT-s operating loss for FY80 was B 541 million and net loss (after
interest charges) at B 1.17 billion. To help solve EGAT's temporary
liquidity problems the Government granted it equity contributions in the
amount of B 1.2 billion ($58 million), short-term loans of B 0.5 billion
($24 million) and arranged a transfer of funds from MEA and PEA to EGAT of B
100 million ($5 million). These funds ensured that EGAT's normal operations
and investment program were not affected.
5.05      A plan of action to restore the sector financial soundness was
agreed with the Government during negotiations of Loan 1852-TH (para. 1.32).
Under it, budgetary oil subsidies were removed in January 1981 and electricity
tariffs were increased on April 1, 1981 to yield a minimum rate of return,
for the sector, of 2% in FY81 (para. 1.34).
Future Financial Position
5.06      Economic expansion and the additional generation and transmission
capacity required to support Thailand's development needs will cause EGAT to
expand its asset base four times from FY80 to FY86. Expenditures to meet
the required construction program for the period FY82-86 are estimated to
total B 114.7 billion (US$5.6 billion) at current prices including interest
during construction. EGAT plans to borrow 70% abroad to cover foreign
costs; 11% will be borrowed locally, 1% would come from Government equity;
and 18% would be self-financed, on the assumption that not less than 8% rate
of return on revalued net fixed assets will be earned by EGAT and the sector
for FY82 and thereafter (para. 5.16).  The financing plan for the period
from FY82 through FY86, based on these assumptions, is shown in Table 5.2.
Financial forecasts for EGAT, MEA, PEA and the sector are shown in Annex 12
and the assumptions incorporated in these forecasts are shown in Annex 13.

5.07      EGAT has no difficulty in raising funds in foreign markets.  It has
a long standing association with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan and more recently with
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED). No difficulties have
arisen in the past in obtaining bilateral financing and suppliers credits.
Since funds were first obtained from commercial banks in 1978 for cofinan-
cing the Pattani project with the Bank, EGAT has made increasing use of
Euro-dollar and other sources and has obtained several commercial bank loans
for its projects. Commercial bank loans are now raised annually to cover
any financing gap.
5.08       In the future, EGAT should charge MEA and PEA adequate tariffs for
bulk power, to ensure an equitable division of sector resources among the
three utilities according to their investment requirements. A provision to
this effect has been incorporated in the legal documents (see para. 5.16).



- 34 -
Tariff Levels
5.09       The bulk power prices that EGAT charges and the average tariff
levels of MEA and PEA have been estimated on the basis that the sector as
a whole earns the covenanted RORs for FY81 and thereafter. Effective
April 1, 1981, EGAT's average tariff increased from B 1.20 (US5.8) to
B 1.45 (US7.1) and the sector's average tariff increased from B 1.50
(US7.3) to B 1.79 (US8.7) per kWh, equivalent to 21% and 19% respectively
to generate the required 2% rate of return./l On this basis, the average
tariff levels that EGAT and the sector would charge per kWh at current
prices and the percentage increases required to achieve them are as follows:

/a  For comparison purposes the average tariffs per kWh (in IJS)
in other countries in the area in 1979 are as follows:
Malaysia 6.9; Indonesia 4.4; Korea 6.2.
Future Operating Results
5.10       EGAT's energy sales are estimated to increase from 13,673 GWh in
FY80 to 32,948 GWh in FY88, an average annual growth rate of 11.6%. Under
the assumptions followed, revenues are forecast to increase from B 10.4 bil-
lion (US$0.51 billion) in FY80 to B 71.4 billion (US$3.48 billion) in
FY88, an average annual growth rate of 27%; operating expenses excluding
depreciation are expected to grow from B 9.4 billion (US$0.46 billion) for
FY80 to B 45.1 billion (US$2.2 billion) in FY88 giving an average annual
growth rate of 21%.
/_ See para. 1.34.



- 35 -
5.11      A downward trend in the operating ratio from 105% in FY80 to 77%
in FY88 indicates the improved financial situation over the forecast period.
This is reflected in an increasing proportion of revenues made available to
help finance construction expenditures; the self-financing ratio increases
from a negative figure in FY80 to 21% in FY88.
5.12      To achieve a more rational use of the sector-s resources the
financial projections assume that some cross funding will take place in the
future among EGAT, PEA and MEA. This would result in higher rates of return
for EGAT (about 9%) than PEA and MEA while the sector as a whole complies
with the present rate of return covenant (para. 5.16).
Debt Control
5.13      The capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt equity ratio is estimated to vary between 44/56
(FY80) and 59/41 (FY86). EGAT-s current debt control test provides
for Bank review of borrowings when the debt equity ratio exceeds'60/40 or
when medium term debt /1 aggregates to 15% of total debt. It was agreed to
continue these tests for the proposed loan.
Liquidity Position
5.14      Under the assumptions followed, during the forecast period (FY81-
88) EGAT-s working capital will increase by B 8.6 billion (US$0.42 billion).
Its current ratio will recover from a minimum of 0.6 in FY80 due to cash
balances being lower than desirable in the early years of the forecast period
and will remain above 1.0 after FY82. Additionally, EGAT has access to
short-term borrowing in an emergency; the position is therefore acceptable.
5.15      Consumer accounts receivables at end FY79 were about 2.4 months
billing which is high for a bulk power supplier. This situation started to
improve in FY80 (2.2 months) and will be further improved because recently
the Government instructed PEA and MEA to pay their bills to EGAT within 30
days. The cash flow benefits to EGAT from this action will be partially
offset because EGAT will have to pay PTT-within the same period.
Financial Covenants
5.16      The following covenants concerning corporate financial performance
and agreed under previous loans have been continued in the proposed loan:
(a) EGAT furnish to the Bank financial statements and accounts audited by
consultants satisfactory to the Bank within six months of the end of each
financial year; (b) the long-term debt to equity ratio should not exceed
60:40 and medium term debt should not exceed 15% of total debt for the
duration of the loan; (c) EGAT and the sector will achieve a rate of return
/1 Debt which on issue matures within 5 years.



- 36 -
on average revalued net fixed assets in operation of not less than 2% for
FY81 and 8% thereafter; and (d) the Government will review periodically and
make frequent adjustments as necessary, the adequacy of EGAT, PEA and MEA
tariffs required to produce: (i) the covenanted rates of return for the
current and next following fiscal years and (ii) accomplish the required
cross funding among the three utilities to enable them to carry out their
investment programs. EGAT will maintain in its tariff schedule a provision
for fuel and power purchase adjustments to compensate for changes in the
price of all fuels and purchased power.
6. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS
General
6.01      The power demand in Thailand is expected to increase at an annual
rate of about 10% for the next decade (para. 3.05). The proposed loan is
intended to help finance EGAT's power development plan from FY80-86 on a
program basis. This chapter will deal with the comparison of alternative
programs to meet the projected demand growth at the least cost and the
internal economic rate of return expected to be achieved for the specific
time slice of the expansion program.
6.02      The discounted cash flow method was used in the least cost
analysis for comparison of alternative programs. The cost-benefit analysis
was made on a program basis, rather than project basis.
Production and Benefits
6.03      Only new projects to be completed during the period FY80-86 were
taken into consideration. The installed capacity, peaking capability and
energy outputs of these new plants are listed in Table 6.1.
6.04      The main objective of EGAT's development policy is to convert the
oil-based generation to other renewable and indigenous energy sources such
as hydro, natural gas and lignite. Based on the program as shown in Annex
6, the composition of energy generation and sources of energy are
demonstrated in Table 6.2. Therefore, oil-based generation would reduce
from about 72% in FY81 to 11% in FY86 and 6% in FY91.

Least Cost Analysis
6.05      As demonstrated in the Appraisal Report of Khao Laem Hydroelectric
Project (Report No. 2568a-TH), EGAT-s power development program is definite
up to FY84 upon the completion of Bang Pakong Thermal Unit No. 2. The known
reserves of natural gas will be fully committed by that time. To find the
least cost program of system development from FY85-93 the following four
sequences, including the transmission systems required to carry the power
to the grid, were compared on a program basis (Table 6.3). Sequence A is
the base program; Sequence B is used to compare Lang Suan and Chiew Larn
hydroelectric projects included under Sequence A with their thermal
alternatives; Sequence C is used to compare Lang Suan and Chiew Larn
hydroelectric projects with a larger thermal unit in the central region and
gas turbines in the South; and Sequence D is used to find the economic
sequence of development of lignite-fired units at Mae Moh with coal-fired
units at Si Racha using imported coal (Annex 14 provides further details).
6.06      The comparison was made on a constant price basis by comparing the
total present value of capital investment, operation, maintenance and fuel
costs. The fuel costs were calculated by merit-order operation of generating
plant on a system basis. Efficiency prices were applied as follows:
(a) taxes and duties were excluded;
(b) foreign exchange costs were shadow priced by a factor of 1.1; and
(c) the conversion factor for skilled and unskilled labor was
assumed to be 1.0.

6.07      The total present value of the four sequences at several discount
rates are shown in Table 6.4. Sequence A is the least-cost program for all
discount rates up to 16%. This demonstrates that the Lang Suan and Chiew
Larn hydroelectric projects are economically justified when the opportunity
cost of capital is below 16%. A sensitivity test analysis between sequence
A and sequence B indicates that even with a 20% increase in the cost of Lang
Suan and Chiew Larn hydroelectric projects and 20% decrease in fuel cost
(assuming that natural gas would become available for the southern area in
the future), Sequence A is still the least-cost solution up to a discount
rate of about 14%. Between sequence A and sequence X, the equalizing
discount rate is 22% which means that early lignite development is more
economical than late lignite development.

Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.08      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) was calcuated by
equalizing the present value of the economic costs and benefits of the
Sector's least-cost development program from FY80 through FY86. The costs
included are capital investment for generation, transmission and distri-
bution projects to market the power to the retail consumers, operation and
maintenance costs, operating costs for distribution and fuel costs.
Efficiency prices were used. Revenues were calculated from incremental sales
and average tariffs at the retail level adjusted to end-1980 level as a
minimum estimate of the power benefits. Savings due to fuel replacement
were also taken into consideration. The IERR thus calculated is about 12%
(further details are provided in Annex 15).

LONG-TERM STUDY OF GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECTS
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Objectives
1.        The objectives of the study are:  to optimize EGAT's power develop-
ment program up to 1990, to formulate a comprehensive plan based on
alternative sources of energy up to year 2000 and to identify long range
energy policy options.
Basic Studies
2.         The following studies are being carried out by EGAT to establish
the technical and economical soundness of individual projects to be inclu-
ded under the development program up to 1990:
(a)  feasibility study for Upper quae Yai hydroelectric project;
(b)  feasbility study for Mae Koh Lignite plant extension;
(c)  feasibility study for EHV transmission line from Mae Moh to
Bangkok; and
(d) site selection for coal-fired plant using imported coal.
Scope of Works
3.         To optimize the program up to 1990, the consultants will carry out:
(a) an in-depth review of the load forecast prepared by the Load Fore-
cast Working Group;
(b) a review of the reserve margin and reliability criteria now adopted
by EGAT;



ANNEX 7
- 50 -                           Page 2
(c)  a review of transmission network by 1990;
(d)  an optimization of EGAT's proposed development program based on
results of studies as mentioned in paragraph 2, particularly the
maximum allowable size of lignite units and relative economy
between lignite units at Mae Moh and coal-fired units along coast
using imported coal; and
(e)  sensitivity analysis to test the optimality of sequence for devia-
tions in capital cost, fuel cost, load growth and reliability
standard.
4.        To formulate the comprehensive program from 1990 to 2000, the
consultants will:
(a)  project load growth up to year 2000 by macro economic analysis;
(b)  review and incorporate the interim findings of the energy master
plan study carried out by ADB (it is necessary that EGAT takes
active role in the task force set up for EMP);
(c)  study and compare the following options:
(i) coal fired thermal units using imported coal (size 500-600
MW);
(ii) nuclear units (size 900-1,000 MW);
(iii) international river development;
(iv) domestic hydro resources; and
(v) any new development in indigenous resources.
(d)  optimize the long-term development program for generation and
transmission.
(e)  recommend long-range energy policy for power generation with
special emphasis on renewable energy and diversification of
sources of supply.

Assumptions in the Financial Forecast of EGAT
Revenues
1.        Revenues for EGAT, PEA and MEA were first calculated at the level
required to yield rates of return of 2% in FY81 and 8% thereafter. This
allowed the calculation of average tariffs at the consumer level for each one
of the utilities. Next, keeping these tariffs unchanged, the excess cash
in MEA and PEA was transferred to EGAT by increasing EGAT's bulk tariff to
MEA and PEA. This should produce a more rational use of the sector finan-
cial resources. The following table highlights the results of this
simulation:
EGAT                       FY81  FY82  FY83   FY84  FY85  FY86  FY87  FY88

2.        Revenues for FY81 were estimated on the basis that EGAT-s tariffs
were raised on April 1, 1981 to yield a 2% rate of return on net revalued
fixed assets in operation. The following are the resulting tariffs for EGAT
and the Sector.

Fuel Costs
3.        Fuel oil and diesel prices adjustments to EGAT have been assumed
to eliminate oil subsidies by April 1, 1981 to a price level of about
US$34.50/bbl crude equivalent for FY81; thereafter costs would be increased
at 3% p.a. in real terms.
4.        Lignite prices have been assumed at cost through FY83 and at
US$15.20/ton escalated at 1% p.a. in real terms after FY83.
5.        Gas prices have been assumed at 75% of the fuel oil equivalent
each year.
Operating Costs
6.        Operating costs have been estimated based on FY80 unit costs and
escalated at 12.5%, 10.25%, 9.75%, 8.75%, 8.25% and 7.0% for FY81, FY82,
FY83,84,85, and FY86-88, respectively. The rates are the latest projections
assuming 50/50 foreign and local expenditures.
Capital Investment
7.        Construction costs are those estimated to provide the additional
plant and equipment required to meet the demand forecast escalated in
accordance with the latest projection of inflation rates.
Equity
8.        Equity to be received is that to be provided to PEA and EGAT
for ongoing and future projects, to cover cash shortages.

Borrowings
9.        Foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates varying
from 2% to 15%, and for terms varying from 30 years including 10 years grace
to 10 years including 3 years grace. Local borrowings have been assumed at
annual interest rates varying from 10% to 15%, and for terms varying from 10
years including 5 years grace to 20 years including 5 years on the
assumption that the long-term debts will be rolled over.

2.        Sequence A was the basic program, Sequence B was used to compare
Lang suan and Chiew Larn hydroelectric projects under Sequence A with their
thermal alternatives (two hydro projects together would contribute about 890
GWh of energy output and 355 MW of dependable peaking capacity), Sequence C
was used to compare Lang Suan and Chiew Larn hydroelectric projects with a
larger thermal unit in the central region and gas turbines in the South, and
Sequence D was used to find the most economical sequence of development of
lignite-fired units at Mae Moh mine mouth with coal-fired units at Si Racha
using imported coal.
3.        Associated transmission facilities were taken into consideration in
the comparison including the 500 kV transmission line required for the Mae Moh
extension. Capital and O&M costs for projects common to all four sequences
were not included with the exception of those which would otherwise affect
the fuel cost calculation.
Methodology of Comparison
4.        The comparison was made on a constant price basis by the discounted
cash flow method. Only actual expenditures on goods and services were
included. Financial charges such as interest, depreciation and amortization
were excluded. The length of period compared was (i) the-first period
covering the years of expansion of the system until the full utilization of
the power capacity of the hydro projects, and (ii) the second period
extended until differences in costs of operating the alternative sequences
become insignificant.
5.        The economic life of power plants and transmission system was
assumed to be:
Hydro plant ............ 50 years
Thermal plant .......... 25 years
Gas turbine ............ 20 years
Transmission line ...... 40 years
Substation .............  25 years
Interim replacements required for equipment having a life shorter than 50
years were taken into consideration.
Capital Costs
6.        All costs were at end-1980 price levels.  Efficiency prices were
used as follows: (i) taxes and duties were excluded; (ii) foreign exchange
costs were adjusted by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.91 (or
multiplying foreign costs by 1/0.91 = 1.1); (iii) the conversion factor for
skilled and unskilled labor was assumed to be 1.0.

Fuel Cost
9.        The fuel consumption of alternative programs was calculated by an
energy balance study on a system basis, taking into consideration the
following factors:

(a)  maximum generation or energy capability of various thermal plants;
(b)  scheduling of energy generation according to merit order operation
so as to minimize fuel costs; and
(c)  characteristics of system load.
10.       Fuel costs used in the analysis for various thermal plants before
shadow pricing were as follows (it was assumed that the prices of oil,
lignite and coal would be increased at the annual rates of 3%, 1% and 1%,
respectively, in real terms from 1980):

12.       Between Sequence A and B, Sequence A is the least cost solution
for discount rates up to 19% which demonstrates that the Lang Suan and Chiew
Larn hydroelectric projects are economically justified on a program basis
when the opportunity cost of capital is below 19%.
13.       Between Sequence A and Sequence D, the equalizing discount rate is
22%, which means that the early lignite development is more economical than
its alternative of late lignite development.  However, this is only a
preliminary result; further refinement is necessary pending upon the
following studies:

Internal Economic Rate of Return
General
1.        The internal economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated by
equalizing the present value of the cost streams and the benefit streams of
EGAT-s least cost development program from FY80 through FY86. The analysis
was made on an incremental basis using 1979 as the base year.
Costs
2.        Same method of calculation as detailed in the least cost analysis
was used.
3.        Capital Costs.  Capital expenditures between FY80 and FY86 on all
projects to be commissioned during this period were included. Annual
expenditures with shadow pricing are shown below:
Generation and transmission    Distribution
Year         --------------- (B million) ----------------
1980                  19,098                      2,534
1981                    9,865                     4,335
1982                    9,878                     4,566
1983                  10,175                      5,286
1984                   6,349                      5,430
1985                   3,441                      4,048
1986                    1,631                     3,844
Total               60,437                     30,043
4.        O&M Costs.  Incremental O&M costs were calculated for new
generation and transmission facilities which would be put into operation
during FY80-86. Basis of estimating O&M costs for generation and
transmission was given in Annex 14. Operating costs for the distribution
systems including MEA and PEA were estimated at B 0.15 per kWh based on FY80
operation analysis, but excluding depreciation.

5.        Fuel Costs.  It was assumed that the system would be operated in
such a way as to minimize the fuel cost. All hydro plants would generate
energy to their full capability and the balance of energy requirements would
be met by thermal plants based on merit-order operation. The fuel costs
used were same as Annex 14 with the exception that the economic cost of
natural gas was used in the analysis (excluding royalty and taxes). The fuel
costs of various power plants completed during the period FY80-86 were
estimated as follows:
Energy
Fuel cost         cost
Plant                                Type of fuel       (B/unit)         (B/kWh)
South Bangkok gas turbine            Distillate        5.6207/liter      2.3253
(4x25 MW)                          Natural gas        51.2/MBtu         0.8200
Bang Pakong combined cycle           Distillate        5.6507/liter      2.2471
(4x60 MW + 120 MW)                 Natural gas        51.2/MBtu         0.4658
Bang Pakong thermal plant            Natural gas       51.2/MBtu         0.4678

75 MW                             Lignite            307.5/ton         0.3321
150 MW                                              307.5/ton          0.3167
Benefits
6.        Incremental Energy Sales.  Benefits were calculated by
multiplying incremental sales in each year over FY79 by an average
price of electricity sold at the retail level. A study of system
energy balance (Table 1) indicated that in the early years from FY80-83
part of the incremental sales should attribute to generation made by
the existing plants in operation before FY80 and in years from FY87
and afterward part of the incremental sales should attribute to
generation made by new plants in operation after FY86. The incremental
sales of these years would be therefore controlled by the generation
made by these plants commissioning from FY80-86 after adjusting for
generation and transmission losses (about 7.4%) and distribution system

losses (about 6.7%). Only in three years, FY84, FY85 and FY86 incremental
sales at the retail level were applied and there was excess generation which
would be used for fuel replacement. The incremental sales and generation
available for fuel saving are shown below for a total operating period of 25
years:

7.        Revenue.  In the absence of an established methodology to quantify
benefits of power supply, revenues from the sales of electricity at the
retail level were used as a substitute measure of the economic benefits.
This is considered to represent the minimum economic benefits because it
shows consumers' willingness to pay but takes no account of consuemrs'
surplus; people may value service by more than the amount they pay to obtain
it. The average tariffs used were based oIn the results of financial
projection required to produce the covenanted 8% rate of return for the sector
as a whole on revalued net fixed assets basis and adjusted to end-1980 price
level.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
8.        The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is the discount rate
which equalizes the present values of the economic costs and benefits. The
IERR of EGAT's development program FY80-86 thus calculated would be 12%.
Detailed calculation is given in Table 2.
