PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Southern Irrigation
Project, for which Loan 1796-TUN, in the sum of US$25.0 million was approved
in February 1980. The loan was closed on June 30, 1987, one year later than
estimated at appraisal.   The  account  was  kept open till December 31, 1987.
Final Loan disbursement is US$18.6 million and the unused balance is can-
celled.
The PCR was prepared in collaboration with the Government Officials
by a FAOICP Cooperative Program mission which visited Tunisia from 7th of
September to 18th of September 1987. No completion report was prepared by the
Borrower but all the required information was provided by project officials.
The PCR is based on a review of the President's Report (-. 2681-TUN) dated
December 26, 1979, the Staff Appraisal Report (2681-TUN) dated December 19,
1979, the Loan Agreement and internal Bank memoranda and reports on project
implementation and issues as contained in relevant files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OLD) but
the project was not audited by OED staff. A copy of the draft report was sent
to the Government of Tunisia for comments on September 15, 1988. Those
comments have been appended (see Attachment 1) and Incorporated into the final
report.

SOUTHERN IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Low 1796-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
1.       Objectives.  The project supports the Government's investment p ..gram
of the Master Plan for Water Resourc-s Development in Southern Tunisia. Its
objectives were to develop groundwater resources in the southern region,
increase production of dates and vegetables and raise living conditions of
smallholders in the existing oases.
2.       Implementation Experience and Pesuilts.  After experiencing lengthy
delays due to the late creation of the Agricultural Development Agencies (OMV)
for two project areas, Djerid/Tozeur and Kebili/Gabes, project implementation
progressed according to the approved schedule of implementation laid down by
different Bank supervision missions. Consequently at the official closing
date almost all civil works were completed. Infrastructure is now operational
while agricultural objectives will soon reach the expected development, and as
a consequence, it may be concluded that project objectives have been met and
an important impact on regional and local development has been achieved.
3.       In general, rehabilitated oases and new plantations are almost fully
in operation: farmers are dynamic, fully participating in the project and
satisfied.
4.       Land protection against sand intrusion has been carried out; water is
adequately distributed up to the tertiary canals and farmers participate in
water management.
5.       Project ccst, in dinar terms, is now D 36.1 million compared with
D 29.6 million estimated at appraisal, implying an overrun in Dinars of about
212. In Dollar terms the cost amounted to only US$47.5 million, 34S below the
appraisal estimate of US$72.5 million.
6.       Increased costs, in Dinar terms, above those projected at appraisal
caused by the combined effect of higher costs of irrigation infrastructure,
building construction, establishment of new perimeters and strengthening of
the technical assistance, were largely offset by the effect of the rise of the
US$ vis-a-vis the Tunisian Dinar. In spite of this, at the closing date,
US$0.9 million of the Bank loan of US$25.0 million remained undisbursed in
addition to US$5.5 million which had already been cancelled since May 23, 1986.
7.       The technical assistance provided for under the project played a
useful role in the works supervision in the fields of irrigation equipment



- v -
maintenance and the agricultural extension program.  Studies undertaken of the
groundwater situation were generally comprehensive, well documented, and
consistent with project requirements.
8.       Implementation of a program to recover the costs of irrigation
services, as required under Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement, has been
delayed. However, in the framework of the Irrigation Management Improvement
Project (Loan 2573 TUN) Government is committed to reach by January 1, 1995
full cost recovery of irrigation operation and maintenance and measures have
already been taken to decentralize and render more flexible the operating
procedures of the Water Users Association (AIC) to permit them to recover
those costs from their members.
9.       The financial and economic reevaluation shows rates of return that
are somewhat higher than those estimated at appraisal. This favourable result
is a reflection of implementation that went broadly as planned together with
higher-than-expected date prices. Financial rates of return ranged between 9Z
and 30% according to the type of investment and farm enterprise, while
economic rates were somewhat higher from 14% to 37%. For the project as a
whole, the re-estimated economic rate of return is 19%. The project also had
significant institutional benefits for the sub-sector in the creation of the
two OMV's.
10.      Sustainability.  The prospect of being able to sustain the
improvements brought about under the project are good. The creation of two
Offices has provided the institutional basis for maintaining the existing
structures and investing in new developments. Financing these Offices to
ensure proper maintenance and operation has been an issue in the past, due to
low contribution from producers to those expenses and to meager budget
allocations from Gov rnment. The situation is , however, improving supported
by the Bank-financed Irrigation Management Improvement Project (Loan 2573-TUN)
and the ASAL-I (Loaa 2754-TUN) which contain a package of measures aiming at
strengthening farmers associations t increasing water charges, improving
management control of the Offices, strengthening their accounting procedures,
all with the objective of making the Offices financially self-sufficient.
Recent progress made in these several fields creates good prospects of
reaching that objective.
11.      On a long run, doubt.s about water availability could exist.  However,
currently there is a good knowledge of aquifers potential and behavior for
which the project has made a contribution, and the Government is committed
(Gabes Irrigation Project - Loan 2605-TUN) to keep a balanced allocation of
water resources among the competitive users (irrigation, industry, human
consumption). In addition, the general acceptance (by authorities and
population) that water resources are limited and should be exploited
adequately and parsimoniously, and the level of the monitoring system which is
being used give extra assurances that the issue of water availability might
only be raised in the context of international implications, i.e., through
excessive withdrawals in Algeria. Even this aspect has been taken care of
with the setting up of a joint international committee (Algeria-Tunisia) on
hydraulics and environment.
12.      Findings and Lessons.  The project has generated some important
lessons which later have been applied in similar projects with visible success



- vi -
and advantage: they are related particularly to the need for complete design
as early as possible in the project preparation and appraisal process, to the
advantage of bulking contracts avoiding repetition of long administrative
procedures, and to the importance of having future beneficiaries involved in
the project preparation. The project has also permitted us to know better the
local market of contractors, leading to a more appropriate selection for
future projects.

SOUTHERN IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Loan 1796-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.1      Tunisia has a total land area of 16.4 million ha of which 8.4 million
ha are suitable for agriculture and grazing. The country can be divided into
three main ecological zones: the Northern zone (25%) is the most fertile
receiving adequate rainfall for a range of crops (400-1,000mm); the central
zone (152) receives between 200 and 400 mm of rainfall and the southern zone
(602) which is a semi-desert zone receiving less than 200 mm of rainfall. Of
the 5.0 million ha of cultivable land, 342 is planted to cereals, 352 to fruit
trees and the remainder to forage crops, vegetables, grain, legumes, and
industrial crops; 20% is normally left fallow. Given the high variability in
rainfall, major efforcs have been made to develop irrigated agriculture.
1.2      The mobilization and efficient use of scarce water resources for
irrigation has been and remains a major Government preoccupation. Since the
early 1960's, substantial shares of public and private investments in
agriculture have been allocated for this purpose: 30% between 1962 and 1971,
232 from 1972 to 1976 and 44% from 1977 to 1981. Government invested heavily
in irrigation infrastructure (9 major dams, 20 smaller dams, more than 800
deep wells and about 250 pumping stations have been constructed), where the
private sector invested mostly in shallow wells (about 23,000) and related
equipment. Currently, some 205,000 ha are equipped for irrigation (1983/85)
against 120,000 ha in 1972.
1.3      Groundwater resources of Southern Tunisia are covered by two major
aquifers: the Complex Terminal (CT) cal,ed Djeffara in the coastal area of
Gabes, and Continental Intercalaire (CI) which is mostly used in the Djerid
and Nefzaoua areas. In 1974, Government requested the French engineering
firm, Sogreah, to prepare a Master Plan for Water Resources Development in
Southern Tunisia, based on the UNESCO/UNDP survey and on the results of the
simulation models which defined for different areas the level of exploitation
of the aquifers within acceptable salinity levels. The result of the plan
defined a water resources development program for southern Tunisia to be
implemented over 20 years. Consequently, the Government decided on a long
term development strategy to be implemented over several four year Plans
(1974-1996). The Southern Irrigation Project represents one phase of the
Master Plan.
1.4      Bank group lending for agriculture in Tunisia commenced in 1967 and
to date 17 projects have been approved at a total of US$407.9 uillion of
Bank/IDA Zunds.  Directly related to the development of the irrigation
sub-sector are the following: (a) First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1068-TUN); (b) Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project (Loan 1431-TUN); (c)
Medjerda/Nebhana Irrigation Project (Loan 2157-TUN); (d) Irrigation Management
Improvement Project (Loan 2573-TUN); (e) Gabes Irrigation Project
(Loan 2605-TUN). All those have been operating satisfactorily.

H. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification and Preparation
2.1      The Project was jointly prepared by the National Center for
Agricultural Studies (CNEA) and the Rural Development Department (GR) of the
MOA assisted by consultants. The consultant services amounted to US$180.000
and were financed under the Bank Project Preparation Facility Funds. The
preparation was supervised by the WB/FAO Cooperative Program (CP) and the
project was appraised in December 1979. After appraisal major issues were
raised relating to: (a) low financial rate of return; (b) cost recovery and
water charges; and (c) water quality. The low financial rate tf return was
mainly attributed to the lorig maturing period of the palm trees and increase
in the cost of civil engineering. On the cost recovery issue, The Bank felt
that the Government should determine and implement a cost recovery strategy to
be applied to various beneficiaries of the project investments. The water
quality issue was related to the recommendation made up by the Southern
Tunisia Water Resource Development Master Plan which established that (a)
water levels in the aquifer will continue to sink and as a result pumping
costs will increase due to increased depth of water; and (b) the degree of
water salinity will progressively increase. In this respect the Government
agreed to study the problem and prepare a mathematical model for the
monitoring of the aquifer. Negotiations were completed in February 1980, and
agreement reached on all the above issues. The loan became effective on
September 30, 1980.
Proiect Obiectives
2.2      The specific objectives of the project were to develop the potential
groundwater resources of Southern Tunisia and improve agricultural practices
and services in order to: (i) increase present prod action of dates,
vegetables, and forage; (ii) provide employment opiF-rtunities for farm labor
in the new date palm plantations and improve the living standards of the
smallholders in t..e existing oases. These objectives were in line with
Government efforts to reduce its deficit in the trade balance for food and to
improve rural incomes in the poorest regions of Tunisia. The development of
groundwater potential were to be accomplished through rehabilitation of
existing oases (upgrading their irrigation and drainage networks and drilling
of new wells for the creating of new irrigation perimeters in areas with good
production potential). Better agricultural practices were also to be
introduced by reinforced extension services, equipment and research. As a
result of the project, some 6,200 farmers' families were expected to increase
income.
Project Description
2.3      The major trust of the project was:  (i) the rehabilitation of 7
existing oases on 3,040 ha in the Djerid, Kebili and Gabes areas; (ii) the
creation of 9 new date palm plantations and date palm/forage plantations on
2,100 ha in Djerid, Nefzaoua and Kebili; (iii) the creation of a date
processing facility; and (iv) the provision of equipment facilities and
personnel for agricultural services, technical assistance and research in



- 3 -
drip irrigation for date palm trees. The extent of the rehabilitation works
consisted of: (a) improving the water supply where required by drilling
additional deep wells; (b) equipping the new and existing wells with pumps
where the artesian flow has diminished or disappeared; (c) changing the
irrigation network from the present irrigation ditches into cement pipes so as
to limit water losses; and (d) improving or creating drainage canals. Four
new plantations were to be created on Government-owned land and five on
collective land. Investments in the new plantations included: (a) tita
creation of 27 new deep wells and related equipment; (b) land leveling; (c)
establishment of wind breaks; (d) building of irrigation and drainage
infrastructure; (e) construction of access roads and tracks; and (f)
agricultural machinery and equipment. In some of the new oases to be created
the forage area would be about 580 ha. The expected alfalfa production on
this acreage was adequate to cover the urgent needs of the existing livestock
in the area and ensure survival of flocks during drought years.
2.4      The project also provided one date processing facility to be built in
the vicinity of Nefta or Tozeur in the Djerid. This facility was to have a
capacity of 10 t/day for dehydration, 45 t/day for disinsectization and
12 t/day for date processing which would be adequate for processing the
additional crop until about year 15 of the project. Two agricultural
development authorities "Office de Mise en Valeur" (OMV) were to be
established by the Government in the project area, one in the Governorate of
Gafsa with an office in Tozeur, and the second in Gabes with offices in Gabes
and Kebili. In addition, the project also provided equipment for the
agricultural research on: (i) drip irrigation for date palms; (ii) sprinkler
irrigation for forage; and (iii) various systems of drainage. As a Technical
Assistance component, the project provided 48 man-months of consultants'
services to assist GR in the preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation
and project supervision and 12 man-months to Water and Soil Resources
Department (DRES) for preparation of a mathematical simulation model for the
Southern area of Tunisia.
2.5      The total Project cost was estimated at US$72.5 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$25.3 million. The Bank loan of US$25.0
million was to finance the foreign exchange component relating to (a)
*          irrigation infrastructures, buildings and vehicles; and (b) technical
assistance and training.
2.6      The Project was expected to be completed over a period of six years
(1980-1985).   All irrigation engineering works were to be completed by the
first quarter of the year 1985.  Full development was expected to take place
by 1990. The completion date was scheduled for December 1985 and the closing
date for June 1986. The closing date was in fact extended by 12 months to
June 1987.

ilL I4PLEMIENTATION
Effectiveness
3.1      The project became effective on September 30, 1980, some 4 months
later than scheduled. The reasons for the delay were administrative and
related to: creation of the Agricultural Development Authorities (OMV's for
the two project areas and furnishing the Bank with the standard legal
opinions. However, it is worth noting that delays in loan effectiveness did
not have a negative impact on the implementation schedule of most of the
components financed under the project.
Revision
3.2      The Loan was amended twice.  On June 13, 1983, to respond to the need
for improvement of implementation performance and to Government decisions
regarding the operation and maintenance of new piilm trees plantations in the
South. As a result, it was decided (1) that the agricultural development of
the new plantations would be the responsibility of farmers assisted by the
OMV's and financed by Government through special credit and subsidy lines
foreseen in the law; (2) the construction of buildings and the setting up and
operation of the research activities would be the responsibility of the OMV's
with the assistance of the GR and of the related research institution if
needed.
3.3      The second amendment took place on January 12, 1984, and it is
related to the changes of the percentages of expenditures to be financed under
categories (1) and (2) of the Loan Agreement. This change has been made to
reflect higher percentages of foreign exchange for the components financed
under those categories than anticipated at appraisal.
3.4      Finally, at Government's request the closing date was extended one
year from June 30, 1986, to June 30, 1987, to allow for payments still pending
in on-going works and supplies particularly related to contract completion.
Implementation Schedule
3.5      Irrigation and drainage.  Despite a prompt call for bidding, the
project experienced lengthy delays in its start up. From the beginning civil
works were spread over an implementation time of 5 years instead of 4 as
anticipated during appraisal. Chart 1 compares the actual with the estimated
schedule of implementation for the major components of the Project under World
Bank financing. Chart 2 shows actual implementation of irrigation
infrastructures for each sub-project area, Annex 1 shows key-indicators of
civil works, while Annex 2 gives details of physical works regarding
irrigation and drainage infrastructures.
3.6      While design of irrigation infrastructures, including tender
documents, and bids progressed satisfactorily, delays in the construction of
the irrigation infrastructure were mainly due to: (i) well-drilling taking
longer than expected; (ii) delays in performing proper pumping tests



(iii) poor organization by the contractors in obtaining materials for
construction; (iv) ill-adapted equipment for the boring of deep wells; and (v)
lack of accessories which did not permit contractors to lay *rrigation pipes
as scheduled. Main features of the constructed irrigation system consisted
of: a buried pipe distribution system parallel to feeder roads of asbestos
cement pipes distributing water to the irrigation sections. The
rehabilitation system included 150 km of pipes which have been replaced with
the old earth canal system. Hydrants have been installed along the buried
pipeline each hydrant serving units of oout 4 hectares through seguias of ?,O0
m of maximum length. The creation of new plantations has entailed 150 km of
buried pipes with same characteristics as above. The new plantations have
been divided in blocks of 20 ha served by a 20 1/sec. water delivery each.
Summary of area under irrigation and length of canals is given below:
SAR       Actual          Actual as
of SAR estimate
Area under irrigation ha       5,174      4,884                94
Length of canals       km        224        300               133
The implementation of drainage work, compared with appraisal planning gives
the following result:
Drainage Work             SAR       Actual          Actual as
---- m3        -    - of SAR estimate
New excavation          572,000    220,000               38
Improvement              92,000    164,700              179
Construction of new drains has been spaced at a distance of about 200 m and at
a depth of 2 m.
3.7      The large difference in new excavation volume is due to the decision
to postpone the construction of the drainage network in some of the new
plantations. Drainage works in the oases to relabilitate have been made and
the reconstructed networks are operational with noticeable impact on soil
aeration and leaching. However, the drainage networks for newly created oases
have been limited to those where there would be no danger of the ditches being
easily filled up with sand because of lack of proper soil stabilization with
crops and protection with windbreaks. This is the case of Rejim Maatoug,
Hazoua, and Draa Nord. The continuation of the relations with the OMVGJ
within the framework of the Irrigation Management Improvement Project gives an
opportunity to follow up on this issue and to assure that these drainage
networks will be made in time. The implemented roads program, compared with
appraisal estimate, indicates that: (i) for oases rehabilitation, only 1 km
of access road has been constructed instead of 31 km; and (ii) for new
plantations only 362 of the program has been completed (see Annex 1). Major
problems observed regarding this low performance are: over estimation by SAR
regarding access roads for oases rehabilitation and low need for the time
being of road infrastructure in new plantations.
3.8      Quality and performance of irrigation and drainage infrastructure
have been done in accordance with good engineering practices and are generally
suitable for local conditions. However, the design of some irrigation schemes
could have included tertiary canals.

3.9      Buildings.  The adequacy of the buildings as foreseen at appraisal
time was analyzed by the supervision missions and compared with actual needs.
OMVPIGJ suggested a reduction of the storage area and increasing workshop
facilities, while OMVPIGM's main proposal was the creation of extension
center. Bids were invited in April 1981 for all buildings and work was
expected to he completed by May 1983. Although commitment for all buildings
was made, they were in some cases poorly executed and some contracts were
terminated because of low quality and delays by the contractors. A
supervision mission which examined the building issues with the Genie Rural
and the Offices concluded that one of the reasons for the delays was the lack
of an adequate supervision of works done by the "Service des Batiments" of the
Ministry of Agriculture. As a result, the practical aspects of the execution
of the works were reviewed and new procedures were agreed upon by the Bank and
Ministry of Agriculture (Loan Agreement 6.13.83). With the transfer to the
Offices of the responsibility for executing this component and the strict
adherence to the programs previously agreed upon by the Bank and the Offices,
these components made good progress, and all the works were completed by end
of 1985 (see Anrex 6). Summary of implemented work compared with appraisal
estimates gives the following result:

3.10     Research.  A detailed applied research program was prepared by both
offices and submitted to the Bank for review and approval. The research
program in cooperation with the INRAT and IRA was mainly directed to he
following terms:
-    irrigation methods, including drip irrigation for dates;
-    cultural practices, including weed control in existing date orchards,
and the use of fertilizers; and,
-    rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure with
M'Dakkar date variety collection in the Tozeur oasis.
The Offices have been assisted with the design of the trials, observations,
measurements and data analysis. In addition, two new sub-stations were
established and budget increased for both Offices. This component was
satisfactorily implemented without major delays.
3.11     Water Resources and Monitoring.  Groundwater resources of Southern
Tunisia are in two major aquifers: the Complex Terminal (CT), called Djeffara
in the coastal area of Gabes, and the deeper Continental Intercalaire (CI).
The Djeffara aquifer is fed from the CI through the geologic fault of
El Hamma. The general groundwater flow is towards the sea where it outcrops a
few kilometers from the coast. Traditionally surface water has been available
for use from naturally occurring springs with substantial flow rates at the
outcrops. With the introduction of deep well drilling techniques, numerous



wells were sunk close to these existing springs in order to increase the
volume of water available for traditional date palm, fruit and vegetable
cultivations; subsequently wells were also sunk outside the traditional
perimeters for the development of modern date palm plantations. A consequence
of this increased exploitation of the water resources has been a decrease in
the flow or drying out of natural springs and a decrease or disappearance of
the artesian flow of the deep wells indicating a need for a more carefully
planned approach to water development.
3.12     The water resources development potential of the project area has
been assessed in studies financed by UNDP, starting with a study of the
Algerian and Tunisian Northern Sahara region by UNESCO in 1968-72, which
included mathematical simulation models of the aquifers and an electrical
analogic model of the coastal Djeffara aquifer. In 1976, a Master Plan for
Water and Soil Resources Development in Southern Tunisia (WMP) was
subsequently prepared and updated simulation models defined the limits of
exploitation of the aquifers within acceptable salinity levels. Water
resource estimates of the WMP have since been systematically updated and
refined as more detailed data became available. This has confirmed that the
findings of the basic studies are robust. Monitoring of groundwater
abstraction, water level fluctuations and quality is systematically carried
out by the regional branches of the Water Department (DRE) of the MOA. Water
abstraction for Djerid a!d Nefzaoua areas has increased from 5.7 m3/sec.
during 1981 to 9.1 m3/sec. for the year 1986. This is less than anticipated
by the mathematical model on the results of which the Water Master Plan (WMP)
was based.  The model indicated that in the year 2010 a maximum abstraction
would be 11 m3/sec.  The decline of water level, estimated in year 2010, may
be between 20 and 45 meters in the Djerid area and between 5 and 13 meters in
the Nefzaoua area. Present monitoring shows that little variation has
occurred as predicted by the model.  For the coastal project area, there was
little variation of the total water discharge as foreseen by the WMP.
Rowever, the water level is reported to have been lower than anticipated,
although a certain stability has been observed during the past 2 to 3 years.
The table below shows year by year water abstraction for Djerid and Nefzaoua
regions:
Region                         Actual                                   Model

3.13     Rehabilitation of Existing Oasis.  Progress of thinning and
rejuvenation continues to be slow, although meetings had been organized by the
Offices to encourage farmers to renew old date palms. Delays of this program
were mainly due to: (1) land tenure: the small size of holdings in the
project area is not so much of a constraint to the agriculture development,
because of the cropping patterns (vegetables and fruit trees). However, the
true issue is that the large percentage of absentees and of share cropping
lead to difficulties in convincing owners (sometimes hard to be reached) and
share croppers (too many in the same farm) about the benefits of the
reconversion programs and make them accept and execute those programs; (2)
poor drainage: improvement of drainage conditions in existing oases with



- 8 -
excessive farm fragmentation and tree density is difficult; therefore, in
those areas where these constraints exist, vegetable intercropping, which is
needed to compensate for initial reduction of increase following removal of
old or low productive palm trees, was also difficult; (3) insufficiently
staffed extension services; (4) reliable and available water: farmers have
waited until th- water supply is improved before embarking in a reconversion
investment; and (5) reluctance to cut trees (traditional value).
3.14     New Plantations.  Progress of this program has proceeded
satisfactorily. The farmers participate intensively in all the operations of
agricultural implementation. The role of the Offices is to provide extension
services, to prepare and follow-up the credit demands, to give techuical
assistance, and to provide and distribute agricultural inputs. Farmers are
selected from a list of applicants, with priority given to young people who
just left the agriculture training school, followed by laborers with extensive
agriculture experience; preference is also given to candidates from the local
population. On the average, about 80X belong to the first category.
Government also provides housing facilities by creating villages itl the
vicinity of these newly created oases. Farmers use their own transportation
means or those made available by Government during the installation period.
The financial support provided by Government is based on a 15% subsidy, 15% of
"pioneer bonus" and 70% of credit of an estimated cost per hectare. This
support is estimated to cover the cost of offshoots, manure, NPK, labor
mechanized services, and protective covers, and is managed by the Offices
which pass it to farmers in accordance with a given schedule. Farmers provide
labor for all agricultural activities. Repayment conditions are 7 years, one
year of grace and 61 interest. Farmers with good records would become full
owners of the 2 ha plot.
3.15     Other Components.  Other project components, such as technical
assistance and purchase of equipment, were implemented satisfactorily and
completed on time.
Reporting
3.16     The execution of the major project components was the object of
quarterly and annual progress reports prepared by the Offices (OMVGO and
OMVGM) and by the Genie Rural. Frequent supervision missions during the
project implementation period were made and full information was reported
detailing progress of the civil works. Although overall progress reporting
can be considered satisfactory, the situation differs as far as financial
reporting is concerned. Audited financial statements for different years were
available but the auditors always qualified their opinion because they were
unable to obtain adequate evidence of all transactions made by the different
Offices.  Recommendations were made to improve the accounting situation,
inclbiding the recruitment of a qualified consultant for both Offices in order
to design and set up a more adequate accounting system for their activities
and project components. The new system was set up at the beginning of 1985
and current situation is satisfactory. Accounts referring to 1986 for both
Offices have been audited and submitted to the Bank.

Procurement
3.17     Pumpsets with related equipment and pipes for irrigation valued at
about D 0.970 million were tendered and awarded under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). This represents about 4% of the total cost of the
irrigation component. Deep wells were executed by a specialized agency of the
MOA. Total cost of the above works made in accordance with local competitive
bidding was D 3.657 million or about 162 of the irrigation component.
3.18     Irrigation and drainage network construction were awarded to Tunisian
firms under several contracts through local competitive bidding procedures.
Total cost of this work was D 10.871 million or about 482 of the total of the
irrigation component. Procurement for vehicles and agricultural equipment
totalling about D 0.728 million were procurred also through competitive
bidding in accordance with local procedures.
3.19     After wide international consultation, the studies for groundwater
resources were awarded to a French consulting firm, while power-line
connections were designed and executed by the Government-owned Tunisian
Electricity Company (STEG) under special negotiated contract.
Cost
3.20     The actual cost of the project was D 36.10 million instead of D 29.62
million as estimated at appraisal, implying an overrun in Dinar terms of 222.
In Dollar terms, however, project cost amounted to only US$47.5 million
compared with US$72.5 million at appraisal, a decrease of 342. Annual
breakdown of costs by different components in terms of current price is given
in Annexes 3 to 7. Comparative statements of estimate and actual costs and

3.21     The establishment of new perimeters and civil works is mainly
responsible for the Dinar cost overrun. The higher cost for the establishment
of new perimeters is due to insufficient basic data available at appraisal.
Detailed plans showed the need for much higher investments in land levelling,
service roads, and wind barriers, tertiary canals, as well as higher unit
costs. The cost overrun of the civil works components is about 202 and is the
result of a combination of price escalation and fluctuation of foreign
currencies. In general, the higher than estimated domestic inflation rates
were mitigated by the lower than estimated increase in international prices
and as a result, overall project costs overrun has been only 22%. The decline
in Dinar, from D 0.408 = US$1 at appraisal to D 0.825 = US$1 in 1986, is the
main reason for the reduced dollar cost of the project.
Disbursements

3.22     The above statements of tctal disbursement by categories indicate
that: (i) civil work expenditure has been higher than estimated at appraisal
and (ii) the cancelled balance is US$6.4 million, total disbursements from the
Bank Loan are, therefore, US$18.6 million.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.23     Major loan covenant dealt with cost recovery (section 4.04 of the
Loan Agreement) and financial accounts of the project (section 4.02 of the
Loan Agreement). These are discussed in paragraphs 5.09-5.19 and 3.15
respectively of the PCR.  In other respects, Government complied with
covenants satisfactorily.
Iv. PROJECT IMPACT
General
4.1      As most of the new plantations and rehabilitated oases are still at
the early stages of agricultural development, at this time it is too soon for
a definitive assessment of the project's impact. Most of the descriptions
given below are based on the experience made from other schemes under
operation in the region and by mission estimate. Nevertheless the PCP mission
is satisfied that if improvements so far brought about can be sustained in
future the project will have achieved a significant economic and institutional
impact.
Irrigation
4.2      The project has had a substantial effect on irritation in southern
Tunisia, both through having achieved the majority of its own objectives in an
area that amounts to about 20% of the irrigable area in the region and through
having given momentum to the Master Plan for Water Resources for the area as a
whole. As envisaged at appraisal, the project has effectively modernized the
majority of seven existing schemes - although in some cases, e.g., Tozeur
oasis, much yet remains to be done - and has established nine new
plantations. In the existing oases, the project has made a valuable
contribution to arresting a decline in production. The major benefits have
come from reducing seepage losses in the canals and improving water
distribution in the irrigation network. Farmers have been constructing
concrete fluves and concrete lining of earth ditches, and there are
indications that these practices would be extended to the entire planted new
areas. In addition, farmers being sure that the water will be available in
quantity and time, do participate more openly in the reconversion program.
4.3      In the regional context, the project was the first element of the
Master Plan to be implemented. It has facilitated the remainder of the
program through (i) having established the necessary overall institutional
capacity; (ii) having improved the system for monitoring the aquifers, and
(iii) having played a pilot role in gaining experience in organizational and
technical matters. The Master Plan comprises three more phases yet. The
second one includes the rehabilitation of about 16,800 ha of old oases and the
creation of about 700 ha of new ones. This corresponds (i) to the Development
Plan of Djerid, financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund (3,300 ha in 23 existing
oases), which is being completed, (ii) to the Development of Nefzaoua, financed



- 13 -
by the Saudi Fund (4,300 ha of renovation and 500 ha of new oases) which is
expected t' be completed in 1990, (iii) to the Development Plan of Gabes,
financed by the Bank under the Loan 2605-TUN (5,000 ha of rehabilitation and
200 ha of new oasis) which is progressing well and should be finished in 1991;
and (iv) to the Development Plan of Gafsa, financed by KFW (3,300 ha of
renovation) which should be completed in 1990. The Third Phase refers to the
development of the Rejim Maatoug region, south of the Chott Djerid where the
project has already created 300 ha of new oases. The total area would be
about 2,000 ha and financing is being sought from the EEC. The Fourth Phase
will be executed in the Medenine and Tataouine areas and will include plans to
rehabilitate 200 ha and to create some 6,000 ha of new oasis. These
developments are expected to start soon. As it was mentioned before
(para. 3.11), all these developments are based on recognized available water
resources, the exploitation of which is being continuously monitored.
Area, yields and production
4.4      The area covered by the project is indicated in the table below.  A
total of 4,749 would be improved (compared to 5,149 ha expected at appraisal).
of which 1809 ha represent newly established plantations (2,109 ha at
appraisal) and 2,940 ha rehabilitated oases (3,040 ha at appraisal). The
lower area of new plantations is largely explained by part of Ipi Chabbat
having been undertaken outside the Bank-financed project. At present, 1,699
ha of new plantations have been completed and 1,116 ha of existing oases have
been rehabilitated.

4.5      New plantations followed the pace of construction and they started in
1981 in Gabes-M6denine, but only in 1984 in Tozeur-Gafsa. For the whole
project, 92% of the trees are 4 years old or less and have not reached
production stage.
4.6      The extent of the impact of the project on existing oases varies
considerably from some oases (e.g., El Hamma) on which the great majority of



- 14 -
envisaged improvements have taken place or are currently being implemented to
others (e.g., Tozeur) on which comparatively little has yet been achieved in
good measure because of lack of receptivity among land-holders. In average,
thinning was very limited, with final densities at about 200 trees/ba (instead
of 150 envisaged at appraisal) while the proportion of Deglet Nour variety
increased from 30% to about 50% (as against 707 foreseen).
4.7      Areas under vegetables and forage crops progressed generally well.
In the new areas, they reach 1/3 of the new plantations. In the coastal
oases, cropping intensity went beyond the appraisal target of 1002 and should
reach 130%. In other oases under rehabilitation, performances are diverse;
areas increased only marginally in Tozeur where virtually no thinning was
made, but more than doubled in Gabes.
4.8      Projected yields (table below) are considered to be in line with
appraisal estimates. It must, however, be emphasized that the all-important
yields of dates resulting fr.,m the project's improvements are still
speculative as optimum yields will not be known until some 12-16 years after
establishment. As an average for full development, however, the appraisal
report's estimate of 10 tons per hectare for Deglet Nour on new plantations is
considered to be rather high; 8 tons for a pure stand c' Deglet Nour being
more realistic. Conversely, on the rehabilitated plantations, the appraisal
report may be too conservative in its estimates. The PCR's estimates of the
pre-project and potential yields of vegetables are similar to those of the
SAR. However, the absence of systematically and sufficiently long evaluation
period of the project's impact unfortunately weakens the factual base for
estimates of yield and production, and the PCR's re-estimates must be regarded
as tentative. The PCR confirms the appraisal report's assumption that
without the project, yields could be expected to decline over time, perhaps by
12 per year.

4.9      The appraisal report's estimates of incremental production at full
development are in line with those projected by the PCR (see table). The
re-estimated incremental production of some 24,000 tons of dates at full
development represents an increase of 36% over national production in 1981,
the first year of the project.

Markets and Prices
4.11     The great majority of project benefits were expected at appraisal to
accrue from incremental production of dates, specifically Deglet Nour variety,
much of it for export. Provision was made for a date processing plant as
existing capacity in the private sector was believed to be limited.
Incremental production of common date varieties would be consumed within the
country, and the local market was expected to absorb increased output of
forage crops and vegetables.
4.12     In the event all but one of these assumptions were justified.  The
production of Deglet Nour dates has increased in the country as a whole (from
31,400 tons in 1980-81 to a provisional 44,000 tons in 1986-87) while exports
have risen from 7,700 tons in 1982 to a peak of 14,400 tons in 1984 and 11,800
tons in 1986-', fluctuation between a quarter and a third of total
production. During this period, export prices have held up well; average
realizations rising in real terms by about 40S between 1982 and 1986, as the
following table indicates:

While the prospects for Deglet Nour on the world market are good, current real
price levels will not necessarily be maintained. For the purposes of the
economic Analysis a price of D 1,500 per ton, fob Tunis, has been used.
Deduction of collection, processing and transport costs and margins and an
allowance for losses, a total of D 440, yields an economic farmgate price of
D1,060 per ton. For the financial analysis, a weighted average of the export
and local market prices was taken, amounting to D943 per ton. In real terms
the recalculated prices for the economic and financial analysis are 19% and
351 respectively above those assumed at appraisal. In view of the fact that
the majority of project benefits result from incremental production of Deglet
Nour dates, this real price increase is a major boost to project viability.
4.13     For common date varieties and for other crops, prevailing prices are
in real terms in line with or above those foreseen at appraisal. These
products are overwhelmingly consumed within the country although a modest
export market has developed for the Alligh date, amounting to 6% of total
production of that variety, and some exports of vegetables are being promoted
(for instance tomatoes from the Gabes area with the assistance of the OMVPI).
4.14     The date processing facility envisaged at appraisal was found to be
unnecessary as private sector eapacity was adequate. All marketing and
processing of dates in Tunisia are carried out by the private sector with
limited regulatory functions being provided by the public service agency,
Groupement Interprofessionnel des Dattes (GID). Although Government tax sets
margins for traders and processing or (b) internal prices to reduce
consumption and promote export for higher quality dates, market conditions are
the main influence on price levels. Government policy has been consistent
over the years in respect of the relationship between the private and public
sectors in date marketing. This has contributed significantly to orderly
development of internal markets and has allowed favorable conditions on world
markets to increase incentives to producers.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.1      The PC mission reassessed the financial and economic viability of the
project using a method similar to that of the SAR. The SAR had defined four
models representing the main farming enterprises in the project area and
estimated the costs and benefits of each with and without the project. These
models were found to have remained in broad terms valid. All variables were
re-estimated for the PCR.
5.2      Model 1 - Ibn Chabbat (100 ha) represents a unit of newly created
date palm plantation. This unit is divided into identical holdings of 1 iha
each. Palms are planted in pure stand with 135 trees per ha of Deglet Nour



- 17 -
vari:ty and 15 trees per ha of other varieties. Work is generally carried out
by laborers until trees start fruiting when the share cropping (Khemes) is
introduced.
5.3      Model 2 - El Hamma of Tozeur (340 ha) is typical of an old inland
oasis (fruit treed, horticulture and forage crops are mixed with date palm
trees). With the benefits resulting from thinning ot date palms and
replacement of common varieties with Deglet Nour, and from improvement of
vegetables and forage production and water use efficiency.
5.4      Model 3 - Kebili (100 ha) is similar to Model 1 but includes more
mtixed cropping with Alfalfa and horticulture crops in between newly planted
date palm trees (Deglet Nour).
5.5      Model 4 - Gabes (1 ha) is representative of a small holding in the
coastal area, where common date varieties are intercropped with fruit trees,
promegranate, olive, alfalfa, vegetable, cropping intensity is high, yield
increase will come from thinning, drainage and use of improved inputs.
5.6      The following table compares the re-estimated financing and economic
rates of return for each model with those foreseen at appraisal:

Total Project                        -     -            13   19
5.7      Re-estimated financial and economic rates of return are in most cases
higher than the SAR's initial estimates and are above the estimated
opportunity cost of capital in Tunisia. The re-estimated internal economic
rate of return for the project as a whole is 19X.
5.8      The economic results are markedly higher than the financial results.
This is mainly due to: (i) the border parity price for Deglet Nour dates in
the economic analysis (D 1,060 per ton) being significantly higher than the
farmgate price actually paid to farmers (currently around D 900 per ton); and
(ii) the adoption (in line with the SAR)-of a shadow wage rate for labor, the
main item of farmers' costs of D 2.00 per day compared with the prevailing
actual rate of D 4.00 used in the financial analysis.  The justification for
this last assumption is the existence of some under-employment in rural
areas.  Labor used in harvesting dates was not, however, shadow-priced as this
is a peak period.



- 18 -
5.9      There are also significant differences between the financial and
economic performance of the different production models. In the case of the
new plantations, capital costs were higher than at appraisal and date yields
were lower, but this was offset by higher than expected date prices. Costs
for rehabilitating existing oases were conversely lower than expected and
yields of Deglet Nour dates higher, but the level of benefits was in some
cases reduced by a slower than expected rate of participation by producers.
These oases also benefitted from the high date prices.  The highest returns of
any project component were recorded on the two rehabilitated coastal oases
primarily because these are used for high value annual crops whose benefits,
unlike those from date palms, are already forthcoming, it should, however, be
noted that the risks of these types of crops are higher than for the date
palms on which the bulk of project benefits at other locations depend
Sensitivity Analysis
5.10     Sensitivity of the financial IRR to decreases in expected yields was
practiced for all 4 models. Results are shown in the following table as well
as the switching values for incremental costs and benefits at OCC 12X:

VI. PERFORMANCE
Project Execution and Management
6.1      The appraisal report provided for the project to be implemented by
four public sector agencies.  The GR was to be responsible for planning design
and implementation of irrigation drainage infrastructure.  The water resource
studies and the mathematical simulations of the aquifers were to be carried
out by the DRES while agricultural development was entrusted  to two Offices
to be created under the project.  The Offices main responsibilities were to be
(i) to maintain the irrigation infrastructure ; (ii) to ensure that
appropriate support services, including extension were provided to farmers;
and (iii) to manage and maintain the new plantations.  The implementing
agencies were to be coordinated by the Department of Planning of the Ministry
of Agriculture.
6.2      Overall, project implementation was satisfactory.  After a slow
start, due principally to difficulties with staff recruitment, the newly
established Offices have become increasingly effective and are now
implementing all projects in the irrigation subsector in southern Tunisia. A
change to the project which was made with the Bank's agreement was the
decision that participating farmers rather than the Offices should be directly
responsible for managing the new plantations with the prices playing a
regulatory and supportive role. This has been successful and has the
advantage of reducing demands on the national budget. The performance of GR
has been satisfactory, although at one time supervision missions were
concerned that headquarters staff were not communicating sufficiently with
field staff. DRES, with assistance from consultants, has effectively
instituted the system for monitoring aquifers. Government has provided an
adequate level of support for the project, assigning staff to strengthen the
agencies involved and providing a higher level of budget resources in Dinar
terms than was originally envisaged.
6.3      Shortcomings in implementation related primarily to: (i) the delays
in setting up an effective accounting system within the Offices which caused
concern to successive supervision missions until improvements were put in
place in 1985; and (ii) delays in submitting requests for reimbursement to the
Bank for eligible expenditures which had already paid made by Government. In
both these cases, adequate remedial actions were taken.
Supplies and Contractors
6.4      Contracts for civil works including acquisition of vehicles and
agricultural equipment required under the project were awarded under local
competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for pump sets and well equipment
were awarded under international competitive bidding.
6.5      Irrigation-related works and building construction were executed by
local contractors. Implementation went very slowly and was characterized by
repeated interruptions of works also due to occasional shortages of
construction materials. In addition, the contractors generally did not assign
to the works technical and management skills capable of adequately supervising
the work. This led to the need for a more close monitoring and supervision of



- 20 -
the works by the GR and Offices staff. Most of the equipment was imported by
local representatives, but certain items (pipes and pipe accessories) were
made in Tunisia. Delays in furnishing large diameter concrete pipes due to
lack of production capacity of the local supplier had caused significant
delays in the completion date of irrigation networks. Contractual penalties
were applied but they were not sufficiently persuasive and pressure from the
concerned ministries had occasionally to be used to ensure contractors'
performance.
Consultants
6.6      The project provided a substantial assistance (48 man-months) of
consultant services to assist (i) GR in the preparation of tender documents
bid evaluations, project supervision and studies, and (ii) the DRES for the
study of a mathematical simulation model for water resources monitoring and
exploitation. On the whole, and in spite of delays in recruiting and
completing some of the studies (cost recovery), the performance of consultants
was satisfactory.
The Bank
6.7      Eleven supervision missions visited the project approximately every
six months. The size of missions ranged from one to three persons. Following
each mission, letters, summarizing the main findings and corrective actions
suggested were sent to the Government. In addition, aide-memoires presented
detailed comments and suggestions to the project implementing agencies.
Although the formal reviews were prepared mainly by engineers, the project
also benefitted from the work of financial analysts and agriculturists.  One
of the main problems encountered by supervision missions was difficulty in the
setting up of the two Offices and in the implementation of the rehabilitation
program with respect to date palm plantations. Because farmers were reluctant
to follow extension services recommendations, the Bank was flexible and agreed
with Government requests to amend Loan Agreement and as a result the prospect
for project implementation was improved.
Cost Recovery
6.8      At appraisal, a major issue was recognized to be the means and extent
by which Government could recover the capital and operating costs of the
irrigation systems. Accordingly the Loan Agreement (section 4.4) provided (i)
for a study of cost recovery to be carried out, (ii) for Government by 1981 to
prepare a plan for water charges to be progressively increased, and (iii)
subject to Bank agreement, for Government to implement it. In the event, the
study was conducted as planned-'.  Although there was some slippage of time,
the main work was done in 1983.
6.9      Some of the main features of the present situation are as follows:
i)   The investment and operating costs of water are naturally much higher
on newly-created plantations (from D 100 to D 150 per m3 in 1985
prices) than on rehabilitated oases (D 030 per m3 upwards), and
within each of these categories, there is great variation between
locations;

for Direction du Genie Rural, Tunis, Rapport de synthese, July 1985.



- 21 -
(ii) Charges levied on farmers to pay for water supplies by the OMVs also
vary from case to case, but in no cases do they cover the investment
cost of water and in many do not cover operating costs;
(iii) The rates of recovery of these charges from farmers range from 901 in
some oases to only 30% in others. Farmers are particularly unwilling
to pay for water where historically they have been supplied free from
springs which have now, however, dried up;
(iv) For the newly-created plantations under the project, water charges
have up to now been recovered through a system of seven-year credit.
This is deemed necessary to support producers until date production
grows sufficiently to provide adequate income. Cost recovery has
thus been a book-keeping exercise with the real test coming in future
years when credit is due to be repaid.
(v) Individual producers vary greatly in their capacity to pay for water,
major influences being location and fragmentation of the Folding as
well as management ability. However, there is little doubt that the
great majority are able to pay more than at present. Moreover, the
incremental production resulting from improvements brought about
under the project is more than enough to cover the additional cost of
the water.
(vi) Ability and willingness to pay are intimately linked with the quality
of the irrigation service received, in particular, the quantity and
reliability of water. Where, as at Tozeur oasis, limited
improvements have been made (in good measure a result of the
complexity of traditional tenure systems) the rate of recovery of
water charges is very low.
(vii) Where perimeters are operated by AICs farmers, contribution fully
pays for operation and maintenance of the systems. However,
Government still helps by subsidizing AIC annual budget.
6.10     The disadvantages of low charges and recovery rates are twofold.
Perhaps most important is that they do not encourage efficient use of water
and waste is systematic. Since water is a limited resource, it should be a
permanent objective to instigate its economy. The second reason to improve
recovery of costs is to reduce the burden on the national budget: only in the
Project area the total cost of supplying water is of the order of D 3.5 to
4.0 million per year. Considering the current level of subsidization, this
gives a measure of the importance of the problem on a national level.
6.11     Government is setting out to solve this issue by (i) raising water
charge to appropriate leveis, (ii) giving AICs the legal base to permit them
to run the irrigation schemes independently and through the financial
contribution of their members, and (iii) encouraging the creation of AIC where
public water supply for irrigation is made. With the Bank support and under
the Irrigation Management Improvement Project (Loan 2573-TUN) water charges
are being raised to attain full operation and maintenance cost recovery before
1985. In addition, Law No. 87.35 of July 6, 1987 has already established the
required juridical base to permit AICs to function independently and operate
public waters. The detailed application decree is due for publication shortly.

VIL SPECIAL ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNED
General
7.1      In spite of the delays and frustrating problems encountered during
its implementation, the project has made a valuable contribution to the
irrigation subsector. It is well on the way to meeting its production
objectives: it has provided an opportunity for the staff of implementing
agencies to gain experience with the organizational and technical issues of
irrigation development; it has strengthened the institutional rramework of the
subsector; and it has given impetus to the Master Plan for Water Resources in
southern Tunisia as a whole. These are significant achievements, but the
project is only a part of a continuing process and much remains to be done.
In the first place, further work is needed to consolidate the advances so far
made: effective extension work is still needed to encourage farmers to
persist with the rehabilitation of existing oases to take advantage of the
improved water supply; and the promotion of AICs as viable organizations needs
to be sustained. In the second place, the efforts being undertaken under the
Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (2754-TUN) to put the subsector on a firmer
financial basis, need to be expanded and consolidated. And in the third
place, it is of prime importance that Government keeps up the good start it
has made in managing the aquifers to avoid over-rapid exploitation of the
resource.
7.2      Part of the reason for the satisfactory record of the project is that
its directly productive components and its institutional components were well
balanced within the overall design. This has enabled the project directly to
make a positive contribution to the national economy while also creating
conditions that have facilitated subsequent investments within the subsector.
Other favorable factors have been the good infrastructure and communications
within the project area and to the capital, the satisfactory performance of
the implementing agencies, and a judicious balance between the private and
public sectors.
Infrastructure
7.3      The project has generated a number of lessons.  These include the
following:
-    to avoid cost overruns, detailed design covering at least the first
year's construction should be completed before appraisal;
-    bulking procurement should be more extensively used to avoid
repetitive administrative delays and obtain lower costs;
-    to avoid construction delays, procurement and budgetary procedures
should be improved, price escalation formulae included in contracts,
when appropriate, and payments to contractors accelerated;
-    most of the contractors did not perform well, and project completion
took on average 40-601 longer than anticipated. To address this, the
local construction industry must be strengthened, qualification
criteria improved, and major contracts should be awarded only to
contractors with adequate financial resources and equipment;
-    participation of beneficiaries in the early stages of implementation
of the irrigation schemes is essential to develop understanding of



- 23 -
the requirements and benefits occurring to the farmers from irrigation
activities. In some schemes although rehabilitation works were completed,
progress of thinning and rejuvenation of palm dates continues to be slow.
The Pilot Role of the Proiect
7.4      The project played an important role in the development of all the
irrigation resources of southern Tunisia and corrective measures have been
introduced when designing new projects to take into consideration the lessons
learnt. It was the first major element of the Master Plan for irrigation in
the area and not only had importance in institutional development (principally
in setting up the two OMVPIs, in introducing GR efficient methods to implement
and monitor large contracts and in promoting the mathematical models
monitoring changes in the aquifers, but it also served as a testing ground for
different technical and organizational issues. These include the principles
underlying renovation of existing oases and the transfer of responsibility for
tertiary water distribution to producers, through the consolidation and
promotion of AICs. Five subsequent irrigation projects now cover the
remainder of the 22,800 ha of potentially irrigable lands in the south in the
two first phases of the Master Plan: Gabes oasis (Tunisian national funds),
1984-86; Djerid plan (Abu Dhabi Fund), 1983-89; Nefzaoua plan (Saudi
Development Fund), 1984-90; Gabes plan (World Bank, Ln. 2605-TUN), 1985-91;
and Gafsa plan (KfW), 1986-90. The design of all these projects strongly
reflects lessons learned under the Southern Irrigation Project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
7.5      Adequate records were kept of the physical implementation of the
project. However, monitoring of the agro-economic impact of the project was
less thorough. Both Offices kept records for some specimen landholdings, but
the coverage was limited and sampling not systematic, accordingly the results
are not adequate as measurements of actual input levels, yields and production
in the project area as a whole. Without such information, management of the
extension services and economic evaluation of the investments are inevitably
weakened. In the framework of strengthening of the Offices to manage
irrigation development and within the measures being taken under the
Irrigation Management Improvement Project (Loan 2573-TUN), the OMVs are being
assisted to improve their information systems and accounts. In addition,
computerized monitoring and evaluation of activity is being practically
introduced in all the OMVs. This activity needs to be expanded and
consolidated.
Sustainability
7.6      The prospects of being able to sustain the improvements brought about
under the project are good, in the medium term at least. From an
institutional perspective, the creation of the two Offices has provided an
implementation capacity for future investments in the subsector as is now
shown by the central role of these two agencies in the Master Plan for
irrigation in southern Tunisia. A major question, however, relates to the
financing of the Offices in future and the extent to which costs can be
recovered from producers. To improve the present level of recovery and to
prevent that the Offices (or the AICs) will remain heavily dependent on public
sector funds to meet their operating costs as well as capital investments,
actions are being taken under the Irrigation Management Improvement Project
(Loan 2573-TUN) and ASAL-I (Loan 2754-TUN) (new water tariff structure,
improved management, better accounting systems, transfer of commercial or
other services to the private sector, etc.).



- 24 -
7.7      The complexity of socio-economic and tenure arrangements within the
existing oases is another possible source of risk that the momentum of the
rehabilitation component of the project may not be maintained. Existing
legislation (Agrarian Reform Law and Law on Abandoned Land) permit the
correction of undesirable situations but authorities have not been too hard in
applying these due to risk of socially-related implications. A long-lease law
that was recently published would give tenants a better chance of recovering
investments made by them in improving somebody else's farm. But the efforts
to be made by the Offices through their extension services and the eX.amples of
profitability shown by renovated farms will play a major role and will have an
important impact on expediting the rehabilitation program.
7.8      In the longer term, the ecological fragility of the project area
cannot be overlooked. The most important question is the rational management
of the aquifers. So far the project has made a positive contribution to this
through promoting the mathematical models of aquifers which underpin the
present management system. For the future, it is essential that Government
continues the monitoring program and effectively polices the rate of
well-drilling to keep exploitation within acceptable limits as it is being
done under the Gabes Irrigation Project (Loan 2605-TUN). Internally, the
situation is balanced and controlled through the execution of a plan based on
confirmed water resources, periodically ,.hecked and updated. At a regional
level, no water shortage is envisaged within a medium-term period (at least
before the economic life of the structures). However, those water resources
are dependent on a balanced exploitation by Algeria. A bilateral
Algeria/Tunisia technical committee for hydraulics and environment has been
created and this can provide the essential forum for exchange of information
on the program and plans for the use of common water resources. It will be
important for this committee to monitor exploitation patterns to ensure that
development remains within the limits that have been tested and accepted for a
sustainable exploitation of the ground water resources.

SOUTHERN IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Loan 1796-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FINACIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.       The  financial  and  economic  analysis of the project was based at
appraisal on four models of enterprises typical of the project area. The PCP
found these models in broad terms still to be valid and accordingly re-
analysed the project on the same basis. All variables were, however. re-
estimated in the light of information now available. Details for each moael
are given in Tables 1 to 4 (attached.)
2.       Model 1 represents 100 ha of newly established plantation pronucing
dates  alone, 90X of these being Deglet Nour and 10% common varieties. Palms
reach maximum production in their 13th year. having started to yield in  the
5th  year  with  20% of the maximum. They also produce offshoots for 5 years
starting in the 4th year. In view  of  the  close  supervision  of  the  new
plantations by the staff of the Offices, it is assumed that producers follow
the recommendations as far as plant spacing and fertilization are concernes
except for manure where the recommended application rates of 30 tons per ha
are not in practice available. Deglet Nour yields are expected to reacn
80 kg per.palm at a spacing of 100 per ha. and common varieties 90 kg. These
estimates compare with 100 kg assumed by the SAR.
3.       Model 3. also a newly-established plantation, is similar to Model 1
except  that  the dates are interplanted with 30 ha of forage crops (alfalfa
18 ha and barley 12 ha) and 20 ha of vegetables.
4.       Model 2 represents the  rehabilitation  of  an  existing  oasis  of
340 ha,  involving  the improvement of water supplies and drainage, tninning
the date palms from 270 per ha to 180 and increasing the proportion of
Deglet Nour variety, and increasing forage and vegetable production. As a
result of the project. Deglet Nour yields are expected to increase from 25
kg to 50 kg per palm (20 kg to 37 kg in the SAR). and common varieties from
40 kg to 60 kg (37 kg to 55 kg).
5.       Model 4 is a 1 ha unit in the coastal oases growing vegetables  ana
to a lesser extent fodder crops. Without the project, yields are expected to
decline by about 1% per annum. With the project, they are expected to
approximately double over 6 years. These assumptions are similar to those of
the SAR.
6.       Where possible -technical parameters have been defined using  actual
data supplied by the implementing agencies. But in several instances.
including actual application levels of inputs, a firm empirical base does
not exist and estimates, which were discussed with project staff, have Deen
used.

7.       For each model, an internal financial rate of return over 20  years
has been calculated (Tables 5 to 8). Costs include actual expenditures under
the project together with estimates for future project operation and
replacements, as well as farmers' direct production costs.
8.       Economic  rates  of  return  were  also  calculated  for each mocel
(Table 9). Internationally tradable items were valued at border prices (this
principally affected Deglet Nour dates and fertilizers). The FOB Tunis ori:e
of Deglet Nour dates was adjusted to the farmgate by deducting costs ano
margins for harvesting and collecting (D 95/ton), processing and packing
(0 152/ton), lOX losses and insoluble rejects (D 150/ton) and transport a'c
handling (D 40/ton), a rounded total of 0 440/ton. Common date varieties.
vegetables and fodder were valued at 1985 farmgate prices. The major item of
farmers costs, family and hired labour, was shadow-priced at D2.00 per day.
half the prevailing wage rate. This adjustment, which is in line with tne
method used at appraisal, is intended to reflect the priority given tO
creating employment in the rural areas in which some underemployment is
believed to exist. Labour used in harvesting dates was not, however, shadow-
prices as this is a season of peak labour demand. The economic value of tne
Tunisian Dinar was taxen to be the pruvailing official exchange rate against
the dollar. All costs were net of taxes and duties.
9.       Based on  the  economic  analysis  of  the  individual  models,  an
economic rate of return for the project as a whole was calculated, with each
model weighted according to the proportion of the total project area it
covers (Table 10). For this analysis, implementation of each model was
phased in line with what has actually occurred under the project. In view of
the substantial delays in implementing parts of the rehabilitation of
existing inland oases in particular at Tozeur (Model 2). the majority of
benefits of this model have been delayed by two years.
