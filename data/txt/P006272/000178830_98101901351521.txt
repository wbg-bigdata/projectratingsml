BRAZILIAN STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM
APPRAISAL OF COSIPA EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed Stage III expansion project of
Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA), one of the three leading Government
owned flat steel producers in Brazil for wqhich the Bank has been asked to
make a loan of US$60 million. The Company is currently implementing Stage II
of its expansion program, a US$670 million project which the Bank is helping
to finance jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The Stage
II loans from the Bank (US$64.5 million) and IDB (US$43 million) are being
used to finance internationally bid equipment.
ii.       The Stage III project will increase the raw steel capacity of
COSIPA's Cubatao plant from 2.3 (Stage II) to 3.5 million tons per year by
1979, will permit an increase in production of flat-rolled products of im-
proved quality and greater dimensions as required by the growing Brazilian
market and will reduce production cost. The plant will be in better balance
after the Stage III investments. To achieve this, a third sinter plant, a
second BOF shop with two 120-ton vessels and two continuous casting machines,
a new tandem cold mill and a new temper mill will be installed and several
alterations and additions to existing rolling and finishing facilities
incorporated.
iii.      The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's
raw steel making capacity from 7.9 to 22.3 million tons per year between
1974 and 1979. The original program formulated by Conselho Nacional de
Industria Siderurgica (CONSIDER) 1/, the National Steel Council, has been
somewhat accelerated and includes simultaneous expansion of the other two
government-owned flat product mills, Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN)
and Usinas Siderurgicas de iinas Gerais (USIMINAS). On June 9, 1975, a loan
of US$95 million was approved by the Bank to help in financing the CSN
expansion. The COSIPA Stage II project is expected to be completed by the
third quarter of 1976, about 6 months behind schedule. The estimated project
cost is currently about 40% above the appraisal estimate, due mainly to
increased costs of construction, currency realignments, ocean freight,
engineering and working capital.
iv.       Estimated total financing required, including working capital and
interest during construction, is US$1,446 million equivalent of which about
US$829 would be in foreign exchange. The project will be financed with loans
from (a) the export credit institutions of potential equipment supplying

Non-Ferrous Metals and Steel), with the same acronym, in August 1974.

countries, namely, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States
(US$254 million), (b) the Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE)
and Agencia Especial de Financiamento Industrial (FIN7AME) (US$703 million);
(c) the IBRD and IDB (US$60 and 40 million respectively); as well as a capital
increase (US$340 million), and COSIPA's internal cash generation (US$50 mil-
lion). The IBRD/IDB loans will be used in a 60:40 proportion to finance
internationally bid equipment items from a joint list.  It is expected that
Brazilian suppliers could win about 55% or US$55 mil:Lion worth of equipment
from this list, with the remaining US$45 million to finance equipment purchases
in other Bank member countries.
v.        Imported equipment not on the banks' list will be financed (85%) by
the above non-Brazilian countries after competitive bidding among their sup-
pliers, taking financing terms into account in evaluating bids. These coun-
tries are expected to provide export credits for 15 years with 4 years of
grace and at an average interest rate of 9% per annum. The BNDE and FINAIE
loans are expected to be made available for 15 years, including 4 years of
grace, at an average nominal interest rate of 6% plus monetary correction to
the outstanding principal.  Finally, the IBRD/IDB loans have been assumed to
be made on the same terms as the Brazilian loans, but at interest rates to
COSIPA of 10% and 8% per annum respectively for the I[BRD and IDB. The Company
would pay the Government a guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per year on the Bank's loan,
which is included in the 10% rate. All foreign exchange loans will be gua-
ranteed by the Government which will also assume the obligation to finance
any possible cost overrun. The Bank's contribution will be about 4% of the
total estimated financing requirements of the project.
vi.       COSIPA was founded as a private company in 1953; however, since 1957,
BNDE, the Federal Government Development Bank has been controlling COSIPA by
owning 87% of the Company's share capital. It is antlicipated that the Govern-
ment shares will shortly be transferred to Siderurgia Brasileira S.A. (SIDERBRAS),
the recently formed holding company for the public steel sector. COSIPA
completed its Stage I expansion early in 1975 thereby increasing annual raw
steel making capacity to about 1.0 million tons. This capacity will increase
to 2.3 million tons after completion of the Stage II expansion (1976). After
the start of integrated production in 1965, COSIPA had substantial losses due
to a heavy debt burden and high operating cost, and as a result difficulties
in meeting its debt service. To improve COSIPA's financial position and
facilitate financing of the Stage II expansion, BNDE, in 1971, capitalized
some of its outstanding loans and increased COSIPA's share capital. Since
that time, COSIPA has maintained a 50:50 debt/equity ratio and has continuously
improved its profitability. The Company has also been successful in improving
the organization of its administration and in establ-ishing over the past few
years a highly motivated management team.
vii.      During implementation of the last two expansion stages, COSIPA has
been accumulating valuable experience in engineering and project management.
Arthur G. McKee & Co. of the US and Nippon Steel Corporation of Japan (NSC)
are providing technical assistance for the ongoing Stage II expansion and
NSC will render similar assistance on engineering, procurement, erection,

start-up and project management for the Stage III expansion. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory and the Company is considered capable of carrying out
the project efficiently. Engineering and preparation of bid documents for
Stage III has commenced and first orders for equipment financed by the Bank
are expected to be placed in early 1976, with most installations completed
in the first half of 1979.
viii.     During the 1950's and 60's consumption of steel in Brazil increased
on average by about 9iD per year. Between 1967 and 1974, consumption of flat
rolled products grew at 23.0% per year and is expected to grow at 12% per
year for the remainder of the decade. To eliminate part of the present
imports of flat products (about 2.6 million tons in 1974), and to satisfy the
growing demand in Brazil, COSIPA's sales are projected to increase annually
by 21%o on average without incorporation of any new items in the product line.
Upon completion of Stage HII, COSIPA is expected to be less dependent on
automotive and tube manufacturers and sell more to shipbuilding and household
appliance manufacturers.  TIhe Company will then satisfy about 25% of the
domiestic flat products demand.  Exports, although feasible due to competitive
production costs, are not projected, unless the Brazilian market will grow
more slowly than now expected.
ix.       COSIPA obtains its iron ore from various sources in the State of
Minas Gerais. The other principal input, coking coal, is imported
with the exception of about 20% which is procured domestically. Other raw
materials are mainly obtained locally and no significant problems are fore-
seen in their supply. Labor productivity is presently below that of plants
in the US and Japan, but the implementation of Stage III is expected to bring
about improvements.
x.        The Company's selling prices on which the financial projections
have been prepared are, on the whole, slightly below European domestic prices
for similar products. Current European export prices (FOB Antwerp) are some-
what lower than the Company's domestic prices and it is expected that, upon
completion of the project, the Company could meet the substantially declined
international prices and still earn an acceptable financial return. In view
of the importance of steel prices, which are controlled by the Brazilian
Government, both to the steel industry and the economy as a whole, the Bank
intends to have periodic consultations with the Government on steel pricing
policy.
xi.       The Company has a satisfactory 50/50 long term debt/equity position
which would increase to 60/40 during the implementation of Stage III. Debt
service coverage and liquidity will continue to be satisfactory. At the
completion of Stage III, COSIPA will have a profit break-even point of 59%
of capacity, a cash break-even point of 61% of capacity and will provide a
suitable financial rate of return of 11% even at the assumed level of
Brazilian steel prices which, as mentioned previously, are low by inter-
national standards.



- iv -
xii.      The project's economic rate of return is a satisfactory 16% and
thus 1% above the rate that had been forecast for the Stage II expansion.
Sensitivity tests indicate that the return will remain adequate even under
adverse conditions. The project will also have a beneficial effect on
Brazil's foreign exchange position, with net savings expected to reach about
US$230 million annually by 1982. The risks in this project are relatively
small and probably only of a temporary nature, such as possible construction
delays due to the sheer size of the simultaneous execution of three large
steel projects, possible overloading of Brazilian equipment manufacturers
and structural steel fabricators, a somewhat lower l:han predicted growth of
flat products consumption and, possibly as a consequence thereof, a minor
deterioration in the present price/cost relationship for finished products.
xiii.     The Bank's new loan would make a significant further contribution
to the expansion of the Brazilian steel industry in the current decade; add
to the conversion of one of the most abundant resources of Brazil - iron ore -
into a competitive product; and despite a proportionately small financial
contribution play a key role in establishing a financing package in which the
great bulk of the equipment would be bid internationally.
xiv.      Based on satisfactory agreements obtained on certain
financial and other covenants as described in Chapter X of this report, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent for a term
of 15 years including 4 years of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the expansion (Stage III) of the capacity
from 2.3 to 3.5 million metric tons per year (TPY) of raw steel 1/ of the
government-owned Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA) steel plant at
Cubatao, in the State of Sao Paulo. The Bank has been requested to make a
loan of US$60 million equivalent, or about 4% of the estimated financing
requirements of about US$1.4 billion for the project, for internationally
bid equipment and construction materials. COSIPA has approximately 17% of
Brazil's current flat steel producing capacity of 3.2 million TPY of raw
steel and is expected to increase its share to about 25% at the completion
of Stage III.
1.02      The proposed project will overlap with Stage II of a continuing
expansion program 2/ designed to increase Brazil's raw steel capacity to 22.3
million tons per year by 1979. This program also includes the expansion
of the other two major government-controlled steel companies - Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais (USIIaNAS).
The Bank, together with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), has played
a major role in developing this program, and is assisting the ongoing simul-
taneous Stage II expansions of the three companies with loans totalling US$192
million. The Bank has also approved a loan of US$95 million to finance the
Stage III expansion of CSN. Annex 1 describes all those features of the Stage
III expansion program which are common to all three plants as well as the
sector's history and the market for steel products in Brazil.
1.03      The project was appraised by joint missions 3/ of the Bank and the
IDB in May/June and September 1974, January 1975 and in various subsequent
discussions with representatives of the Company and Siderurgia Brasileira
S.A. (SIDERBRAS), the recently formed holding company for the government-owned
steel companies.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Ownership
2.01      COSIPA was founded in 1953 as a private company and commenced its
integrated production in November 1965 after five years of construction. As
of December 31, 1974, COSIPA's share capital was Cr$1,752.8 million (US$335.8
million) of which about 87% was held by BNDE; around 12% by the State of Sao
1/   Raw steel is defined as steel in the first solid state after melting and
includes ingots, continuously cast semi-finished products and castings.

Paulo and the remaining 1% by private local and foreign shareholders, all
divided into 64% common and 36% preferred shares. 1/ The State of Sao Paulo
has agreed so far to continue to invest in COSIPA, through 1976, shares in an
amount equal to 50% of its Imposto sobre Circulacao de Mercadorias (ICM) 2/
receipts from the Company and is thus expected to increase its shareholding in
COSIPA to around 20% by 1977. The shares held by BNDE will shortly be trans-
ferred to SIDERBRAS.
B.   Location and Plant Facilities
2.02      The plant is located at Cubatao (Map IBRD 3893R) a town of about
50,000 inhabitants some 20 km from the port of Santos and some 70 km from Sao
Paulo. The site is connected with the principal markets for flat products
(Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte) by railway lines and roads;
a good dock capable of accepting vessels up to 30,000 dwt. is also available.
Iron ore is received by rail from mines in Minas Gerais some 850 km north-east
of the plant; limestone and dolomite are transported by rail and road over
distances of between 200 and 570 km.  COSIPA receives domestic and imported
coking coal by ship at its dock.  The plant is therefore well located with
respect to both major sources of raw materials and markets (Map IBRD 3662R3).
The Company's plant site at Cubatao is relatively flat but restricted. The
only oossibility of increasing the extent of the site is to remove at least
partly an adjacent hill (the so-called Neoro de Tapera.) Therefore, the
Company commissioned and has recently received a technical and financial
study on the removal of this hill.  The evaluation of this study and the
Company's final decision will require some time.  Even if the Company decided
to enlarge the present site, the lay-out for Stage III (IBRD 11258) would not
substantially change, because the additional space would be reserved mostly
for investments subsequent to the project. COSIPA purchased a large tract
of land at Quilombo close to the existing site, where any major further
expansion beyond Stage III could take place.
2.03       COSIPA's steel production is fully integrated; limestone, dolomite
and minor portions of iron ore are provided by one of the Company's two sub-
sidiaries,
2104       COSIPA's plant facilities at the completion of State II are described
in Annex 2 aind consist essentially of a dock, ore and coal yards, raw mat-
erials handling, five coke oven batteries, two sinter plants, two blast fur-
naces, two 85-ton and two 100-ton BOF converters, one 4-high plate mill, one
semi-continuous hot strip mill, two pickle lines, one tandem cold rolling
mill and annealing, temper rolling and finishing facilities, as well as
complem-.ientary installations.  The new plant to be erected under the proposed
project is described in Chapter IV.

C.   Subsidiaries
2.05      The Company has two subsidiaries, i-ineracao Ferro e Manganes, S.A.
(M14) and Cosipa Processamento de Dados Ltda. (CPD).  iFm, which COSIPA ac-
quired in 1964, supplies the Company with all its limestone and dolomite at
competitive prices by well connected railroad and highway and, in cases of
emergency, part of its i-ron ore needs. Almost all (98%) of NFM's share
capital is held by COSIPA and its Board of Directors is composed of top
executives of COSIPA.
2.06      CPD, which is owned by COSIPA (80%) and ITUM (20%), was created in
1972 to undertake computer and data processing work mainly for COSIPA and
to a lesser extent for other organizations in the area. In 1974 bothl subsi-
diaries combined had total assets of Cr$20.8 million (US$2.8 million), a
turnover of Cr$22.4 million and profits before taxes of Cr$2.5 million.
2.07      The Bank renewed assurances (which are already incorporated in the
Stage II loan agreement) that, without the consent of the Bank, no new sub-
sidiaries will be established, and that COSIPA's subsidiaries will not make
investments exceeding the equivalent of US$4.0 million in any one year. More-
over, presently the subsidiaries and COSIPA are not allowed through 1980 to
extend or incur loans, advances or guarantees of more than US$2.0 million
equivalent per year with the possibility of accumulation of up to US$6.0
million in any one year. For the Stage III loan, COSIPA's investments in
subsidiaries and/or other business entities will be limited to US$4 million
per year, loans or advances to subsidiaries and/or other business entities
to US$4 million outstanding through 1981 and guarantees of debt to subsidiaries
and/or other business entities to US$12 million outstanding through 1981.
D.   Organization and Mlanagement
2.08      The Board of Directors, whose main function is to give guidance
to management and formulate long-term policies for the Company, at present
is composed of COSIPA's President, five Directors, two of whom represent
BNDE and the Ministry of Finance respectively. Board members are elected
by the shareholders for a term of four years and were re-elected at the end
of April 1975.
2.09      In order to improve the effectiveness of COSIPA's organization to
prepare it to cope with the expanded volume of production, the Company in
1972 appointed Booz, Allen & Hamilton International, Inc. (BAHINT) to carry
out various studies and recommend necessary organizational changes at all
levels of the administration. These studies have been completed and the
recoimmended modifications in the organizational structure and procedures
have been made at the lower and medium level with good results. The major
organizational change at the higher level is that now the three main func-
tions of "operations", "sales" and "expansion" will be coordinated by the
newly created position of the Executive Vice President who, together with
the functions of "finance" and 'general planning", will report directly to
the President (Annex 3).



-4-
2.10      The recommended change in the top organization - essentially the
creation of an internal Board, as customary in Brazil, consisting of the
President and five Company top executives and an Executive Committee to deal
with day-to-day matters not requiring Board consideration as well as the
creation of the Executive Vice Presidency - has already been accepted by the
present Board.
2.11      SIDERBRAS will inform the Bank when the majority of COSIPA's voting
share capital will have been transferred from BNDE to SIDERBRAS. However,
SIDERBRAS has informed the Bank of the measures it would cause COSIPA to take
at COSIPA's next Board meeting regarding the senior management reorgani-
zation of COSIPA. These measures, which would further strengthen COSIPA's
senior management, are satisfactory.
2.12      The Company is headed by Dr. Mario Lopes Leao, who became President
of COSIPA in 1967, having previously served three power companies in the same
capacity.  He is an experienced executive who provides stability and maturity
to the Company. The persons nominated for the newly created key posts in top
marnagement are dynamic and well trained and have been with the Company for
many years. Their record indicates that they will provide the requisite
leadership and will have the support of the staff. In the past two years
COSIPA has shown commendable improvements in the way7 it has been operated,
and the present management is considered capable of undertaking the proposed
expansion program. Moreover, COSIPA has a comprehenisive technical assistance
agreement with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) of Japan, which will provide
the Company with the necessary back-up and help to establish the precondition
for the successful operation of the plant, the implementation of its large
expansion program and an effective administration. In view of the good
results obtained under the present top management team, the Bank obtained
assurance from COSTPA that the Bank will be informed by the Ccmpanry wheen
making personnel changes at the senior management level.
2.13      In late 1974 the Government modified the law establishing SIDERBRAS 11,
the holding company which has been assigned overall responsibility for the
government-owned steel Compan4ies. Tn addition to planning and coordinating
developmaent of the public steel sector, SIDERBRAS will hold the major share
of existing and an-y newly-formed government steel companies.  the companies
will retain their present independent corporate form, however, -wJith responsi-
b'llity for planning and managing their day-to-day operations, Under agreement
reached for the Stage II loan and to be maintained under the project, COSIPA
cannot be merged or consolidated with other companies without prior consultation
with the Bank.

2.15      The above table shows a considerable improvement of COSIPA's operat-
ing performance during the last five years. Sales of finished products, in-
cluding those from processed imported semi-finished steel, which allowed the
better utilization of some excess rolling and finishing capacity, increased
from about 473,000 tons in 1970 to 726,000 tons in 1974, or by an average
of 11% per annum. Despite such substantial growth in output, domestic pro-
duction of flat-rolled products increasingly lagged behind Brazil's rapidly
rising consumption. To meet the supply gap, the Government authorized the
three flat steel companies to import finished products beginning in 1971.
The sale of steel thus imported was to generate neither profits nor losses



-6-
for the companies. 1/ The import of semi-finished and finished products is
an integral part of the Company's 7nistoric financial statements.
2.16      The 1970 result was still adversely affected by low domestic steel
prices, high financial charges and partly underutilized equipment due to un-
balanced plant facilities. Following a major steel price increase in 1971,
and as a result of continuous improvement in operations and cost control,
COSIPA's profitability increased especially in 1972. This favorable trend
slowed down during 1973 and the first half of 1974, when costs rose faster
than prices and raw steel production declined due to relining of the blast
furnace in 1973 and the effect of the US coal miners' strike in 1974. The
substantial steel price hike in September 1974, which re-established the 1971
price/cost relationship, was too late to improve last year's profitability
substantially.

salient ratios are shown below:

/1   Unaudited.

2.18      To create a sound basis for the Stage II expansion, the Company's
equity was increased after 1970 through (a) capitalization of BNDE's interest
bearing advances for capital increases and part of its loans it has made to
COSIPA and (b) through re-investment by the State of Sao Paulo of half of the
ICM tax it has been receiving from the Company (para 2.01). However, since
outstanding debt also rose from US$95 to 355 million between 1970 and 1974,
I/   The Company is being adequately compensated byt the Government for any
losses which would have resulted due to the high cost of imported steel
thiough various mechanisms, including allowing the purchase by the Company
of special high yield government bonds with sales revenue from the resale
of imported products, direct subsidy, and adjtsted selling prices for
all products. This last method should continue to compensate the Company
fully for any losses sustained or the resale of imported products.



- 7 -
the Company's debt/equity ratio deteriorated and by the end of 1974 had
slightly surpassed the maximum 50/50 ratio expected in the Bank's appraisal
during the construction period of Stage II expansion. Also the current ratio
dipped in 1973 to 1.2:1, i.e. below the 1.3:1 limit stipulated in the Bank's
loan agreement, but recovered in early 1974 and ended with a 1.3:1 value at
the end of the year (1974).
2.19      Primarily as a consequence of the reduced discounting of receiv-
ables the net receivables/sales ratio increased from 0.2 in 1971 to about
0.3 in 1974; these levels are satisfactory. The inventories/sales ratio and
the inventory turnover also developed by and large satisfactorily during the
1970-1974 period.
2.20      In summary therefore, although growth of physical sales has been
largely as foreseen at the time of the Stage II appraisal, the profit margins
and cash generation fell short of expectations, because of the deteriorating
price/cost relation. Debt was not drawn down as rapidly as expected, mainly
due to better than expected payment conditions for equipment, but the actual
debt/equity ratios show only minor deviations from the projected values.
In general, the Company was able to maintain a sound financial position and
could fulfill, with the help of BNDE, the agreed financial conditions.
F.   Progress of Stage II Expansion
2.21      The ongoing expansion (Stage II) to 2.3 million TPY of raw steel
overlapped with the previous expansion (Stage I) to 1.0 million TPY, which is
now completed. The Stage II project is expected to be completed by the third
quarter of 1976, about 6 months behind the appraisal schedule. This delay
was mainly caused by a change in the scope of the existing BOF shop expansion
and the need to procure the mechanical and electrical equipment for the plate
mill in two separate packages rather than in one as originally planned. The
support provided by NSC, COSIPA's technical consultant is very effective and
the Company's management has good control over physical progress and project
costs.
2.22      The Company's most recent (January 1975) re-estimate of the Stage
II project cost puts it at about US$668 million or about 40% above the US$472
million cost budget in the 1972 Bank appraisal. More than half of this over-
run occurred in local construction and erection costs which increased far
more than Brazil's overall inflation rate, the remainder being accounted for
by currency realignments, as well as higher ocean freight and engineering
costs. It would still be a major achievement, if COSIPA were able to stay
within this latest estimate, because of the unprecedented world-wide cost
increases over the past two years. If the same project were to be commenced
today instead of in 1971/1972, it would cost between 60% to 70% more than
the latest re-estimate.
2.23      While procurement is largely complete, only US$33.2 million or about
51% of the Bank's loan was disbursed by April 1975; this is because the main
payments for many large equipment items will become due only later in 1975,



-8-
but it is projected that by year end more than 90% of the loan will have been
disbursed. By the end of November 1974, about 85% of the Bank and IDB loans
were committed for equipment contracts. Of these, about 40% by value had been
awarded to Japanese suppliers, 35% to Brazilian suppliers and the remainder to
suppliers in the US, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium in de-
cending order. Of the total value of equipment contracts thus far awarded,
suppliers from Japan had won about 43%, Brazil 20%, and Germany 18%. Since
the bidding for these contracts took place, the competitive position among
major steel mill equipment supplying countries has narrowed considerably and
awards could thus be nmch more evenly distributed in the Stage III project.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Recent Sales History and Sales Forecasts
3.01       The market for steel in Brazil is described in Annex 1.  This chapter
treats those aspects of the market that relate specifically to COSIPA's opera-
tions. The table below summarizes COSIPA's recent sales history (1970-1974)
and forecasts through 1982, the first full year during which the Company is
expected to operate at full capacity following physical completion of the
Stage III expansion project in 1979 (Annex 5) and ithe relining of Nos. 1
and 2 blast furnaces during the subsequent two years:

-9 -
3.02      Total sales of the Company increased from 473,000 to 723,000 tons
of finished steel during 1970-1974 or by somewhat more than 11% annually.
Despite the completion of several additional production facilities during
1973 and 1974, COSIPA's sales in 1974 were only at the level of the two
preceding years, because of - as mentioned previously - a decline in pig
iron production as a result of the relining of No. 1 blast furnace and diffi-
culties in the supply and low quality of imported coking coal. An analysis of
sales by product groups during the past four years reveals signs of a strong
sellers market. Sales increased most in cold rolled sheet, i.e. the product
processed farthest (from 66,000 to 140,000 tons or by almost 22% per annum)
and least in plate (from 99,000 to 110,000 tons, or by less than 3% per annum).
Sales of hot and cold rolled coil grew about in line with the Company's total
flat products sales.
3.03      As a result of the Stage II expansion of production capacity, COSIPA
plans to increase its present annual sales by almost 1,000,000 tons of finished
products by 1977 and by a further 950,000 tons by 1982, when the production
facilities from Stage III are expected to be in full operation. The reason
for the apparent slower sales build-up after Stage III completion as compared
to that of Stage II is that COSIPA's blast furnaces are scheduled for relining
in 1980 and 1981.
3.04      Between 1974 and 1982 COSIPA's sales of plate are envisaged to
increase by almost 800,000 tons or by an average of 30% per year and annual
sales of hot rolled coil and sheet by around 140,000 tons (or 5%) and 75,000
tons (or 10%) respectively. Sales of cold rolled coil and sheet during the
same period are expected to quadruple to about 600,000 tons per year each,
equivalent to an average growth rate of approximately 20% per annum.
3.05      In the past, only insignificant quantities of COSIPA's sales (less
than 5%) went into exports. Sipce Brazil's demand for flat products has in-
creasingly been exceeding domestic supply and in 1974 no less than 30% of the
domestic demand had to be covered by imports, the Company obviously has had
no incentive to promote its exports. If the demand for flat products grows
at the projected rate of 12% per annum during the next eight years (Annex 1,
para. 36) against about 23% per annum during the four year period 1970-1974
there will also be no surplus for exports. If the demand, however, were to
grow somewhat more slowly and assuming there will be no delays in completing
the expansion of all three flat products plants, there would be a small surplus
for exports.
3.06      In 1974, COSIPA's domestic flat steel sales represented about 17%
of total domestic consumption. Since, as mentioned before, the domestic demand
for these products is projected to grow at about 12% per annum through 1982
and COSIPA's sales by an average of 18%, the Company will increase its share
in the Brazilian flat steel market of 10.5 million tons in 1982 to more than
25%.
3.07      The market prospects look good, and the Company's production facil-
ities will continue to have sufficient flexibility to allow some adjustment
of the sales program to changing market conditions. Any exportable surplus,
should it occur, is likely to be absorbed domestically within two or three



- 10 -
years following the completion of Stage III. Despite this outlook SIDERBRAS
and COSIPA will keep market developments under continuous review in order to
firm up market estimates and assess future requirements and product mix
changes. The Conselho de Nao Ferrosos e de Siderurgia (CONSIDER) and
SIDERBRAS will cooperate closely in the preparation of a new comprehensive
National Steel Plan for the period 1975-83, covering all aspects affecting
the development and operation, including pricing and financial policies, of
the Brazilian steel industry, both in the public and private sector (Annex 1).
Consultants were appointed early in 1975 to prepare by June 30, 1976 a plan
for the development of the Brazilian steel industry; CONSIDER and SIDERBRAS
will exchange views with the Bank as the work proceeds.
B.   Geographic Distribution of Sales
3.08      At present about 90% of COSIPA's domestic sales are made in the
Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro areas, which are the fastest growing centers of
consumption in the country (Annex 5). The Company expects to maintain its
position in these markets and may even improve its share by 1980, as its
sales of plate to shipyards in Rio and rolling stock manufacturers in the
States of Rio and Sao Paulo are expected to greatly increase.
C.   Marketing Organization and Policies
3.09      Due to the general shortage of steel in Brazil during the last
several years, the steel producers have been enjoying a sellers' market.
Despite these favorable conditions, however, and in anticipation of a more
competitive position, COSIPA has begun to strengthen its marketing functions.
The Company's new organization (Annex 3) recognizes the importance of market-
ing by creating the position of General Superintendent of Marketing who will
report directly to the Executive Vice President. Within the Marketing
Department, studies are being conducted on how to diversify sales to different
sectors, fabricate part of COSIPA's production within the Company, systematically
develop transport connections to customers, including coastal shipping of
heavy plates to shipyards and in general improve its future sales programming
and production planning. By 1980, the Marketing Department will have increased
by about 100 persons to 300 employees, including about 40 university graduates.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
4.01      The project (Stage III) is designed to increase the capacity of the
plant from 2.3 to 3.5 million TPY of raw steel to meet domestic market demand
and eliminate maost of Brazil's import requirements of flat products, reduce
production costs and inmprove product quality. The concept of Stage III was
prepared by NSC, COSIPA's technical consultants, during 1974.  Existing iron
and steelmaking, rolling and finishing capacity will be expanded to obtain a
balanced production capacity at the present site.



- 11 -
4.02      More specifically, the following major facilities form part of the
project:  a new pier and additional loading and unloading facilities; addi-
tional raw materials handling equipment; a third sinter plant to increase the
proportion of prepared burden for the existing blast furnaces; a second BOF
shop with two 120-ton vessels and two continuous slab casting machines; re-
motoring of the finishing stands of the hot strip mill; an additional slab
reheat furnace for the 4,100 mm plate mill together with an additional cooling
bed and normalizing furnace; a new pickling line; a new 5-stand tandem cold
reduction mill; a new temper mill; and lines for coil inspection, shearing
and electrolytic cleaning. The associated maintenance and auxiliary facilities
comprise a new roll shop for the cold mill, high and low pressure boilers, one
turbogenerator with substation and a fourth oxygen plant. A possible addition
to the project could be the installation of a second stand of the 4,100 mi
plate mill wqhich is presently under consideration by the Company. A detailed
description of these project facilities is given in Annex 6.
B.   Observations
4.03      As already pointed out in the appraisal of Stage II, the new facil-
ities will complement and make full use of some of the investments being made
as part of the previous expansion, such as No. 2 blast furnace, No. 5 coke
oven battery and the plate mill. Relative to the added production to be
obtained, the Stage III program will, therefore, require the installation of
less equipment.
4.04      During the first scheduled relining of No. 2 blast furnace in 1980,
its iron making capacity could be increased by enlarging the inner volume.
At the same time or subsequently, the capacity of No. 2 BOF shop could also
be expanded by the addition of a third converter, and the additional liquid
steel processed in a third continuous casting machine and new rolling and
finishing facilities. The options for this further expansion step will be
examined in the course of preparing the Natonal Steel Plan for the period
1975-1985, for which consultants have recently been contracted (para 3.07).
C.   Ecology
4.05      Brazilian pollution control regulations are still in the early
stages of development. When specifying the new facilities to be installed
in both the Stage II and Stage III expansions the Company proceeded on the
premise that air and water pollution control should be in line with US prac-
tice or Brazilian regulations, whichever is the more stringent. Dust collec-
tion devices, especially at the sinter plant, blast furnace and BOF shop, a
biological treatment plant for the coke oven effluent and water recirculation
systems will be expanded or newly installed as part of the project. Other
anti-pollution facilities will include acid collection and neutralizing plants
for pickling line effluent and an extra high stack at No. 3 sinter plant
(Annex 7).



- 12 -
4.06      These anti-pollution devices are included in the project cost and
are estimated to account for approximately 3% of total equipment cost as com-
pared to around 5% for Stage II. The reduction is due to the fact that many
environmental devices needed for the project were already installed as part
of Stage II. The Company will install adequate air, water and noise pollution
controls, including suitable measurement devices, acceptable to the Bank and
also monitor emissions to maintain them within acceptable limits.
D.   Labor Force
4.07      Currently, COSIPA has about 7,600 employees.  Since 1966, tlle
Company's first year of integrated production, COSIPA has been able to reduce
its employment by more than 2,200 persons and simultaneously more than double
its output. After completion of the ongoing Stage II expansion, about 2.3
million TPY of raw steel, equivalent to about 1.8 million TPY of finished
products, will be produced with a labor force of approximately 11,000 employees.
Thus under Stage II the labor productivity will increase to about 12 man-hours
per ton of finished steel which is in line with industry productivity levels
in the early 1970's in such countries as Japan (12 man-hours per ton); the
U.S. (12.2); and Germany (15.6). It should however be recognized that these
figures are not fully comparable, since COSIPA on account of its product
mix does not have the same amount of labor-intensive finishing facilities
as are found in many steel mills in other countries or for example in
CSN's plant.
4.08      By 1982, when Stage III will be in full production, COSIPA's labor
force is expected to increase further to about 14,100 persons. With an out-
put of 2.8 million TPY of finished products, the labor productivity should
improve to around 10 man-hours per ton of finished product (Annex 8).
4.09      COSIPA is favorably located with respect to the labor market and
most new employees will come from the Sao Paulo/Santos region. 'io problems
are therefore foreseen in attracting the required personnel which will be
adequately trained inside as well as outside the Company to the extent tech-
nologies are involved with which COSIPA is not yet. familiar. Neither the
Company nor the other steel plants have had strikes in the last six years
and COSIPA's labor turnover has been low and its safety record good.
E.   Project Execution and Implementation Schedule
4.10      In the past three to four years COSIPA developed a competent organi-
zation for the planning and execution of expansion projects. The engineering
and procurement for Stage II was undertaken by the Company's Superintendency
of Expansion, assisted by Arthur G. McRee & Co. and NSC.
4. 11     COSIPA intends to continue with its present expansion orgalization
and to take an increasing share of the responsibility for implementing Stage
ITI. NSC will carry out the engineering of all major production facilities
and give temporary assistance on procurement, supervision of erection and

start-up in addition to the services to be rendered by the equipment sup-
pliers. Experienced Brazilian engineering and contracting firms will be
entrusted with the design of the auxiliary installations, foundations and
buildings to a larger extent than has been the case in the ongoing project.
There is no doubt that COSIPA's experienced team is able to plan, monitor
and control the progress of the Stage III activities, which are now getting
underway.
4.12      As shown in the project schedule for Stage III (Annex 9), engineer-
ing and procurement action has commenced. Orders for the equipment to be
financed by the Bank/IDB and bilateral agencies are expected to be placed
during the first half of 1976. The last installations are scheduled for
completion by the middle of 1979 in time to permit the projected increase
in production and sales of around 13% (as compared to 1978) shown in the
financial projections for that year.  The delivery and construction times
are based on information provided by potential equipment suppliers and are
considered achievable.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Cost
5.01      Detailed capital cost estimates for the Stage III expansion are
contained in Annex 10. These estimates were recently (January 1975) thorough-
ly reviewed and revised by the Company and reflect in particular the latest
reassessment of civil works and construction costs in their ongoing Stage II
expansion.

5.02      Capital cost estimates for equipment are based on general budget
quotations obtained from suppliers during 1974 and were updated by the Company
to the end of 1974.  Spares are estimated at 7% of equipment costs, freiglht
and insurance at 15% of the cost of imported equipment, and local transport
at 2% of the cost of Brazilian equipment.  To provide for physical
contingencies, a 10% allowance has been added to the base cost estimate of
equipment. Further allowances for price escalation have been made at 12%
for 1975, 107% for 1976 and 8% per annum thereafter.
5.03      Capital costs for civil construction and erection, engineering,
procurement, administration and pre-operating expenses were estimated on the
basis of the most recent cost experience for the ongoing expansion. The
poor properties of the sub-soil are known and its soft nature over iuchi of the
site requires extensive piling and foundation work.  Particular construction
difficulties encountered during Stage II have been accounted for as far as
apDlicable in the Stage III estimates but to reflect remlaining uncertainties
a 15% physical contingency has been allowed for construcdion and erection.
Assumed price escalation above the base cost estimate has been as follows:
16% for 1975, 14% [or 1976 and 12% per annum thereafter.  The estimated
direct and indirect foreign exchange requirements are US$620.0 million
including US$61.4 million for interest during construction.
B.   Working Capital
5.04      Working capital requirements for the project are estimated at
US$110.8 million, comprised of US$14.7 million in 1979 (the year of physical
completion) and US$96.1 million for the subsequent three years when (in 1932)
the project facilities are expected to reach rated capacity (Annex 11). The
increase of US$96.1 million has not been included in the project cost estimate,
and will be met by Company cash generation.
C.   Financing Plan
5.05      The total financing requirements of US$1,446 million equivalent
(para 5.01) will be met as follows:

5.06      The financing plan is based on the objective that the Company will
maintain an overall debt/equity ratio of at least 50:50 through the life
of the Bank loan, except for a temporary increase of this ratio to 60:40
until completion 1/ of Stage III expansion or up to December 31, 1981 which-
ever is the earlier. The financing plan, therefore, assumes a share capital
increase of US$340 million equivalent during project implementation (1975-
1979) and an additional increase of an estimated US$160 million in 1980 to
bring back the debt/equity ratio to 50:50 by the end of that year. The
total equity contribution during 1975-1979 including an estimated US$50
million internally generated cash, would represent about 27% of the total
financing required for the project; the remaining 73% will be financed with
long term debt.
5.07      The combined Bank/IDB financing of US$100 million equivalent is to
be shared 60/40 between the two banks as in the Stage II loans.  The Bank
loan would be made to COSIPA for 15 years including a grace period of 4 years
at an interest rate of 10% per annum of which the Company would pay
to the Government a guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per year. The IDB loan, already
made in December of 1974, is also for 15 years with a 4-year grace period,
but carries an interest rate of 8% per annum. Commitment charge will be
3/4% for the Bank and 1-1/4% for the IDB, both payable on the undisbursed
balance of the respective loans. In addition, IDB charges a flat inspection
and supervision fee equal to 1% of the loan amount. The terms of the bilateral
1/   The project will be defined as "complete" following satisfactory
operation of the new Stage III facilities at 90% rated capacity over
three continuous months.



- 17 -
credits 1/ have not been definitely settled, but have been assumed to be for
15 years, including 4 years grace, at an average interest rate of 9% per annum
with a Company contribution of 15% (i.e. the loans would cover 85% of equip-
ment cost). All foreign loans will be guaranteed by the Brazilian Government.
5.08      SIDERBRAS, BNDE and the Company have confirmed the following:
(a) the favorable disposition of the appropriate bilateral lending institu-
tions in supplier countries to extend credits for the purchase of equipment
in amounts sufficient to insure adequate international competition and
(b) the terms of the loans from the two Brazilian lending institutions (BNDE
and FINAME). These will have a 15-year term, including 4 years of grace, at
an interest rate of 6% per annum plus monetary correction. The loan, guarantee
and project fund agreements stipulate that (a) no disbursements on the Bank
loan will be made until the IDB loan agreement has become effective; (b) the
capital contributions and the local loans be made available as and when
required by the project and on terms acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.07); and
(c) that the Government will undertake to provide funds to complete the
project, 2/ on terms acceptable to the Bank, to cover any cost overrun or
shortfall in financing due to whatever cause and in whatever currencies
required.
VI. PROCUREMENT AND ALLOCATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF BANK LOAN
A.  Procurement
6.01      Equipment and spare parts to be financed under the IBRD and IDB
loans in a 60/40 sharing and on the basis of a common list (Annex 12) will
be procured by international coiupetitive tender. For purposes of bid
evaluation, Brazilian manufactured goods, will receive a margin of preference
of up to 15%, depending on the applicable import duty, which is presently
greater than 15% for the type of equipment involved. In accordance with
Brazilian regulations 3/ bids containing components manufactured in Brazil
equal to at least 50% of the total value of the complete equipment are con-
sidered domestic and qualify for preference on the entire bid price, while
domestic components of foreign bids are also given preference in the bid
comparison. The Brazilian definition of domestic bids is more stringent than
the customary Bank threshold of 20% of value added domestically. These
arrangements are in line with those followed under the Stage II loan, which
have worked satisfactorily.
1/   Expected to include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
2/   See footnote 1/ on page 16.
3/   Portaria No. 6 of January 14, 1969 (Ministerial Order, Ministry of
Finance).



- 18 -
6.02      It is expected that up to US$55 million, or 55% of the US$100 million
IBRD/IDB loans, could be used to finance Brazilian goods under the bidding pro-
cedures described above and that the remaining US$45 million will finance
equipment from other Bank member countries, including those from which bilater-
al credits may not be available. Including estimated indirect foreign currency
cost, the Bank would finance about US$40 million equivalent of foreign goods
and services. The other equipment will be bid competitively among the suppliers
of countries providing bilateral credits, including Brazil, with the financing
terms being taken into account in bid evaluation.
6.03      Equipment and construction materials supplied by Brazilian manu-
facturers and not financed by the IBRD/IDB loans will be financed by FINAME
and BNDE. Construction and installation (including civil works), will not
be financed by IBRD/IDB, and will be carried out by local contractors
following competitive bidding, unless the quoted costs and schedules were to
indicate that the Brazilian construction industry is becoming overextended.
COSIPA has agreed that, as for Stage II, if there is evidence of such over-
extension, it would seek international bids for subsequent contracts. The
Government also agreed to continue expediting the registration of purchase
contracts and approval of import licenses.
B.   Allocation of Bank Loan
6.04      As mentioned in para. 6.02 above it is estimated that Brazilian
manufacturers could win up to 55% of the equipment bid competitively under
the Bank and IDB loans (Annex 12). Based on this estimate, the amount of
local currency financing by the Bank would be about US$20 million or about
1/3 of the total proposed Bank loan of US$60 million.
C.   Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.05      The list of equipment to be financed by the Bank loan, the category
allocation and the disbursement schedule are shown in Annex 12. The dis-
bursement schedule is based on detailed estimates of order placement and
expected delivery times for equipment in line with the construction schedule
(Annex 9).
6.06      The Bank loan will be disbursed against 60% of (i) the CIF cost of
imported equipment, including spare parts and installation materials, and
(ii) the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment, spare parts and
construct-ion materials. Any loan funds remaining uncommitted upon completion
of the bidding for equipment on the Bank's list would be used to finance
additional equipment for the project, if found justified; otherwise these
funds would be cancelled.

VII. PRODUCTION COSTS AND SELLING PRICES
A.   Raw Materials
7.01      The availability of domestic iron ore of good quality has been an
important factor in the development of Brazil's integrated steel plants.
COSIPA receives its iron ore from mines in Minas Gerais some 850 km from
the plant, at competitive costs. Partly offsetting this advantage is the
relatively high price of coking coal in Brazil, both from domestic and over-
seas sources. Brazil needs to import about 70-80% of its coking coal
requirements. Although the local coal is slightly cheaper per ton at the
plant, it is of lower quality and has a higher ash content than imported coal.
7.02      Brazil has massive iron ore reserves and hence an assured supply.
The outlook for coking coal supply is less assured, especially since the recent
impact of higher prices and the resulting uncertainty affecting all fossil
fuels. The Company, in close consultation with SIDERBRAS, has been taking
steps to diversify its coal sources. In addition to current contracts for
supply from the US and Poland, negotiations are taking place with suppliers
in other countries, including Canada and Australia. The other principal
raw materials are limestone and dolomite. These are available from COSIPA's
subsidiary, MFM, and no difficulties are foreseen in their supply. Further
details regarding raw materials including quantities and sources are given
in Annex 13 and Map IBRD 3893R. Transportation and shipping used by the
Company are adequate and are to be further improved and extended for the
Stage III requirements. Water, fuel oil and electric power supplies are
available in sufficient quantities and at reasonable cost.
B.   Production Costs
7.03      COSIPA's direct production cost per ton of finished product are
expected to decline in 1974 constant terms after completion of Stage III.
Main reasons are the higher yield in the production of slabs after start-up
of the continuous slab casting machines and in the production of cold rolled
coil, to be rolled on the new 5-stand tandem cold mill. Furthermore, the
unit cost of labor is expected to decline as a consequence of the projected
improvement in labor productivity at completion of the project. These
improvements are, however, partly offset by increases in indirect production
costs, principally depreciation. The direct and indirect production costs
per ton of finished product are shown below for 1974 (actual), for 1977 (at
full product- of Stage II) and for 1982 (at full production of Stage III):

/1   Including raw materials, labor and supplies.
/2   Including depreciation, amortization and general overhead expenses,
exluding tax.
The above table shows that the total average cost per ton of finished product
will decrease by about 5% in 1977 and will then further decrease by another
5% in 1982. As a result of higher depreciation and overhead expenses after
Stage III completion, indirect cost are expected to increase by about 50%
between 1974 and 1982.
C.   Selling Prices
7.04      COSIPA's selling price assumptions are based on the situation in
the Brazilian domestic market during the first quarter of 1975 (Annex 14);
These prices reflect the substantial price increase of September 1974.  On a
product-by-product basis, most Brazilian flat product prices, by the end of
March 1975, were below domestic West European prices and slightly above
international export prices which substantially declined during the last
quarter of 1974 and 1st quarter of 1975, though they have again become some-
what firmer six'e (pages 28 and 30 of Annex 1). It should be noted that
COSIPA's prices for all individual product groups are somewhat higher than
comparable CSN prices for the following two reasons: (i) COSIPA's average
quality and size of plate and cold rolled products justify prices slightly
higher than those of CSN and (ii) COSIPA's plant is closer to Sao Paulo than
CSN's plant; since domestic steel prices for comparable products must be
equal CIF Sao Paulo, COSIPA is able to charge higher FOB-plant prices than
CSN. Prices are normally established twice a year after review and approval
by the Interministerial Price Council (CIP), based on increases in costs
outside COSIPA's control, i.e. raw materials, labor, contractual and capital
costs.
7.05      Agreements similar to those for the Stage II loan were obtained
whereby the Government will maintain steel prices at levels which would remain
reasonably competitive with imports and at the same time permit the companies



- 21 -
to (a) earn an adequate return on capital under efficient operating conditions,
(b) meet their financial obligations, (c) contribute to the financing of further
expansions, and (d) share savings in production costs with consumers through
price reductions. This also means that the price/cost relationship of
September 1974 will be substantially maintained during the execution of the
project. To this end the Government and the Bank will consult as necessary
to determine whether steel prices are appropriate. The recent price increases
have resulted in a much improved level of profitability which satisfies the
above criteria. The financial projections for the Company, discussed in the
following Chapter, assume that the growth in revenue in current terms will be
somewhat slower than the growth in production costs.

8.02       Between 1975 and 1977 when Stage II is in full operation, net sales
are projected to increase from US$295 million to US$809 million in current
US-dollars, or by about 275%. During the same period, net profits will
increase from US$34 million to about US$97 million, although due to the
cotrunencement of the charging to income of financial cost and full depreciation
for Stage II, profit as a percent of sales will remain at about 12%.  A similar
development can be observed under Stage III, when in 1980 net profits of
US$58 million are much less than the 1979 net profits of US$177 million. Net
profit, sales profitability and profit over average equity, however, rapidly
recover during subsequent years as available capacity is more fully utilized.
By 1982, the first year of full Stage III production, net profits are
expected to reach US$194 million, sales profitability to improve to 13%.
Net profits as a percentage of average equity, in 1982, would be about 12%.
B.   Break-Even Point
8.03       After completion of Stage III, the profit break-even point is about
59% of production capacity or 1.57 million tons of finished steel. Altern-
atively, prices at full capacity could fall by 18% before the Company would
show a loss. At 1982 debt service requirements, the cash break-even point
would be 61% of production capacity, since debt repayment of US$144 million
is higher than the US$135 million annual depreciation. In the same year,
assuming full production, prices could fall about 17%' before the Company's
cash generation would be zero. Further details on break-even are found in
Annex 15
C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.04       The project provides a suitable incremental rate of return (after
taxes) of 10.7%. in constant terms. The assumptions used for the rate of
return calculations, as well as details of the sensitivity tests thereon,
are contained in Annex 16.
8.05       To determine the effect of various events on the financial rate
of return, sensitivity tests have been run which show the following:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return

Case                          cost         cost         Revenue       Return

5.                                 105           105            95            8.5
6. One year project delay                                                     9.2
7. One year project delay and
15% cost overrun                                                         7.7



- 23 -
The above sensitivity tests indicate that under rather adverse circumstances
the project would require some increase in steel prices to provide an adequate
financial rate of return.  This would be possible as the assumed prices are
still low by international comparison (Annex 1).
D.   Financial Position
8.06      Forecast balance sheets for 1975-1983 are contained in Annex 4.
Significant data from these are shown below:

/1   Including surplus cash.
8.07      The projected long-term debt/equity ratio remains favorable during
the implementation of the project with a maximum debt position of 60% being
reached in 1977 and 1978. Thereafter the debt/equity ratio declines and
by 1983 COSIPA would have only 32% in debt. This conservative capitalization
after the proposed expansion will place the Company in a good position to
finance further expansion. Except with the prior consent of the Bank, new
capital investments, other than those for the project itself, will not exceed
US$12 million equivalent in any year during the execution of the project.
This amount will exclude "major repairs" and new investments in subsidiaries
and other enterprises (para. 2.07), but include improvements and modifications
to equipment not provided for in the project.
8.08      The current ratio increases after completion of Stage III because
surplus funds generated have been included in current assets during that
period. It can be assumed that these funds will be used for further expansion



- 24 -
(para. 8.14 below) and that the current ratio would then drop to a more normal
level. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the current ratio is not
to drop below 1.1:1 as calculated from the Company's audited financial
statement. The minimum level under the Stage II loan agreement was 1.3.
While the slightly lower level was agreed to, the Government has at the same
time undertaken to make appropriate financing available to the Company
promptly if otherwise the current ratio were to fall below the 1.1:1 level
at any time.
8.09      The Company's financial position is expected to allow payment of
reasonable dividends after project completion. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, cash dividends (except on existing preferred shares) will not be
permitted if, after payment of such dividends, the current ratio were to
fall below 1.3:1. Also, the Company will not issue new preferred shares
if by doing so the total preferred share capital would exceed a value
corresponding to 50% of its total share capital.
E.   Debt Service Coverage
8.10      COSIPA is not expected to have any difficulty servicing its debt.
Long-term debt service coverage forecasts indicate the following:
Long-term Debt Service Coverae
1975    1976    1977    1978    1979    1980   1981   1982   1983
/1
Times Covered  1.6      4.8      1.7    1.5-    3.5       1.4    1.8    1.8    2.9
/1   This figure reflects the repayment of funds for which Government bonds
were temporarily bougnt.  The interest on those bonds is part of the
compensation for losses arising out of import of finished products for
resale in the domestic market during 1972-1974.
8.11      As agreed under the Stage II, no new loans, other than those for
the project, should be incurred, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree,
if debt service coverage would fall or is projected to fall below two times,
or if the debt/equity ratio would exceed 50%. The expected 1.5 coverage in
1978 can be tolerated in view of the satisfactory level in the preceding
years as well as the following year and the fact that any cash shortfall
during the project implementation period is covered by the Government's
overrun guarantee (para. 5.08). Also the low debt service coverage in 1980
is acceptable since the equity contribution required in that year to improve
the debt/equity ratio to 50:50 would be adequate to cover most of the debt
obligations (para. 5.06).

F.   Company Financing During Project Implementation
8.12      The detailed Sources and Applications of Funds projections for the
Company to 1983 are contained in Annex 4. The following table summarizes
these projections during implementation of the project.

/1   Disbursement of additional US$3.1 million equivalent is expected in 1980.
G.   Major Risks
8.13      In addition to (a) possible delays caused by the demands of three
large expansion projects on the construction and equipment manufacturing
capacity of Brazil's expanding economy, (b) a market growth somewhat slower
than predicted, and (c) an erosion of the present price/cost relationship,
the risks inherent in the project basically relate to its very large scale.
There is full awareness of this potential problem within COSIPA and the risk
of the Company's losing control is therefore not great. Experience gained
from the Stage II expansion has improved the Company's abilities to make



- 26 -
engineering and cost estimates and to control the cost and progress of the
expansion program. Any adverse effects on the project on account of market
limitation are also regarded as likely to be of a temaporary nature only.
A moderate erosion of the present price/cost relationship has been assumed
for the financial projections (Annex 14) and the impact of various changes
in the revenue/cost relationship have been assessed (para. 8.05). The results
indicate that a satisfactory financial rate of return should be obtained.
H.   Further Expansion
8.14      A minor expansion of about 0.5 million TPY of raw steel beyond the
capacity increase under Stage III expansion could be carried out by the
enlargement of No. 2 blast furnace and additions to existing production
facilities at the present plant at Cubatao (para. 4.04). A major subsequent
expansion stage would, however, require new iron and steel making facilities,
which would have to be constructed on COSIPA's new site at Quilombo, close
to the existing plant. Assuming a new plant of about 2.0 million TPY with
a product mix similar to COSIPA's upon the completion of Stage III, the
financing required could be in the order of US$2.0 to US$3.0 billion in
1980, using present levels of capital costs as a basis. The financial
projections of Stage III (Annex 4) indicate that a reasonable proportion
of the new plant could be financed from accumulated cash. Whatever the
financing, pricing and investment plans adopted, it seems that the Company's
projected rate of cash generation is appropriate for any reasonably foreseeable
expansion. The foregoing indicates the importance of progressing the pre-
paration of the National Steel Plan (para. 3.07).
IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01      Based on projected long-term import prices for steel products over
the assumed 18 year life of the assets, the project's return to the economy
is estimated to be 16%; this is 1% above the 15% return expected for the
Stage II expansion. The higher rate of return under Stage III as compared
to that of Stage II mainly originates from the expected full utilization
of Stage II equipment such as the blast furnace No. 2, after full production
of Stage III is reached. The underlying assumptions and details of the
economic analysis, including sensitivity tests are presented in Annex 16.
The main eonclusion of the analysis is that the project's contribution to
the economy will be quite adequate even under foreseeable adverse conditions.
B.   Competitiveness and Protection Required
9.02      As indicated in para. 7.04 and Annex 1, selling prices for finished
flat rolled products in Brazil are below current prices prevailing in
Western Europe, and somewhat above present international export prices.



27 -
Furthermore, a comparison of expected production costs for COSIPA with those
costs of a hypothetical but representative production unit in Europe 1/
indicates that COSIPA should be quite competitive. The project does not
therefore require tariff protection for satisfactory operation under normal
trading conditions.
C.   Net Foreign Exchange Savings
9.03      Net foreign exchange savings resulting from the project are pro-
jected to reach US$230 million by 1982. This represents a very substantial
positive impact on Brazil's balance of payments. Further details of the
calculation of these savings are shown in Annex 17.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major commitments and assurances were obtained from
the Government, SIDERBRAS, BNDE and the Company.
A.   Commitments by the Government, BNDE and SIDERBRAS
(a) SIDERBRAS agreed to inform the Bank when it becomes majority
voting-shareholders of COSIPA (para. 2.11);
(b) COSIPA's present corporate form will be maintained and
the Company will not be merged or consolidated without
prior consultation with the Bank (para. 2.13);
(c) Plan for the development of the Brazilian steel industry,
to be prepared by June 30, 1976 by consultants contracted
by the Government; the Bank will be afforded the opportunity
to exchange views on the components of the plan (para. 3.07);
(d) The Government (including BNDE and/or SIDERBRAS) will make
funds available to COSIPA for the project of about US$1,043
million equivalent in the form of loans and equity to be
disbursed between 1975 and Stage III completion - about
1979 (para. 5.05);
(e) The Government will guarantee repayment of the Bank's loan
'-and also guarantee project completion and provision of
funds to cover cost overruns and financing shortfalls
(para. 5.08);

(f) The Government will expedite registration of purchase
contracts and approval of import licenses (para. 6.03);
(g) Domestic steel prices will be set to enable the Company
to earn a reasonable return on its assets, meet its finan-
cial obligations and contribute to the financing of further
expansions; the Government and the Bank will consult as
necessary to determine whether steel prices are
appropriate (para. 7.05);
(h) The Government will make appropriate financing available
promptly such that the Company's current ratio (as deter-
mined from the Company's audited financial statements) will
not fall below 1.1:1 (para. 8.08).
B.   Commitments by the Company
(a) No new subsidiaries will be established, investments in sub-
sidiaries or other business entities will be limited to
US$4 million per year. Loans to or advances to subsidiaries
and other business entities will be limited to US$4 million
outstanding at any time through 1981. Guarantees of loans
by subsidiaries will be limited to US$12 million at any
time outstanding (para. 2.07);
(b) The Bank will be informed when personnel. changes at the
senior management level are made (para. 2.12);
(c) Installation of adequate air, water and noise pollution
controls, including suitable measurement devices, accept-
able to the Bank. Emissions will be monitored and
maintained within acceptable levels (para. 4.06);
(d)  Overseas contractors for construction work will be invited
to bid if over-extending of local construction industry
is indicated (para. 6.03);
(e)  No new investments in excess of US$12 million equivalent
during each year of project implementation (para. 8.07);
(f) The current ratio shall not fall below 1.1:1; no cash
dividends on common shares are to be paid if this would
cause the current ratio to drop below 1.3; the value of
all preferred shares issued will represent not more than
50% of the value of total share capital during project
implementation (para. 8.08 and para. 8.09); and



- 29 -
(g) No new loans will be incurred if debt service coverage
would fall or is projected to fall below two times or
if the debt/equity ratio during the Stage III implement-
ation would fall below 60:40 and thereafter below 50:50
(para. 8.11).
10.02     Confirmation has been obtained that bilateral credits will be forth-
coming and of the terms of the BNDE and FINAME loans. No disbursements on
the Bank loan will be made until the IDB loan agreement has become effective
(para. 5.08).
10.03     Based on the foregoing commitments and assurances received, the
project provides a sound basis for a loan to COSIPA equivalent to US$60
million for 15 years including a 4-year grace period.

B. History of Brazilian Steel Industry
4.        The steel industry in Brazil is of comparatively recent origin.  Of
the major producers, Belgo-Mineira in the State of Minas Gerais was the first
to start up in the 1920s. Even after the Second World War, before CSN began
operations, domestic steel production was less than 300,000 ingot tons equi-
valent, and contributed less than half of domestic consumption at that time.
Since then production has grown rapidly and in 1974 Brazil was the largest
steel producer in Latin America, responsible for 42.4% of the region's output.
Prospects for further rapid growth of the industry are good.
5.        The principal steel mills are located in the area bounded by the
cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Vitoria and Belo Horizonte, which region
also encompasses the mines which supply them with iron ore and limestone and
most of Brazil's steel consuming industry.
6.        Operating at full capacity the Brazilian steel industry produced
about 7.57 million raw steel tons in 1974, of which 45% were processed into
flat products and 55% into non-flat products. This total made Brazil the
sixteenth largest steel producer in the world in 1974, coming after Australia
(7.81 million tons) and before India (6.97 million ltons).
7.        The three principal producers of flat products and their present
annual ca3ac!ities in raw steel equivalents are CSN (1.60 million tons),
USIMINAS (1.45 million tons) and COSIPA (0.78 million tons). In addition
ACESITA, another government-owned company, has a calpacity of 185,000 tons of
special and stainless steel coil and sheet. Non-flat steel is produced by
some 40 companies (in addition to CSN), of which the ten largest account for
2.8 million tons or about 75% of total capacity.  The remaining 30 units are
all below 150,000 tons in capacity and work mostly on the basis of scrap.
8.        The Government plans to expand capacity to about 22.3 million raw
steel tons by 1979, of which about 11.4 million tons - or 51% - would be for
flat products. This is an ambitious program, which projects an average
increase of installed steel-making capacity of abouit 25% per year during the
remainder of the current decade. The corresponding growth in consumption is,
however, only about 12% per year, as Brazil expects towards the end of the
1970s to pass from being a net importer of steel to becoming a small net
exporter. Given Brazil's performance record in the expansion of its steel
industry in the past five years and the experience it has gained during this
period, there is no reason to doubt the country's commitment to the planned
steel expansion program, nor the skill and experience which the institutions
and companies concenied can bring to bear on its implementation.
9.        World production of raw steel increased from 595.6 million tons in
1970 to 710.1 million tons in 1974 (Table I) equivalent to an average annual
growth rate of 4.6% and is expected to grow at about 4.3% per annum to around
915 million tons by 1980. This expansion of world steelmaking capacity would

require a minimum capital investment of US$150 billion equivalent not counting
any investments to replace obsolete facilities. If steel output in Brazil
reaches the 22.3 million tons target by 1979, it will account for about
2.4% of world production as against 1% at present. The apparent per capita
steel consumption in Brazil rose from 41 kg in 1960 to 75 kg in 1973, but is
still less than in some other Latin American countries, such as Argentina,
Mexico and Venezuela. In Western Europe, the lowest levels per capita steel
consumption in 1972 were in Portugal (101 kg) and Greece (96 kg). Australia
and Canada consumed 480 kg and 588 kg per capita, respectively and the U.S.A.
633 kg. Absolute and per capita steel consumption in 1960 and 1972 of some
40 countries around the world are shown in Table II.
tively and the U.S.A. 633 kg. Absolute and per capita steel consumption in
1960 and 1972 of some 40 countries around the world are shown in Table II.
The above table indicates that, among those countries listed, Brazil has
experienced one of the highest growth rates in steel consumption and in 1972
had attained a per capita consumption about equal to that of Argentina, Chile,
Portugal, Spain and Yugoslavia in 1960.
C. Past Brazilian Steel Consumption and Supply
10.       Although consumption of steel in Brazil over the last two decades
has increased by an average of about 9% annually, it has fluctuated substan-
tially from year to year, in step with the general economy. Consumption
exceeded one million tons of raw steel equivalent for the first time in 1947
and by 1960 had increased to about 2.8 million tons. It rose further to
3.5 million tons in 1963, but then declined to 2.9 million tons in 1965 and
increased again to 3.8 million tons in 1967. Since then steel consumption
has risen steadily as shown in the following table, which also gives local
production as well as imports and exports of both flat and non-flat products:

11.       On the basis of the above table the cumulattive annual rate of growth
of apparent steel consumption for three periods over the past 8 years has
been as follows:
Table IV

1967-1974       23.2                    13.6                         18.3
1967-1970       19.9                     9.5                         13.9
1970-1974       25.6                    16.8                         21.7
12.       As a result of continued high growth of the economy, total consump-
tion of steel increased at an annual rate of 18.3% in the 1967-^1974 period.
In 1973, it reached the consumption level forecast for 1975 when the Stage II
expansion was appraised and in 1974 surpassed the earlier expected 1975
consumption level by about 3.4 million tons, or by 40%. This accelerated
growth was even more pronounced in flat products, consumption of which grew
at an annual rate of 23.2% during the same period, approximately 70% above



ANNEX 1
Page 9
the growth rate for non-flat products. Given the present limited capacity
of the Brazilian steel industry, increased consumption has been supplied mainly
by imports, which reached 3.5 million tons in 1974, as compared to 1.5 and
0.7 million tons respectively in 1973 and 1972.
13.       Past consumption (1967-1974) of principal groups of flat and non-
flat products is shown in Tables XVII and XVIII at the end of this Annex.
A summary of the annual rates of growth is given below:
Table V
Brazil - Average Annual Steel Consumption Growth Rates:  1967-1974
Flat products                   %    Non-Flat Products                      %
Heavy plates                   44.6  Roads                                 16.5
Hot rolled products            19.3  Wire roads                            15.7
Cold rolled products           23.9  Bars and light sections               2.3
Tin plate                       8.0  Med. and heavy sections               28.1
Galvanized sheets and                Rails and accesories                   1.9
terneplates                  20.9  Special steel bars                    8.6
Others                          6.4  Seamless pipes                        17.7
Total flat products          23.2  Total non-flat products              13.6
The substantial increase in consumption of most flat products can be attributed
to the growth of heavy industry, consumer durables and non-durable consumer
goods production and shipbuilding. On the other hand, construction and heavy
infrastructure investments have been the main areas in which consumption of
non-flats has grown.
14.       Exports have represented an increasingly smaller part of production
(2.5% in 1974). For the most part exports constitute fulfilment of previous
sales commitments and a policy to maintain future potential markets.
15.       While imports are licensed, there is no indication that consumption
of steel in recent years has been held back due to import restrictions. Growth
of apparent consumption is therefore judged to reflect reasonably well the
increase in the demand for steel in Brazil.
D.   The Stage II Expansion Program
16.       In January 1971 the then newly created Conselho Nacional da Industria
Siderurgica (CONSIDER) published the general guidelines of a National Steel
Program. This program called for the establishment of 20 million tons of
annual raw steel making capacity by 1980, which represented an average rate
of increase of installed capacity of 12% per annum including 10% of surplus
capacity, which would be available for exports of steel products. What had



ANNEX 1
Page 10
appeared at the beginning of this decade an unprecedentedly ambitious steel
expansion program is now well on the way towards achievement. The National
Steel Program served as the basis of the Stage II expansion projects of CSN,
USIMINAS and COSIPA, which are designed to increase raw steel making capacity
of the companies from 1.7, 1.0 and 1.0 million tons per annum at the comple-
tion of Stage I of their expansion program to 2.4, 2.4 and 2.3 million tons
respectively, and provide additional rolling and finishing facilities. As
mentioned previously, the Executive Directors of the Bank approved loans of
US$64.5 million, US$63 million and US$64.5 million during the first half of
1972 to help finance the CSN, USIMNAS and COSIPA expansion projects. They
are scheduled for completion in 1976.
17.       Progress in the implementation of these projects has generally
been good and the average delay in bringing the new facilities into operation
is now estimated to about six months. If no further delays occur, this must
be considered a major achievement, particularly in view of the difficult
equipment supply conditions prevailing over the past: two years. Particularly
noteworthy are the low price levels at which the major equipment was bid and
contracted. This factor has been largely instrumental in enabling the
companies to keep the overrun on total project costs to within 40% of the
original estimates, despite changes in scope arising out of design evolution,
currency realignments, higher than expected domestic inflation and the impact
of increased fuel costs and high rates of inflation in all the equipment
supplying countries.  However, as the following table VI shows, by far, the
major reasons for the project cost overruns were increases in civil and
construction costs, ocean freight and engineering/administration of the
expansion.

The increases in costs for civil engineering and construction work were caused
by both underestimation of physical quantities and higher than expected
domestic inflation. The cost increase for equipment was primarily due to
design developrment and to higher ocean freight costs, which are included in
the equipment budget. The costs of engineering/administration of Stage II
increased due to underestimation of the volume of work involved and proper
charging of the projects within their share of costs under these two headings.
18.       As at the  end of December 1974 about 75% of all equipment orders
were placed. Awards, after international competitive bidding, either following
Bank guidelines for Bank/IDB financed items or a modified procedure, which
takes into account credit terms for bilaterally financed items were as follows:
Table VII
Distribution of Total Equipment Orders by
Country on Basis of Value: Stage II
Country                             (%)
Japan                                56.0
Brazil                               15.6
Germany                              11.4
USA                                  11.0
Italy                                 3.5
France                                1.1
England                               1.1
Others                                0.3
100.0
The above table indicates that Japanese suppliers were most successful in
the bidding processes. This was largely due to the competitiveness of
Japanese suppliers during the principal period of bidding (second half 1971
through first half 1973), but also because bidding took place at a time when
steel mill equipment suppliers in Japan were keen on orders following a major
reduction in the previously planned steel capacity expansion program in that
country. It is expected that in the Stage III expansion equipment orders will
be distributed more evenly, since it appears that competitive prices in the
world for steel mill equipment have narrowed significantly. As the above
table indicates, Brazilian suppliers and sub-suppliers have won about 16%
of total orders placed, or about 30% of orders placed with Bank/IDB financing.
Their performance in terms of quality of workmanship and adherence to delivery
schedules has, with few exceptions, been satisfactory.
19.       All the civil engineering, construction and erection work was or
is being carried out by Brazilian contractors. These companies have demon-
strated their capacity and capability to take on such major contracts. In



ANNEX 1
Page 12
particular, they are able to mobilize the construcltion management, plant,
skilled labor and materials as and when required to meet the tight schedules
set by the steel companies. While in some instances delays in construction
work have been the cause for delays in overall project implementation, these
have been due more to delays in receipt of design information and unexpected
additional work necessitated to minimize interrupt:ions of ongoing operations
than their inability to adhere to their original contractual obligations.
E.   The Stage III Expansion Program
20.       Owing to the rapid growth of consumption of steel products of all
kinds, which resulted in imports in excess of about: 3.5 million tons during
1974 as mentioned previously, the Government increased in II PND capacity
target from 20 million tons of raw steel in 1980 to 22.3 million tons in 1979
and, at the same time, advanced the buildup of capacity by about one year.
The three flat products producers were thus requested to modify their Stage
III expansion plans accordingly. The Stage III projects have therefore been
rescheduled and revised in the light of recent technical, commercial and market
developments and now call for raw steel capacity of CSN, USININAS and COSIPA
to be increased to 11.4 million tons by 1979. The present (1974) and planned
capacities of the three companies shown in the following table VIII:
Table VIII
Installed Capacity of the Flat Products Plants
(in millions of raw steel tons equivalent)
Present     Stage II      Stage III
(1974)       (1976)        (1979)
CSN                        1.6           2.4           4.4
COSIPA                     0.8           2.3           3.5
USIMNAS                   1.4           2.4           3.5
Total                 3.8           7.1          11.4
21.       The individual expansion projects have beten well prepared and co-
ordinated with one another and incorporate the experience gained in the on-
going expansion program (Stage II).  A common feature of all three projects
is that-they will balance their plants; the excess blast furnace capacity
installed in Stage II will be fully utilized. All three companies will
therefore install additional sinter capacity and, in the case of CSN and
USIMINAS additional coking capacity. COSIPA will only reprogram the produc-
tion of its existing No. 5 coke oven battery from merchant and foundry coke
to metallurgical coke for its blast furnace operations. All Ihree companies
will be installing continuous slab casting machines and increasing the capacity
of their rolling and finishing facilities.



ANNEX 1
Page 13
22.       If as SIDERBRAS and the companies propose, Stage III were implemented
hard on the heels of Stage II, the construction contractors now engaged on
the plant sites could continue working without interruptions caused by a
run-down and subsequent build-up of their work force and equipment. Accord-
ingly, the companies have started procurement action for the long lead-time
plant items included in their Stage III expansion projects such as coke ovens
and new rolling mills, and expect to place the first contracts late in 1975
or early 1976. Civil work for Stage III is not scheduled to start before
the end of 1975, by which time the Stage II projects will be in the final
phase of erection and start-up. The timing of Stage III will therefore maintain
the momentum which the companies have built up over the past two to three years.
F.   Government Policy towards the Iron and Steel Industry, Institutions
23.       The present expansion program of the public sector steel companies
owes a great deal to the efforts of CONSIDER which was established in June
1970. CONSIDER was instrumental in preparing the National Steel Program
which is the basis of the Stage II expansion projects of CSN, COSIPA and
USIMINAS and in arranging the necessary foreign and local finance to permit
these projects to be implemented.
24.       In September 1973, the Government created Siderurgia Brasiliera,
S.A. (SIDERBRAS), a holding company, to be responsible for new public sector
projects, such as the Tubarao semi-finished products plant and Brazilian
joint ventures in foreign countries, such as the proposed 100,000 tons per
year steel mill in Paraguay. BNDE decided also to set up a holding company
for its interests in the steel industry, specifically in USIMINAS and COSIPA.
Eventually these two holding companies were to be merged giving SIDERBRAS
control over the entire public steel sector.
25.       The new administration which came into office in March 1974 decided
against this plan and announced that all public sector companies and projects
would be placed under the control of SIDERBRAS from the outset. Accordingly,
an amended version of the SIDERBRAS law was drafted which was approved by
Congress in November 1974. In summary the law designates SIDERBRAS to promote
and manage Government interests in the iron and steel industry and the procure-
ment of the domestic and foreign capital and operating resources required for
the operation of the plants, to coordinate the industrial and commercial
policies of the steel producers and to stimulate the formation and development
of the human resources needed for the activities of the Brazilian iron and
steel industry.
26.       The Board of SIDERBRAS is appointed by the Minister of Industry
and Commerce and consists of the President, General Alfredo Am1erico da Silva,
previously President of CSN, the Director Superintendent, Director of Finance,
and Director of Raw Materials and marketing. The day-to-day operations of
SIDERBRAS are handled by a staff of some 20 engineers, financial analysts and
economists, most of whom transferred from CONSIDER to SIDERBRAS upon the
latter's creation in 1973

27.       In August 1974 a new decree modifying the original CONSIDER decree
was published. The major change is in the scope of CONSIDER, which now covers
the non-ferrous in addition to the iron and steel sector. CONSIDER is
charged with formulating and coordinating an industrial development policy,
establishing criteria for the granting of incentives, approving new and
expansion projects, establishing general directives for the commercial and
financial policies of the industries, planning investment, coordinating the
raising of the required financial resources, and carrying out studies for
the development of the sectors.
28.       Working relationships between CONSIDER and SIDERBRAS are good.
The two ent-t4es will cooperate closely in the preparation of a new National
Steel Plan for the period 1975-83. This National Steel Plan will be a compre-
hensive document covering all aspects affecting the develpment and operation
of the Brazilian steel industry, both in the public and private secLor, suCh1
as raw material availabilities, the growth of the domestic and export markets,
pricing of steel products, the capability of the local equipment manufacturing
industry, local financing requirements, the development of the necessary mana-
gerial and industrial skills and infrastructure requirements. Some of these
aspects, such as the growth of demand for steel have already been studied
(and will be updated continuously), while work on the others has begun or
will shortlv be initiated. Consultants will be appointed early in 1975 to
prepare, by the end of i475, in conjunction with CONSIDER and SIDERBRAS, the
National Steel Plan which will incorpotatle the findings of the various sub-
studies listed above.
G.   The Market
29.       The Brazilian Government commissioned several studies of the domestic
steel market during the past decade. The first one, the foreign exchange
cost of which was financed by the Bank, was carried out by Booz, Allen and
Hamilton International in association with Tecnometal in 1965.
30.       Tecnometal carried out another study in 1970, which served as the
basis of the Bank's appraisal of the Stage II expansion projects of CSN,
USIMINAS and COSIPA. This study, which took 1969 as the base year, produced
demand projections for the period 1970-80 with special emphasis on the years
1970-1975.
31.       The continued high rate of economic growth in Brazil during 1970-
1974 resulted in a much greater increase of domestic steel consumption than
forecast in the 1970 study. Accordingly CONSIDER commissioned Tecnometal in
May 1974 to undertake a new study of the Brazilian steel market for the
period.1975-1983. Special emphasis was placed on flat products, because these
are exclusively produced by public-sector companies.
32.       The final version of this study, which was completed in December
1974, is based on extensive discussions between Tecnometal and the marketing
departments of the flat-products companies, CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA, and on



ANNEX 1
Page 22
a detailed analysis of the sixteen major steel consuming sectors in Brazil.
In addition, Tecnometal carried out a macro-economic analysis of the entire
steel demand, covering flat as well as non-flat and special steel products.
33.       The sectoral forecast is based on an analysis of questionnaires
completed in mid-1974 by major steel consumers, which were aware of the growth
targets established in II PND which was then available in draft form. There
is therefore a linkage between the sectoral forecast of a total flat steel
demand in 1980 of 10.2 million tons comprising uncoated and coated comaon steel
flat-rolled Products and a GDP growth rate of 10% per annum in the second half
of the 1970s which is the underlying assumption in II PND. Table IX shows
the expected growth of demand during 1975-1981, which averages out at 14.1%
per annum.
34.       The Bank Econ-o,mc 'issJon which visited Brazil in January 1975 formed
the view that, on account of the balance of payments constraint likely to
persist over the next few years, Brazil's GDP growth rate in the period 1975
through 1980 would be around 7% per annum rather than 10% as stipulated in
II PND.
35.        Consequently the Bank prepared a new macro-economic forecast based
on a regression between apparent flat-rolled steel consumption and GDP for
the period 1967 through 1973.  (Table IX.)  The apparent consumption figures
for 1974 were ignored as it is known that heavy stock--Jing of steel inven-
tories took place in that vear- wi c-h _Ld have introduced an upward bias
in the fQrecast.
36.       According to the Bank's computation the demamd elasticity for flat
steel is 1.71. The application of this elasticity to the predicted 7% GDP
growth rate gives a 12% demand growth rate for flat products. Thus the
macro-economic forecast of common and coated flat steel demand in 1980 is
8.3 million tons.
37.       Table XL shows the domestic demand for flat products during 1975-
1981 as predicted by the sectoral and macro-economic forecasts. It will be
seen that for the reasons set out above, the sectoral forecast is greater
than the macro-economic forecast; in 1980 the difference between the demand
for flat products forecast by the two methods is 1.85 million tons.
38.       The effect of the postulated lower GDP growth rate on the structure
of flat steel consumption has not yet been determined. It can be expected,
however, that a greater proportion of heavy plate will be consumed, as the
use of heavy plate is primarily associated with construction projects, while
the end use of hot and cold rolled coil and sheet is largely in consumer
durables. However, using the structure of consumption which prevailed in
the recent past the Bank has, on the basis of the macro-economic forecast,
prepared a new series of demand projections for the principal flat products -
heavy plate, hot rolled coil and sheet, uncoated cold rolled coil and sheet
and coated coil and sheet which is shown in Table XII.



ANNEX I
Page 23
39.       A comparison between the domestic demand projections for flat
products, excluding special qualities, and the sales forecasts of the three
flat products producers, CSN, COSIPA and USIMINAS, is shown in Table XI. It will
be seen that in 1980 demand and supply are expected to be more or less in
balance, but that already in 1981, the first year in which the Stage III
facilities are expected to be in full operation, the deficit between supply
and demand is projected to increase to 900,000 tons of flat-rolled products.
40.       This underlines the need for the national steel study, which
SIDERBRAS and CONSIDER will jointly commission, in order to determine the
parameters - scope, location and timing - of the Stage IV expansion program.
The first 1 million tons of raw steel deficit after 1980 could be supplied
by the Tubarao semi-finished products plant, if the decision to proceed is
taken in 1975, but any additional tonnages over and above this 1 million
tons will require the installation of a new blast furnace, either at COSIPA,
USIMINAS or a greenfield plant.
41.       Projected supply and demand comparisons for the individual principal
flat-rolled products groups - heavy plate, hot rolled coil and sheet, uncoated
cold rolled coil and sheet, and coated cold rolled coil and sheet are shown
in Tables XII,XIII,XIV,XV.
42.       For heavy plate the present supply deficit is expected to continue
throughout the period under consideration, reducing to 160,000 tons in 1978
but increasing again thereafter to 550,000 tons in 1981 (Table XII). USIMINAS
or COSIPA or both companies will therefore need to install the second plate
mill stand by 1980 in order to provide additional plate rolling capacity.
43.       The projected demand and supply comparison for the hot rolled coil
and sheet shows a reasonable balance after 1975 (Table XIII). Such surpluses
and deficits as are predicted are within the order of accuracy of the esti-
mates - rated capacities, learning curves and product mix on the supply side
and market forecasts on the demand side. From 1979 however, additional hot
rolling capacity need be installed to cover the rapidly increasing supply
deficit.
44.       For uncoated cold rolled coil and sheet (Table XIV) the demand and
supply situation is expected to become reasonably balanced after completion
of the Stage III expansion. No additional cold rolling capacity need be
installed before 1982.
45.       For coated products (Table XV) - tinplate, galvanized coil and
sheet and, to a lesser extent, terne plate and black plate for enameling -
the projections show a continuing deficit in the 1975-1981 period. This
deficit is insignificant in 1976 but increases thereafter to a minimum of
100,000 tons per year. Additional finishing facilities should therefore be
installed by 1981 based on the next market study which is expected to be
carried out in 1976.



ANNEX 1
Page 24
46.       In comparing the supply and demand situat:Lon for individual flat
products groups it must be remembered that there is a degree of interchange-
ability between the different product groups. The companies will therefore
be able to adjust their production programs to suit the characteristics of
the market at any particular time. The projections indicate that, overall,
the companies' proposals for installing additional rolling and finishing
capacity are appropriate in the light of the expected development of the
market.  The next market study (to be carried out in 1976) and the conclu-
sions of this study should serve as the basis for determining the nature
and capacity of the rolling and finishing facilities to be installed as part
of Stage IV of Brazil's steel expansion program and to be operational by
1982.
47.       In the field of non-flat products CSN is the only producer of rail-
road rails and accessories in Brazil. Upon completion of the revamp of the
breakdown mill included in the Stage I expansion CSN4's rail producing capacity
will be 142,000 tons per annum, which is insufficient to satisfy the require-
ments of the ongoing railway expansion and modernization project. Accordingly,
the Bank has asked CSN to examine the feasibility of further increasing the
capacity of its rail and structural mill in order to reduce the need for
importations of rails.
H.   Competitiveness
48.       The competitiveness of Brazil's steel price structure is shown in
Table XVI which compares current (March 1975) domestic selling prices,
exclusive of ICM tax, of representative flat-rolled products with those pre-
vailing in Western Europe, exclusive of value added tax, and the US.
Table XVI
Comparison of Selling Prices

Heavy Plate                 285                334               267

/1   Average of British, French and West Germany quotations.
This comparison shows Western European selling prices to be up to 20% above
US prices for similar products, and the Brazilian prices generally closer
to the US than the European prices.
49.       Price comparisons of this nature are always difficult to make, as
actual transaction prices may differ from posted prices, the exact size and
quality of the products sold may differ from case to case, the selling price

Page 25
may include a concealed discount in the form of extended credit terms or
waiving of quality and dimensional extras, and due to the frequency with which
selling prices have been adjusted of late the reference dates may not be the
same. Nevertheless, it is clear that Brazilian domestic selling prices for
heavy plate, hot rolled products and cold rolled products are fully in line
with those prevailing in Western Europe and the US.
50.       A more comprehensive price comparison will be included in the
report to be presented to the Executive Directors. At the same time it is
expected that the Bank's analysis of the steel industry's pricing policies
and profit margins will enable appropriate criteria for the determination of
selling prices to be established.
51.       In the recent past, Brazil's exports have been confined to fulfilling
contracts signed before the advent of the present acute domestic supply defi-
cit, but no new exports of flat products have actively been promoted. As
Tables XII, XIII, XIV and XV show, no significant export surpluses are
expected before the end of the present decade. Brazil's declared objective
of exporting 10% of its steel production will therefore have to be deferred
until the implementation of Stage IV of the country's Steel Expansion Program.
As the analysis of CSN's and COSIPA's cost structure shows, the implementa-
tion of the Stage III facilities will further serve to strengthen Brazil's
competitive position in the export market.

BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED FACILITIES
The Stage III expanion project will increase COSIPA's production
capacity from 2.3 million tpy as of Stage II to 3.5 million tpy. The pro-
ject consists of the addition of new facilities and the expansion of others.
Some existing facilities, like the blast furnaces, do not need to be expanded
at all because their original capacities are sufficient to reach the pro-
duction targets under Stage III. This underscores the fact that the expansion
projects are part of an expansion plan that is implemented in overlapping
stages.
The principal proposed facilities under Stage III Expansion
Project are described below.
1.   Dock-Loading and Unloading Facilities
One berth for foreign vessels and two berths for domestic vessels
with a total length of 440m shall be newly constructed west of the existing
pier.
The existing two 600 t/h unloaders shall be relocated to the new
pier, and two 1,200 t/h unloaders shall be newly installed.
The existing pier will have four 20 t loading cranes.
Each pier will have two handling equipment operating within vessels
for loading and unloading operations.
2.   Raw Materials Handling Facilities
The raw materials handling facilities to be installed in the Stage
III Expansion Plan will be those necessary to supplement the capacity to
blend, grind, screen and transfer the increased raw materials demand of
the 3.5 million tpy production target; the main facilities to be added
being the following:
a)   Additional piles for primary yard ore and secondary raw materials;
b)   Blending yard for No. 3 Sinter Plant;
c)   Receiving conveyors from unloaders at pier No. 2;
d)   One additional line to primary yard discharging conveyors;
e)   Pellet screen station;



ANNEX 6
Page 2
f)   Conveyors for No. 3 Sinter Plant;
g)   One additional pile to primary yard for ore.
These facilities will be able to store enough materials to
maintain the followqing stock levels, in days consumption:
a)   Primary yard:  Iron ore - 30 days, limestone and dolomite -
15 days, manganese ore - 45 days, gravel and sand - 20 days,
scale, coke breeze and sinter - 3 days.
b)   Sized materials yard:  lump and fine materials after crushing
station - 7 days, sinter - 3 days.
c)   Blending yard:  fine ore - 10 days.
As a rule, the raw materials are to be received and stored at the
primary yard and then supplied to other areas as required. Fine sinter and
coke breeze are usually sent by freight cars or truck direct to the sinter
plant from the blast furnace or coke plant, but the primary yard is used
as a buffer.
3.   Sintering Plant
A new No. 3 Sinter Plant (hereinafter called the No. 3 DL) shall
be installed for securing the blast furnace burden necessary for the 3.5
million tpy Expansion Plan.
The No. 3 DL will consist of compact sintering equipment with 250 m
of effective sintering area installed in parallel and north of the existing
No. 2 DL with an average of 6,300 t/day capacity. The plant will produce
self-flux sintered ore using fine ore and self-generated fines as main
material, sand and limestone as sub-material and coke breeze as fuel. It
will operate 24 hours a day at a 90% rate with the following raw mix com-
position:
Fine Ore             487
Sinter fine           5%

g)   Dust collecting equipment - one set of 7,000 m /min. capacity.
4.   Coke Plants
No. 5 Battery which produces foundry coke for sale under the 2.3
million tpy Plan will later be producing metallurgical coke to attend COSIPA's
increased Blast Furnaces requirements under the 3.5 million tpy Expansion
Project. The only addition to the coke plant will be dust exhausting
equipment.
5.   Blast Furnaces
No alternations of the No. 1 and No. 2 Bliast Furnaces are foreseen
under the Stage III expansion. Hot metal production necessary for the 3.5 MT
shall be of approximately 9,000 t/day. The inner volume of Blast Furnace
No. 1 was increased to 1,740 m3 during the relining in July 1973. Consider-
ing a production of 1.7 t/m3/day, the Blast Furnace No. 1 shall produce about
3,000 t/day. The Blast Furnace No. 2 will originally have an inner volume
of 2,565 mi and considering a production rate of 234 t/m3/day will produce
the required 6,000 t/day of hot metal.
6.   Power Plant
The Power Plant will be expanded mainly to meet the additional
demand for low pressure steam. Moreover, this expansion will also enable
COSIPA to use all surplus energy in order to balance the generation and
consumption of energy under Stage III Expansion Project.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
a)   Power House
An additional high-pressure boiler and an additional turbo-
generator will be installed with sufficient capacity to
absorb the surplus by-product energy.
The new turbogenerator is planned to have 30 MW capacity and
the new high-pressure boiler will be able to produce 130 t/h
of steam at pressure of 43 kg/cm and 440C temperature,
capacity to burn coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, heavy
oil and coal tar. The No. 3 Turboblower installed at the
2.3 million tpy Stage will be used with oxygen enrichment
to attend wind requirements for the No. 2 Blast Furnace
5,800 t/day production.
b)   Yard Steam
The Yard Steam will be mainly supplied from the existing back-
pressure turbines, and the steam shortage will be covered by
a new low-pressure boiler to be installed near No. 2 Cold
Strip Mill, where a large volume of low-pressure steam will
be consumed.  The low-pressure boiler newly installed at        2
this time will be able to produce 55 t/h of steam at 15 kg/cm
and 263C temperature capable to burn COG and heavy oil.
c)   Fuel System
The capacities of BFG Holder, COG Holders and COG boosters
will remain unchanged as the capacities planned in the 2.3
MT/Y project will be sufficient to attend the new requirements
at the 3.5 MT/Y stage.
7.   Foundry
The foundry capacity will not be changed since no additional ingot
molds will be required after the startup of the continuous casting in the
new No. 2 Steel Plant.
8.   Steelmaking Plants
The existing No. 1 BOF-shop will continue to operate with its
two 85 t converters and two 100 t converters capable of producing hot metal
sufficient to reach 2,300,000 tpy of sound ingots. This production will
completely be processed on the slabbing mill.
The new No. 2 steelmaking plant which will be built under Stage III,
will be equipped with two 120 t converters for an initial capacity of 1.2
million tpy of slabs. An additional 120 t converter could be installed to
allow an increase of output to about 1.8 million tpy.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
The new No. 2 BOF Shop with two 120 t BOF converters and two
continuous slab casting machines with four strands each will be located in
Amores Island, adjacent to COSIPA's existing facililties.
8.1       The BOF plant basic design conditions are:
a)   Heat size (liquid steel)                         117 t/heat
b)   Steel yield                                      92%
c)   Hot metal ratio                 maximum          90%
average          85%
Minimumn         80%
d)   Heat cycle                      average          42 minutes
e)   Blowing time                                     16 to 18 minutes
f)   Oxygen flow rates               maximuma         23,000 Nm /hr
minimum          21,500 Nm3
g)   Iron ore addition during        maximurn         0.5/minute
blowing
In comparison to the ingot making process, the continuous casting
process requires higher and rigorously controlled tapping temperatures and
as a result there is a longer tap-to-tap time, which is estimated to average
42 minutes.
One converter will be in operation at a t'ime with about 31 heats
of 117 tons each day, for a yearly production of 1,258,000 tons of liquid
steel. The scarfing and casting yields will be 98.5% and 97% respectively,
so that the production of slabs will reach approximately 1.2 million tpy.
The plant layout has been designed so as to obtain high-quality
steel and high productivity, on the one hand, and to make the plant as
compact as possible, on the other hand, so that it may be located conveniently
in Amores Island and still allow for future expansion.
8.2       Continuous Casting Plant
The continous casting (CC) plant of 1.2 million tpy capacity will
consist of 2 machines, with 4 molds each. The molds sizes vary from
160 mm x 800 to 140 mm x 1,550 mm for the hot stip mill and from 120 x 1,200 mm
to 260 x 1,400 mm for plate mill. The average casting speed can reach a maximum
of 1,900 mm/min.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
The CC machines will use the ladle-car system and the layout of the
tandish and casting ladles will be so arranged as to permit series casting.
Each strand will be provided with a market, a pusher-stand for slate trans-
portation, a slab cooler to reduce the number of slab cooling beds and an
off-line slow cooling bed. The slab condftioning equipment consists of two
scarfing machines, a hand scarfing unit and a primary and secondary slab
cutter.
A slab bed of some 1,100 m  will be provided in the final process
for storage of about 2,000 tons of slabs.
The water service system for the CC plant will be divided into
the following four subsystems for rationalizing necessary water treating
equipment:
a)   mold cooling water and machine cooling water
b)   spray water (secondary cooling)
c)   cooling water for slab cooler
d)   washing water for machine scarfer and washing water for
secondary slab cutter.
The slabs will be transported by rail outside the plant.
The plant will operate under conditions of series casting of 1.3
to 1.9 times, dependent upon the way products lots are arranged. The casting
speed is planned from the outset at 1,300 mm/min. for small mold sizes and
1,000 mm/min. for larger ones and is expected to increase gradually.
9.   Calcining Plant
A third rotary kiln of 250 t/day capacity will be purchased for
the new BOF plant. The unit consumption of burnt lime will be 60 kgs/t of
steel. This kiln will be installed close to the new BOF plant and will be
provided with a limestone washing facility, a grate type raw material pre-
heater, an electric dust collector and a 4-5 days consumption burnt lime
storage bunker that will also be used as the BOF plant ground bunker.
The working ratio of the lime kilns is planned to be 96.5%
throughout the year, but if this high ratio cannot be reached burnt lime
can be purchased from outside.
10. Refractory Plant
No changes will be made since all the additional brick requirements
will be met through purchases from outside.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
11.  Oxygen Plant
A new air separation plant of about 12,000 Nm3 /hr will be installed.
It will be provided with argon extraction equipment and will be, as the
existing plant, an all low pressure type and medium pressure type with
nitrogen extractions.
12. Slabbing Mill
There will be no changes in the existing slabbing mill since the
entire increase in slab production will take place at the new CC plant.
13. Hot Strip Mill
The hot strip mill will suffer various alterations in order to
more than double its production to at least 2.03 million tpy of hot coils.
No new hot strip mill will be installed but the required additions will be
the following:
a)   One 100 MT/h reheating furnace,
b)   One complete 110 mm roughing mill (7,000 HP),

this equipment.
The hot rolling finishing line and the skin pass mill will be
transferred to the area where the 110" Plate Mill is installed at present.



ANNEX 6
Page 8
14. Cold Rolling Mill Plant
A second Tandem Cold Strip Mill, No. 2 TCM, will be installed
in Amores Island. Its capacity is 700,000 tpy and the site and layout allow
a future expansion. The adoption of continuous rolling in No. 2 TOM, as
well as a continuous annealing and processing line and tinplate production
are expected to be brought by another expansion.
The installation of the new cold rolling mill plant consist
of a) a 68,000 t/month capacity 54" pickling line of the horizontal con-

ANNEX 7
BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
ECOLOGY
COSIPA is trying to comply with the anti-pollution regulations
for the whole plant. For the ongoing expansion as well as for Stage III,
all attention is given to environmental considerations. Under the present
project, the two most important equipment groups are:
No. 3 Sinter Plant
No. 2 Steel Plant including Continuous Casting
The No. 3 sinter plant will be equipped against air pollution with
a main exhaust dust collecting system with two electrostatic precipitators
conceived for the removal of particles larger than 15i micron. The system
will process 17,000 m3lminute. The new stack will be 100 m high with a
diameter of 4.2 m; the expected gas velocity will be about 25 m/sec.
Auxiliary dust collecting systems are: (1) machine feed dust collector
(volume 31,000 m3/h), (2) limestone bins dust collector (36,000 m3/h),
(3) sinter screening dust collector (83,000 m3/h), (4) sinter crusher dust  3
collector (33,000 m /h), (5) machine discharge end dust collector (280,000 m h).
The water anti-pollution devices are recirculation systems for the tower,
the hot and cold pits and additional filters.
The No. 2 BOF shop will be equipped with a gas treating system and
a secondary ventilation system against air pollution. The gas treating
system will be a non-combustion O.G. system with a membrane type cooler,
a first quenching venturi dust collector, a second dust collector and two
exhausters each with 2,300 m3/min capacity. The tripod type flare stack
will be 70 m high and 1.4 m of diameter. The secondary ventilation system
will attend the following locations: (i) converter mouth, (ii) hot metal
reladdling stations, (iii) hot metal deslagging platform. The bag filter
and fan will have a capacity of approximately 8,000 m3/min each. Water
anti-pollution measures for BOF will mainly be based on recirculation of
water from the tower and from the dust collection. Two thickners (11.5 m
diameter, 3.5 m light) and two sludge filters (1.5 A/h each) and one coarse
grain separator will be installed.
The continuous casting plant's anti air pollution equipment has
not yet been designed. The water anti-pollution equipment consists of the
recovering devices for direct and for indirect cooling water separately.
While the indirect cooling water will only be reduced in temperature, direct
-cooling water is led through settling basins, filters and is subsequently
reduced in temperature. The steel scale of the direct cooling water which
has flowed into the settling basins, is removed by a sludge scraper.

BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
1.     The table of projected employment after co-mpletion of the excpansion
Stages II and III indicates an overall 33% increase between the above t-wTo
expansion stages.
2.    WShile the clerical staff will only 'oe increased by 12% during the
build-up of Stage III production, the sales will incmrease by 7'% as a result
of the Corpan-'s efforts of diversification in m!arkets and products.
Especially new product lines like welded tuoes and pre-fabricated steel bridges
T.Lll require additional personnel.
3.     To establish the man hour productivity, 2000 hours per year of product-
ive time are assumed per employee;  moreover, on average, about 75' of the new
steel quantity produced can be expected as finished flat steel products.  ?Ctween
1973 and 1980, for industrialized countries a productivit 7 increase of aroat
2.5% p.a. equal to 19% between 1973 and 1980 can be expected.  This would leave
t,he IJS TgAth about 8.5 man hours per ton of finished product and Japan wnth around
6.7 man hours per ton of finished product by 1980.

2/ Includes about US$182 million enuivalent estimated indirect foreign exchange component of locally procuired Mods.
3/ Valties for local goods include 15% preference margin.
4/ Working capital increases under Stage III will total US$110 8 million eouivalent. Until 1979, the year of the physical completion of Stage III, working
capital for Stage  III will increase by US$14.7 million.   The balance working capital increase of US$96.1 million equivalent during 1980-1982 will be financed
out of cash generation and is therefore not included in the cost of the project.
5/ These items are expected to be won by Brazilian suppliers after bidding in  all countries providing bilateral financing including Brazil with funds from
FINAME and/or BNDE.

BRIZIh - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
ASSUMPTIONS FOR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIRENENTS
The working capital required by COSIPA every year is assumed to
represent a proportion of gross sales, as shown below:
1973        1974-1979       1979-1983
(Actual)
As Percentage of Gross Sales
Cash and Brnks           1.5             2.0            1.0
Inventories             32.4            20.0           20.0
Accounts receivable    27.9             20.0           20.0
(Net)
Accounts payable        42.0            19.0            19.0
The breakdown of Inventories from 1974 onwards as percentage of
gross sales, is the following:
% of Gross Sales
Stores             7.2
Raw Materials      6.o
Products in
process          2.3
Finished products  3.5
Products in
transit          1.0
Total Inventories 20.0
Cash and Banks projections are 2% of gross sales from 1974 through
1978 due to higher cash requirements for both the normal operations
and the project implementation.

The hiatus between 6 months financing of flat steel imports through the Government and 1 month required by the Company between payment of these imports
and discounting of receivables from these marketed products provides the above net financing by revolving short term obligations to the Government.  The
net financing is after the deduction of inventory due to the import scheme.

ANNEX 13

Iron Ore
COSIPA's plant is located at a distance of some 850 km by rail from
the various iron ore mines in the State of Xminas Gerais. Therefore, freight
represents more than half of the delivered cost of the ore. Iron ore pellets
are supplied by CVRD and carried by coastal ships from Victoria, State of
Espirito Santo, to COSIPA's own port, at a distance of about 430 sea miles.
Iron ore deposits in Minas Gerais are practically unlimited. This is also
the reason for Brazil being one of the main exporters of iron ore in the world.
Limestone and Dolomite
The limestone and dolomite are supplied by COSIPA's subsidiary MFM,
from mines situated at 210 km and 450 km from the plant respectively. These
raw materials are transported to the plant by rail and truck.
Coal
Brazilian coal is mined in the Stage of Santa Caterina and trans-
ported to the plant by rail and by sea over a distance of about 350 miles.
Although domestic coal is available in larger quantities, COSIPA uses only
20% local coal in its blend because of its physical properties and the high
ash and sulphur content. The remaining 80% of coal is normally imported.
Only in exceptional circumstances, as during 1974, when imported coal is not
available despite long term supply contracts, a much higher proportion of
local coal is used (up to 50%), which, however, reduces the efficiency of
the blast furnace.
COSIPA has signed long term contracts for imported low, medium and
high volatile coal with US and Polish suppliers. These call for increasing
shipments up to 1980, and should satisfy more than 830% of its requirements.
Contacts are being made with Canada, Australia, Colombi. and the Peoples
Republic of China to meet the increased requirements for the expansion under
Stages II and III between 1977 and 1980.

BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
SELLING PRICE ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
For 1974, prices are those prevailing in Brazil in December 1974.
These prices do not reflect a price increase in early October 1974 which was
only granted to compensate for future losses out of the import of finished
flat steel by the Brazilian steel producers. Since this import scheme will
always have at least a neutral effect on the Company's profit and future
quantities and prices are extremely difficult to project, the imports of
finished flat steel for redistribution in the Brazilian market are not
reflected in the financial projections.
Domestic prices and costs of the Brazilian flat steel producers
were escalated during the implementation period of Stage III. This escala-
tion was made in an attempt to show more realistic figures of prices, costs
and cash generation during a limited period. The estimated cumulative escala-
tion rates from 1975 to 1979 are 10% for prices and 12% for costs.

for all steel products except hot rolled coils, for which the tax
is only 4%.

within the State of Sao Paulo and 13% for sales outside the State.

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
Assumptions
1.        Financial rate of return calculations are based on the incremental
capital cost, operating cost and revenue streams shown on page 2 of this
Annex. The capital costs, operating costs and revenues were inflated at dif-
ferent rates for the financial projections (see Annexes 16 and 17) and have been
deflated accordingly to reflect their respective 1975 values in real terms.
2.        Other basic assumptions used in the financial rate of return cal-
culations are as follows:
Construction period:    4 years
Life of the project:   15 years
Revenue: Net sales (excludes excise tax and
cost of distribution, includes sales
tax)

ANNEX 1

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
Assumptions
1.        All costs and revenues are expressed in real 1975 prices and are
derived on the following basis: (a) benefit stream is based on the oppor-
tunity cost of inporting steel products; (b) production cost is calculated
using same prices as for financial rate of return analysis (see Annexes 16
an 17), as prices for the main inputs are consistent with world market
prices; and (c) all taxes and duties are excluded. No shadow-pricing of
foreign exchange/1 or labor/2 has been employed.
Revenue
2.        COSIPA's net sales are valued at adjusted 1975 world market prices
(CIF Brazilian port), which are derived from projected long-term steel
export prices for the major steel-producing countries. The price levels
used for the analysis reflect the lower end of the range of current domestic
prices for those countries/3 for each of the steel products to be produced
by the project and allow about $50 per ton transportation cost on the esti-
mated FOB prices to determine CIF Brazil values. The resulting prices are an
average of 20% below the levels which prevailed in 1974, when a worldwide
shortage of steel pressured international prices for steel products to an all-
time high. More recently, with the world-wide slowdown in economic activity,
international steel prices have begun to decline. In the long term, there is
little risk that international prices will remain below the levels listed
below, which values (in 1975 US$) have been used to determine the benefit stream
for the economic rate of return:
Long-term Projected International Steel Prices (CIF Brazil)
Product Group                         Price (US.$ 1975)

/1 A Shadow-price factor for foreign exchange of 1.2 has been estimated for
Brazil by Professor Edmar Bacha (Dean of the Department of Economics,
University of Brasilia); see Ednar L. Bacha, "Estudio de casos concretos en la
estimacion de parametros nacionales en paises de desarrollo", El uso de criterios
socio-economicos en la evaluacion de proyectos, ed Omar Botero-Paramo and Hugh
Schwqartz (Washington, D.C.:  Departamento de Desarrollo Economico y Social--BID,
