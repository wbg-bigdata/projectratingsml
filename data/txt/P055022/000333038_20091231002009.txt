F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were: (i) increased average farm income in
project area; (ii) increased level and efficacy of Operation and Maintenance (O&M)




                                                   ii
activities; and (iii) promotion of community driven development (CDD) in the irrigation
sub-sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Additional Financing aimed at scaling up activities of the Institutional Development
component of the on-going Irrigation Development Project. No changes in the Project
Development Objective, design, or scope are envisaged. Some changes are clearly
expected at the outcome level.

conveyance irrigation systems that were highly deteriorated. The delivery system was inadequate
to the new post-socialist reality: on-farm systems designed to service large state farms (50 to 400
ha) from a single head structure had to service 300 or more small farms with an average size of
1.38 ha. Three main issues required urgent attention: (i) the high cost of water delivery resulting
from heavy reliance on energy intensive pumping led to high subsidies and put into question the
viability of i rrigated a griculture; ( ii) t he l ack of a n e ffective c ost r ecovery pol icy a nd of a n
operational mechanism for adequate funding and timely execution of Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) activities led to continuous deterioration of the infrastructure; and (iii) the lack of clarity
in the allocation of responsibilities and guidelines for accountability prevented water users from
participation in th e ma nagement o f th e ir rigation s ystem and r esulted i n w asteful ir rigation
practices and a high rate of water losses at all levels.

and restructuring of the Irrigation and Drainage (I&D) systems in Armenia. At preparation it was

   The first phase of this long-term program consisted of emergency interventions to secure continuity of system operation, along
with pilot/demonstration activities to develop a practical methodology for improving system management. Implementation was
initiated u nder the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project ( IRP), w ith f inancial s upport from I DA and International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD). It was followed by the IFAD-supported North West Agricultural Services Project (NWASP)
and t he I DA-supported D am S afety P roject ( DSP), w hich w as ex pected t o conclude t he emergency i ntervention p hase. The
second phase of the long-term program was expected to be the restructuring and development phase. It would focus on building a
solid basis for system sustainability through physical upgrading of the infrastructure and empowerment of stakeholders to prevent
its deterioration.

the s econd o f w hich ( including t he D rainage component a nd about h alf of t he C onversion
Schemes component of t he original WSDP) was postponed and its preparation planned to start
during the third year of IDP implementation. Selection of activities to be financed under IDP was
made on the basis of an agreed approach: the IDP would support efforts to address both physical
and i nstitutional i rrigation s ector de ficiencies i n a br oader a nd i ntegrated m anner, given t hat

equal importance as support for the needed physical rehabilitation works.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
         The IDP's original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to contribute to enhancing
the p rofitability and s ustainability o f i rrigated a griculture. It aimed at p roviding th e b asis f or
stabilizing irrigated agriculture as a predominant source of productive employment, thus helping
to prevent economically and socially unjustified rural/urban migration. This objective was to be
achieved primarily through rehabilitation works and a set of institutional reforms and incentives
tailored to motivate water users to participate in the management of the irrigation system, and to
facilitate the establishment of stakeholder-based incentives for improved O&M of the irrigation
infrastructure. T he P DO i ncluded: ( i) i ncreased av erage f arm i ncome i n p roject ar ea; ( ii)
increased level and efficacy of O&M activities; and (iii) community driven development (CDD)
in the irrigation sub-sector.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
        No changes in the PDO or design were introduced during implementation. However,
given the satisfactory implementation of the project, in 2007 the GOA requested the Bank to
support the scaling up some of the IDP activities aimed at supporting Water Users Associations
(WUAs), and some project scope expansions at the original outcome level. For this reason (i) an
Additional Financing (AF) in the amount of US$5.0 million equivalent was approved (effective
on January 18, 2008); and (ii) a two year extension of the closing date (until March 31, 2009) for
implementing the enlarged outcome agreed upon. IDP support was then continued through the
grant program for the rehabilitation of additional tertiary systems not foreseen at appraisal;
alongside support for annual audits of the WUAs, and limited training and technical assistance.
        The IDP PDO indicators, some of which were revised during implementation, were kept
for the AF. The percentage of irrigated hectares cultivated with high value-added crops was
expected to increase from 71 percent in 2006 to 78 percent in 2008, and cost recovery3 would
rise from 42 percent to 60 percent. Changes in the Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) for
the AF included: (i) electricity consumed per hectare was removed due to the potential influence
of other factors; (ii) area under irrigation would increase from 128,600 to 130,4004; (iii) the
number of WUAs was eliminated as it was surpassed early in the IDP implementation,
incorporating the number of communities involved, which was expected to reach 115 by 2008.
IOIs tracked under the IDP that would continue to be considered for AF included: (i) the level of
farmer satisfaction with water user services to be derived from social surveys; and (ii) the
efficiency of water distribution among water users, expected to increase as a result of the new
project's rehabilitation activities.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
        The primary project beneficiaries were about 30,000 rural households who were expected
to increase the productivity of and the income derived from their 40,000 ha irrigated agriculture,
directly as a result of project interventions. In addition, about 5,000 rural households depending
on c ostly and unr eliable pum p i rrigation w ould be a ble t o c ontinue t o pr actice i rrigated
agriculture instead of either, shifting to very low productivity rain-fed agriculture, or migrating
to urban areas in search of employment. The project would also directly benefit the institutions
involved i n t he m anagement of t he i rrigation s ystem i n t he c ontext of P IM as us ers'
organizations would develop both technical and management capabilities and acquire a healthy
degree of financial autonomy. Finally, the project would contribute to lowering the burden on the

  Reliable estimates of O&M needs were made in 2003-04 by a technical commission, based on an investigation financed under
IDP. Needs at about 8 billion drams were much beyond original expectations due to the deteriorated state of much of the system.
Hence, in 2005 the cost-recovery target of 47 percent was formally revised for the IDP.
4
  The target for the original project for the year 2006 was set at 132,000 ha. However, experience during implementation showed
that there are two parallel on-going processes: on one hand, the number of hectares cultivated and irrigated is increasing, and on
the other hand, farmers are switching to cultivation of higher value crops and cannot always afford (financially and/or in terms of
manpower) to do this on their total land plot and leave part of it uncultivated for one or a few seasons.


                                                                3

1.5 Original Components
         The pr oject pr oposed a f ive-year pr ogram a imed a t c reating i nstitutional s tructures,
capabilities and procedures for PIM of the I&D system. It would complete the rehabilitation of

IDA credit was US$24.9 million. It was organized in four components. The first one focused on
keeping the conveyance system operational; the second, aimed on reducing the energy intensity,
and t hus t he c ost, o f t he w ater de livery s ystem; t he t hird one , a ddressed t he i nstitutional

while t he f ourth c omponent pr ovided for p roject management. R esources allocated t o t he IDP
would be managed by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the State Committee for Water
Management ( SCWM). B eneficiaries w ould c ontribute a n a verage of 36 percent of t he cost of
civil rehabilitation works (a minimum 30 percent) and 20 percent of the cost of equipment. GOA
would contribute 16 percent of costs.
         Component 1: Rehabilitation of Critical Irrigation Infrastructure (US$4.33 million
including contingencies). It aimed at correcting essential and important deficiencies in priority
sections of the I&D system following completion of the IRP. This included further rehabilitation
of infrastructure that was severely deteriorated due to delayed repair and maintenance over an
extended period of time. It also included some significant physical I&D system improvements
that, among other benefits, would lead to major reductions in O&M burdens and costs.
         Component 2: Conversion from Pump to Gravity Irrigation (US$13.9 million including
contingencies). This component aimed at reducing the reliance on high-cost energy-intensive
irrigation by supporting the conversion of pumped irrigation schemes to gravity irrigation
schemes in those cases where clear technical and economic viability had been demonstrated.
         Component 3: Institutional Development (US$9.65 million including contingencies).
Based on the outcome of an institutional audit of the O&M function made during project
preparation, the previous five agencies involved in O&M were to be restructured and
strengthened under the project to allow for the effective introduction of PIM. In that framework,
responsibility and accountability for O&M would be clearly allocated between the remaining two
types of public agencies: (i) a permanent Water Supply Agency (WSA) and the temporary
Drainage and Irrigation Management Agencies (DIMAs); and (ii) the WUAs which would
operate as partners in the management of the I&D system. A funding mechanism along with
appropriate operational procedures were also to be put in place to ensure that management of the
system would be participatory and cost effective. This included the creation of two matching
grant schemes (one for equipment and the other for rehabilitation) and provision for Technical
Assistance (TA) and training to WUAs and the WSA. The command area whose management
was expected to be transferred to farming communities through WUAs in the original design was
40,000 hectares.
         Component 4: Project management (US$1.77 million including contingencies).
Allocation for this component took into consideration that the PIU was already established and
managing the Dam Safety Project (DSP) implementation, but also that the PIU would assume the

                                                     4
responsibility for design and supervision of the quite simple rehabilitation and minor
improvement proposals of WUAs to be formulated under the support of the Institutional
Development component.

1.7     Other significant changes
        In December 2005 the credit agreement was amended setting lower targets for cost-
recovery of the O&M costs. This responded to the fact that these targets proved to be unrealistic
given the bad state of the structures and to allow for the necessary time for WUAs to adopt the
new cost sharing procedures. The minimum required percentage of O&M costs of the irrigation
infrastructure to be recovered through water charges was then decreased from 33, 44, 56, 70 and
85 percent by end of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively, to 13, 30, 38, and 46 percent
by the end of 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. Also the required contribution amount
from WUAs for equipment and rehabilitation grant schemes was reduced from 30 to 15 percent.
        Additional Financing in the amount of US$5.0 million equivalent (SDR3.3 million) for
the IDP was approved by the Board on July 31, 2007 aiming at scaling up activities under the
existing PDO, design and scope. Support to WUAs would continue through the grant program
for the: (i) rehabilitation of tertiary systems (US$4.55 million ­ 91 percent); (ii) annual audits of
the WUAs; and (iii) limited training and technical assistance (US$0.45 million). The AF would
partially cover the surplus demand from actual proposals (37) from WUAs that were prepared for
co-financing but could not be funded with the original credit due to a lack of resources. The
implementation arrangements for rehabilitating tertiary systems under WUA management would
be the same as those successfully tested under the IDP.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
         Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was not subject to a Quality at Entry
Review (QER) or to a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessment. Project objectives were
consistent with the 2001 CAS objectives and targets that specifically indicated: (i) improving
rural services; (ii) 20 percent increase in WUAs receiving at least 5,000 cubic meters of irrigation
water per hectare; and (iii) cost recovery in irrigation water supply increases by 25 percent.

PDO, a nd t he a llocation of t he r esources t o t he pr oject c omponents w as r ealistic a nd
commensurate for t he s tated ne eds. The d esign was pertinent and bui lt also on l essons l earned
from the Bank supported program in Armenia. It put an importance to institutional development
as a prerequisite for achieving efficiency and sustainability in the development and management
of I&D systems. In particular it made clear that: (i) weak public sector agencies with overlapping
allocation of r esponsibilities, l imited a uthority, a nd i nadequate r esources to w ork w ith, us ually
fail in e ffectively ma naging th e ir rigation s ystem a nd in p reventing its d eterioration; ( ii) w ater

approach was necessary for enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the systems.
         The project design reflected that in order to benefit from this approach, action should be
taken on the following fronts: (i) responsibility for O&M had to be clearly allocated between the
new s limmer G overnment a gencies and t he WUAs; ( ii) publ ic a gencies ha d t o be h eld
accountable for assuming that part of the responsibility allocated to Government and should be
given the resources and the authority to credibly assume that responsibility; (iii) their role should
be pr imarily t o m anage t he O &M of he adworks a nd t he t ransfer pr ocess of O &M of ot her
structures to WUAs, with any construction activities contracted out to the private sector; (iv) the

participate in an intensive skill training program to acquire the technical and management skills
that would allow them to work as partners in the management of the irrigation systems.
2.2 Implementation
         The first months of implementation showed a dynamic start of the infrastructural part of
the project and a slow advance of the institutional part. This was also due to the fact that many
activities foreseen under the institutional part had disbursement conditions that took several
months to be met. By March 2003, fifteen months from project effectiveness, disbursements
amounted to US$4.3 million, 17 percent of the credit amount and in line with original plan.
Components 1 and 2 were performing well: six out of nine civil works contracts expected to be
signed under these two components had civil works started. Yet the third component was
proceeding slower than foreseen in the process of reforming the public irrigation agencies.
         During the following twelve months the first two components continued performing well,
and the third one began to improve. Corrective actions agreed with the Bank missions focused on
accelerating transfer of management of irrigation infrastructure to WUAs from the DIMAs, but
the strengthening/restructuring of the public agencies, advances remained behind schedule. By
April 2004, all thirteen DIMAs were liquidated and 52 WUAs covering almost the whole
irrigated area in Armenia took over the system, concluding the process started one year before.
Management of all secondary and tertiary canals together with some primary canals and other
irrigation structures (small dams and pumping stations) were passed to WUAs.
         At the time of the Mid Term Review (MTR) mission ­ January 2005, disbursements of
credit proceeds amounted to 45 percent of the total credit. With the exception of the matching
grant scheme for rehabilitation and improvement of canals that was just starting disbursement, all
activities were on schedule or ahead of schedule, and unit costs were below budgets. Component
1 and 2 were performing more than satisfactory while component 4 was rated satisfactory.
Component 3 was showing consistent progress on the WUAs side and delays on the
strengthening/restructuring of the main public agencies. The rehabilitation grant scheme financed
about US$7.2 million for rehabilitation of tertiary canals under WUAs' management with about
eighty-five percent financed with the credit proceeds and 15 percent by the WUAs as counterpart
funding. Improvement and strengthening of the WSA dealing with head works, despite its
smaller size, was below expectations. This was partially due to the fact that the project design did
not spell out clearly the actions to be taken under the project and to the fact that WSA was not
able to produce evidence of its activities and prepare a business plan as advised by Bank. Despite
the overall progress made at the MTR, it became clear that the 56 percent cost-recovery target of

                                                     6
O&M costs for 2004 would not be met since collections were covering only about 30 percent of
the needed O&M expenses.
         By September 2005, one and a half year ahead of closing date, all activities foreseen
under component 1 had been completed and component 2 was also far ahead of schedule. It was
then decided that some changes on the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were necessary,
including: (i) better description of roles and tasks of WUAs versus those of the Water User
Federations (WUFs); (ii) better description of components 3 and 4; (iii) a revision of counterpart
financing due from the WUAs in the rehabilitation program and the equipment grant scheme to
be lowered from 30 percent to 15 percent; (iv) a review of cost recovery targets for the whole
irrigation infrastructure system; (v) inclusion of audit costs under Consulting service
disbursement category, and extension of eligibility of 20 percent of PIU operational expenditures
till the end of Project (instead of December 31, 2005); (vi) a reallocation of credit proceeds
among the disbursement categories; and (vii) changes of aggregate amounts for the project
procurement methods. The rationale behind the change concerning WUAs counterpart financing
was low demand for rehabilitation activities under the grant scheme and the need to enhance the
WUAs strengthening process. The review of the cost-recovery target was done considering that it
was originally overestimated, probably because originally referred to cost recovery targets for
the public agencies alone.
         In January 2007, two months before the closing date, the GOA expressed interest in
expanding the Bank's involvement in the I&D sub-sector. It requested the Bank to continue its
overall advice on the ongoing institutional reform of the sub-sector and provide limited financial
resources for: (i) extending the IDP's grant scheme for rehabilitating tertiary canals under the
management of WUAs for which the demand was exceeding the available resources, and (ii)
some additional training activities targeting WUAs' personnel. On the basis of this request,
preparation work and a pre-appraisal mission were carried out immediately. Given the similarity
with the activities already implemented under IDP, and as no controversial issues were raised,
the AF (US$5 million) was then approved.
         The second phase of the long-term program for the I&D sector in Armenia foresaw the
IDP I as a Stage I of the restructuring and development phase with a focus on building a solid
basis for system sustainability through further rehabilitation of critical structures, reduction of
energy usage in the system and empowerment of stakeholders in carrying on O&M of the
system. IDP I was intended to be followed by a Stage II project ­ IDP II. However, in
consultation with the Government and other donors, IDA decided not to proceed with the Stage
II project, because other sources of support had materialized, in particular the U.S. Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC), which signed a compact with the GOA, to provide about US$100
million for irrigation works. The Bank provided bridge support from limited Bank/IDA
assistance as an AF while the activities of MCC were getting underway, in particular to ensure
no loss of momentum in support of the WUAs.
2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design and implementation was a weak spot of the
project PIU until MTR. Part of the problem was linked to the lack of M&E specialists within the
early PIU team5. The problem was solved after defining adequate guidelines to be used, and the

5
 The project design gave little guidance on how to monitor income and employment targets. Both were also strongly influenced
by changes in relative prices, and by the emigration attraction to countries offering better job opportunities than in rural Armenia.


                                                                 7
hiring of specialists by September 2005. Several M&E indicators for the Project have been
changed since some indicators as originally set in the PAD didn't take into account the changes
occurring in the process of the institutional reform implementation and/or were impossible to
measure. By the end of 2005, a new M&E scheme to follow and new indicators to measure and
evaluate the Project activities were agreed upon. Three main types of indicators selected to
measure the success of the project were: (i) technical: number of ha irrigated, maintenance
expenses of WUAs per 1 cubic meter delivered to a field, efficiency in water distribution within
WUAs' infrastructure, electricity consumed per ha; (ii) financial: cost recovery rate; and (iii)
social: percentage of farmers satisfied by irrigation water supply services, level of awareness of
water users about WUAs, participation of water users in WUAs' activities, reduction in number
of conflicts between WUAs and water users. With the new set of indicators it would also be
easier to measure ­ at completion ­ the IDP impact on income and employment.
         A highly remarkable achievement of the PIU M&E team was the development of a
comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) interfaced database that allows for
monitoring the irrigation sector including areas cultivated, water volumes, losses, energy
consumption for pumping, and cropping patterns as well as fee collections and financial situation
of WUAs. The database uses cadastre records and maps as the basis from which then several
variables can be overlaid. The system allows for data analysis from the project or district level to
WUA, the community, all the way to the individual farmer. Reporting can be generated on
financials, crop areas and types, water plans and deliveries from main intake down to the gates at
the field level. Data are entered on a seasonal basis by WUA officers at the beginning of the
irrigation season as a yearly baseline. The data is then updated regularly throughout the season
reflecting water use relative to original plans, collection of fees and cropping patterns. The
system is being used by WUAs as a reference instrument to help them identify plots which are
not cultivated, irrigated but not reported, and any other irregularity related to land and water use,
and for planning & reporting.
         The system installation WUAs offices is highly appreciated by WUAs as a management
tool that enforces transparency in resource allocation and fee collection, and helps in settling
disputes related to water deliveries and tracking payments. Under the project, WUAs were
equipped with computers able to handle the database, while training to the user of the system at
the WUA is part of the installation package. The system is currently installed in some 20 WUAs
and covers about 80,952 ha or roughly 63.2 percent of the total irrigated area. The cost of
installation of the system is born by WUAs themselves at US$3,000 per installation. This sum
pays mainly for the cost of obtaining land records and cadastre maps which form part of the
baseline for the GIS based system. The installation of a data system has increased farmer trust in
the management of the irrigation system, enforcing accountability of WUA management.
         Many key indicators about the irrigation sub-sector that in previous years were guest-
estimated or ever changed depending on the source interviewed, even within the same old
irrigation agency, are now well known. IDP collection of WUAs data created a sound basis for
analysis and strategy building. The most important data monitored by the PIU ­ considering all
operating WUAs and the whole irrigated area in Armenia can be summarized as follows:

Source: GIS based data system
         The system provides for an effective real time monitoring of key variables of irrigation
efficiency and effectiveness and the basis to generate data that will eventually help develop
irrigation recommendations depending on weather patterns, and help forecast short term peaks in
demand for electricity in the sector. At present the system does not have the ability to provide
summarized reports responding to specific queries; data can only be queried at the level of the
individual WUA. These reporting capabilities are being developed as the system is being
implemented nationwide. With completion of the installation of the system, Armenia will have a
comprehensive irrigation monitoring system in place that that very few countries have, will help
in taking policy decisions, and would be instrumental for maximizing the economic returns from
the investments made in irrigation infrastructure.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
         The project showed no unresolved fiduciary, environmental or any other safeguard
problems7. The IDP activities did not involve any exceptions to Bank policies. The rehabilitation
of tertiary channels did not affect new areas or expand existing infrastructure. As required under
the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a hydrological-environmental investigation was
completed in March, 2006. Its implementation lasted for two years as sampling and observation
had to be conducted during an extended period for identifying any environmental-hydrological
impact generated by expansion of Araks intake financed under the project. The investigations
conducted by a consultant proved that rehabilitation of the intake did not affect negatively the
hydro-ecological state of the river.
         The original EMP prepared for the IDP has been revised slightly in 2007 to describe
mitigation methods and monitoring activities for the proposed civil works to be implemented
under the AF. The revised EMP was publicly disclosed in the local newspaper "Hayastani
Hanrapetutyun" on April 28, 2007 thus meeting IDA's operational policy on public disclosure.
This EMP was prepared in such a manner that environmental requirements (mitigation measures,
monitoring and technical specifications) related to the construction phase could be incorporated
in the bidding/contract documents. The EMP was implemented and monitored during the
construction phase by the contractor, the WUA representatives, and the PIU.
         Overall, the PIU's internal controls system was capable of providing timely information
and reporting on the projects. The quarterly reports on all the PIU implemented projects have
always been received on time and were found to be satisfactory to IDA. The PIU's auditing
arrangements and findings have been consistently satisfactory. No significant issues have arisen
in the audits of other IDA-financed projects implemented by the PIU. The significant strengths
that provided the basis for reliance on the project financial management system included: (i)

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
         The 2009 World Bank supported Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with Armenia,
provides the framework guiding the Bank's assistance for 2009-2012. Prepared at a time when
Armenia is being rocked by the global economic crisis8, the Strategy design reflects the context
of the global economic crisis and intends to resume growth and reduce the impacts of the crisis
on the poor. It also aims to help lay the foundation for a more competitive economy--a key
requirement for diversified and sustainable growth9. While much has been achieved in the
irrigation sub-sector of Armenia, the needs for irrigation rehabilitation investments remain
important. In addition, the need for short-term employment stimulation in the conditions of
economic crisis have contributed to emphasize attention to the I&D sector again. Consequently,
GOA has asked the World Bank for further assistance in the rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure,
which was included in the CPS.
         The new Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project is aimed at: (i) improving water use
efficiency in two selected irrigation schemes; and (ii) fostering immediate rural employment.
These objectives will be achieved by rehabilitating irrigation canals to reduce water losses in two
selected schemes, and at the same time by providing some limited assistance to strengthen
institutions managing the irrigation infrastructure. The project also will help to pilot a Federation
of WUAs as a next step in the institutional development process.
         The Bank had been proactive since the fall of the FSU and continues to help the GOA in
developing a future vision for the sector and water resource management in general. Specific
points touched during the discussions include: (i) water resources regulatory function; (ii)
legislative and regulatory framework for surface and groundwater usage; (iii) basic principles of
a water rights system; (iv) water modeling methodology linked to creation of flood forecasting
and water monitoring services; (v) analysis and definition of subsidy and tariff policies for
irrigation; (vi) restructuring of the WSAs; (vii) identification and diversification of support
activities for small WUAs; (viii) promotion of WUAs federations; (ix) establishment of a
drainage board; (x) rehabilitation of the Vorotan Arpa-Sevan inter-basin system; (xi)
interventions on Araks river banks; and (xii) rehabilitation and/or construction of water control
mechanisms or levees particularly if under WUAs management.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
       The IDP objectives and design approved in August 2001, as well as those of the AF
approved in July 2007, are fully consistent with the current country's development priorities and
circumstances and with the Bank's country and sectoral assistance strategies. The 2004 CAS was

    CPS estimated economic contraction was projected to be 8 percent in 2009 and a further 2 percent in 2010.
9
  The third results area expected from the CPS aims at "rural and environmental risks decrease" and the outcomes would be: (i)
further rises of irrigated acreage as institutions for water management are developed; (ii) increased rural output and employment;
and (iii) an impact on the rural economy to enhancing export and growth prospects.


                                                                10
designed to support Armenia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP), which placed major
emphasis on reducing rural poverty. The AF approach of scaling up the IDP was specifically
discussed in the CAS Progress Report reviewed by the Board on March 2007. The IDP was also
consistent with both of the two strategic themes of the 2009 CPS, namely "addressing
vulnerability", and "competitiveness and growth". The IDP outcomes are directly linked with the
declared CPS following outcomes: "area returned to irrigation increases as a result of
rehabilitation" and "rural output and employment are supported". The current CPS also
specifically states that: "there is a need to complete priority irrigation works to minimize water
losses and strengthen the capacity of less experienced WUAs."
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
         The IDP has been the primary force for policy, institutional, and technical improvements
in the Armenia's I&D sector, as recognized by both the government and all interested donors.
The Government had roll out the IDP pilot WUAs nationwide, and so the number of WUAs was
not just the targeted 8-10, but 54 covering all irrigated land in Armenia. WUAs took over 17,969
km of tertiary canals with respective structures and 728 tube wells for operation. The attention of
the IDP implementation has centered on; (a) introducing PIM practices; and (b) returning a larger
amount of land to irrigation. Both policies are still pertinent and valid. There is some anecdotal
evidence of crop yields increasing and a trend towards increasing higher value crop
diversification (GIS tracked). The current arrangements of transferring managing responsibility
for irrigation water supply services to WUAs has resulted in an increased economic self-
sufficiency (the cost recovery rate is 80 to 90 percent in most gravity based systems for the
WUAs system and 45.2 percent for the whole irrigation system). About 80 percent of surveyed
farmers declared to be satisfied with the current water supply services and arrangements. The
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) ratings from the project's start until closing have
always been adequately rated as "satisfactory" for both Implementation Progress (IP) and
Development Objectives (DOs).
         The IDP has been a fully successful project that helped in transforming the I&D sector
turning around the deterioration tendency and starting the recovery of the irrigation area, and
supporting community involvement in O&M of the I&D structures and its management. More
regular and predictable water flows have increased crop yields and provided the enabling
environment for moving cropping patterns towards higher value crops, leading to the outstanding
increase of farm income and employment. Some of the foreseen PAD outputs and others added
during implementation are explained below and expanded in Annex 2. Key measures of results
include: (i) the beneficiary households' income increases, averaging 30 percent, reaching the
target and covering 128,860 ha (tripling the targeted 40,000 ha); (ii) number of WUAs
established: 54 instead of targeted 8 ­ 10 (570 percent of the target); (iii) the number of hectares
irrigated (from 112,300 ha to 128,860 ha); (iv) the cost-recovery rate of O&M expenses (45.2
percent, about 75 percent of the revised target of 60 percent, while it was 8 percent in 2000); and
(v) the amount of reduction in energy (valued at US$3.4 million annually), and costs and water
losses (beyond expectations).
         Regarding the cost recovery rate target, the PAD set an overly ambitious mark (100
percent) that very few countries are able to achieve in this sector and did not consider the
dilapidated situation of much of the country's irrigation infrastructure at the start of the project.
The 2005 revision to a more realistic cost recovery target: from 8 percent to 47 percent by the


                                                 11
end of the project, is considered sound. An overall rate of 45 percent had been achieved by
200810. This positive achievement stems from the facts that irrigation water fees collections from
users were increasing steadily, and that financial costs of O&M went down from 8.7 billion
drams in 2004 to about 7.8 billion drams in 2008, mainly due to the decrease in used energy.
Collected water charges went up from about 700,000 drams in 2003 to 3.44 billion drams in
2008, and the on-going Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project (IREP) emergency financing
will provide more time to improve further this achievement.
        Some of the outcome indicators have shifted significantly over the implementation period
in recognition of better understanding of the systems, evolving events, realism, and the need for
measurement. The most significant ones and how they have shifted over time are as follows:
    · Increase in irrigated area. The i ncrease i n i rrigated l and w as not a n or iginal e xplicit
    target, a nd t he qua ntity of i rrigated l and w as heavily ove restimated a t IDP a ppraisal a t

    time t o m ake a pr ecise calculation of t he i rrigated l and i n A rmenia, w hich w as 112,300
    hectares. The AF set its irrigated area target at 132,000 ha . It has reached to 128,860 ha by
    the end of 2008.
     · Introduction of participatory approaches. The project originally sought to pilot about 8-
     10 Water User Associations for a total of 40,000 hectares. However, after the project began,
     the G overnment de cided t o r oll out t his a pproach na tionwide w ith a proper legal and
     regulatory framework, and 52 WUAs were established covering all irrigated area in Armenia.
     The IDP th us e xceeded b y 3 time s th is s pecific in stitution-building o bjective f oreseen a t
     appraisal.
     · Reduction in energy used and water losses. The project set a target to reduce 16 percent
     the energy consumption by converting 7,300 ha from a pump to gravity systems and to save
     60 million cubic meters of water loss per annum. These targets have remained unchanged
     and have been met. The amount of energy usage saved is about 50.9 million KWh per year
     (48 through construction of conversion schemes and 2.9 through rehabilitation works), in line
     with original project objectives. At a current economic value of US 6.6 cents per KWh, this
     feature alone provides US$3.4 million in annual benefits to the Armenian economy. The
     amount of estimated reduction in water losses is about 65 million cubic meters per annum.
     · Improvement in cost-recovery rate of O&M expenses of the system. At the time of
     appraisal, the public water agency was having about an 8 percent cost recovery rate. The
     goal of full cost-recovery by the end of the project in 2007 proved to be unrealistic as the
     needs for O&M of the system were not well understood. More reliable estimates of O&M
     needs were made in 2003-04: at about 8 billion drams, the needs were much beyond original
     assumptions, due to the deteriorated state of much of the system. The new cost-recovery
     target of 47 percent formally agreed in 2005 was set by the AF at 60 percent. By 2008, the
     cost-recovery rate was 45.2 percent and is expected to improve by the end of 2009. Irrigation

     million AMD in 2004 to 3,443 million in 2008).
3.3. Efficiency
        Separate economic analysis was done at project preparation for each component and,
within each component, for each of the discrete IDP interventions. At project level, all economic
benefits and costs were added in the PAD, resulting in an overall Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) of 24.8 percent, and a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$17.1 million. The financial
analysis showed that the potential average net farm income derived from irrigated agriculture
ranged from US$400 to US$1,000 per ha in the with project scenario, compared to between
US$0 (where no rain-fed cropping was possible) and US$200 (where rain-fed cropping was
possible) in the without the project. Farm incomes would typically increase by at least 30-40
percent.
        At completion, the overall ERR of the project was estimated at 43.5%. Using a discount
rate of 12 percent, the NPV is AMD 45,5 billion (US$122.3 million), about 715 percent of the ex
ante estimation. These results, even though outstanding, are still considered to be a cautious
estimate since the improvements achieved in 2008 are expected to be increased (but were not
quantified), as the development process has just started under the leadership of the WUAs, with
full support of the GOA. Benefit estimates were mainly derived from: (i) the 13.7 percent
expansion of the irrigated areas; (ii) the production activities diversification towards higher value
crops (vegetables, grapes and orchards grew from 38 to 50 percent of the irrigated area) away
from extensive crops; and (iii) a 10 to 15percent increase in crop yields stemming from the
improved availability of water for irrigation. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in
Annex 3.
        The IDP improvements have resulted in higher net value of production per unit of water
used for irrigation. Between 2004 and 2008, the water productivity has grown by about 49
percent11. This indicator was measured by the net economic value of production divided by the
quantity of irrigation water used for production in both scenarios, with and without project. This
productivity gains are critical for sustaining the subsidy reduction process to which the GOA is
committed.
        Financial Results at the farm level were also analyzed in both scenarios using FARMOD
software and show the expected results in typical farms of homogeneous Zones A, C and D.
Results are summarized in Annex 3. It is expected that typical farms have been given the
potential to almost double - on average - their net family income, depending on the farm size and
location of the family plots and cropping pattern.
        Sustainability of project benefits is expected to be high, given that the increase in water
availability, and in use efficiencies, together with the consolidation of the PIM approach
introduced by the IDP, will continue to reinforce the efficiency gains of the overall irrigation
systems. The strong dynamic attitude shown by WUAs assuming the O&M of the irrigation
infrastructure is already having a significant effect on the water service delivery and, as a
consequence, on farmers' satisfaction level with the new arrangements and water delivered.

11
   Water productivity gains are also underestimated since the productivity estimation is based on the water entering at the farm
level. H ence, t he I DP i mprovements i n t he water d istribution s ystem ( head, primary, s econdary and t ertiary) which w ere
significant, allowing for more water to reach farms, were not included.


                                                               13
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
         Rating: Satisfactory
         The government has successfully begun to reverse the deterioration of the I&D systems
and has established an improved sector policy, as well as an institutional and financial
framework. Farmers have increased their income by about 30 percent and are expected to grow
further once investments in the new crops mature. Employment in the sector and productivity of
water has grown also by about 50 percent. The overall ERR of the project has been estimated at
43.5 percent. Although there is still a need to complete priority irrigation works to rehabilitate
irrigation areas to minimize water losses, and to strengthen the capacity of less experienced
WUAs and creating Federations of WUAs (FWUAs), WUAs now cover all irrigated land and is
taking the lead of the process. Increased reliability and greater transparency of the irrigation
management combined with improved customer satisfaction have also made it possible to
increase the water fees to 9 AMD per cubic meter. In mainly gravity supplied systems this rate
is getting very close to full cost recovery that was estimated to be in the vicinity of 10.5 AMD
per cubic meter at the time of project appraisal.
         Only in the largely pumped systems, the current water price represent about half cost
recovery assuming the full cost of electricity. Even though overall revenues remain at only 45 -
50 percent of full cost-recovery levels and only 70 percent of irrigable land is irrigated, a
sustainable ground has been created for a highly participatory development process with high
probability of being irreversible. The reform path was validated and will be increasingly
important for development if Armenia continues to be successfully addressing a favorable
climate for the private sector in the future. The on-going challenge is to make WUAs fully
sustainable and continue the reform process by establishing WUFs to take over upper parts of the
I&D systems. Benefits exceed the simple investment in infrastructure and spills over into
capacity building and sustainability.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
        In the early 1990s, people migrated to rural areas in search of ways for coping with the
economic difficulties after the FSU collapse. IDP increases in agricultural productivity and
incomes, is helping to reduce poverty significantly as it creates conditions for duplicating family
income in rural irrigated farms as shown by the typical farm modeling presented in Annex 3.
After 2001, growth in agriculture picked up along with the overall the economy: between 2001
and 2006 agriculture grew at 7.6 percent per annum on average, driven by productivity gains in
irrigated areas, jointly with improved terms of trade, which also helped raise rural incomes.
Productivity gains in the rural areas are the result of sustained efforts to ease constraints to
production and investment.
        All financed under IDP proposals for rehabilitation of tertiary canals have been approved
by the project created WUAs General Assemblies, therefore representing a fair and participatory
choice by the communities involved. The selected rehabilitation works led to strengthen the
human and social capital in rural areas mitigating constraints, as well as reducing conflicts and
social tension, stemming from better access to water for irrigation and from the PIM approach
adopted. It also built a strong basis for sustainable rural development which is highly relevant to
poverty reduction.



                                                14
         Increases in rural productivity and incomes practically eliminated absolute poverty in
rural areas. Poverty fell from around 56 percent in 1998 to about 35 percent in 2004 and further
declined to 25 percent in 2007. Extreme poverty declined even faster, from about 6.4 percent in
2004 to less than 4 percent in 2007; and the percentage of the very poor in the rural areas
dropped from 14.1 percent to 2.3 percent. These achievements are attributable partially to the
IDP, and also to the strong GOA reform efforts (improved business climate, increase in real
wages, private transfers from abroad, and rising social transfers). According to latest surveys,
the size of the areas that are not irrigated due to the lack of access to water has decreased
considerably, as well as the number of rural families, which believe that their key problem is the
lack of access to irrigation.
 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
         The establishment of 52 WUAs determined that all irrigated areas in Armenia are
currently under WUAs' management. Capacity building of WUAs included: (i) WUA
governance, (ii) financial management, (iii) water management, (iv) technical training; (v) O&M
planning and budgeting; (vi) legal issues; (vii) participation techniques; and (viii) conflict
resolution. Two tailored software for WUAs (accounting and water management) have been
developed and provided to WUAs and are now also equipped with a GIS based software
designed by the project to track field irrigation, cropping patterns, water quantities delivered at
field level and water fees. This data helps WUAs not only in being more effective in managing
the irrigation distribution but it also helps them spot more effectively undeclared irrigation, and a
better planning of the system.
         The consolidation of the responsibility for oversight over the irrigation infrastructure in
one organization, the WSA, was also crucial. The Government implemented a very important
additional improvement on March 2006 abolishing the central administration of the WSA and
transferring all water supply functions to four regional branches established on a regional basis.
The branches became separate legal entities and took the responsibility for O&M of respective
river basin's infrastructure and supply of irrigation water to WUAs of those areas. Currently, the
regional branches of the WSA are providing water to existing WUAs, and the introduction of
WUFs, will remove further responsibilities from WSA, reducing its sphere of action and easing
future efforts for its full restructuring. This is being addressed under the follow-up projects.
 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
         Since 2006, subsidies are been allocated directly and completely to WUAs on the basis of
a complex i ndicator t hat t akes i nto c onsideration t heir pl anned budge ts, pl anned us e of e nergy
and t echnical s tate of t he i nfrastructure unde r t heir m anagement. T his a voids c oncentration of
subsidies in particular parts of the irrigation system made on the basis of subjective decisions.
         The PIU has been an effective implementing and policy reform instrument for the
Government. It has conducted a participatory process that has been rolled over the whole
irrigation area in Armenia. It has developed a GIS-based Water Management Software (WMS)
that is an efficient instrument that facilitates water management by the WUA and the central
authorities, through the accounting and analysis of the following parameters: (i) water intake by
irrigation systems from water sources; (ii) water distribution at the levels of secondary and
tertiary canals; (iii) water users; (iv) signed agreements; (v) irrigated areas; (vi) area of each
crop; (vii) consumed electricity; (viii) volume of irrigation water actually delivered to water
users; (ix) actual irrigation water losses; (x) payments by water users and arrears; and (xi) water


                                                   15
user plans, electricity quotas, etc. As the software continues to be developed to comply with
increasing users and administrators requirements, new features are being continuously added,
constituting a major project achievement for the growing efficiency of the O&M of the irrigation
systems.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
        At the end of 2005 and 2006 social surveys among water users were carried out mainly to
learn about water users' satisfaction with irrigation water services and how they perceived the
new organizations that provide them with these services. The data received from the surveys was
used for the monitoring and evaluation purposes. A new social survey among water users was
conducted at project completion, including quantitative and qualitative data as well as lessons
learned and suggestions for future investments in the sector. This survey done in April 2009 and
its main findings are presented in Annex 5. A summary of the survey conclusions are:
        · The number of water users satisfied with irrigation water delivery has increased since
            2006 by 19.1 to 57 percent while those positively assessing WUAs performance have
            increased by 13.3 percent to 91.5 percent.
        · Collection rate for water fees was 70.4 percent in 2008, only 1.6 percent higher than
            in 2006; and those paying fees through Armenian Post Office increased from 11.2
            percent to 50.5 percent.
        · 17.7 percent of water users demanded water measurement at their farm intake, an
            increase of 16.9 percent compared with 2006.
        · Awareness among water users about WUAs activities increased by 16.5 percent to
            85.7 percent; while those cooperating with WUAs management increased by 26.4
            percent.
        · Users are well aware of their rights and responsibilities have increased by 30.7
            percent and 39 percent, to 44.9 percent and 58.2 percent respectively.
        · One of the most important achievements after establishment of WUAs is the number
            of water users that see positive changes in irrigation water supply. It increased from
            64.2 percent to 89.6 percent. Those that see significant improvement increased by
            26.7 percent.
        · 25 percent of water users were of the opinion that improved water delivery has
            supported expansion of cropped areas (8.7 percent more than in 2006); and
        · 61.9 percent see that positive changes in irrigation system supported shifts to high
            value crops, an increase of 15.5 percent in the last 2 years.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
R         ating: Moderate
         The risks to development outcome are considered to be moderate given the impact
already achieved. As has been happening in the years after rehabilitation of irrigation structures
under the management of the WUAs, users are responding positively to the more reliable
irrigation water delivery by increasing cropped areas, improving agricultural yields and moving
cropping patterns from extensive crops towards higher value crops. Overall, IDP has created
conditions to improve users' income and their capacity to pay for the improving delivery service.
There is an evident strong financial ground for WUAs to continue to improve the service and the
efficiency of the systems. The PIM approach is also empowering stakeholders to enhance the


                                               16
 relevance of the development efforts in rural agriculture which is complemented by the
 Government's continuous commitment to support a sector that has been showing its growing
 potential in the creation of wealth, exports, productive employment and poverty alleviation.
         However, a factor affecting negatively the WUAs is the Governmental decree (No.654-
 N) dated May 15, 2003, concerning the payment of "over normative" amounts of water, which
 instructed farmers cultivating over-normative water consumption land not to pay for excess
 water used on their plots. This created serious problems for the WUAs financial sustainability,
 since they have to pay for the bulk water received in excess but are not reimbursed from farmers.
 An alternative suggested by the Bank was that these farmers could receive subsidies as
 compensation so that they could pay to the WUAs.
         Another risk is linked to the possibility that WUAs could not motivate users to fully
 recover the O&M costs in pump based systems, as the amount of subsidies are reduced further.
 This risk is also modest provided the facts that: (i) water fees represent only 6 percent of the
 value of production, and a further increase by even 50 percent would represent less than 9
 percent of the value of production; (ii) all WUAs are improving the reliability of the water
 delivery system making the activity more profitable; (iii) WUAs are increasing their credibility;
 and (iv) there is a social control mechanism that is resulting in a growing rate of compliance with
 the water fees.
         Under the new IREP operation that will continue to support and follow-up on the sector
 reform and structure rehabilitation process, adequate mitigation measures are been put in place to
 ensure that the residual project risks are mitigated. Bank will continue to closely monitor
 performance during the IDP operational phase and during the implementation of the new
 operations.

recovery rate for the end of the project implementation period, which was too ambitious for the
existing state.
 (b) Quality of Supervision
         Rating: Satisfactory
         The Bank supervision team has had a proactive and permanent policy dialogue with
 Government authorities and was effective in finding powerful political allies for supporting the
 IDP led reform process. High ranked political officials have repeatedly expressed concern about
 different critical irrigation and water management issues and how would be addressed over
 coming years. They strongly valued Bank technical input and have been requiring continuation
 of Bank involvement even when the MCC program substituted the Bank as development partner


                                                      17
on irrigation issues. The team maintained continuous discussions about a medium to long term
agenda focused on institutional development and on a more sophisticated level of water
management issues.
        As part of its project supervision, IDA conducted risk-based financial management
exercises at appropriate intervals, supervising the project's financial management arrangements
by: (a) reviewing the project's quarterly Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) as well as the project's
annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter and remedial actions
recommended in the auditors; and (b) reviewing key areas (project internal control systems;
budgeting and financial planning arrangements; disbursement management and financial flows,
including counterpart funds, as applicable; and any incidences of corrupt practices involving
project resources). Coordination with other donors has been permanent, emerging mostly from
individual efforts but within the overall framework of the PRSP and Mid-Term Expenditures
Framework (MTEF) set by the Government. There has been close work with MCC in irrigation
and in the allocation of competitive grants to farmers.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory
        Overall, the Bank performance was effective in dealing with the project and government
program and sector priorities, and showed capacity and commitment in its interventions at
preparation and supervision work. It was proactive in designing investments, and in piloting
innovative techniques for introducing users participation in the water sector that were later scaled
up beyond targets, and covering the whole country. In addition, the Bank has carried out
coordination work and developed complementary operations in a timely manner for the irrigation
sector and these have also resulted in new Bank operations.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
         Rating: Satisfactory
         Government performance was in general effective and supportive. Legal and regulatory
issues identified during preparation were in general implemented and appropriate laws enacted,
together with establishing the necessary environment for project implementation. However,
during the first two years of implementation the Government showed slow commitment in the
process of reforming and downsizing the public irrigation agencies as agreed and planed under
the IDP institutional development component, shadowing in part the very positive achievements
of the project. The situation was later substantially improved as the temporary DIMAs were
liquidated and the transfer process to WUAs accelerated and expanded. In just one year the
tertiary structure that covered all irrigated areas in the country was transferred to WUAs, though
initially it was planned to be implemented on a pilot basis and only on 40,000 hectares. The
Government was also somehow slow in enforcing the collection of user fees to the levels
originally agreed. However, recognizing that these reforms are always difficult to deal with, the
Government performance is considered satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
      Rating: Satisfactory
      A strong local staff as well as effective PIUs have contributed to a well run program.
PIU was responsible for an exemplary implementation and management role that included the


                                                18
IDP and other projects, being instrumental for a successful sector policy reform process. It
conducted an outstanding PIM process centered on the rehabilitation of the I&D structures that
allowed for the improvement of the irrigated farming sector performance where most of the poor
live. The PIU has also managed to established a successful track record of effectiveness and
sound handling of fiduciary requirements. The financial management arrangements have been
reviewed periodically and found satisfactory: it had adequate and competent staff and a sound
accounting system. The PIU has been also positively assessed regarding its procurement
function. Its staff proved to be experienced with IDA procurement policies and procedures. The
civil works under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) tendering was processed jointly with
WUAs which was instrumental for empowering WUAs. When issues arose or were marked by
the supervision missions, they were readily considered and remedial action taken.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
       Rating: The Borrower's overall performance is rated Satisfactory
6. Lessons Learned
   ·   The IDP experience with the I&D sector in Armenia shows that deep reforms work well
       when there is strong commitment to reform overtime.
   ·   As was in the case of Mexico, IDP successfully used financing of rehabilitation works as
       a bargaining tool to promote transfers that were not very economically attractive to users
       given the dilapidated state of the systems and the chronic lack of funds for O&M.
   ·   Institutional arrangements giving more responsibility and say to farmers, engage the
       energy of the private sector, and reduce governments role. Emphasis on decentralization,
       financial viability and accountability of water services providers, empowerment through
       rights and responsibilities of water users and their organizations, always result in higher
       impact of I&D rehabilitation investments, sustainable transformations and dynamism.
   ·   Stakeholders active participation in the I&D investments and sector reform processes,
       and building capacity (organizational and managerial skills, and databases) in agricultural
       water projects has demonstrated, once again, that it derives in more satisfactory results.
   ·   With the transfer of responsibilities to users, the role of the public water agencies change
       to that of providing technical guidance (managerial, accounting, and financial advisory
       services); assisting with dispute resolution; and monitoring performance of associations.
   ·   Where market absorption exists, expansion and productivity increases through
       improvements of agricultural water management can strongly contribute to poverty
       alleviation in rural areas, were most poor live.
   ·   The effectiveness of the IDP PIU and its experience in the management of Bank projects
       (procurement, FM, disbursements etc.) have contributed to the satisfactory status of the
       project and high disbursement rates. It has also becomes an effective support unit
       (including on policy matters) for the line Ministry who at times relied on the PIU for
       work outside of Bank operations, taking into account staff professionalism and
       performance.
   ·   Institution building, such as those of WUAs is a long term process that often requires a
       time period longer than one project.
   ·   GIS based database allows for an effective M&E of agricultural water development,
       measuring the full range of benefits ­ economic, environmental and social. It is essential


                                                19
      not only to adapting current programs, but also to scaling up and complementary
      interventions. Key outcome indicators should also track production per unit of water use
      and overall water savings. Impact indicators should monitor incomes, poverty reduction,
      and system sustainability for management and planning the improvement of the systems.
    · Agricultural diversification creates opportunities for higher and more stable rural incomes
      through more efficient use of resources and the exploitation of comparative advantages.
      They usually require less water but reliability on its supply, that is often absent in poorly
      maintained systems. Rehabilitation usually comes along with diversification,
      opportunities for greater employment, higher incomes, and ultimately, more value added
      from water.
    · Improvement of I&D facilities is a prerequisite to crop diversification but should be
      complemented by other actions (modernization of marketing facilities, improved roads
      and communication services, extension, etc.) for sustainability of the new crop patterns.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
        In 2005, when MCC Armenia program was already outlined financially and technically,
it became obvious that it might continue the works initiated under IDP. More than three-fold
greater financing capabilities of MCC Program would ensure significant advancement in the
sector and solve many problems in the crucial process of making the system self-sustainable.
        However given the concerns about interruption of leading role of the World Bank in this
crucial process and delays and significant downsizing (activity-wise) in the implementation of
the MCC Program, without any depreciation of professional skills of MCC staff, the Bank has
reassumed the leading role with a new Emergency operation, continuing the successful
experience of the World Bank gained during dozens of years, and which has been introduced in
Armenia since 2001. It was the response to the evidence that the nature of financing
preconditions set by MCC together with price increase trends had reduced the resources foreseen
under MCC Program.

Rehabilitation of Canals and Conversion from Pump to Gravity (Components 1 and 2)
        Based on t he ICR t eam f ield vi sits i t ha s be en c oncluded t hat t hrough t he ph ysical
investments t he IDP a nd t he A F ha ve greatly improved t he l ife of a s ignificant num ber of
farmers in Armenia. In general, the following activities were implemented under the original IDP
project:
       ·   rehabilitation of 28.1 km of main and secondary canals;
       ·   increase of intake capacities from Araks River from 27 m3/s to 53 m3/s;
       ·   rehabilitation of 33 aqueducts and 34 siphons;
       ·   gravity irrigation on the area of 6,838;
       ·   construction of 214 km of tertiary irrigation system on the area of 15,300 ha.
         In addition ­ not foreseen at appraisal - 37 designs of tertiary irrigation systems were
realized with 20 WUAs under the AF as a result of which 103.5 km of irrigation canals were
rehabilitated improving water delivery and water distribution over the area of 9,862 ha, saving of
23.7 million cubic meters of water due to reduced seepage losses and less electricity
consumption (2.5 million KWh annually).
         Irrigation water supply is more timely and in enhanced quantities, resulting in a
significant increase in crop yields, irrigated areas; and in an overall increase in area sown/planted
with high value crops (20 - 30 percent from the baseline). Hence, it has significantly improved
the overall economic value of the irrigation infrastructure. With increased reliability and
benefits, farmers have also shown to be more willing to pay for irrigation services, and through
their involvement, incorporated sustainability, assuring an adequate O&M of the system.
Collection rates nationwide for 2008, was around 70 percent on invoices with some cases with
practically 100 percent recovery. Even the weakest WUAs where rehabilitation works are yet to
be undertaken, manage 50 percent collections. The increased reliability and greater transparency
of the irrigation management have also made it possible for WUAs to increase the water fees to 9
AMD per cubic meter. In mainly gravity supplied systems this rate is getting very close to full
cost recovery that was estimated to be in the vicinity of 10.5 AMD per cubic meter at the time of
project appraisal. However, in the largely pumped systems with high electricity costs, the
current water price still represents about half cost recovery when the full cost of electricity is
considered.
The irrigation system physical improvements helped to introduce financial sustainability into the
sub-sector due not only to a reduction of the O&M expenses needs but also to a significant
increase of the O&M fees collected by the WUAs. The overall cost-recovery ratio for the sub-
sector went from about 8 percent in 2001 to 45 percent in 2008, and continues to grow as the
reform is being consolidated. O&M needs went down mainly as a consequence of completion of
the conversion schemes bringing substantial savings on energy needs. The main factors behind
the increase in collection rates are: (i) improved access to water which improved yields and
allowed for shifting towards higher value crops; (ii) implementation of WUAs training modules
particularly in financial management and conflict resolution; (iii) change in the payment channel:
all payments are being made through post offices that automatically provides receipts against
payments made; (iv) PIU information sharing activities among farmers; (v) practical suggestions


                                                 22
provided to WUAs (such as hanging the list of water users that did not pay water fees on the
WUA buildings front doors); and (vi) a general increase of agricultural products prices that also
contributed to improved farmers ability to pay.
Institutional Development (Component 3)
During the first years this component focused on establishing and enabling a proper legal and
operational environment for introducing an institutional reform of the sub-sector based on PIM
principles. From the third year on, the focus was shifted on planning and implementation of
training and other WUAs strengthening activities. The main achievements during this period,
besides the approval of the WUAs law included:
        (i) establishment and preparation of internal regulations of the WUA regulatory body
               (dispute resolution committee);
        (ii) establishment and preparation of internal regulations of a WUA executing
               committee (supervising committee);
        (iii) completion of a report on Technical Survey of the I&D Systems for Developing
               and Costing of O&M of I&D Systems in Armenia (estimated to be about 8.9 billion
               AMD);
        (iv) establishment and strengthening of a single headworks agency, the WSA, that took
               over responsibility for managing O&M of headworks from four out of the five
               public agencies previously involved in this activity;
        (v) establishment and subsequent liquidation of 13 temporary DIMAs in charge of
               O&M of lower levels of the system during the period in which WSA had already
               handed over O&M of such lower parts, and WUAs had still not taken over their
               management (DIMAs were needed since establishment of WUAs was a long
               participatory process made on a voluntary basis, and with no certainty about WUAs
               establishment all over the country);
        (vi) preparation of a standard water delivery contract from WSA to WUAs;
        (vii) preparation and enactment by the Government of the transfer agreement of
               infrastructure management and operation to WUAs;
        (viii) establishment of 31 WUAs (12 in 2003 and 19 in 2004) covering a command area
               of about 135,000 ha (other 23 had been established by IFAD in mountainous areas
               and cover about 15,000 ha), therefore the final result has been that all irrigated areas
               in Armenia are currently under WUAs' management);
        (ix) implementation of the training program for WUAs;
        (x) implementation of the matching grant scheme for provision of equipment to
               WUAs; and
        (xi) implementation of the matching grant scheme for rehabilitation of infrastructure
               under WUAs management.
        Participation of farmers in WUAs representative and managing functions, as
administrative council members and as executing managers is still increasing. A Government
decision dated September 1, 2005 introduced into the WUAs law, established that local
administration members were no longer considered eligible for membership in the WUAs'
administrative councils. This had the double effect of avoiding having administrative council
members not having enough time to deal with WUAs problems because they were in charge of

                                                  23
many other duties, and allowing increased participation of farmers who have a better knowledge
of everyday irrigation and agricultural issues.
         Transparency in allocation of subsidies was also enhanced from past bulk subsidy
transfers to the old central irrigation agency. The old system did not help in ensuring an equitable
allocation of subsidies among O&M headwork branches and WUAs, and between the WUAs
themselves. Since 2006, subsidies are been allocated directly and completely to WUAs on the
basis of a complex indicator that takes into consideration their planned budgets, planned use of
energy and technical state of the infrastructure under their management. This avoids
concentration of subsidies in particular parts of the irrigation system made on the basis of
subjective decisions..
         Training of WUAs started in October 2005 based on 8 modules: (i) WUA governance,
(ii) financial management, (iii) water management, (iv) technical training; (v) O&M planning
and budgeting; (vi) legal issues; (vii) participation techniques; and (viii) conflict resolution. All
WUAs underwent training in each of the 8 modules. Two tailored softwares for WUAs
(accounting and water management) have been developed and provided to WUAs. Study tours of
selected Government, PIU and WUAs staff/directors to Spain and Portugal have been organized
based on the participants learning needs.
         Beside these positive achievements there are issues that remain unsolved, namely those
related to WUAs taxes, over normative land, establishment of the federations of WUAs, the
independent review of the ongoing reform process and WSA restructuring, and release from
cadastre of WUAs territory map
Project Management (Component 4)
         The PIU has been an effective implementing and policy reform instrument for the
Government. It has conducted a participatory process that has been rolled over the whole
irrigation area in Armenia. It has developed a GIS-based Water Management Software (WMS)
that is an efficient instrument that facilitates water management by the WUA and the central
authorities, through the accounting and analysis of the following parameters: (i) water intake by
irrigation systems from water sources; (ii) water distribution at the levels of secondary and
tertiary canals; (iii) water users; (iv) signed agreements; (v) irrigated areas; (vi) area of each
crop; (vii) consumed electricity; (viii) volume of irrigation water actually delivered to water
users; (ix) actual irrigation water losses; (x) payments by water users and arrears; and (xi) water
user plans, electricity quotas, etc.. As the software continues to be developed to comply with
increasing users and administrators requirements, new features are being continuously added,
constituting an unforeseen major project achievement for the growing level of efficiency of the
O&M of the irrigation systems.
         The software contains a database with all the required information for carrying out the
accounting for management of the system and for water use operation. It has an entry part that
enables the input of required initial information as well as for process data required for the
accounting system. The information entered into the software (e.g. actually delivered quantity of
irrigation water at different structure levels, the readings of electric meters, etc.) is updated daily.
The initial information entered at the initial stage to make it operational usually requires minor
editing and adjustments, shifting the focus on the input of daily operation data.
         The initial establishment of the system requires the input of following initial data: (i)
names of served communities/sub-areas; (ii) water sources of irrigation systems; (iii) structure of
irrigation system from the water sources to the water users; (iii) responsible persons for irrigation


                                                  24
water (name, occupation); (iv) pump parameters and characteristics; (v) water losses in the
irrigation system; (vi) membership and water fees per m3 of water delivered to users; (vii)
cropping pattern and irrigation standards; and (viii) other data on water users.
         The following information is entered on a routine basis: (i) contractual data and
agreements signed with water users (signing date, initial debt, etc.); (ii) data from annexes to
agreements signed with water users that are considered integral part of the agreement (irrigated
area, cropping pattern, water source, etc.); (iii) the amount of water received during each
watering and date (from the ditch master's log); (iv) the type, amount and dates of payments done
by water users (from pay books, invoices, files provided by Haypost (Armenian Post Office); (v)
the time and the amount of water delivered to water measurement stations of the irrigation
system (from water delivery daybooks and diaries); and (vi) actual readings of current meters of
pump engines and the quantity of electricity consumed.
         The software main menu enables to: (i) establish an accounting system; (ii) enter current
data; (iii) produce and print out reports and analyses for any required period; (iv) export reports
into M S E xcel a pplication, w hich allows f or d etailed a nd c omprehensive da ta a nalysis; (v)

into data base automatically; (ix) create backup copies, recover damaged database thus securing
the s ystem from information loss caused by various reasons; (x) create archives and work with
them (i.e. storing information from completed years for future comparisons with past years data);

         In order to establish an electronic link between the land plots shown on the maps and
encrypted list of landowners, the software includes the WUAs' service area map. The electronic
maps of communities were processed for their integration (inclusion) into the accounting
software to facilitate the work with the system. As new areas are incorporated into the system,
the processing is carried out through the following steps: (a) as the service area of WUA usually
covers several communities and the electronic maps are prepared on a community basis, the
community maps are put together to have the WUA map; (b) the maps are cleared from
unnecessary information; (c) the required information contained on maps is grouped and
colored/highlighted (administrative borders of communities, rivers, irrigation systems, buildings
and facilities, objects specific for the area that helps to locate positions, etc.). The maps that are
processed as mentioned above and comply with the requirements are the put into the WMS
database.
         Using the encrypted list of landowners and the encrypted maps (in the scale of 1:500) that
match with the list of landowners entered into the database and with the processed map, the
WMS establishes the corresponding links between each water user and his plot/s and existing
facilities. The system allows specifying the total area of plots and irrigable areas, the actually


                                                    25
irrigated and not-irrigated areas, the cropping patterns within the WUA area, etc. The software
helps solving many routine water management problems using maps, produces map-based
reports enabling efficient and detailed analysis, identifies and specifies the owners of undeclared
plots and facilitates accounting of water users that farm on leased lands.
Results at the level of the existing WUAs are highly positive with still pending issues
Preliminary data made available by the monitoring department of the PIU as a result of data
collection from WUAs allow for the following conclusions:
     · The number of hectares irrigated continues to grow reaching 128,860 hectares (compared
        with 112,000 hectares in 2004) ­ about 15 percent increase in just four years. This is
        mainly due to the transfer of O&M to the WUAs and their better performance of the
        water distribution function.
     · The collection rates at the end of 2008 were about AMD3.44 billion. Most of the
        collection was performed though the post-offices, which means that almost no cash
        money paid by water users to water masters eliminating corruption possibilities.
     · The GOA is very keen to fight corruption in all kind of spheres of life and economy. The
        Minister of Territorial Administration is very firm in forcing all water users, including
        authorities with big land plots, some of whom were not paying in full in the past, to pay
        their dues. The list of large non-payers (with dues exceeding 200,000 AMD) was
        published in the republican daily "Azg".
     · The total consumption of electricity in the part of the system managed by WUAs
        decreased from about 128 million KWh in 2004 to about 116.8 million KWh in 2008, due
        presumably to a more rational usage of energy. Taking into account also the share of
        WSA energy consumption, the energy consumption figures decreased almost 30 percent
        which is attributed to the conversion from pumping to gravity irrigation which was
        implemented in some schemes under the project.
     · Amount of subsidy has decreased from 5.4 billion AMD allocated in 2007 to 4.9 billion
        AMD allocated for 2008. It is worth to mention that the Government is switching to the
        performance-based subsidies, a new approach that is being improved.
     · The Government continues to apply ceiling on water pricing. 2009 ceiling was set at 9
        AMD/m3. However, this distortion is being gradually removed, and according to the
        Government programs, the current tariff will be increased by 2 AMD per cubic meter for
        the years 2010 and 2011. The program assumes that collection rate will be improved
        reaching 80, 82 and 85 percent respectively in 2009, 2010, and 2011.
     · An issue which has been raised by the Bank team since 2004 involves an area covering
        26,400 ha in 52 villages in Ararat, Aragatsot, and Armavir marzes land. The Government
        defined this land as a water over-normative area due to certain specific characteristics of
        the soil, which determines that it needs an amount of water in excess of that foreseen by
        the normative amounts calculated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to produce an
        average crop yield. Based on this, on May 15, 2003, a decree informed owners farming
        land in this area that the quantity of water used in excess of the normative did not need to
        be paid. Consequently, those farmers are currently not paying WUAs for the excess water
        that nevertheless is paid by WUAs in the form of bulk water and excess of energy
        consumption to WSA including also the losses along the distribution system for this
        marginal quantity. The Bank recognized the social reasons behind such decision, but


                                                26
    believes it weakens the financial sustainability of WUAs. The government should
    therefore decide to either reverse this decision on this subject or subsidize WUAs for the
    financial losses suffered from this situation.
·   WUAs are now gradually being equipping with the GIS software to track field irrigation,
    cropping patterns, water quantities delivered at field level and water fees. This data helps
    WUA staff not only in being more effective in managing the irrigation distribution but it
    also helps them spot more effectively undeclared irrigation. Farmers can effectively know
    if all farmers in their vicinity pay for water and peer pressure has become more effective.
    However, there is no strict policy of cutting of water supply to WUA or farmers that do
    not pay their bills. Unpaid fees accumulated by WUAs over the previous years are rolled
    over into the new irrigation year which is a solution for the short-term but, over the
    longer term if these amounts are continuously rolled over, the problem might become
    unmanageable. This poses a longer term risk to the financial sustainability of the WUAs
    and contributes to a permanent starving of system O&M resources since expenditures
    such as salaries, utilities, and power will be paid on time while maintenance is deferred.
    This represents also a significant risk since the government's policy is also to gradually
    increase water prices to cost recovery levels.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analyses
Background
        IDP rehabilitation of tertiary canals and conversion from pumping to gravity in selected
schemes, together with the institutional reforms and transfer of O&M of the systems to WUAs;
would result in the following benefits: (i) reduced water losses and costs of irrigation; (ii) farm
area returned t o i rrigation; a nd ( iii) i ncreased pr oductivity a nd di versified a griculture t owards
higher va lue crops, as a result of i mproved availability of w ater (in qua ntity a nd oppor tunity).
Reduced w ater l osses w ould a lso r educe t he e conomic c ost of i rrigation w ater t o us ers a nd
increase the availability of water in the WUAs irrigation systems. The PDO were: (i) increased
average farm income in project area; (ii) increased level and efficacy of O&M activities; and (iii)
promotion of community driven development (CDD) in the irrigation sub-sector.
         Separate economic analyses were performed at project preparation for each component
and, within each component, for each of the discrete IDP interventions. At project level, all
economic benefits and costs, excluding the institutional reforms, have been aggregated in the
PAD, resulting in an overall ERR of 24.8 percent and an NPV of US$17.1 million.
         The financial analysis at appraisal consisted in assessing project impact at farm level.
Typical crop models were derived from a sample of about 230 farms interviewed in 1998
representative of the country's four agro-ecological zones. The analysis showed that: (i) the
average net farm income derived from irrigated agriculture ranged from US$400 to US$1,000
per ha in the "with project" situation, compared to between US$0 (where no rain-fed cropping is
possible) and US$200 (where rain-fed cropping was possible) in the "without project" situation;
(ii) the value of one cubic meter of water was estimated at about 19 drams (US$0.035) on
average, compared to the existing water charge of 3.8 AMD and its full cost of 12.7 AMD; (iii)
farm incomes would typically increase by at least 30-40 percent as a result of the project; and
(iv) assuming that 8 percent of the gross farm income would be a reasonable price for a typical
farmer to pay for water, the analysis showed that, if water was available in time and in planned
quantity, the "affordable" water fee could range between 10 and 16 drams/m3 (US$0.018 to
0.03).
Main Assumptions of the ICR Assessment
         The actual IDP financial impact on farmers' income and the economic impact on the
Armenian economy were assessed at project completion with the help of detailed crop and farm
models, showing typical farming situations. Models were developed using FARMOD software.
         In the ICR exercise, the analysis was based on the evolution of the actual irrigated area
and cropping patterns as recorded in the GIS based data monitored by the PIU for the five year
period 2004 ­ 2008. Information required for assessing crop yields with and without project was
based on data collected from visits to WUAs. Irrigated area data shows that the actual increase
in the number of hectares under irrigation was 15,494 ha. From the 194,795 irrigable ha
according to cadastre in the WUAs about 128,860 ha were irrigated in 2008. Consultation with
the PIU M&E team allowed for estimating the recurrent costs and water savings for the with
project scenario. Average yields, production parameters, costs, and crop budgets were defined
based on field visits and on data available from surveys done under the MCC Armenia Program.
The following Table 1 shows the GIS based recorded evolution of Armenian irrigated area and
cropping patterns for years 2004 ­ 2008 in the main regions under irrigation.

          The IDP reached effectiveness in December 2001 and began to show its impact before
  2004, year in which the agricultural output grew by 14 percent. However, since the M&E PIU
  detailed baseline data was available in 2004, this ICR exercise assumed 2004 as the baseline to
  which the project impact would be compared. As can be seen in the Table 1, the 52 WUAs
  created with the support of the IDP were allocated in 3 main homogeneous groups A, C and D,
  as specified in the first column of the Table. The following Table 2 summarizes the areas and
  cropping patterns considered in the homogeneous groups, and how these have been evolving
  since 2004.

          After completing the crop budgets and farm models, the aggregation of incremental costs
  and returns were estimated and the Economic Rates of Return (ERR) calculated based on the
  "with-project" and "without-project" scenarios. The main components of the project costs were
  all considered: (i) the rehabilitation of canals and conversion from pumping to gravity
  investment costs; (i) the institutional development costs; as well as (iii) the project management
  costs. Project investment costs were all those actually incurred since effectiveness.

                                                            30
        Benefits were mainly derived from the availability of more timely and adequate irrigation
water for the previously distressed areas, resulting in: (i) 10 to 15 percent of yield increases; (ii)
some irrigated area increases (from 113,366 to 128,860 ha); together with (iii) significant
changes in cropping patterns towards higher value crops. Increased irrigated area and the
changes in cropping pattern were also taken from actual information derived from the GIS based
monitoring data. Table 2 shows that while wheat and alfalfa areas were reduced from 46 percent
to 34 percent of the irrigated area, fruits and vegetables have increased from 38 percent to 50
percent.
        The total area under irrigation in 2008 was 128,860 ha, but is still with considerable
wastage of water. Adopting conservative assumptions, it was considered that: (i) the before
project situation would have remained unchanged under the "without project" scenario (which
underestimates benefits since the system would continue to deteriorate and wastage of water
increased); (ii) the current situation (2008) would be maintained unchanged in the future "with
the project" scenario; and (iii) without further improvements following 2009, it was assumed that
AMD 222 million would be the additional O&M costs to keep sustainable the IDP
improvements. Although it is expected that the improved systems would gain in efficiency under
the consolidation of the WUAs' management, with efficiency increases in water conveyance and
electricity consumption savings beyond what was already attained, this benefit was not
quantified for the ICR exercise.
        The conversion factors (CF) applied for the economic analysis to investments, goods
and services used or produced, were equal to one except for wheat (1.08), labor (0.7), and water.
The financial cost of one cubic meter of water for farmers was based in 2008 tariff, which was
equal to 9.0 AMD (US$0.024), while the economic cost depends on the location and sources of
water. The later was based on information provided by the WSA, being 15.3 AMD (US$0.041),
14.4 AMD (US$0.039) and 17.1 AMD (US$0.046) for the areas in homogeneous area groups A,
C and D respectively. Based on those figures, the CF used for irrigation water were 1.7, 1.6 and
1.9 respectively. The exchange rate used in the analyses was 372.5 AMD per dollar (May 11,
2009).
Other Assumptions of the Analysis
        Crop models detail the partial budgets involved in each representative major crop per ha,
including: (i) crop yields, inputs and labor used, both in the pre-project situation (and in the
without the project scenario), and after the new rehabilitation under the project is introduced
(scenario with the project); and (ii) the financial budget resulting from the physical quantities of
products, inputs and labor used, and from the market prices received by farmers for their
production, or prices paid by them for the required inputs and services used for the activity.
        Aggregation of Costs and Benefits. The resulting agricultural production costs and
benefits obtained from irrigated crops per ha were aggregated in both scenarios: "with" and
"without" project. It was conservatory assumed that no further changes in yields, planted areas
and/or cropping patterns will occur after 2008 (2014 for yields, allowing for the full production
of the new vineyards and orchards planted before 2008, so that the new plantations installed in
2008 would reach maturity). A first level of aggregation was at the typical farm level, and the
second one, at the 3 homogeneous zones and at the overall irrigated area in Armenia, following
the evolving cropping pattern as recorded in the GIS based M&E data. This aggregation of the
agricultural incremental production and related farm costs, allows for estimating the: (i) financial



                                                 31
impact on farmers' income; and (ii) the overall economic impact of the project, as net benefits
are compared with the project's investment costs (about US$40.5 million).
Financial and Economic Results
        Average crop budget for the irrigated areas in Armenia allows comparing the with and
without project scenarios as can be seen in the following Table 3. Seven crop models and 1 farm
model for each homogeneous zone (A, C and D) were used as the basis for estimating the impact
of the project at the farmers' income level, and at the country' levels (Tables 1 to 6 in Appendix
1).

        Financial Results at the farm level were also analyzed in both scenarios using FARMOD
software. The Tables 7, 8 and 9 in Appendix 1 show the expected results in typical farms of
Zone A, C and D respectively and results are summarized in Table 4. It is expected that typical
farms would - on average - double their net family income depending on the farm size and
location of the family plots. This is a higher impact at the average farmer level than the one
expected by the PAD which was 30-40 percent.

        The increase in income is resulting from a combination of vertical and horizontal
expansion of the farming activities, due to water improved availability in time and more
frequency, which has improved productivity and also induced farmers to invest in higher value
crops. Table 4 summarizes the expected financial impact at the farm level with the new cropping
pattern which includes new orchards and vineyards expected to reach maturity after 6 or 7 years
of planted. As mentioned before the physical improvements, as well as the WUAs involvement
and system management is resulting in more timely and evenly water distribution. As water
supply is made more secure, higher net value is being produced per drop of water. This is been

below.
         Overall Economic Analysis. After the few adjustments mentioned above made to the
market prices (the overall ERR of the project was estimated at 43.5 percent. Using a discount
rate of 12 percent, the NPV is 45.5 billion AMD (US$122.3 million). The estimated results,
even when are outstanding, are still considered to be a conservative estimate given that the
improvements achieved in 2008 are expected to continue to increase given that the development
process has just started under the leadership of the WUAs with full support of the GOA. Benefits
were mainly derived from: (i) the 13.7 percent expansion of the irrigated areas; (ii) the increased
diversification towards higher value fruit crops (vegetables, grapes and orchards growing from
38 to 50 percent from 2004 to 2008, away from extensive crops; and (iii) a 10 to 15 percent
increase in crop yields stemming from the improved availability of water for irrigation.
         Water Efficiency. Due to the long deferred maintenance of the irrigation systems in
Armenia, most of the structures were not operating well and water, still today, rarely reaches
some of the farms at the tail of the systems. From the time of the FSU it is estimated that
irrigated area dropped to half the area that was under irrigation. With the rehabilitation of some
of the structures and the PIM approach introduced by the IDP, the irrigation systems are being
rehabilitated, beginning to save water that was being lost without the project. The more reliable
supply of water, the higher value crops, and the 13.7 percent more land irrigated has resulted in
higher net value of production per unit of water used for irrigation. Between 2004 and 2008, the
water productivity has grown by about 49 percent12. This indicator was measured by the net
economic value of production divided by the quantity of irrigation water used for production
with and without project, as can be seen in the following Table 5. This water productivity gains
are critical for sustaining the subsidy reduction process to which the GOA is committed.

         Sustainability of project benefits is expected to be high, given the increase in water
availability and use efficiencies, together with the consolidation of the PIM approach. The strong
dynamic attitude shown by WUAs assuming the O&M is already having a significant effect on
the water service delivery and as a consequence on farmers' satisfaction level and incomes. It is
expected that with the formal transfer of O&M responsibilities of the primary and secondary
canals on a pilot basis under the follow-up IREP to federations of WUAs, the more efficient and
responsive management of the irrigation infrastructure would also allow for further expansions
of the irrigated areas and a more sustainable use and life of the overall system.

         A social survey was conducted in April 2009 in Aygabats-Vorogum WUA, Shamiram
WUA, Mkhchyan WUA and Armavir WUA. The sampling approach in 2008 survey was the
same as in 2006, considering in particular: (i) geographical location of WUAs: mountain, pre-
mountain and plain areas; (ii) irrigation method: gravity; pumping and mixed irrigation; and (iii)
total number of water users. At the first sampling level, the same WUAs investigated in 2006
were selected for this survey: Mkhchyan WUA of Ararat Region (or "Marz" in Armenian) and
Armavir WUA of Ararat Marz ­ both in plain area, Shamiram WUA of Aragatsotn Marz (pre-
mountain area) and Aygabats-Vorogum WUA of Shirak Marz (mountain area). The total number
of water users in those WUAs was 20.55313. At the second sampling level, the survey was
conducted in the same communities as in 2006. The survey unit at the third sampling level was
the household (water user). The 2008 survey was conducted among 240 water users ­ the same
number as in 2006. Each household from the total population of water users had equal probability
to be included into the sampling list.
         The analysis was conduct through the method of individual standardized interviews among
water users applying the questionnaire of 2006 with some minor modifications. In addition to
quantitative survey among water users, qualitative survey was conducted among managing and
executive bodies of WUAs (Chairman of Administrative Council, Executive Director). 240
questionnaires filled during the survey were logically analyzed, and the open and semi-open
questions were encrypted. The data was entered into the computer and analyzed through SPSS
statistical software.
         The objective of social survey was to: (i) identify the changes in irrigation system
between 2006 and 2008 and assess their impact on water users; and (ii) find out main problems of
water users and propose solutions. The subject of the survey of investigations in 2008 was the
same as in 2006, and the social monitoring was conducted among water users and representatives
of WUA governance and management bodies. The survey was conducted within the service area
of four WUAs.
         The objective of social monitoring was to: (i) identify satisfaction level of water users
with irrigation services in 2008 compared to 2008; (ii) identify the participation level of water
users in WUA management and decision making process in 2008; (iii) identify the awareness
level of water users about WUA activities and changes having occurred in last two years; and (iv)
assess the impact of WUA activities on water users in 2006-2008.
         Satisfaction of water users by irrigation services: 57 percent of water users gave
positive answers to the question "Have you received enough irrigation water in 2008?" and were
satisfied with the volume of received irrigation water. This indicator was 37.9 percent in 2006.
The comparison shows that the number of water users satisfied with irrigation water delivery has
increased by 19.1 percent in two years, which may be considered as an important performance
improvement for WUA. Vice versa, the percentage of water users that have not obtained
sufficient water has reduced from 20 percent in 2006 to 7.6 percent in 2008. The WUA Executive
Directors explained it by some improvement of technical state of irrigation system and financial
state of WUAs. However, 12.4 percent of respondents in general remain dissatisfied with water
delivery. That rate was especially high in Armavir and Shamiram. The Director of Shamiram
WUA explained it by discharge capacity of Arzni-Shamiram canal, which complicates irrigation
water delivery to communities located at the end-tail sections of the canal. The Director of
Armavir WUA related it to pumping irrigation, in particular by failures of pump operation.
         In order to support WUAs in their future activities, it is important to know the water users
opinion about the reasons of irregular water delivery. 43.3 percent of water users blamed the poor
technical state of water conveyance system, which is by 14.6 percent higher than in 2006. About
one quarter of respondents relate the insufficient water supply to breakages of pumps (18 percent

  Mkhchyan and Azat WUAs merged in 2008 into new Azat WUA. Another three WUAs of Shirak Marz including Aygabats-
Vorogum WUA also were in a merger process. However, this survey covered the same communities of Mkhchyan WUA and
Aygabats-Vorogum WUA as in 2006.
                                                        44
in 2006). Non-payment was another reason for irregular water supply. This issue relates also to
insolvency of some water users. The water users stated high irrigation fee together with not-timely
and insufficient delivery of irrigation water as the main reason for non-payment. The number of
water users that blamed non-payment for irregular water supply has increased by 2.5 percent
compared to 2006 reaching 13.6 percent. In Armavir, 9.1 percent of water users blamed non-
payment as the main reason for irregular water supply in 2006, however this number reached 27
percent in 2008. That indicator has remained the same in Shamiram and Azat and was reduced by
11.3 percent in Aygabats. 9.3 percent of respondents think that the reason for irregular water
supply is the lack of water delivery schedule and arbitrary actions by some operating staff. This
issue was highlighted yet in 2006 survey, and some actions were recommended to implement to
improve the situation. As a result, that indicator was reduced by 16.8 percent in 2008.
        Satisfaction with WUA performance. 78.2 percent of respondents positively assessed
the activities of their WUA in 2006 (0.4 percent ­ very well, 13.8 percent - well and 64 percent -
sufficient). That number has increased by 13.3 percent in 2008 ("very well" - by 9.2 percent,
"well" ­ by 13.6 percent and "sufficient" ­ by 9.5 percent). Only 8.5 percent of water users
negatively assessed WUA performance, as they have not received sufficient water in a timely
manner. The number of water users that have negatively assessed WUA performance is especially
high at the end-tail sections of irrigation system.
Participation of water users in participatory management of WUA and in decision making
        Awareness about irrigation water fee. The survey results on this issue are not optimistic.
The water user awareness about membership fee was very low both in 2006 and in 2008 survey.
Very few water users knew about membership fee. Only 8-12 percent knew about its importance.
All WUA Executive Directors stated that in spite of some explanatory work efforts displayed
among users on the importance of membership fee, very few of them are informed its importance.
Water users are sure that membership fee is accounted with irrigation fee for consumed water, and
this entails some confusion. WUAs have to carry out additional explanatory works among water
users to make them aware about the concept of membership fee to enhance water users'
confidence towards WUA and increase their responsibility.
        Water users continue to be little informed about how irrigation fee is set. The survey of
2008 showed that the situation has changed very little, and water users still don't know how much
they have to pay per 1 m3 of water. According to WUA Executive Directors, the irrigation fee was
set up at 9 AMD/m3 and the irrigation fee for water delivered to water users is calculated on that
basis. However, the survey showed that the fee is calculated on per hectare basis, according to
duration of water delivery or according to water demand standards by crop types.
        Payment of irrigation fee. Payment of irrigation reached 70.4 percent in 2008 and no
significant changes were observed compared to 2006 survey (1.6 percent increase). Number of
non-payers was reduced by 5.6 percent. The highest collection rate was in Aygabats and
Shamiram. Collection rate in Azat was reduced by 7 percent in 2008. The opinions of water users
on the issue of irrigation fee enables to arrive to the conclusion that, they gradually become aware
about the need to pay for irrigation. Regarding to the reasons of non-payment, 56.2 percent of
respondents mentioned their insolvency, which was 10.4 percent higher than in 2006. However,
there are also non-diligent payers who are reluctant to pay after irrigation. WUA applies some
sanctions in respect of those water users. The number of insolvent water users was high in Azat -
an increase by 29.9 percent compared to 2006. The increase in Armavir was 21.2 percent and in
Aygabats - 17.1 percent. 20.2 percent of respondents stated the non-adequate calculation of water
fees as another reason for non-payment. The number of such water users in Armavir has increased
by 21.1 percent and in Aygabats ­ by 40 percent. Another reason for non-payment was not timely
and insufficient delivery of irrigation water. However, the number of such respondents reduced by
4.4 percent and 6.1 percent respectively. Both in 2006 and 2008, WUA management applied
individual approach towards non-payers. The water users that have large arrears accumulated
from previous years would not be provided with water. The most common punishment for non-
payment is deprivation of irrigation water. Except for Aygabats, all other WUAs continue to
claim irrigation arrears of water users through court proceedings. According to Director of
                                                45
Armavir WUA, first they sent notifications to debtor water users. The next step is claiming the
amount through court. This creates tense relations between WUA and water users.
         Invoices (receipts) for payment of irrigation fee and irrigation fee payment.
According to survey of 2006, only 11.2 percent of respondents said they have paid through
Armenian Post Office. Meanwhile the number has increased to 50.5 percent in 2008 in Azat and
Armavir. The number of water users making payments to ditch masters was reduced by 68
percent and 55.2 percent in Azat and Armavir, respectively. In particular, in 2006 only 5.3 (Azat)
and 12.8 percent (Armavir) of respondents paid irrigation fee through Armenian Post Office,
meantime the same indicators for 2008 were 73.3 percent and 70.6 percent. These indicators
evidence that the payment system through Post Office became more acceptable to water users,
which reduces the risks associated with cash payments to ditch masters. The Post Office system of
payment was introduced in Aygabats only in 2008, and 37.9 percent of water users made
payments through that system and 62.1 percent still relied on ditch master. About 85 percent of
irrigation fees had supporting receipts in 2006. The same indicator was 99.3 percent in 2008, i.e.
an increase of 14.3 percent. According to last investigations, actually all water users received
receipts for paid irrigation fees.
         Proposals on further improvement of irrigation fee collection rate. Water users stated
the cheaper irrigation fee as the main factor that will enhance better collection rate. They think
that irrigation fee is too high and not affordable to poor people. This view was stated by 33.8
percent (2006) and 37.2 percent (2008) of water users. Very often they do not request irrigation
water because could not afford to pay for it, although their crops needed irrigation. The technical
state of tertiary irrigation system was another important issue. The number of water users giving
high importance to improvement of tertiary irrigation season has increased by 16.8 percent in
2008. They think that improvement of the state of tertiary irrigation system may reduce water
losses. 15.3 percent of water users gave high importance to the issue of fair distribution of
irrigation water. The number of such water users has increased by 2.2 percent in two years. 4.5
percent of respondents stated the purposeful use of collected fees as a factor that may improve
collection rate. Of course, the publicity and transparency in the usage of collected fees may help
to increase the collection rate. WUAs have to analyze seriously why so few water users think that
higher confidence towards WUA may increase collection rate (2.4 percent greater than in 2006).
         Water delivery according to water applications submitted beforehand. The number of
water users receiving water according to previously submitted applications has increased (83.5
percent in 2006 and 85.9 percent in 2008). This is considered as a more advanced form of water
delivery and enables implementation of efficient water management. However, in spite of
existence of such agreements, water users try to secure water delivery through verbal agreement
with the ditch master on "ad hoc ­ when required" principle. WUA management explained this by
poor technical state of irrigation system and unequal solvency situation of water users, and
currently implementation of water application system is difficult.
         Water measurement facilities and devices. Only 2.9 percent of water users in Shamiram
and 1.1 percent in Azat have used water meters in 2006. According to 2006 survey, 99.2 percent
of water users were of the opinion that "the use of water meters will change nothing, as irrigation
fee in any case will be charged on a per ha basis or according to operation time of pump station".
However, there was some advancement in 2008 survey as 17.7 percent demanded water
measurement and found it important in adequate calculation of irrigation water.
         Conflicts emerging from irrigation water. The conflicts between water users and ditch
masters, water users and water suppliers and among water users themselves is reduced to some
extent. Some of conflicts occurred due to insufficient water delivery as a result of poor stated of
canals and breakages of pump operation. WUA management stated that water users do not trust in
WUA Dispute Solving Commission so do not apply to it. So far, WUA management has received
only verbal complaints and no written complaints. Meantime the Executive Director of Armavir
WUA mentioned that sometimes disputes on collection of irrigation fee are solved through court
proceedings. The Executive Director of Azat WUA said that water users are poorly informed
about the existence of Dispute Solving Commission. The problems with delivery of irrigation
                                                46
water create some tension in WUA. This issue is more evident in WUAs were water is scarcer.
Many water users are of the opinion that the source of disputes lays in unfair distribution of
irrigation water.
         Cooperation between water users and WUAs. When asked about their cooperation with
WUA management body, water users stated that they cooperate mainly with ditch master and site
manager. They are interested first of all in timely and sufficient delivery of irrigation water. 62.2
percent of respondents positively answer the question "Have you ever applied to WUA
management bodies?" It shows a 26.4 percent increase in 2 years and has increased in all WUAs.
Some of WUA management-water user relations related to court claims of irrigation fee, others ­
to proper calculation of irrigation water fee. 37.8 percent of respondents stated that they solved
their problems with ditch master and site manager so there was no need to apply to WUA
management. Only if the problems are not solved on ditch master/site manager level, water user
approaches to higher managerial level. 62.4 percent of water users did not apply to WUA
management because there was no such need. This may be considered as a positive achievement.
Meantime 36 percent of water users still do not trust WUA.
         Water users' awareness about WUA activities. During 2006 survey, 69.2 percent of
water users positively answered the question "To what extent are you aware about water users
association?" (35 percent are well aware and 34.2 percent are partially aware). The awareness in
2008 was increased by 16.5 percent, including 9.2 percent of "well aware". This indicator was
especially high in Armavir (51.1 percent). This level has increased by 21.1 percent in Aygabats
and by 6.7 percent in Shamiram. The number of water users not aware in WUA activities was
reduced by 16.5 percent in two years, which is positive achievement. However, it is still low in
Azat - 22.2 percent.
         Awareness of water users about their rights. Positive trends were observed in water
users' awareness about their rights. The average indicator was 78.4 percent in 2006 (well aware -
14.2 percent, partially aware - 64.2 percent), and it has increased by 6.5 percent in two years (well
aware - 44.9 percent, partially aware - 40 percent). However, the awareness knowledge is not
deep. Usually awareness of rights is limited to the right to get irrigation water in a timely manner
and to apply to court in case of incurred losses. Water users still think that there is no sense in
being aware about their rights as the laws are not implemented or are implemented arbitrary.
Water users of Armavir, Azat and Shamiram told during interview that their crops have suffered
because of not timely delivery of irrigation water. However, they found useless to apply to court
for compensation for damages.
         Awareness of water users about their responsibilities. Results showed some increase in
water users' awareness of their responsibilities. It increased by 39 percent in two years. The
number of water users not aware of their responsibilities has reduced by 10.1 percent in the last
two years. Again, most water users see their responsibility first of all in timely payment of
irrigation fee and in that they may be sued by water supplier for non-payment of the fee. Referring
to this issue, WUA directors said that they held meetings and discussions with water users before
irrigation season, and afterwards have conducted daily meetings with them during irrigation
season. WUA directors think that greater awareness level was achieved as a result of training
implemented under Water-to Market component of MCC project. One day of MCC program
training course was devoted to irrigation water management issues.
         Assessment of WUA activities by water users. The positive trends in irrigation water
delivery observed after establishment of WUAs continued in 2008. 26.7 percent of water users
think that WUA performance has significantly improved in last two years and 89.6 percent of
water users see the positive trend. The number of water users that see no changes has reduced by
18.5 percent, and the "significantly worsened" answer has reduced by 8.3 percent. The positive
trends in WUA performance were positively assessed especially in Aygabats and Shamiram (49.5
percent and 36.2 percent respectively). WUA management also positively assessed the changes in
irrigation systems. Results showed that changes in irrigation system had positive impact on the
expansion of irrigated areas. About 25 percent of water users have expanded their irrigated areas,
which is by 8.7 percent more than in 2006. This means that water users are more confident
                                                 47
towards WUA and consider it as a reliable partner in irrigation water supply. The irrigated areas
have expanded by 7 percent in Aygabats, by 8 percent in Shamiram and by 7 percent in Armavir.
However, 1/3 of water users have less irrigated crops than two years ago. Water users explained
such reduction with their poor financial capacity. The reduction of irrigated area was especially
notable in Azat - 57.8 percent. Based on survey results, improvements in irrigation water delivery
have impacted crop pattern and enabled the growth of high value crops in 2008. 18percent of
water users answered "yes" to this question and 43.9 percent - "partially" (10 percent and 36.4
percent in 2008, respectively, Table 18). According to water users, the rate of high value crops
could have been even higher, but they still face problems with marketing of crops, lack of
compensation in case unfavorable weather conditions, etc.
         Proposals on future improvement of WUA performance. Following are the proposals
of water users for improvement of WUA performance: (i) 41 percent: improvement of tertiary
irrigation system; (ii) 22.9 percent: lower water tariff; (iii) 8.8 percent: failure-free operation of
pump stations; (iv) 7.1 percent : fair distribution of irrigation water; (v) 4.4 percent: timely and
reliable delivery of irrigation water; (vi) 3.5 percent: adequate organization of water delivery
process; (vii) 2.2 percent: adequate calculation of water fee on poor lands requiring greater
volume of water; (viii) 1.3 percent: construction of new water conveyance systems.
Survey Main Conclusions
         WUA achievements
     · The number of water users satisfied with irrigation water delivery has increased by 19.1
         percent.
     · The number of water users positively assessing WUA performance has increased by 13.3
         percent.
     · Collection rate for irrigation water fee was 70.4 percent in 2008 ­ a 1.6 percent increase
         compared to 2006.
     · The number of water users paying irrigation fee through Armenian Post Office was only
         11.2 percent in 2006. That number has increased to 50.5 percent in 2008.
     · 17.7 percent of water users demanded water measurement at their farm gate ­ an increase
         of 16.9 percent compared with 2006.
     · Awareness among water users about WUA activities increased by 16.5 percent, including
         9.2 percent that are well aware.
     · The number of water users cooperating with WUA management has increased by 26.4
         percent.
     · The number of water users that is well aware of their rights has increased by 30.7 percent
         (of responsibilities ­ by 39 percent).
     · One of the most important achievements after establishment of WUAs is the greater
         number of water users that see positive changes in irrigation water supply. In 2006, 56.2
         percent of respondents were of the opinion that irrigation water delivery has improved
         after establishment of WUA, while the number of such respondents in 2008 was 64.2
         percent.
     · The number of water users that see significant improvement in irrigation system in last
         two years has increased by 26.7 percent.
     · 25 percent of water users were of the opinion that improved water delivery has supported
         expansion of cropped areas. This is by 8.7 percent more than in 2006.
     · 15.5 percent of water users were of the opinion that positive changes in irrigation system
         in last two years supported conversion to high value crops.
         WUA problems
     · The surveys of 2006 and 2008 showed that water users are poorly aware about
         membership fee and irrigation water fee.
     · In 2008 irrigation water was delivered irregularly. 43.3 percent of water users explained it
         by poor technical state of water conveyance systems and 25 percent - by poor state of
         pump stations.
                                                  48
·   8.5 percent of respondents still is not satisfied with WUA and has negatively assessed its
    performance.
·   37.2 percent of respondents think that irrigation water fee is high and not affordable by the
    poor. They were of the opinion that lower irrigation fee might bring to higher collection
    rate.
·   The delivery of irrigation water according to irrigation water applications submitted by
    water users beforehand is crucial for proper water management and for purposeful use of
    irrigation water. Meantime the survey showed that system of water delivery based on
    water application does not work and water users rely on verbal agreements with ditch
    master.
·   82.3 percent of water users have not performed water measurement at farm gate for
    accurate calculation of irrigation water. That number includes the water users whose plots
    are located on soils with higher than standard water losses.
·   There were conflicts in some communities due to insufficiency of irrigation water. These
    conflicts created some tension in communities.
·   37.8 percent has not applied to WUA management bodies, as they did not trust them and
    did not believe it would make any sense.
·   Although according to 2008 survey, the awareness level among water users about WUA
    activities has increased, 14.3 percent of water users still were not informed about that.
·   15.1 percent of water users still were not aware about their rights.
·   The Chairman of Administrative Council and Council members are not paid and not too
    motivated. As a result, the activities of Administrative Council, Dispute Solving
    Commission and Supervision Commission are still ostentatious. That hinders institutional
    strengthening of WUAs. WUA management thinks that those bodies should be ensured
    with technical means, and their members should be paid for their work.
·   In order to make WUA performance maximally efficient, the Administrative Council,
    Dispute Solving Commission and Supervision Commission should be equipped with
    technical means, and their members should be paid for their work.
·   Not all members of WUA Administrative Council participate fully in council's activities.
·   No positive trends were observed during 2008 survey in water users' attitude towards the
    institute of the WUA Representatives' Meeting. Water users do not consider that institute
    seriously. Meantime the WUA Representatives' Meeting shall serve as an informational
    link between WUA management bodies and water users.

1.       Background
         Armenia is a s mall, m ountainous c ountry w ith an area of 29,743 square kilometers. Its
average altitude is 1,830 m above the sea level. About 90 percent of the territory is at an altitude
above 1, 000 m. The population of A rmenia is about 3. 0 m illion. I n the former Soviet Union,
Armenia occupied a r elatively f avorable pos ition, ow ing to the production of hi gh-valuable
agricultural products (grapes, fruit, tobacco, geranium etc.), and light industrial products (machine
tools, e lectric engines a nd military pr oducts). The economy w as, t hus, driven b y export. A t the
end of the 1980s, Armenia had a prospering industry and one of the highest living standards in the
Former S oviet Union (FSU). T he c ollapse of the economic, financial and t rade links with t he
former S oviet r epublics l ed t o a rapid de terioration of the pr oduction i nfrastructure, which
translated into a rapid decrease in national production.
        Agriculture remains a d ominant s ector in the economy of A rmenia. It p rovides va rying
levels of productive employment to about half of the households, and contributes about 30 percent
of GDP. Agricultural lands cover about 1.4 million ha, of which about 500,000 ha (35 percent) are
plough lands. Of this latter area, about 280,000 ha are potentially irrigable.
         The irrigation infrastructure c omprises 81 reservoirs, about 3, 000 km of m ain and
secondary canals, about 18, 000 km of t ertiary canals, 400 medium and l arge pumping s tations,
about 2,220 tube wells and artesian wells, and about 2,000 km of drainage-collectors. The demand
for i rrigation w ater be gins increasing in l ate A pril, pe aks in e arly J uly, and drops off i n late
October. N early 80 percent of the irrigated area i s s upplied through ope n channels and t he
remaining 20 pe rcent i s s upplied t hrough pi pes. M ajor sections of t he i rrigation water de livery
system r emain hi ghly d eteriorated. T he on -farm s ystems, w hich w ere or iginally d esigned t o
service large farms irrigating 50 to 400 h a from a single headgate or canal outlet, have not been
effectively adjusted to the present reality where the same outlet may service 300 or more farmers,
each irrigating an average of less than 1.5 ha.
        During the period following the collapse of the Soviet regime (1991) the irrigation system
appeared on the brink of collapse due to lack of operation and maintenance, extreme insufficiency
of state funding and insolvency of new owners of small land plots. By 1995, it was estimated that
about US$800 million would be required for complete recovery of the irrigation system and
efficient utilization of water resources.
         While G overnment ha s taken swift a ction t o privatize a nd liberalize m ost a spects of the
agricultural economy, irrigation related issues remain prominent among the primary issues facing
the s ector, a nd among those t hat pr oved t o b e m ost di fficult t o address under t he current
circumstances. Three issues, in particular, continue to require urgent attention in terms of policy

         Thus the irrigated agriculture plays a major role in the development and sustainability of
Armenian economy and in the pr ocess of fair r edistribution of w ealth between various social
groups. In t his r espect, the upg rading o f irrigation s ystem including c onversion f rom high
electricity consuming pump schemes to gravity systems, rehabilitation and increase of discharge
capacities of main canals, upgrading of pumping stations in the areas where there is no alternative
irrigation, construction of t ertiary c anals for delivery of i rrigation water to plots i rrigated b y
farmers with minimal losses, development of institutional improvements in irrigation sector will
have a decisive role in the development of irrigation sector.
2.      Description of projects
Description of IDP
        The project will constitute a five-year program for completing the task (initiated under the
IRP) of establishing the basis for sustainable irrigation and drainage, and for creating institutional
structures, capabilities and procedures for participatory management of the system. The project is
organized in four components.
    Component A: Rehabilitation of Critical Irrigation Infrastructure
    Component B: Conversion from Pump to Gravity Irrigation
    Component C: Institutional Development
    Component D: Project Management and Design and Supervision of Tertiary Rehabilitation
        The first c omponent focuses on reducing water l osses in the c onveyance system, and on
safeguarding the land f rom w ater logging a nd s alinity. T he second component focuses on
reducing the energy intensity, and t hus the c ost, of the w ater de livery system. The third
component addresses t he institutional strengthening r equirements for e ffective pa rticipatory
management and long term sustainability of the irrigation and drainage system. Finally, the fourth
component provides for project management during the five-year implementation period.
        The selection of activities for implementation under IDP project was carried out according
to approaches agreed with the Government. This approach may be summarized as follows: wide
and c omprehensive a ssistance t o t he e fforts a imed a t s olving t he s tructural a nd i nstitutional
deficiencies of the irrigation sector. In particular, as the main reason for the physical deterioration
of the system was the non-adequate (or lack of) maintenance in the past ten years, the investments
made for prevention of such state in the future are considered at least as crucial as the assistance
to the physical rehabilitation of the system.
         Based on the above, it was decided to develop the IDP by building up the achievements
reached during t he previous interventions. The goal was t o m ake t he i rrigated agriculture more
profitable and sustainable through improvement of w ater s upply s ystem's e fficiency and
reliability. This overall goal implied t he e xistence of t he f ollowing intermediate goa ls: a )
rehabilitate the physical state of irrigation infrastructures to the extent when the water losses at the
main a nd s econdary canal levels a re minimized; b) reduce op eration c osts of i rrigation system
through reduction o f its reliance on hi gh-cost e nergy; c ) improve system management b ased on
the pr inciples of P articipatory Irrigation Management (PIM) t hrough c lear allocation of
responsibilities and a ccountability between pa rties a nd i mprovement of institutional capacities
and establishment of reliable financing mechanisms that would prevent future deterioration of the
water conveyance system.


Description of Additional Financing to IDP



                                                   52
         Yet at the preparation stage of the Irrigation Development Project and afterwards, at the
credit negotiation stage, it was fixed that the project has to be continued through the second phase
taking into account the following essential considerations:
     · The implementation of comprehensive institutional improvements in the sector is a long
         process and it may take dozens of years, as is evidenced by the experience of foreign
         countries.
     · The cost of the project at the preparation stage was estimated at US$65 million. However,
         considering the limited amounts provided to Armenia by IDA during that period it was
         decided to split the project into two phases with costs of US$30 million and US$35
         million, respectively.
         It was decided to continue the Irrigation Development Project for another 2 years from
March 31, 2007 to March 31, 2009. About US$5.0 million was spent for rehabilitation of tertiary
irrigation systems during that 2-year period.
         Therefore the main objective of the Additional Financing for the Irrigation Development
Project was the continuation of rehabilitation works on tertiary irrigation networks using the
design and cost packages existing in the WUAs.
         The Additional Financing supported rehabilitation tertiary irrigation systems. The civil
works were carried out based on 37 design packages existing in the WUAs. These works covered
41 communities in 20 WUAs.
         The main conditions were as follows:
     · The Project will be continued for rehabilitation of tertiary irrigation systems only.
     · The systems being rehabilitated will not require increase of intake from the water source.
     · The water quantity required for irrigation of lands under command of rehabilitated
         systems will be ensured through reduction of water losses and saving of irrigation water.
         WUAs ensured 15 percent co-financing of rehabilitation works, so the project continuation
did not require additional financing from the State Budget of the Republic of Armenia.
       The Additional financing consisted of the following components:
    1) Rehabilitation of tertiary irrigation system operated by WUAs
    2) Training of WUA staff
    3) Preparation of new designs (rehabilitation of tertiary irrigation systems)
    4) Revision of existing designs (rehabilitation of tertiary irrigation systems)
    5) Audit of WUAs (for the year 2006)
3. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
Irrigation Development Project
Part A: Rehabilitation of Critical Irrigation Infrastructure
       The following works were proposed under this component:
    1. Rehabilitation of the most critically deteriorated higher-level irrigation system structures.
    2. Capacity expansion of the Armavir irrigation scheme's: (a) Araks river intake, including
       construction of sediment control facilities; (b) Hoktemberyan main conveyance canal; and
       (c) Maisian secondary canal.
       The cost estimate for this component was US$4.33 million. The aim of this project
component was to rehabilitate the main deficiencies of drainage and irrigation system that were
not rehabilitated under IRP. These are the sections that were considerably deteriorated due to long
absence of operation and maintenance activities. This component includes also some
improvement of important irrigation and drainage systems, which would result in reduction of
O&M load and costs in addition to other benefits. The civil works at Araks head intake structure
were completed on April 14, 2004. This intervention increased the intake capacity from 27 to 53
cubic meters per second.
       Component A was completed mainly in October 2005, and the hydrological-
environmental investigation were completed in March, 2006. This investigation was required
under EMP. Its implementation lasted for two years as sampling and observation had to be
conducted during prolonged period for identifying any environmental-hydrological impact
                                                53
generated by expansion of Araks intake financed under the project. The investigations conducted
by a consultant proved that rehabilitation of the intake did not affect negatively on hydro-
ecological state of the intake.
       This component a lso supported r ehabilitation of 69 e mergency i nfrastructures of S hirak,
Armavir, Talin, Arzni-Shamiram, Vayots-Dzor and Vorotan irrigation system.
        The works foreseen under this component are completed.
Part B: Conversion from Pump to Gravity Irrigation
        The intention of this component was to reduce the system's heavy reliance on energy
intensive pumping within those systems where there is a clear evidence for technical and
economical feasibility for conversion from pumping to gravity.
        This c omponent supported the implementation of Y egegnadzor, A ygedzor a nd A yrum
gravity schemes and reduced e nergy costs within t he s ystem w hich a ccounted for 60 pe rcent of
total ope ration costs. This c omponent e nsured reliable i rrigation on the area o f 6, 500 h a and
provided for savings of about 47 million KWth electricity annually.
Part C: Institutional Development
       This component supported provision of technical assistance, training, equipment and
vehicles to support the institutional development of: (a) WUFs; (b) the DIMA Enterprises; and (c)
the WSA.
Implemented institutional improvements
    1. Among t he important pol icy de cisions w as t he c onsolidation of t he responsibility f or
       oversight ove r t he irrigation i nfrastructure i n on e or ganization ­ Water S upply Agency.
       Then t he Government implemented a very important additional improvement unde r i ts
       resolution of M arch 2006 a bolishing t he central a dministration of W ater Supply A gency
       and transferring all w ater s upply f unctions t o four regional branches established on a
       regional basis. The branches became separate legal entities and took the responsibility for
       operation a nd m aintenance of r espective river ba sin's i nfrastructure and supply of
       irrigation water to water users associations of those areas.
   2. The Law of the R epublic of A rmenia "On W ater U sers Associations a nd F ederations of
      Water U sers A ssociations" ( 10.09.2002) was adopted w ithin t he f ramework o f legal
      improvements. A ne w l egal-organizational entity - water us ers association ( WUA) w as
      specified under t hat Law, which is an e ntity established b y w ater us ers according t o the
      mentioned Law.
   3. The introduction of participatory irrigation management by water users, establishment and
      strengthening of W UAs are the mayor results of institutional and legal improvements in
      Armenian irrigation system. By introduction of participatory irrigation management in the
      sector, the main part of irrigation management functions was transferred directly to water
      users thus increasing their independence and responsibility.
   4. 18 WUAs have been established by water users on an area of 47,355 ha in 2003 under the
      Law of the Republic of Armenia "On Water Users Associations and Federations of Water
      Users A ssociations" ( 10.09.2002) a nd ba sed on t he r espective conclusion of R egulatory
      Board in Charge of Regulation of Activities of Water Users Associations and Federations
      of Water Users Associations. Another 36 WUAs have been established in 2004 on the area
      of 86,035 ha as the next step of initiated institutional improvements through liquidation of
      closed j oint s tock c ompanies i n charge of operation of irrigation systems (at the time of
      ICR preparation there were 48 WUAs due to mergers of some of WUAs).
   5. The state-owned irrigation systems and property were transferred to water users by free of
      charge right of use according to respective resolutions of the GOA. (Resolution 314-N of
      the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated March 13, 2003 "On the Procedures for
      Transferring S tate-Owned Irrigation Systems t o W ater U sers Associations b y Free of
      Charge Use Rights and Ensuring Supervision (Control) of those Systems by Owners" and

                                                 54
       "Transfer Agreement for Passing over of State-Owned Irrigation Systems to Water Users
       Associations by Free of Charge Use Rights").
   6. WUAs took from communities 17,969 km of tertiary canals with respective structures and
      728 tubewells for operation.
   7. Prior to establishment of W UAs, water m easurements w ere carried out mainly on m ain
      and s econdary i rrigation s ystems. That pr ocess was not regulated and t ransparent.
      Measurements on t ertiary canal systems were ca rried out s poradically an d ac tually w ere
      absent. PIU specialists have developed Water Management Software (WMS) that enables
      accounting of irrigation water, a ctual l osses, irrigation fee collection and collection rates
      by each water users. So far that software is introduced in 33 WUAs.
   8. Since J anuary 1, 2005 collection of i rrigation f ee c harges ha s been made on a non-cash
      basis through banks or Armenian Post Office to increase efficiency and implement strict
      control over cash flows and eliminate cash losses.
   9. The W UAs have a lso introduced a ccounting software that i ncludes WUA a ccounting
      policy and chart of accounts. T he s oftware ha s i ts M anual w ith d escription of m ost
      common operations.
       We want to mention few figures to specify quantitatively the achievements:
   ·   The actually irrigated area has expanded by 15,200 ha (from 113,400 in 2004 to 128,600
       in 2008).
   · Irrigation fee collection rate increased by about 1,232 million AMD or by 55.7 percent
       (from 2,211 million AMD in 2004 to 3,443 million AMD in 2008).
   · Electricity consumption reduced by 27.8 million KWh or 194.7 million AMD (from 119.2
       million KWh in 2004 to 110.3 million KWh in 2008). This was due to conversion from
       pumping to gravity irrigation and consistent water accounting.
       This component also provided training, equipment and vehicles to support the institutional
development of: (a) WUFs; (b) the DIMA Enterprises; and (c) the WSA. Following is the
description of that support by items.

        a2. Training
        Training of W UA chief accountants ("Organization of t raining f or WUA Chief
Accountants, Delivery, Installation and Training of Accounting Software") was organized in 2004
under IDP f inancing. T he t raining c overed c hief a ccountants of 52 W UAs, a nd dur ation of
training course was 66 hours.
      As a n i mportant pr e-condition f or pa rticipation i n training, the chief a ccountants
nominated for training should have passed certification and assessment of their professional skills.
        Development of W UA t raining pr ogram s tarted in 2004. That pr ogram covered all the
aspects of WUA activities. To m anage t he program, a n international consultant w as hired. He
selected a group of professionals consisting of two i nternational experts a nd one l ocal t raining
expert.
       Training ne eds a ssessment was carried prior t o t raining pr ogram de velopment. The
following training topics were found to be relevant for WUAs
                                                55
    ·   WUA management
    ·   Operation and maintenance
    ·   WUA financial management
    ·   Water delivery management and accounting
    ·   Dispute resolution
    ·   Legal issues of WUAs
    ·   Accounting
         The t raining t eam de veloped training program, identified t arget groups for t raining and
elaborated t raining schedule. T he t raining t arget group i ncluded members of WUA e xecutive
staff, administrative councils, dispute resolution and supervision commissions of WUAs, sub-area
representatives.
        Implementation of the training program was divided into three main stages:
    · Development of training materials
    · Training of trainers
    · Training of WUA target groups.
      The training team developed the following training modules:
    1) Participatory training techniques
    2) C onflict resolution and management
    3) WUA governance and management
    4) Operation and maintenance planning and budgeting
    5) F inancial management
    6) Water management practical
    7) Legal issues for WUA
    8) Technical issues for WUA staff (operation and maintenance of pump stations)
        The training of trainers started i n M arch 200 5, a fter discussion and c ompletion of
developed t raining materials. Participants were from W UA S upport T eam of P IU, PIU f ield
offices. T he t raining of t rainers was carried out j ointly b y i nternational and local e xperts i n the
large hall of SCWM (the building of SCWM is located next to PIU office). Training of trainers
covered 163 trainees.
        The training of W UA s taff a nd ot her managerial bodi es s tarted i n May, 2005 a fter
completion of t raining of t rainers a nd printing of upda ted versions of training modules. Special
classrooms were prepared and equipped with equipment procured under training program to carry
out training sessions. The training of 30 W UAs was carried out in PIU field offices in October-
December 2005. It c overed 387 pe ople from W UA s taff. The training of remaining W UAs was
carried out in June-July 2006. It covered 352 pe ople from W UA staff. T he training w as c arried
out in courses of 6-day duration. The trainers of each module arrived at the training location and
carried out t heir part of training. A training t rip to Spain and Portugal w as or ganized i n M ay
2006. A 15-member team of project beneficiaries analyzed the or ganization of water s ector and
WUAs of those countries.
         Refresher training was organized in November-December 2006. 454 trainees participated
in that training. The training was organized in the Agavnadzor based of Agricultural Academy (40
km from Yerevan). Training was organized in such manner that each target group remained at the
base for several days during entire training course.
        In order to evaluate the training process, each trainee filled a pre-evaluation questionnaire
before training. Each questionnaire included 20-25 questions (the trainees were asked to select the
right answer from provided alternatives). Right after lessons the trainees were asked to fill post-
evaluation questionnaire with the same questions but in different order.

         The financial health of the sector and its future stable performance depends upon
sustainability of WUAs. This requires the intervention of full potential of Armenian executive and
legal bodies as the world experience shows that it takes dozens of years and requires continuous
monetary injections for WUAs to become self sustained.
Part D: Project Management and Design and Supervision of Tertiary Rehabilitation
         Provision of: (a) technical assistance for design and supervision of tertiary rehabilitation;
(b) equipment; and (c) financing of : (i) incremental operating costs for the PIU, including audit
services; (ii) training for formation of WUFs; and (iii) carrying out of monitoring and evaluation
activities for the Project.
         In general, the following activities were implemented under the project `
   ·   rehabilitation of 28.1 km of main and secondary canals;
   ·   increase of intake capacities from Araks River from 27 m3/s to 53 m3/s;
   ·   rehabilitation of 33 aqueducts and 34 siphons;
   ·   gravity irrigation on the area of 6,838;
   ·   construction of 214 km of tertiary irrigation system on the area of 15,300 ha.
Additional financing to IDP
       As it was sated above, 37 rehabilitation designs of tertiary irrigation systems were realized
in 20 WUAs within the frame of technical support to water users associations. The Project
covered those WUAs that expressed readiness to undertake the operation and maintenance of
                                                57
irrigation systems and ensured their input in systems rehabilitation in form of 15 percent co-
financing of civil works.
         These 37 designs were grouped into 29 civil works contracts according to funds allocated
by the Additional Financing for civil works.
         103.5 km of irrigation canals were rehabilitated during Project implementation. This
resulted in improved water delivery and water distribution over the area of 9,862 ha, saving of
23.7 million cubic meters of water due to reduced seepage losses and less electricity consumption
by 2.5 million KWh annually. Rehabilitation works covered 41 residential areas.
         The selection of contracts for implementation was carried out based on additional
applications and proposals of WUAs. In order to ensure the use of funds for the most critical
systems or their components, each proposal was thoroughly reviewed and approved after the
analysis of technical and financial parameters and ERR calculations. The ERR of each
rehabilitated tertiary irrigation system made up at least 12.5 percent.
         All the selected canals refer to tertiary irrigation system, and the civil works were only of
rehabilitation type. The improved water provision within the under command areas was achieved
exclusively through reduction of water losses after rehabilitation and not through increased intake
at the water source (main canal, secondary canal, tubewell, etc.)
         The Additional Financing supported institutional strengthening of already established and
successfully operating 20 WUAs. Rehabilitation works will enable implementation of more
efficient water management in future, ensure durability of irrigation system and reduce irrigation
costs through reduction of operation and electricity costs.

     4. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

         The taxes and counterpart financing aren't included in O&M expenses
     18
        This target for the original project for the year 2006 was set at 132,000 ha. However, experience during
     implementation showed that there are two parallel on-going processes: on the one hand, the number of hectares
     cultivated and irrigated is increasing, and on the other, farmers are switching to cultivation of higher value crops,
     cannot always afford (financially and/or in terms of manpower) to do this on the their total land plot and leave part of
     it uncultivated or under rainfed cultivated for one or a few seasons.. The new target more accurately reflects these

         In the fall of 2004, when the second stage of Irrigation development Project had to be
started, the Government of the US recognized Armenia as eligible for financing under the
Millennium Challenge Corporation Program. Right from the beginning, the MCC program was
aimed at reduction of poverty in rural areas with irrigation improvement as an instrument to
achieve that objective.
         In 2005, when MCC program was already outlined financially and technically, it became
obvious that it might continue the works initiated under IDP. More than three-fold greater
financing capabilities of MCC program surely would ensure significant advancement in the sector
and solve many problems in the crucial process of making the system self-sustainable.
         However there are concerns about interruption of leading role of the World Bank in this
crucial process. Without any depreciation of professional skills of MCC staff, one should be
realistic and accept that it can't substitute for the successful experience of the World Bank gained
during dozens of years, and which has been introduced in Armenia since 2001.
         Furthermore, now it is evident that the nature of financing preconditions set by MCC
together with price increase trends have reduced the volumes foreseen under MCC Agreement by
70 percent. The component of institutional development of the sector has been reduced and its
implementation is rather slow. There is a risk that the institutional improvements achieved under
World Bank financing may be interrupted.

 It is important to note that up until 2004 no detailed survey of the irrigation system had been made and the
levels o f d eterioration had been s everely u nderestimated i n t he p rior p roject and a t preparation.
Consequently, once an accurate survey was available, the originally estimated irrigated area of 190,000 in
reality only to some 112,300 ha.
