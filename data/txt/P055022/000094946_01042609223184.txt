EA of Irrigation Development Project                        Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The proposed Irrigation Development Project (IDP) aims primarily to rehabilitate and improve
existing irrigation schemes and infrastructures. Because it will not create new irrigation schemes or
build important new infrastructure such as dams, the IDP will not have significant impacts typically
associated with such large projects. The positive socio-economic and environmental impacts of the
IDP outweigh its potential negative impacts, which remain acceptable subject to full implementation
of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) recommended by this EA.
Positive impacts. The proposed IDP will have significant positive impacts for the farmers and
people of Armenia. It will improve agricultural output and productivity, increase income for tens of
thousands of farmers, increase the supply of water for irrigation and reduce water losses, save
millions of dollars annually in energy costs, reduce the dependence on pumping to supply irrigation
water, reduce water-logging and flooding of tens of villages and the spread of malaria in the Ararat
Valley, and safeguard human life and property for 350,000 people living below the 20 dams targeted
for safety improvement.
Potential negative impacts. For each significant negative impact associated with each
component of the proposed IDP, Table ES-1 indicates the proposed mitigation measure, its
executing agency. and its estimated capital and annual recurrent costs. The EA has also identified
other conventional or less significant impacts, such as soil and water pollution, accidents and
nuisances due to increased traffic, loss of soil fertility and soil erosion due to contractor negligence
and poor construction practices.  The EA recommends that all construction contracts contain
standard provisions requiring contractors to mitigate those conventional impacts; the estimated EMP
budget does not include the costs of such measures.
Capacity building and traininq. The EA Team recommends that the PIU designate an
Environmental Officer among its staff and form an inter-agency Environmental Committee to oversee
and monitor the EMP implementation. The Committee would comprise the Environmental Officer
(PIU) plus representatives of the Ministry of Nature Protection (EIA, water & other departments), the
Ministry of Health, the Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments Preservation, Operation and
Maintenance Enterprises, the Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute, and the Water
Problems and Hydraulics Research Institute.
The basic equipment and supplies needed to implement the EMP include computers, "sewer
televising" equipment to locate and clean logged drains, specially-equipped tractor to cut plants
along canals and collectors. far-reaching mechanical shovel/versatlie dredger, piezometers, water
and soil test kits, hydraulic monitoring stations and flow meters. and bathymetric survey equipment.
The EA team has also identified the potential need for technical assistance in designing and
implementing a hazardous waste sampling and analysis campaign, best management practices for
dredging and maintaining canals and collectors, and designing fish ladders on water intake weirs.
Capital and recurrent costs. The proposed EMP will cost about US$889,000 in capital costs
and between $137,400/year and $187,400/year in annual recurrent costs. This budget includes the
costs of certain measures that are already included in the IDP Project (P) or are already carried out
(or should be carried out) under other funds (0) (e.g., State Budget). When the costs of such
measures are subtracted, the remaining additional costs of the EMP are $810,000 for capital costs
and $49,900/year for annual recurrent costs. The mechanical shovel/versatile dredger and the
specially-equipped tractor for cutting plants cost an estimated $490,000, or over half of the total
capital costs of the EMP. The total EMP includes a budget of $50,000 to $100,000 each year for the
disposal of excavated materials (hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste inside populated
areas), or between one third and half of the total annual recurrent costs of the EMP.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents an Environmental Assessment of the proposed Irrigation
Development Project in Armenia. This introductory chapter is organized in three sections as
follows:
1. Background;
2. Terms of reference and methodology; and
3. Report organization.
1.1 Background
Since 1995, the Government of Armenia (GoA), supported by the World Bank, has
implemented the 'Irrigation Rehabilitation Project' (IRP). The IRP has included a combination of
the following interventions:
* rehabilitation works on irrigation networks, primary and secondary canals, to reduce
water losses, and on drainage canals to help evacuate excess water;
* strengthening of the institutional capability of O&M organizations aimed to clarify
their role, responsibility and accountability through reforming the enterprises
responsible for O&M and establishing and empowering Water Users Consumer
Cooperatives (WUCCs);
- conversion of selected pumping irrigation schemes into gravity schemes; and
- rehabilitation works on dams to improve their safety.
As a follow-up to the IRP, the new Irrigation Development Project (IDP) will build on the
experience, achievements and lessons learned in the process of implementing the IRP (World
Bank, PiD, 1998). Its main goal is to ensure the necessary conditions for the long-term
sustainability of water resources and good operation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and
management systems. The proposed IDP includes five components:
1 'Rehabilitation and Improvement of Irrigation and Drainage Systems,' whose aim is
to secure and maintain the operability of existing systems and to improve their
physical and operational efficiency through judiciously selected infrastructure works;
2. 'Conversion of Pumped Irrigation Systems to Gravity Irrigation Systems. whose
objective is to achieve important reductions in the cost of irrigation by shifting viable
schemes from pumping-based irrigation to gravity-based irrigation and consequently
retiring pumping system installations;
3. 'Dam Safety Improvements,' which aims to improve critical aspects of the most
dangerous dams -as determined by their technical deficiency level and size of
potential risk-- and re-establish an efficient operation and maintenance capability for
dams. An inventory of all small dams will be carried out and institutional measures,
including establishment of emergency action plans, will also be taken;
4. 'Institutional strengthening for O&M,' which aims to increase the sustainability of the
irrigation system by improving funding mechanisms and enhancing institutional
capabilities to perform the O&M function; and

5. 'Project Management,' whose objective is to strengthen the capacity of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) established under the previous Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project.
The EA will identify the potential impacts of the infrastructure components of the proposed IDP
(see Table 1) and will recommend mitigation measures.

1.2 Terms of Reference and Methodology
The proposed IDP is subject to the World Bank and Government of Armenia's
requirements for environmental assessment.  The World Bank has tentatively rated the
proposed IDP as a category "B" project subject to an Environmental Assessment (EA).
Following an international competitive tender, the Ministry of Agriculture has contracted
ECODIT, a U.S. environment and development consulting firm, to conduct the EA of the
proposed IDP.  The EA will follow World Bank operational policies on environmental
assessment (OP 4.01) and other pertinent guidelines, as well as Armenia's 1995 law on
environmental impact assessment (EIA). Specifically, the Terms of Reference for the EA call for
implementing the nine tasks listed in Box 1.
Chapter 1. Introduction                                  ECODIT, January 2000. Page 2

Box I
The Nine Tasks of the EA
1  Describe the proposed project
2. Describe the environment (baseline conditions)
i 3 Characterize the legislative and regulatory background
4  Determine potential impacts
5. Analyze alternatives to the proposed project
6. Develop a mitigation and management plan
7  Identify institutional needs to implement the EA recommendations   I
8. Develop a monitoring plan
9  Assist in the coordination and participation process
The ECODIT Team was comprised of eight national experts and four international
experts (see Appendix A for a list of the EA Team). The international members of the EA team
conducted several missions to Armenia between the months of July and September 1999.
Working with their local counterparts, they held several meetings and discussions with the PIU
staff, met with key Armenian government and non-government officials, reviewed the existing
literature, and conducted several field trips to key project areas (Armavir, Ararat valley, Vayots
Dzor, Aparan dam, etc.). Appendix B provides the list of people and organizations that we have
met.
Public Participation
As called for in Task 9 of the EA Terms of Reference, the EA must follow public
consultation procedures to seek input and feedback from the public on the proposed IDP and its

2. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN ARMENIA
After Armenia gained its independence in 1991, the deteriorating environmental
condition of the country became more apparent and environmental concerns became high
priority political issues. Environmental advocates focused on establishing a Ministry of
Environment and on passing new environmental legislation during the early years of transition
(NEAP, Main Report, 1999).   However, the severe economic decline that followed
independence hampered efforts to improve the environmental situation.
During the past few years. the Government of Armenia has again begun to focus
attention on environmental problems.  With financial assistance from  the World Bank's
Institutional Development Fund, the GoA has prepared two complementary environmental
action programs: the National Environmental Action Program (NEAP) and the Lake Sevan
Action Program (LSAP). Efforts are also underway to prepare an Integrated Water Resources
Management Plan (IWRMP). Appendix G provides more detail on those three plans.
This chapter presents the institutional and legal/regulatory framework for environmental
management in Armenia, with a particular focus on pertinent aspects for this EA. The chapter is
organized in four sections as follows:
1. Institutional setting;
2. Legal and regulatory framework;
3. Environmental monitoring; and
4. International agreements.
2.1 Institutional Setting
The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Ministry of Nature Protection (MoNP) play key
roles in water and environmental management in Armenia.  Recent changes delegated
responsibility to the MoNP for the allocation and use permitting of water resources in Armenia.
In addition, the Ministry of Health plays the lead role in controlling the spread of malaria and
other water-borne diseases. MoNP and MoH share responsibility over decisions concerning
hazardous waste management.  In addition, local and regional authorities (LRA) assume
responsibility for natural resource use and protection within their jursidiction (Map 1 shows the
administrative divisions --into marzes or provinces-- and main cities of Armenia).
2.1.1 Ministry of Agriculture
The MoA has been reorganized in the past few years.' MoA's Department of
Development of Infrastructure and Irrigation, previously the Water Management Department,
consults with an independent research organization, the Hydrology Problems and
Hydrotechnics Institute, on water quality issues. The Soil Management Department of the MoA
assesses soil quality, erosion, and salinity. This department is also responsible for soil
classification and land use. The MoA is also responsible for controlling and monitoring pesticide
use. MoA has prepared a list of agrochemicals that are permitted for import and use in
Armenia. The Agrochemistry SCJSC, a division of the MoA (66 percent privately owned, 34
percent government owned), is responsible for importing agrochemicals into Armenia.

Institutional Framework for Irrigation and Drainage Management
The following organizations are currently responsible for the operation and maintenance
(O&M) of irrigation and drainage systems in Armenia:
*  Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (OME), for primary and secondary
irrigation canals;
*  Dam Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (DOME), for dams;
*  Drainage Industrial Enterprise (DIE), for drainage systems; and
.  Water Users Consumer Cooperative (WUCC) for O&M  of tertiary and
quaternary canals, water distribution. and collection of fees.
Responsibility for tertiary irrigation has evolved significantly in th'e past 10 years. Before
Armenia's independence, village councils used to administer tertiary irrigation. From 1992 to
1997, the OME was responsible for O&M of all irrigation systems, including tertiary irrigation.
Separation of responsibility for tertiary irrigation started effectively in 1997. This significant
change followed a decision by the GoA, based on the Law of Local Self-Governance, which
recognized ownership by rural communities of tertiary irrigation canals.
WUCCs are registered non-profit organizations charged with operating and maintaining
the on-farm irrigation network (tertiary and quaternary canals), distributing irrigation water, and
collecting water charges. WUCCs are independent legal entities with their own rules and
procedures: elected board of directors, management, general assembly, bank account, seal,
etc. The PIU worked closely with farmers and village councils in different locations, to help them
to establish 105 WUCCs, mainly in the four main conveyance schemes of Artashat,
Arznishamiram, Armavir, and Talin. Later, the PIU also helped to establish 45 additional
WUCCs in northwestern Armenia (Shirak, Lori, and Aragatston). The PIU has prepared
guidance materials and provided training and technical assistance to those 150 WUCCs in such
areas as operating and maintaining of tertiary irrigation networks and accounting.
At the same time, about 350 additional WUCCs were established throughout Armenia,
mostly by government decree and without the active participation and involvement of the key
concerned stakeholders: the farmers themselves. The PIU has concerns about the ability of
those 350 WUCCs to serve the farmers effectively and efficiently.2 Box 2 summarizes the key
institutional issues concerning WUCCs in Armenia.
The OMEs continue to be responsible for operating and maintaining the primary and
secondary irrigation networks. They obtain irrigation water either directly from natural sources
(lakes, rivers) or by purchasing it from the DOME and then sell it to the WUCC (or directly to
farmers where there is no WUCC). In 1999, the operation and maintenance of the drainage
system was transferred from the OME to the Drainage Industrial Enterprise (DIE). The DIE will
eventually be responsible for drainage operation and maintenance, distribution, and collection of
drainage water fees.

Institutional Issues Concerning Water Users Consumer Cooperatives
The social assessment of the proposed IDP, as well as the PlUs experience with the IRP
since 1995, have led to several conclusions, including:
1. The legal and institutional framework for tertiary irrigation is ill defined. The RoA may E
need
-- A separate law governing WUCCs or changes to the Water Code, and
- An umbrella institution to represent the interests of all WUCCs (e.g.,
unions of WUCCs by region);-
2. The WUCCs weak management and financial capabilities. There is a need for
technical (and financial) assistance to WUCCs in such areas as accounting, O&M of
tertiary irrigation networks, and conflict resolution; and
3. Farmers are unaware of irrigation management and agriculture techniqves. Farmers
need training in such areas as irrigation management (scheduling, norms, and
methods), agro-techniques, soil management, water conservation, and agrochemical
use.

2.1.2 Ministry of Nature Protection
The Ministry of Nature Protection (MoNP) is responsible for the protection, sustainable
use, and regeneration of natural resources as well as the improvement of the environment in the
Republic of Armenia. In those areas, the MoNP's authority includes overseeing national policy
development, developing environmental standards and guidelines, and enforcement.  The
MoNP discharges those functions through the following departments:
-  Department of water resources protection;
-  Department of biological resources protection;
-  Department of land protection;
-  Department of entrails protection; and
-  Department of mineral resources protection.
The MoNP also undertakes several functions through its structural subdivisions:
.  "Armforest" SCJSC: forest management (23 forest enterprises) and Specially-
Protected Nature Areas (14 state reservations);
*  State  Environmental  Inspectorate  (SEI)  and  11  Regional  Environmental
Inspectorates: oversee the implementation of legislative and regulatory standards in
natural resources protection, use and regeneration;
.  State  Environmental Assessment Expertise  (i.e., EIA  department): conduct
environmental asessments.
The Hazardous Substances and Waste Management Division regulates the
transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Because there are no hazardous waste
landfills in Armenia, domestic waste, hazardous waste, and construction debris are all currently
dumped primarily at the Yerevan municipal landfill, the Nubarishen (Sovietashen) Landfill.
Table 2 indicates the fees to be paid to the State Budget for land disposal of solid waste of

costs as well as direct "tipping fees" to the landfill operator.

Presently, Armenia does not have a national environmental fund.  Generators of
hazardous waste need to notify the MoNP of any intended hazardous waste disposal
operations. Disposal requires a decree by the Government of Armenia classifying the waste
and specifying the disposal method.
2.2 Legal and Regulatory Framework
Although effective environmental policy is not yet in place in Armenia, a number of laws
and decrees were promulgated to regulate water use and protect the environment.  The
following laws and statutes govern natural resource use and biodiversity conservation in
Armenia and are of particular relevance for this EA:
  Law on the Principles of Environmental Protection (1991);
*  Law on Specially-Protected Nature Areas (1991);
*  Water Code (1992);
*  Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (1995);
*  Law on Payments for Nature Protection and Use of Natural Resources (1998); and
*  Law on Flora (1998) and draft Law on Fauna.
2.2.1 Law on the Principles of Environmental Protection (GoA, 1991)
The Law on the Principles of Environmental Protection (1991) outlines the environmental
protection policy of the Republic of Armenia. Its purpose is to ensure state regulation of
environmental protection and use within the territory of the Republic of Armenia. It provides a
legal basis for the developminent of environmental legislation regulating the protection and use of
entrails, forest, water, flora and fauna, and the atmosphere.

According to Order 80/1999 by the Minister of Nature Protection, special water use
permits from the MoNP are required for certain specific water uses. including: water intakes
from surface or ground water, disposal of drainage water in rivers. and disposal of dredged
sediments (and runoff waters) from drainage collectors. Appendix C contains a copy of the
special water use permit application form.
2.2.4 Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (GoA, 1995)
The Armenian Environmental Impact Assessment Act (EIA Act), passed in 1995,
contains the standard steps of the EIA process for various projects and activities in Armenia.
The Armenian EIA Act is generally consistent with the EIA approaches followed by international
conventions and development assistance agencies (e.g., World Bank, USAID, and EU). With
this Act, Armenia has taken steps toward integrating environmental concerns into the decision-
making and development process.
2.2.5 Law on Flora (1998) and Draft Law on Fauna
The Law on Flora (1998) and the draft Law on Fauna outline the Republics policies for
the conservation, protection, use, regeneration, and management of natural populations of
plants and animals, and for regulating the impact of human activities on biodiversity. These
laws aim for the sustainable protection and use of flora and fauna and the conservation of
biodiversity. There are provisions for assessing and monitoring species, especially rare and
threatened species.
2.2.6 Environmental decree on fisheries (Decree No. 687) (1991)
Decree No. 687 (passed December 19, 1991) aims to preserve select surface water
bodies of fishing economic value and to improve their ecological situation in the future. The
Decree lists six lakes (including Lake Sevan), 13 reservoirs, 18 rivers, plus all rivers flowing into
Lake Sevan as covered by the Decree.
2.2.7 Water quality standards
Armenia has adopted various water quality standards from the former Soviet Union,
including the following:
e  Drinking Water Quality Standards (GOST No. 2472-82 and 29183-93). This
norm pertains to microbiological, chemical, and physical contaminants in
drinking water, measured at the consumer's tap.
  Water Supply Sources (L.I. Zhukova, "Ecologia", Saint Petersburg, 1999).
This norm pertains to water quality measured at the source (ground water or
surface water) (see Table 4). The use of water for different purposes and the
treatment requirements depend on the source quality. Water sources are
divided into six categories, with Category I being the cleanest. The Ministry
of Health has the final decision in the selection of water sources. Historically,
the best quality water has been selected regardless of operational
considerations (NEAP, WG4, 1998).

Guidelines for irrigation water quality
Strict guidelines for irrigation water quality do not exist in Armenia. As a reference, this
EA uses FAO's guidelines for the interpretation of water quality destined for irrigation (see Table
5 for a summary of those guidelines). The guidelines use the following two key parameters,
which define possible restrictions regarding crop water availability and infiltration:
* Salinity, either measured directly by the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS, mg/)) or
indirectly by the Electric Conductivity (EC); and
i Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR, unit-less).
Sanitary flow
The Armenian regulations call for maintaining a minimum flow ("sanitary flow") in
rivers to protect human health and the environment. While no specific methods to
estimate sanitary flows are prescribed by law, Armenian agencies generally use the
"Guidelines for Regulating Minimal Water Flow in Rivers for Nature Protection" (Minsk.
1997). The guidelines refer to the histogram of "natural" monthly flows based on flows
recorded by the nearest monitoring stations. Roughly speaking. they suggest setting the
sanitary flow level equal to 75 percent of the g5th percentile of previously recorded
monthly water flow levels. That is, the monthly sanitary flow is set equal to 0.75 times
the monthly flow that has been exceeded during 95 percent of all past months for which
the flows were recorded. The guidelines also suggest taking into consideration other
factors. such as climate and localized geomorphology. For illustration, Appendix G
(Section G.2) describes how the sanitary flow was set at 100 million gallons per day
(MGD) for the Potomac River (near Washington, D.C.), downstream of Little Falls dam.
taking into consideration competing demands for water and the potential impacts on the
most sensitive fish species.

2.3 Environmental Monitoring
Different institutions are in charge of monitoring water quantity and quality and soil
quality in the Republic of Armenia, as explained below.  Box 3 describes current issues
associated with the monitoring of irrigation water quantity.
Box 3
Measuring Irrigation Water Quantities
Measurement of irrigation water poses various challenges Traditionally. the
Operation and Maintenance Enterprises (OMEs) have installed flow meters to measure
the flow (m /s) and hence calculate the volume of water sold to the Water Users
Consumer Cooperatives (WUCCs). However, farmers don't trust or understand the
calculation of amounts purchased based on measured flows and prefer the use of volume
meters (m3). The PIU will install volume meters to avoid this difficulty.
However, it would not be feasible to install flow or volume meters at the farm
level. Typically, the water master controls the length of time the gate remains open to a
farmer's plot. The amount of water delivered to the farmer then is calculated by
multiplying the water flow (through the gate) by the length of time that the gate was open.
The water master allocates water on an equity basis as a function of several factors:
I surface area of cultivated land, crop requirements, and irrigation norms. Estimating water
amounts delivered to each plot is more difficult now because privatization has resulted in
small land plots (between 0.75 and 1.5 ha per plot). The ongoing consolidation of plots
into larger parcels should simplify water allocation at the farm level.

2.3.1  Water quantity
The Hydrology and Water Resources Center, a division of Armhydromet, measures
water flows and levels at 101 monitoring stations throughout Armenia. Currently, 98 of those
101 stations are in operation (91 for rivers, three for reservoirs, and four for Lake Sevan) and
measure water level and temperature twice a day (morning and evening). The measurements
at 19 key stations are reported daily to the MoA, MoNP, and Ministry of Energy (MoE). In
contrast to the water level, water flow is measured 25 to 30 times during the year. Water flow
measurements are more frequent in the spring due to the wide variations brought about by the
melting snow.   The water level is measured  automatically at 24 stations.   Turbidity
measurements are made every 5 days for rivers (91 stations) and Lake Sevan (four stations).
Armhydromet has developed frequency distributions of river flows (average, 50th percentile, 75th
percentile, etc.) based on measured values at most of these river locations over the past 10 or
more years. Several of these monitoring stations provide crucial data to assess the availability
of water to support the proposed irrigation conversion schemes (see Chapter 5).
Lake Sevan
In addition, Armhydromet measures air temperature and water temperature at varying
depths at 17 fixed points on Lake Sevan. Turbidity, wind, relative humidity, air temperature, and
other parameters are recorded, and the evaporation of the lake is calculated. Armhydromet

measures river flow for 15 of the 28 rivers flowing into Lake Sevan and rainfall precipitation at
10 of those 15 stations. Armhydromet also measures flow from the Arpa-Sevan tunnel into
Lake Sevan and water outflow from  Lake Sevan into the Hrazdan River.  Using the
measurements for Lake Sevan, Armhydromet calculates the monthly water balance of the Lake
and reports those monthly balances to the Government. MoE, MoA. and MoNP.
2.3.2 Water quality
The MoNP Monitoring Center is the main agency responsible for monitoring the quality
of surface water as well as the quantity and quality of ground water. Previously, surface water
quality was monitored on a regular basis at the 101 monitoring stations mentioned in the
previous section (water quantity). However, due to the dire economic situation after Armenia's
independence in 1991, surface water has been monitored much less frequently and at fewer
stations.
In addition to the MoNP, the Institute of Hydroecology and Ichthyology (Academy of
Sciences) also monitors the water quality of Lake Sevan and its tributaries at 108 monitoring
points: 36 monitoring points in Lake Sevan and three monitoring points on each of the 24 rivers
that flow into the lake. However, only 11 of those monitoring points have been used since 1991.
Finally, MoA's Drainage Industrial Enterprise monitors the quantity and quality of
irrigation water and its suitability for irrigation, and presents its findings annually as part of the
Cadaster on "Soil Meliorative Status". Due to the lack of financial resources. irrigation-water
quality has not been monitored adequately since 1992.
2.3.3 Water and soil in the Ararat Valley
The "Monitoring and Control of the Rehabilitated State of Irrigated Lands in the Republic
of Armenia," a State Closed Joint Stock Company (SCJSC), monitors water and soil conditions
at 36 hydro-observation posts. The Company monitors drainage conditions, water flow, and
water quality at these observation posts. Every quarter (three months), the Company analyzes
ground water, drainage water, and irrigation water and computes SAR and the C1/S04 ratio to
determine if the water is suitable for irrigation.
In 1998, the IRP/PIU and the Company developed a computer database and mapping
system to assist with water and soil management as part of Armenia's Irrigation Rehabilitation
project. In particular, with the technical assistance of the Company, the PIU has prepared a
digitized map of the Ararat Valley, including information on wells (depth, construction details,
discharge rates) and the location of collectors, drains, and canals. Information on aquifer depth,
ground water salinity, and water chemical quality levels is available but has not been entered
into the computer system. The ECODIT Team has entered some of that information for this EA
(see Section 4.3).
2.4 International Agreements
The Republic of Armenia is a party to several agreements with bordering countries on
sharing water resources.  The RoA has also signed and/or ratified several international
environmental conventions.

2.4.1 International waterways
Araks River
In 1928, the USSR and Turkey signed an agreement for monitoring water flow and
limiting the volume of water withdrawn from the Akhurian and Araks rivers. The agreement
provides a legal basis for Armenia and Turkey to construct water intakes capable of withdrawing
53 m3/s from the Araks River. Turkey carried out the reconstruction of headwork structures in
the 1980s. However, Armenia has not carried out the reconstruction and therefore has not been
able to withdraw its maximum allowable volume. A component of the IDP would increase the
capacity of the water intake on the Armenian side to 53 m3/s (see Section 4.1). The agreement
also called for maintaining a minimum "sanitary" flow of 5 m3/s in the Akhurian and Araks Rivers.
Further downstream, Armenia and Iran have discussed monitoring and usage of water
from the Araks River where it borders the two countries. A draft agreement has been prepared
jointly but has not yet been signed yet.3
Vorotan River
The Vorotan River, which the Government of Armenia plans to divert partially to Lake
Sevan, flows from Armenia to Azerbaijan. Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, a decision
entitled "On the Project of Bazarchai Reservoir in Azerbaian SSR," allowed Armenia to divert a
portion of the water from the Vorotan (Bazarchai) River, prior to flowing into Azerbaijan. The
decision provided that, in years of average flow, water from the Vorotan river would be divided
equally between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In years of deficit flow, Armenia would provide a
minimum "sanitary' discharge of 1.0 m3/s. However, since 1991, the decision has not been
honored. Armenia currently monitors the flow at several points along the Vorotan river, but no
new agreements with Azerbaijan are under negotiation.
Debet River
There have been discussions between Armenia and Georgia (Tblisi, November 1998) on
the monitoring and use of water from the Debet River, a tributary of the Kur River. The Kur River
flows north from Armenia to Georgia, and ultimately east to Azerbaijan. Any decisions by
Armenia or Georgia that have an impact upon the Kur River flow should therefore include
Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan did not attend the meeting, and no agreement has yet been reached.4
2.4.2 International conventions
Armenia became a signatory to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance on July 6, 1993. Two sites in Armenia are included on the Ramsar list: Lake Sevan
and its basin (489,100 hectares) and Lake Arpi and its surrounding bogs (3,139 ha.). However,
despite the importance of these sites, little has been done to protect them under the Ramsar
Convention (State of the Environment Report, 1998). There are no sites on the Ramsar list in
the Ararat Valley.

3. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION
This chapter presents an overview of environmental conditions prevailing in Armenia,
with a focus on environmental aspects of concern for this EA. Chapters 4 to 6 will describe
those environmental conditions that are specific to individual components of the IDP project.
This chapter is organized in two sections:
1. Socio-economic environment: and
2. Physical and biological environment.
3.1 Socio-Economic Environment
Armenia suffered a catastrophic earthquake in 1988, and shortly after, shut down its
nuclear power plant due to safety concerns. The closing of the power plant, which supplied
about 35 percent of the nation's electricity, had a sever impact on Armenia's infrastructure and
industrial capacity. With the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Armenian
economy collapsed (Kurkjian, 1999). Between 1991 and 1993, Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
decreased by about 60 percent (World Bank Group, 1998). Since the eruption of the Nagorno-
Karabagh war in 1988, Azerbaijan and Turkey have blockaded Armenia, compounding the
shortages of energy, fuel, and raw materials (World Bank Group, 1998). Industry has been
operating at vastly reduced levels due to those shortages and reduced markets, which resulted
from the fragmentation of the centralized economy of the Soviet Union.
This section describes the following socio-economic conditions:
.  Population;
*  Water uses;
.  Agriculture;
*  Fisheries:
*  Environmental health; and
*  Historic and cultural heritage.
3.1.1 Population
While the 1989 Census indicated a total population of 3.28 million, population estimates
for subsequent years vary from one data source to another (see Figure 1). While the NEAP
indicates a steady decline in population after independence due to migration, official statistics
show a steady increase. For example, population estimates range from 3 million (NEAP, WG4,
1998) to 3.78 million (Statistical Bureau) for 1996 and between 2.8 and 3.8 million for 1999
(Ministry of Statistics). According to official statistics, the percentage of people living in urban
areas has decreased from 68 percent in 1989 to 67 percent in 1999 (Ministry of Statistics, Book
on the New Administrative Regions of Armenia, September 1999); Yerevan is the largest city
(1.25 million as of 1/1/99), followed by Gyumri (211,700) and Vanadzor (172,700).
The proposed IDP project will improve economic, health, and quality of life conditions for
a large percentage of the population. For example, the 631,000 inhabitants of the Ararat Valley
(17 percent of the population) will benefit, either directly or indirectly, from the reconstruction of
the Hoktemberian canal and increase of intake from the Araks river as well as the rehabilitation
and improvement of the Ararat Valley drainage infrastructure. Another 350,000 people will live
under improved safety conditions due to safety improvement at the 20 targeted dams.

3.1.2 Water uses
Total water use in Armenia has increased steadily from 1966 to 1990. but has dropped
to 16 billion m3 during the five-year period 1991-1995 (see Figure 2). Irrigation is by far the
largest water use sector, consuming 76 percent of all water used in Armenia in the period 1990-
1995. Industrial water use peaked in the 1980s, but dropped sharply after 1990 due to the
decline of industrial operations.

3.1.3 Agriculture
Agriculture uses about 47 percent (or 1,391.000 ha) of Armenia's total land area. with
grazing accounting for about half of the agricultural land use. The remaining agricultural land is
distributed among the following categories as listed below (Ministry of Agriculture. "RoA
Agrofood System Reform Project for 1998-2002, Yerevan. 1998, p.9):
*  Arable land (494.300 ha)-
*  Fruit orchards and vineyards (63,800 ha);
*  Hay fields (138,900 ha);
*  Pasture (694,000 ha); and
*  Fallow land (800 ha).
Cultivated land is typically located at elevations ranging from 600 m to 2,500 m.
The relative importance of the agricultural sector in the economy has grown since
independence due to the decline of industrial production. Furthermore, there has been a shift
from marketable cash crops to subsistence crops and the efficiency of agricultural land has
been reduced (NEAP, WG6, 1997). Figure 3 shows the evolution from the 1986-1988 period to
the 1996-1998 period of the surface area cultivated (ha/yr), the total annual production
(tonnes/yr), and the annual yield (tonne/ha/yr.) for vegetables. Figure 3 distinguishes between
vegetable growing in the Ararat Valley, the rest of Armenia, and Armenia overall. Between the
period 1986-988 and the period 1996-1998, the overall surface area cultivated with vegetables
increased by 13 percent (from 17,950 ha to 20,281 ha) but total vegetable production decreased
by 30 percent (from 559,000 tonnes to 393,000 tonnes) and yield decreased by 37 percent
(from 30.9 tonnes/ha to 19.4 tonnes/ha).
The lack of technology and training, the deterioration of the irrigation systems, the
salinization of agricultural soils, and the high cost of operation have contributed to the reduction
in crop yields. Land privatization has not yet had the anticipated positive impacts (see Box 4).
Box4
Land Privatization in Armenia
Started in 1991, the speed of land privatization in Armenia was unprecedented in
the former Soviet Union (NEAP, Main Report, 1999). In 1991-1992, 80 percent of the
I land and 713 collective farms (out of 861) were privatized (NEAP, WG4, 1998). Ninety-
nine percent of the arabie land and 79 percent of perennial orchards were either
privatized or targeted for privatization by 1994 (NEAP, WG6, 1997). The privatization
has had no immediate positive impact on agricultural production; rather it appears that he
efficiency and sustainability of agricultural land use have been reduced.
As of January 1, 1999, the privatization of agricultural land had created 333,810
small land farmers. The average plot sizes are 0.91 ha for arable land and 0.15 ha for an
orchard plot. To enable equitable distribution of land of variable quality among villagers,
some plots owned by the same farmer are as far apart as 15 km (NEAP, WG6, 1997).
Yields of all crops have declined due to the lack of experience and training of small land
farmers, combined with the deteriorating irrigation systems, high prices of pesticides and
fertilizers, high costs of automated practices, and difficulties associated with the use of
1 agricultural machinery on small, scaKtered farms.

3.1.4 Fisheries (numbers and figure may need to be revised and corrected)
Fish are produced primarily from Lake Sevan and commercial fisheries in the Ararat
Valley. Total fish production peaked in 1995 at an output of 7.555 tonnes and $10.75 million
and has declined steadily ever since (see Figure 4). In 1998. total fish production was only
1,284 tonnes (83 percent reduction compared to 1990), valued at $1.2 million. The decline of
fisheries is more marked in the Ararat valley, where it went from 6.274 tonnes in 1990 to 70
tonnes in 1998. The main reason for this decline is the reduction in the supply of fish food. To
remedy this situation, the Government has converted the Department of Fisheries into a State
Closed Joirit Stock Company, 'Haydzuk". with a more streamlined staff of 12 employees (one-
fourth of the Department's staff). Another explanation of the decline in fish production is the
loss of the Russian export markets (NEAP, WG4, 1998). About 66. percent (200 ha) of the
fisheries in the Ararat valley have been privatized.

3.1.5 Environmental health
Malaria has re-emerged in the Ararat Valley starting from 1996. In thel950s. wetlands
in the Ararat Valley were drained and mosquitoes and malaria disappeared. From 1963 until
1996, there were no reported cases of malaria (NEAP. WG2, 1998). However, environmental
degradation of the Ararat Valley and the lack of O&M of irrigation and drainage systems have
provided ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In 1996, 143 cases of malaria were reported
in the Ararat and Armavir regions (Table 6), most of them (105 cases) in the low-lying Masis
region. There have been no reports of malaria-related deaths.

The number of reported malaria cases has increased to 1.023 in 1997. There were 542
reported cases in 1998 and 208 cases in the first half of 1999. However, the number of cases
varies from one source to another (Epidemiological Newsletter, June, 1999; Marietta Makarian,
Azg Newspaper, July 14, 1999). The Government of Armenia is committed to preventing and
treating malaria (Decree 208). Recently (March 19, 1999), the Ministry of Health organized a
meeting, The Struggle against Malaria in Armenia, to coordinate national efforts against malaria.
Participants urged the GoA to commit funds to restore and rehabilitate the Ararat Valley
drainage system.
In addition to malaria, the NEAP identified several environmental health concerns
associated with the following activities:
. Discharge of fertilizers and agrochemicals, leading to pollution of
water resources;
. Inadequate maintenance of the water supply system, leading to
contamination from sewage;
. Emissions of lead from mobile sources that impact human health
(e.g., accumulate in crops and pass on to humans);
* Deforestation that exacerbates soil erosion and decreases soil fertility;
* Ineffective management of industrial and household wastes that leads
to pollution of soil and water; and
* Extensive use of pesticides that pass through mother's breast milk to
infants (see Box 5 on the use of pesticides and fertiiizers in Armenia).

Box 5
Use of Pesticides and Fertilizers in Armenia
Pesticides are available in Armenia, but have become quite expensive. There are stockpiles of
outdated pesticides leftover from the Soviet period (imported primarily from Russia and Georgia). The
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for monitoring and controlling pesticide use; however, there is little
icontrol in practice. Armenia is using mainly three types of pesticides: Arrivo, Gezagard (herbicide), and
Ridomil (fungicide).5 Quantities of pesticides imported have remained relatively constant in the past three
years (15-30 tonnes/yr) and significantly less than prior to 1991 (800-1,000 tonnes/yr). The limiting factor
for imports is the low demand. Farmers can not afford to purchase chemicals and thus apply only
minimal amounts of agrochemicals, especially in the Ararat Valley. During the Soviet period, pesticides
were extensively applied (equivalent of 9 kg/ha).
Many pesticides, such as DDT. have been restricted in Armenia and the former Soviet Union
since the mid-1970s. According to the MoA, DDT has not been used for agricuitural purposes since its
restriction  Pesticides have been used in the Ararat Valley in the past two years as a cheap and effective
way to combat malaria.6 No information was provided to the EA team on the quantities and locations of
such pesticide applications.
Mineral fertilizers are mostly imported from Georgia. Armenia is also using fertilizers that have
been stockpiled since the early 1990s. About 25,000 tonnes of fertilizers have been imported from
January through August 1999 (or about 40,000 tonnes for the year). Prior to 1991, over 100,000 tonnes
of fertilizers were applied annually in Armenia (KBN Engineering, 1995).
3.1.6 Historic and cultural heritage
Armenia is one of the oldest centers of civilization and has a unique historic, religious,
and cultural heritage. Records of such heritage include scripts from the ninth to the sixth
century B.C. (State of Urartu, Araratian). The Constitution, the Law on the Conservation and
Use of Fixed Historic-Cultural Monuments, the Codes on Land, Water and Entrails, and other
legal acts provide for the protection of the historic and cultural monuments of the RoA. The
Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments Preservation (DHCMP) is responsible for the
protection and use of the historic and cultural monuments of the RoA. According to the Law on
the Conservation and Use of Fixed Historic-Cultural Monuments (Article 15), special emergency
measures would be required to protect historic and cultural monuments, especially the following
six irrigation schemes under the second component of the IDP (conversion of irrigation schemes
from pumping to gravity):
*  Scheme #7: Amrakits scheme
*  Scheme #9: Shirak 8 water intake stations
*  Scheme #10: Ohanavan-Karbi scheme
*  Scheme #13: Vayots Dzor scheme
*  Scheme #17: Tsav-Shikahogh scheme (in particular water intake)
*  Scheme #18: Meghri scheme (water intake).
Article 22 requires that the Contractor must agree on such measures in advance with the
DHCMP and pay for their implementation.

3.2 Physical and Biological Environment
With a surface area of 29,740 kM2, Armenia is the smallest of the former Soviet
republics. The country is mountainous, with 72 percent of the land at altitudes greater than
1,500 meters above sea level (masl) and a maximum altitude of 4.095 masl (Mount Aragatz).
Only 24 percent of the land has slopes of 3 degrees or less (NEAP, WG6, 1997). In spite of its
relatively small size, Armenia's diverse landform and climate have given rise to a large variety of
ecosystems.
3.2.1 Climate
Annual precipitation in Armenia ranges from 1,000 mm in the mountains to less than 300
mm in the Ararat Valley (see Map 4). Most of the precipitation occurs during April and May,
while the least amount of rainfall occurs from July to September, during the peak of the growing
season. Figure 5 shows average (1990-1998) monthly temperature and precipitation levels
recorded at three select stations of particular importance for this EA: Armavir, Ararat, and
Yeghegnadzor.  In those areas, summer months (July-August) are generally hot (with
temperatures as high as 400C in certain areas) while winters are cold and snowy (with sub-
freezing average temperatures in January and February).
3.2.2 Water resources quantity
Armenia has sufficient water resources overall to meet demand, now and in the
foreseeable future. However. water resources are unevenly distributed across the country and
during the year. Some regions suffer from lack of water, while others have ample resources.
Over 200,000 people (about 5 percent of the population) live in areas where water shortage
(see Map 5) restrains regional development (NEAP, Main Report, 1999). The following areas
experience water shortages (NEAP, WG4, 1998):
*  Basins of the Meghri river;
*  North-western and western slopes of Mount of Aragats; and
*  Upper reaches of the Araks basin in Vayot Dzor region.
In other parts of the country, the water resources are available but there are inadequate
water storage facilities.  Other shortcomings in the water supply system  are inadequate
infrastructure for transporting water to users, poor operation and maintenance, leakage, and
water use inefficiencies.
Surface water
Melting snow, rainfall, and ground water replenish surface water resources. River flows
fluctuate widely during the year.  In the summer (June-August) and autumn (September-
November), when the water demand is at its peak, only about one fourth of the yearly flow is
available. In the winter (December-March), the flow is around 10-12 percent of the yearly total,
while in spring (April-June) it ranges between 55 and 70 percent of yearly flow. Water
reservoirs have been constructed with a total capacity of about 900 million m3 (NEAP, WG4.
1998). Six reservoirs are important sources of hydropower generation. Only one reservoir, the
Mantash Reservoir, provides drinking water in addition to irrigation water.

There are seven big rivers in Armenia, each longer than 100 km. About 11,800 rivers
and streams are less than 10 km long. There are two main watersheds in Armenia, which drain
into the Kur River (watershed 700 kM2) and the Araks River (watershed 22,790 kM2).
The lakes in Armenia are relatively small with the exception of Lake Sevan, which had a
surface area of 1,416 km2 before the lowering of its level (1,210 km2 at present) and a
watershed area of about 4,900 km2 (16 percent of total surface area). This highland source of
freshwater provides a significant amount of hydropower and irrigation water to croplands in the
Ararat Valley.
Ground water
Available ground water resources are unevenly distributed throughout Armenia. About
70 percent of all water resources drain to the Ararat Valley (State of the Environment Report,
1998). There are three hydraulically interconnected aquifers in the Ararat Valley, located at a
depth of 40 to 300 meters below the surface (see Section 4.3 for more details). The lower
aquifer (artesian in parts of the valley) is mainly used for drinking water supply: the upper
aquifer (down to 40 mbsl) is used for irrigation.
Irrigation networks built in the 40s-50s (Artashat canal, Lower Hrazdan canal.
Hoktemberien canal) have led to the rise of the ground water table in the Ararat Valley. To
lower the ground water table, open and closed drainage systems were built starting from the
50s-60s. However, ground water levels have risen again in the nineties due to the lack of
maintenance and cleaning of the drainage systems and insufficient pumping of drainage water
(see Section 4.3). This has led to waterlogging and swamping over a large area and the re-
emergence of malaria (see Section 3.1.5). The high level of the water table has also led to
secondary salinization and alkalization of the soils.
Availability and efficiency of irrigation water
Prior to 1990, nearly 80 percent of the agricultural land was irrigated. In 1995, 172,600
ha were irrigated, compared to 311,000 ha in 1985 (45 percent reduction). The use of irrigation
water has dropped from 2.14 billion m3 in 1990 to 0.64 billion m3 in 1995. This reduction is due
primarily to economic factors, in particular the decline in purchasing power and the collapse of
the Soviet Union (NEAP, WG4, 1998). Further, the irrigation infrastructure is deteriorating and
pumping is intermittent. In 1990, approximately 42 percent of the irrigated land depended on
pumping for its water supply.
The irrigation efficiency is less than 45 percent on average and as low as 30 percent in
some areas. Due to the blockade of Armenia, farmers have shifted to growing crops that are
required to ensure food self-sufficiency and do not depend on export markets. The structural
problems of the sector have lead to loss of income to farmers and increased poverty among the
farmers' community (NEAP, WG4, 1998).
3.2.3 Water resources quality
As indicated previously (see Section 3.1.2), industrial and agricultural uses of water
resources peaked in the mid-eighties (State of the Environment Report, 1998). Since then,
water uses and associated pollution loads from agricultural and industrial activities have fallen.
However. surface waters continue to receive relatively large pollution loads due to inadequate
sewage and industrial waste treatment and agricultural and urban runoff. In 1996, less than 60

percent of the sewage generated in Yerevan was treated at the Yerevan Wastewater Treatment
Facility (Melkonian, 1996). Adequate treatment was not available for the remaining 40 percent
of sewage due to missing equipment, insufficient energy supply, and poor economic conditions.
Consequently. approximately 600,000 m3/day of raw and partially treated sewage are
discharged into the nearby Hrazdan river. In 1990, BOD5 levels in the Hrazdan River in
Yerevan were as high as 19.8 mg/l (NEAP, WG4, 1998). Map 6 shows the water quality (high.
medium, and low) of main rivers (by segment) in Armenia.
More than 100 tonnes/yr. of heavy metals are estimated to enter Lake Sevan through its
28 tributaries, agricultural runoff, industrial and municipal discharges. and atmospheric
deposition (Hovhannisyan, 1996). From 1977-1990, five to 10 tons of toxic compounds from 34
pesticides entered Lake Sevan (Hovhannisyan, 1996). In addition, 24 million m3 of sewage are
discharged into the lake annually, of which only about 7 percent are treated (Gharabegian,
1994) and introducing 84 tonnes of oil products, 490 tonnes of magnesium, and 4 tonnes of
copper each year (Narimanyan, 1996).
The Hrazdan River flows southeast from Lake Sevan through Yerevan to Masis in the
Ararat Valley. Near Masis, a portion of the water is diverted to the Mkhchian pumping station
and transferred several kilometers northeast for use in irrigation. In the early 1990s, 270 Mm3 of
water from Lake Sevan was used for irrigation. Figure 6 indicates monthly averages (1986-
1990) of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels measured by three monitoring stations on the
Hrazdan River: Lusakert near Charentsevan (downstream of Hrazdan City), Yerevan just below
Lake Yerevan, and Masis upstream of Masis Village.

Deep groundwater resources are of high quality and are well protected from pollution
due to:
  Depth (down to 300 m):
*  Thick clay layers that overlay the lower aquifer; and
*  Artesian upward pressure that prevents pollution from entering the lower aquifers.
In parts of the central Ararat Valley, TDS values exceed drinking water norms (over
1,000 mg/I; see, for example, Table G-1). Unlike the deep aquifers, shallow groundwater
resources may become contaminated from industrial discharges, agricultural activities, waste
dumps, improper landfilling, and mining activities.
3.2.4 Soil resources
Despite its relatively small size, Armenia has a wide variety of soil types and a diverse
geomorphology. However, most of the land is not suitable for agriculture. The Ararat Valley
produces 40 to 45 percent of the agricultural output of Armenia. The soils of the Ararat Valley,
predominantly clay and clay-sand, have been cultivated and irrigated for centuries.
Poor land management and weak regulations have led to environmental deterioration in
the form of soil erosion, compaction, salinization and contamination. Natural processes, such
as landslides, flash floods, and strong winds have further deteriorated soil conditions. Soils are
polluted by the uncontrolled use of pesticides, industrial discharges, atmospheric deposition,
and improper waste disposal. Although the extent of soil pollution has not been adequately
delineated, certain industrial areas are suspected of containing high concentrations of metals.
Soil erosion, mainly caused by poor agricultural practices and over-grazing, is
progressing at an alarming rate and is a major problem for about 60 percent of agricultural land
(NEAP, Main Report, 1999). Total soil loss in Armenia is estimated to be approximately 8
million tonnes/yr, corresponding to 0.3 tonnes/ha/yr.
3.2.5 Specially-Protected Nature Areas
Special protection of nature areas in Armenia started in 1958. Currently, there are five
State Reserves, 22 State Reservations, one National Park and many, non-inventoried nature
monuments (see Section 2.2.2). The network of specially-protected nature areas (excluding
nature monuments) currently covers a total area of approximately 311,000 hectares (about 10
percent of the national territory) and includes sites of importance to regional ecological
conservation (NEAP, Main Report, 1999). Table 7 indicates which IDP project areas are within
or adjacent to a specially-protected nature area.
State Reserves are established to provide the highest levels of protection for important
habitats and species and correspori to IUCN category la. In these areas, human activity is
limited to scientific research. The five State Reserves (Khosrov, Dilijan, Shikahogh, Erebuni,
and Sev Lich) cover an area of about 68,000 hectares (2.3 percent of the country) (see Map 2).
State Reservations were established in the period 1950-1970 (See Map 3). Economic
activities are allowed in State Reservations as long as they do not conflict with the objectives of
the reservation. Of the 22 State Reservations, 15 are managed by the MoNP, six by by the
MoA and one by the Institue of Physics.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                             Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
The only National Park in Armenia was established in 1978 to protect Lake Sevan and
its surrounding area (see Map 2). The Park covers a total area of 150,100 ha, including 24,800
ha of land. The Sevan National Park is managed by the MoNP.
The RoA is rich in nature monuments, some of which have international recognition.
Although there is no official listing of nature monuments, preliminary lists have been developed.
In addition to the Law on Specially-Protected Nature Areas, other laws and conventions regulate
the protection of nature monuments, including the RoA Code on Entrails (Article 18), the RoA
Water Code (Article 60), the RoA Land Code (Article 50), and the Convention on the Protection
of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1993).

Wetlands
Natural processes (e.g., seasonal fluctuations of water levels) and human activities
(water drainage and peat mining) negatively affect wetlands and may result in the reduction of
biological diversity.  Around 20,000 ha of wetland sites have been drained in Armenia
Chapter 3. Baseline Environmental Situation                    ECODIT, January 2000, Page 29



EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
(Biodiversity of Armenia, First National Report, 1999). About 140 species of vertebrates are
ecologically dependent on wetlands in Armenia. There are 22 families and about 100 species of
wetland birds (State of the Environment Report, 1988). Map 7 depicts the location of main
wetlands and fisheries. Box 6 summarizes the link between the IDP project areas and the two
Ramsar sites in Armenia.
Box 6
Link Between IDP Project Areas and Ramsar Convention Sites
As explained in Section 2.4.2, there are only two sites in Armenia on the
Ramsar list: Lake Sevan and its watershed basin (489,100 ha total) and Lake
Arpi and its surrounding bogs (3,139 ha total). There are no sites on the Ramsar
list in the Ararat Valley. The Vardenis irrigation scheme (#12), which would be
converted from pumping to gravity, is the only project area within the Lake Sevan
basin. The Vardenis scheme lies in the area of the old Lake Gilli, which was
drained by the government in 1960. Appendix G (Section G.5) describes the
draining of Lake Gilli, its impacts, and ongoing plans to restore the lake. None of I
the IDP project areas are within or adjacent to Lake Arpi, the second Ramsar site
in Armenia.
Armavir and Ararat Valley
Previously, there were more than 1,500 km2 (150,790 ha) of wetlands and swamps in
the Ararat Valley, resulting from the upward pressure of the groundwater and the flooding of the
Araks River. These wetlands were breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying malaria. From
1953 to 1955, wetlands were drained and transformed into agricultural lands.  With the
disappearance of wetlands, malaria mosquitoes perished. However, several wildlife species
and large-scale wetland vegetation also disappeared and there were significant changes in the
habitat and distribution of migrating birds (NEAP, WG2, 1998).
3.2.6 Fauna/Flora and landscape diversity
Due to the diversity of altitudes, climates and landscapes, Armenia supports a
surprisingly high diversity of plants and animals, including many endemic, relict and rare
species. Armenia is botanically diverse with some 3,500 species of vascular plants and tens of
thousands of lower plants and bacteria species recorded. More than 17,500 species of animals
have been recorded from Armenia, including 500 vertebrate species.
Agricultural species are of particular importance in Armenia. Armenia is considered one
of the most important centres for agrobiodiversity in the world and represents a relatively large
area supporting wild relatives of crops and agricultural varieties. The people of Armenia have
used these natural resources for over 5,000 years and have built important relationships
between human society and agrobiodiversity, both through breeding and through use of
agricultural lands.
The mountainous nature of Armenia results in a series of highly diverse landscapes, with
variations in geological substrate, terrain, climate, soils, and water resources. These landscapes
support a great variety of habitats, which support distinctive flora and fauna and different human
uses. Seven distinct altitude landscape zones have been described in Armenia: deserts, semi-

EA of Irrigation Development Project                         Ministry of Agriculture, IRPIPIU
deserts, dry steppes, steppes, woodlands, sub-alpine and alpine lands (Biodiversity of Armenia,
First National Report. 1999).
Endemic species
Endemic species and sub-species represent 3% of vascular plants in Armenia (as
compared to 1.5%  of the flora in the Caucasus).  Furthermore, of the animal species
represented in Armenia, 30% of fish, 12% of reptiles and 5% of mammals are endemic.
Threatened species
Because of natural and human impacts, almost half the plant species present in Armenia
may face some threat of extinction. To date, 35 plant species of economic importance are
known to have become extinct in Armenia. A further 386 species (12% of the flora) are listed in
the Armenian Red Data Book (produced in 1988).
Of around 17,500 species of invertebrate and vertebrates recorded in Armenia.
approximately 300 are considered to be rare or declining. A total of 99 vertebrates are currently
listed in the Armenian Red Data Book, of which 39 are also listed in the Red Data Book of the
Former Soviet Union, and a number are considered internationally threatened (according to the
IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals; see Table 8). However, updating the Armenian Red
Data Book would be likely to lead to the inclusion of many more species (perhaps doubling the
existing list). The Armenian Red Data Book for Invertebrates is not yet available, but initial
assessments indicate that over a hundred species will be listed. The Red Data Book of the
Former Soviet Union already lists 48 invertebrate species found in Armenia.
Among the vertebrate species listed in the Armenian Red Data Book are 12 amphibians
and reptiles, and 18 mammal species - many of these species are critically endangered. The
threats facing these species have increased recently as a result of the effects of natural
disasters and economic crisis, coupled with the lack of effective environmental legislation.

4. REHABILITATION OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
This chapter presents the first component of the proposed IDP project, discusses its
potential impacts, and proposes mitigation measures.  The chapter is organized in three
sections consistent with the three following subcomponents:
1. Reconstruction of Hoktemberien main canal and increase of intake from the
Araks River;
2. Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes; and
3 Rehabilitation and improvement of the Ararat Valley drainage infrastructure.
4.1 Reconstruction of Hoktemberien Main Canal and Increase of Intake from
Araks River
This section focuses on the rehabilitation of the Hoktemberien Main canal and the
increase of the intake from the Araks River, the first subcomponent of the proposed iDP. It is
divided in five sections:
1. Description of the current situation;
2. Description of the proposed project component;
3. Main positive impacts of the project component;
4. Potential negative impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures; and
5. Potential negative impacts during operation and maintenance and proposed
mitigation measures.
4.1.1 Description of the current situation
Bilateral agreements entitle the Republic of Armenia and the Turkish Republic to a
53m3/s intake on each side of the Araks River. While the Turkish side has already carried out
the reconstruction of headwork structures and is able to withdraw 53 m3/s of water, Armenia did
not carry out the reconstruction and cannot use its right for the full allocation of 53 m3/s (see
Section 2.4. 1).
The Hoktemberien canal and water intake infrastructures are getting old and do not
allow satisfactory operation. The Hoktemberien canal (also known as Armavir canal) is an earth
channel built in 1930. Since the intake structure has not been upgraded, the intake capacity is
around 25 m3/s, well below the 53 m3/s to which the Republic of Armenia is entitled. Moreover,
the water intake upgrades on the Turkish side have modified the water flow and sedimentation
regime to the detriment of the Armenian side (i.e., water does not flow readily to the Armenian
water intake).
4.1.2 Description of the proposed project component
The reconstruction of the Hoktemberien Main Canal and increase of intake from the
Araks River will include the following components, from the headwork downstream:
. Reconstruct headwork intake structures to increase the water intake
capacity to 53 m3/s;

* Reconstruct the first 4.8 km of the main canal to the Berrkashat hydropower
station (HPS). The selected design is a concrete canal with a throughput
capacity of 53 m3/s;
* Build a sand trap: and
* Reconstruct or rehabilitate 4 km of the main (Maisian) canal below the sand
trap.
4.1.3 Main positive impacts of the proposed project component
The increase of intake capacity from the Araks River and the reconstruction of the
Hoktemberien canal will have the following positive impacts:
1. Increase the productivity of irrigated land;
2. Leach salts out of secondary salinized soils by applying water to them in the
spring time and increase the agricultural productivity of those lands;
3. Save 6.36 MWh of electricity annually by shifting from pumped irrigation
(Sevdjur, Zartonk, and Maisyan pumping stations and select pumping wells)
to gravity irrigation for select lands during the spring;
4. Add capacity in the existing Berkashat hydropower station to produce an
additional 673.000 kWh of electricity annually (see Photo 6): and
5. Save about $34,000 annually in the costs of dredging and disposal of
sediments from the canal (see Photo 5).
4.1.4 Potential negative impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures
Reconstruction of the Hoktemberien main canal and additional water intake from the
Araks River would have the following potential negative impacts:
e Disturbance to the Araks River water quality; and
* Impacts from improper disposal of excavated materials.
Disturbance to the Araks River water quality
The proposed extension of the water intake at the Karaghalla dam would not require
building of a new weir (small dam) or make changes to the existing weir. Rather, the proposed
works call for:
* Rehabilitating the three existing gates (see Photo 2);
 Building three additional gates; and
* Repairing the leaking sluice gates that are used to flush accumulated sands
and sediments back into the river (see Photo 4).
Therefore, none of the standard environmental impacts associated with the construction
of new weirs/dams and reservoirs would be observed in this case. Furthermore, the headworks
will be temporarily separated from the river using special screens and construction will take

EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
place on dry land. Therefore, construction can proceed without the need to reduce or otherwise
change the flow in the Araks River. However, potential spills and leaks of concrete, oils, and
other dangerous materials during or right after construction could pollute the Araks river.
Mitigation measures. The Contractor must take all necessary precautions to avoid
unduly polluting the Araks river and its banks during the extension of the water intake
infrastructure. Once the construction is complete, the Contractor shall remove all construction
equipment and materials from the site and, to the extent feasible, return the site to its pre-
existing conditions.
Impacts from improper disposal of excavated materials
To increase the throughput capacity of the main Hoktemberien canal, the project will
double the cross section of the main canal by excavating large amounts of soils along a 4-km
section of the canal. Those excavated materials are likely to be non-hazardous (Class V)
because the Hoktemberien canal carries relatively clean irrigation water from the Araks river.
Nevertheless, improper disposal of those excavated materials could lead to loss of fertile land,
rainwater runoff, soil erosion, and landscape degradation.
Mitigation measure. The PIU must prepare a landscaping and management plan for
excavated materials and submit it to the local authorities for approval. Contractors shall comply
with this landscaping and management plan. The plan must meet the criteria outlined in Section
4.3.5 under "Impacts from improper disposal of extracted materials."
4.1.5 Potential negative impacts during operation and maintenance and
proposed mitigation measures
The EA team has identified the following potential negative impacts during the operation
and maintenance of the reconstructed Hoktemberien main canal and increased intake capacity
from the Araks river:
 Increased salinity of drainage water;
* Changes in river flow and sedimentation regime; and
* Sanitary flow in the Araks River downstream of the Karaghalla dam.
Increased salinity of drainage water
The primary goal of the increased intake from the Araks river is to provide surplus water
in the spring, which will be used to flush and reclaim salinized soils in the Armavir part of the
Ararat valley. As explained in Section 4.3.1, there are about 20,400 hectares of salinized soils
in the Ararat Valley that require flushing with water before they can be cultivated (Soil Category
11). Clearly, the washing of those soils to remove the salts from them will lead to a temporary
increase in the salinity of drainage waters in the Ararat Valley. The magnitude and impacts of
this increase in salinity is analyzed in Section 4.3.5.
Changes in river flow and sedimentation regimes locally
The increase of water intake on the Armenian side would affect the river flow and
sedimentation regime just upstream of the Karaghalla dam. While new stagnant water pockets
Chapter 4. Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems  ECODIT, January 2000, Page 34



EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
and sedimentation patterns are expected to result in improved water flow towards the Armenian
intake, such changes should not reduce the ability of the Turkish side to get its share of the
Araks river water.
The PIU has informed the EA Team that the increased intake capacity will be used only
in the spring time, when the natural river flow is high, to provide surplus water to flush and
rehabilitate salinized soils. As long as the quantities of water intake on the Armenian side
remain the same as previously between June and October, there will be no need to release
additional quantities of water from the Akhurian reservoir. In this case, the proposed increase of
the intake capacity would not have any impact on the Akhurian reservoir. Conversely, if the
Armenian and Turkish sides decide to divert the maximum of 53 m3/s of water each during the
summer, then they will need to release additional quantities of water from the Akhurian
reservoir, which may not be sustainable in the long term.
MitiQation measures. Under the above assumption. no significant impacts and no new
mitigation measures required. The Ministry of Agriculture will need to continue to work closely
with its Turkish counterpart to monitor the Akhurian reservoir level and make joint decisions on
water releases and allocation.
Sanitary flow in the Araks river downstream of the water intakes
It is the understanding of the EA Team, based on consultations with PIU and
Armhydromet staff, that sanitary flows have been set at 5 m3/s for the Akhurian River and the
Araks river. In particular, the Agreement between Turkey and Armenia calls for each side to
return 2.5 m3/s of water to the river right after the water intake (downstream of the weir). It
appears that this requirement may not be met all the time. Although river flow is not measured
downstream of the weir, visual observation and other monitoring data suggest that downstream
flow in the Araks River is currently below that threshold-from July to November. The proposed
project would make that threshold even harder to meet if adequate measures are not put in
place, as explained next.
Monitored flows. The Armenian and Turkish governments monitor water river flow just
upstream of the weir as well as the quantity of water intake by.each side (one intake on the
Armenian side, two on the Turkish side), The EA Team has used those measured flows in 1998
to estimate the monthly residual flow in the Araks river downstream of the water intakes. As
indicated in Table 9, the estimated residual flow was equal to or less than 5 m3/s on average
between July and November 1998.
Visual observation. Between late July and late October, water leaking from the sand
flushing gates (see Photo 4) on the Armenian side provides the bulk of the residual flow in the
river downstream. (The EA Team observed a residual flow of about 1 m3/s during a field visit at
the end of July 1999). This is because there is no water overflowing the weir during those
months and water releases appear rather insignificant on the Turkish side. After the IDP project
repairs the sand flushing gates, water leaks would be reduced to a trickle. However, the sand
trap in the new project design will be flushed continuously back into the Araks river, which will
return 5 m3/s of water to the Araks river during the spring (about half as much in the summer).

After the reconstruction of the Hoktemberien canal and headworks, Armenia would be
able to meet its part of the sanitary flow requirements downstream of the water intake, except in
the short (170 m) interval between the water intake and the sand trap discharge point, which is
in the backwater zone. In comparison, the Turkish side may not be currently meeting its part of
the sanitary flow requirement (2.5 m3/s) over the 1.5-km interval between its water intake and
sand trap discharge point.
Mitigation measure. The canal operations will need to provide for returning at least 2.5
M3/s of water to the Araks river through the sand trap discharge canal. In addition, the Ministry
of Agriculture may want to work with its Turkish counterpart to examine jointly the question of
whether and how to meet the sanitary flow requirement immediately after the water intake.
4.2 Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes
The rehabilitation project encompasses the repair and cleaning of six main irrigation
schemes: Armavir, Artashat, Arzni-Shamiran. Low Hrazdan, Shirak, and Talin. This chapter
describes this component of the rehabilitation project and its potential environmental impacts in
four sections:
1. Description of the irrigation schemes;
2. Description of the rehabilitation component;
3. Main positive impacts of the rehabilitation project; and
4. Potential negative impacts of the rehabilitation component.

4.2.1 Description of the irrigation schemes
The six schemes selected for the rehabilitation program currently irrigate a total of
146.631 ha in six regions: Kotayk, Aragatsotn, Ararat, Armavir, Shirak, and Lori. They cumulate
1.688 km of main and secondary canals and 11,517 km of tertiary canals. Table 10 presents
the breakdown of tertiary canals vs. main and secondary canals for each scheme.
The six irrigation schemes suffer from significant leakage and loss of water. A 1998
inspection campaign (mainly visual inspection and some hydro-mechanic measurements)
evaluated the condition of the main infrastructures and secondary canals for each scheme. The
inspection report ranked the infrastructure conditions of each scheme from the highest priority
(i.e., emergency state with major deterioration or leakage) to a no-priority status (i.e., no
immediate measure was required but further monitoring was recommended in the near future).

4.2.2 Description of the rehabilitation component
According to the available description of the program, the rehabilitation focuses on
rehabilitating main and secondary canals and would not concern tertiary canals. Only those
infrastructure portions rated "no-priority" during the inspection have been left out; others will be
rehabilitated according to their needs and urgency.  Table 11 summarizes the scope of
rehabilitation for each scheme and indicates the cost associated with the planned activities.
The rehabilitation project will clean and/or repair a 330-km section of the total length (1,688 km)
of main and secondary canals.
Rehabilitation activities will include usual earthwork, construction, and some repair works
(e.g., on metal structures), including but not limited to:
*  Excavation of soil (soft soils, rocks);
*  Loading and transport of extracted materials;
*  Back-filling;
*  Arrangement of embankment;
*  Gabion installation;
*  Concrete mixing;

4.2.4 Potential negative impacts of the rehabilitation component
The rehabilitation of the six irrigation schemes (see activities in Section 4.2.2) would not
pose significant risks to the environment. All of these activities are repair or cleaning work; they
do not affect new areas and do not include expansions or new designs for existing
infrastructures. In addition, the rehabilitation project only aims at improving the efficiency of the
eight systems and reducing water losses; and would not modify dramatically the operation of the
irrigation systems. As a consequence, the EA team expects the range of impacts to be limited -
impacts directly related to the rehabilitation activities- and their magnitude to remain small -
localized impacts and no significant effect on future operation. The rest of this section presents
a list of potential negative impacts from this rehabilitation project.
During construction, the disposal of excavated and dredged materials will represent the
major environmental concern.   Other potential impacts also can arise from  improper
construction techniques or construction site management. We have identified the following
potential impacts during construction:
  Impacts from  improper disposal of extracted materials: inadequate
cleaning and repair of canals could cause inadvertent removal of the
vegetative cover, destroy ecosystems, enhance soil erosion, and damage the
landscape. In addition, excavated soils inside populated areas may require
special disposal permit from local and regional authorities;
*  Water and soil pollution: poorly maintained construction and excavation
vehicles (trucks, bulldozers, excavator), improper fuel storage, and illegal
dumping of used oils and other polluting substances (including out-of-service
pipes and metal infrastructures) would pollute the soil and water.
*  Loss of fertile topsoil: mixing of top soils (suitable for agriculture) with lower
grade soils (deeper layers) during the excavation and back filling of trenches
would have a negative impact on the soil quality and diminish agricultural
production and yield.
*  Impacts from temporary access roads and work areas: establishment of
temporary dirt roads to access work areas and temporary dumping sites for
excavated materials can destroy natural habitats, disrupt wildlife and some
ecosystems, enhance soil erosion, and degrade the landscape.
*  Accidents and increased traffic: all construction activities present intrinsic
safety risks. The use of heavy trucks and earthwork vehicles can lead to
accidents, with potential safety hazards and injuries to workers and people.
The increase in local traffic could also have potential negative impacts on
local population and the environment (e.g., road accidents, air pollution with
dust, and noise).
Likewise, operation and maintenance of the rehabilitated irrigation and drainage
schemes, if conducted improperly, may have negative impacts on the environment,
including:
. Improper canal maintenance: poor canal maintenance can degrade the
environment. If the equipment used for canal maintenance is not appropriate,
plants and sediments will be extracted indiscriminately when canals are
dredged. Extracted materials left on the sides of a canal can return to the
Chapter 4. Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems  ECODIT, January 2000, Page 40

canal under the effect of rain and/or wind, and can spread pollution if they are
contaminated.
. Inefficient operation of the irrigation system: uncoordinated local
rehabilitation works could cause changes that would affect the efficiency of
the irrigation schemes; e.g., deepening some canals might disrupt the
hydraulic flow in other canals down gradient.
The impacts highlighted above are similar in nature (but smaller in scope) to the corresponding
impacts of the Ararat drainage rehabilitation component (see Section 4.3). Accordingly, the EA
team recommends the same types of mitigation measures. Section 4.3.5 (construction phase)
and 4.3.6 (operation and maintenance phase) provide full description of these potential impacts
and the EA team's recommended mitigation measures.
4.3  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Ararat Valley Drainage Infrastructure
This chapter focuses on the rehabilitation and improvement of the Ararat valley drainage
infrastructure. The chapter is organized in six sections:
1. Baseline environmental conditions;
2. Current situation of the drainage system;
3. Description of the project components;
4. Main positive impacts of the drainage rehabilitation component;
5. Potential negative impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures; and
6  Potential negative impacts during operation and maintenance and proposed
mitigation measures.
4.3.1 Baseline environmental conditions
Climate conditions in the Ararat valley are semi-arid with:
e  Low precipitation (about 300 mm/year) with occasional rain storms;
.  Sharp contrast in temperatures between summer (350C on average) and
winter (-50C on average);
*  Low relative humidity; and
*  Strong winds due to sharp differences of temperature.
The main rivers are the Araks River and its tributaries: Akhurian, Hrazdan, Metsamor, Kasakh,
Azat, and Vedy rivers (see Map 1). Despite the semi-arid conditions, ground water is generally
abundant. The artesian basin features three hydraulically-interdependent aquifers: the upper
aquifer (down to 20 m), a sub-pressure intermediate aquifer (between 30 m and 70 m), and the
deep pressure aquifer (below 70 m).

Ground water tends to naturally come back up to the surface. As a result, top ground
layers are often swelled with water, which has adverse consequences for population and
agriculture and causes serious environmental challenges (see Box 8). The construction of an
open drainage system (in the 50's) and of covered drains (in the 60's) have significantly reduced
soil salinization and improved sanitary conditions. However, because drainage is not always
sufficient to rehabilitate all lands, other techniques such as chemical reclamation were applied
to wash the salts away from certain salinized soils (see Box 9).
Box 8
Main Environmental Challenges for the Ararat Valley
1. Rise of ground water level;,
2. Salinization of irrigated lands; and
3. Water-logging and return of malaria.
In the past few years, the deterioration of the drainage system has led to a new rise of
the ground water level. Rising ground water levels have resulted in water logging, flooding of
villages, and the degradation of the sanitary and ecological situation (e.g., return of malaria). In
addition, when water comes back up to within two meters from the surface, it evapo-transpires
leaving behind the salts it contained: the gradual build-up of salts has led to the secondary
salinization and sodicity (build-up of sodium) of the soils.
Box 9
Experience with Chemical Melioration in the Ararat Valley
The Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute has found that
the most efficient chemical rehabilitation of Armenian soils involved the use of
sulfuric acid and iron sulfate. The Institute developed a melioration method using
wastes from chemical and mining industries, and has implemented this method
from 1963 until independence. This chemical rehabilitation has ceased since
independence because cheap raw materials (sulfuric acid, iron sulfate) are no
longer readily available from the former Soviet Union republics. A total of 5,400
ha of land have been treated this way in the Ararat valley and have recovered
their fertility and qualities for agriculture (Dr. V. Nurijanian, Head of Melioration 1
Department, Soil Science. Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute).
Experts disagree on the relative merits of this chemical rehabilitation
process. While some praise its ability to rehabilitate salinized soils and render
them suitable for agriculture, others argue that the process contributes to
polluting the soil and water and should be abandoned. The proposed IDP will not
fund any chemical rehabilitation of salinized soils in Armenia.

Table 12 summarizes the evolution since 1986 of irrigated land surfaces, conditions, and
the number of flooded villages. The negative trend reached a peak in 1995 when 39.1 percent
of irrigated lands were declared in unsatisfactory reclamation condition. Since 1992, due to the
lack of financial resources, the drainage system of the Ararat Valley has not been cleaned
(1992-1994) or has been partially cleaned (15-20% from 1995-1997). As a result, the surface
area of waterlogged lands has increased, first gradually and then sharply until it peaked at about
31,000 hectares in 1995 (or 37 percent of the irrigated land area). In parallel, the number of
waterlogged villages increased from 28 villages to 73 villages in 1995. At the same time,
secondary salinization phenomena were observed in about 15,000 hectares of irrigated lands.
In 1998, about 502 km of the drainage network were cleaned/repaired under the IRP using state
budget resources. This had led to the reduction of waterlogged lands by 7.400 hectares and of
waterlogged villages by 35 villages. in 1999. the IRP has treated and maintained about 300
additional km of the drainage network.
Current soil quality
Monitoring of soil quality has become much less comprehensive since independence
due to the lack of funds. As a result, data are sketchy at best on the current state of the
salinization or alkalinization of soils in the Ararat valley. Soil types can be roughly divided into
three categories (see Table 13 and Map 10):
I.  Soils readily suitable for cultivation;
II. Soils that require flushing with water to wash out the salts before they can
be cultivated; and
l1l. Sodium solonets-solonchak soils requiring chemical melioration.
Although the majority of soils are readily suitable for agriculture (category 1, 71 percent), about
23 percent of soils (category li) would require washing with excess water in addition to irrigation
water and about 6 percent (category l1l) would require chemical rehabilitation.
Current water qualitv
Appendix G (Tables G-1, G-2, and G-3) presents the results of recent water quality
analyses (pH, Sodium Adsorption Ratio, Total Dissolved Solids) for ground water, irrigation
water, and drainage water, respectively. These waters are neutral to slightly alkaline, with pH
ranging from 6.8 to 8.1. Several water sources have salinity levels around 1 mg/l and relatively
high SAR value (over 5), which means that special restrictions are required before these waters
can be used for irrigation (see Table 5). Due to differences in sampling and analysis conditions
(e.g., date of sampling), it would not be appropriate to compare these tables strictly. However, it
appears that salinity levels (measured in terms of TDS) are generally higher for ground water
than for irrigation and drainage water. The high ground water salinity, combined with the rise of
the ground water level, is the major reason for the secondary salinization of soils.

4.3.2 Current situation of the drainage system7
The Collector-Drainage System
There are 13 main drainage collectors in the Ararat valley (see Map 9). The whole
drainage scheme of the valley is symbolically divided into two autonomous regions: the right
bank and the left bank of the Hrazdan river. The Araks river receives drainage water from the
main collectors located on the left bank of the Hrazdan river: Araks, Leftside Hrazdan, and
Arazdayan the Main. Drainage water collected on the right bank of the Hrazdan river (Kuru-
Arax, Kobu-Artashar, and Kobu-Apaga) flows to the Metsamor river.
The drainage network is currently 1,393 km long and consists of open canals (723 km)
and covered ducts (670 km) on both sides of the Hrazdan river. Operating conditions are not
satisfactory. An evaluation dated January 1998 showed that 56.4 percent of the whole network
was in unsatisfactory condition, with more than 75 percent of the open canal in a poor state of
operation or maintenance (see Table 14). Unsatisfactory conditions have several causes:
collectors are overgrown with reeds and other plants, parts of the irrigation-drainage system are
silted due to sedimentation, and some farmers have built earth walls and dikes on certain canals
to divert the water for their own use.

Underground drainage network
The buried drainage network covers 7,967 ha of land and is organized in 17
independently operated sections. About 65 percent of this coverage operates by gravity flow,
the rest requires pumping operations. Drains are laid at depths of 3 to 3.5 meters on average
and the whole network features 2,743 inspection manholes (see Photo 14). The overall
condition of the underground drainage network is not satisfactory: pipes are commonly plugged
or silted and many manholes are dismantled, destroyed, or filled with garbage,
Pumping stations
Twenty pumping stations are still operating: six of them serve irrigation purposes, 10 are
used for drainage, and four carry out both tasks. Hydromechanic and electrical equipment is
completely dismantled in all pumping stations. The buildings housing the pumping stations are
partially destroyed. Construction of the Masis, Sayat-Nova, and Sipanik pumping stations is not
complete. The buildings housing the drainage-irrigating stations of Shahumian, lsakov, and

Arevik are partially flooded due to the rise of the ground water level. Most of the equipment
operates with low efficiency. Left branch, Ranchpar, and Avshar-Ajgevan pumping stations are
in a relatively satisfactory state of operation.
Artesian wells
In the Ararat valley, 942 wells are in operation in 57 villages. Water from artesian wells
is used for irrigation, drinking and technical supply. Only 850 wells are currently functioning and
an overwhelming majority requires significant repair work. For example, 510 wells are not
equipped with gate valves, which makes it impossible to control the outlet flow (see photo 10).
4.3.3 Description of the project components8
The PIU considered two options: (1) cleaning of existing infrastructures and (2) cleaning
and deepening of collectors and reconstruction of some parts of the drainage scheme. Both
options consist of rehabilitation activities (no new canals or collectors) and would not introduce
significant changes in the design or operation of the drainage system. The PIU selected the
second rehabilitation option (i.e.. cleaning and deepening of drainage collectors), as
summarized in Table 15 and the next paragraphs.
Open drainage network
Rehabilitation of the open drainage network will include the following activities:
-  Deepen the first and second parts of the right bank Hrazdan-Arax collector
and redirect the water from the Hrazdan river toward the left bank Hrazdan
collector;
i  Deepen the Kobu-Apaga collector:
*  Deepen the main Arazdayan collector and left bank Hrazdan collector;
*  Reinforce embankments (dikes) along the Hrazdan river; and
*  Reconstruct intakes to allow the discharge of drainage water from  the
covered network but prevent the water from flowing back in the drainage
system.
Underground drainage network
The rehabilitation will include mechanical cleaning of the whole system with the help of
drain cleaners, reconstruction of destroyed parts of drains along 70.9 km of network, and
reconstruction and rehabilitation of 1,190 manholes (inspection pits).

Pumping stations
Repair work. reconstruction of pumping station buildings, and lowering the pumps will
ensure normal operation of pumps. According to calculations, pumps will need to be lowered by
up to 4,03 m. For Ararat, Noyakert, Avshar-Aygevan, Baghramian and Araksavan pumping
stations, lowering the pumps by one meter will be carried out inside the existing buildings. For
Khor-Virab and Burastan pumping stations. deepening of the pumps will exceed one meter and
will require constructing a new building.
The proposed IDP also would convert three pumping stations (Shahumian, Isakov and
Arevik) for use in irrigation, and would decommission six other pumping stations (Marmarashen,
Masis, Sayat-Nova, Sipan, Kalinin, Araks).  Ranchpar irrigation pumping station will be
redesigned and constructed for irrigation-drainage in order to lower the ground water level on
the irrigated lands of Hovtashat, Guy, Haykashen and Hayanist villages. The Lusaghbiur
pumping station on the collector Kobu-Apaga also will be rehabilitated.
Vertical drainage
The project includes the rehabilitation of 61 tubewells. mainly in the Hoktemberien region (north-
western part) and Arazdajan steppe (south-eastern part).
Flowing wells
The IDP plans to eliminate 76 small-discharge wells and to clean, repair, and/or upgrade
(e.g., add storage capacity and outlet for irrigation) 120 other wells.
4.3.4 Main positive impacts of the reconstruction project
The proposed rehabilitation of the Ararat Valley drainage system will reduce the extent
of water logging by lowering the ground water table, which will have the following positive
impacts:
-  Improve the meliorative status of 24,100 hectares of water-logged lands;
-  Decrease the surface area of water-logged lands down to 10,00 hectares;
*  Reduce the risk of secondary salinization in irrigated lands;
*  Provide additional water (52.5 million m3) as a result of rehabilitating vertical
drainage wells and improving the technical conditions of artesian wells;
*  Save 8.8 MWh annually by taking pumping stations out of service;
*  Increase agricultural productivity; and
*  Improve the sanitary and health conditions in populated areas and create
favorable conditions for the elimination of malaria.
Increase the agricultural Droduction and yield
Thanks to favorable climatic conditions, the Ararat valley provides 40 to 45 percent of
the agricultural production of Armenia.  Agricultural production is very diverse: wheat,
vegetables, fruits, grapes, fodder, and cattle. The rehabilitation project will have significant
positive socio-economic impacts for the 631,100 inhabitants (official statistics as of 111/99) of
the Ararat valley, as illustrated in Table 16.

Reduce the number of water-logged villages
Because ground water level has risen closer to the surface, many villages are currently
located in flooded areas (see Table 12). This situation has led to the degradation of conditions
of life. the proliferation of vectors, and the development of water-borne diseases such as
malaria. The rehabilitation project will reduce the number of waterlogged villages.
Improve health conditions
As explained in Section 3.1.5, 143 cases of malaria were reported in the Ararat and
Armavir regions in 1996, with most cases (105 cases) occurring in flooded, low-lying areas of
the Masis region. By lowering the water table, the drainage rehabilitation project in the Ararat
valley will reduce the availability of breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other vectors and will
improve health and sanitary conditions. In particular, the proposed project will help reduce the
incidence of malaria in the Ararat Valley.

4.3.5 Potential negative impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures
The ECODIT team has identified the following potential negative impacts during the
construction phase of the Ararat Valley drainage rehabilitation project:
*  Temporary increase in pollution and turbidity of drainage water;
*  Temporary increase in the salinity of drainage water;
*  Impacts from improper disposal of extracted materials;
*  Water and soil pollution;
*  Loss of fertile topsoil;
*  Impacts from temporary access roads and work areas;
*  Impacts on sensitive habitats; and
  Accidents and increased traffic.
The PIU has already taken several noteworthy steps to mitigate these impacts. This
section identifies those measures as well as others recommended by the EA team.
Temporary increase in the pollution and turbidity of drainage water
During construction, earthmovers and excavators will dredge sediments and excavate
soils from drainage collectors.  Such dredging and excavation activities will release plant
materials (branches, roots, etc.) and suspend fine materials and sediments, leading to a
temporary increase in floating and suspended matter, and salinity of the drainage water (see
next paragraph for salinity). The increase in suspended matter (turbidity) in drainage water may
have adverse impacts on aquatic species, fisheries' productivity, the quality of irrigation water,
and the water quality of recipient river and lakes. In particular, large suspended matter may
clog the gills of small fish and suffocate them.
Mitigation measures. Cleaning and deepening of the collectors should be carried out
during the winter when (1) river flows are high and can dilute easily the increase in suspended
solids, (2) aquatic life is less sensitive, and (3) lands are not irrigated. When possible, work
should be planned so that the water of a collector under reconstruction can be mixed and
diluted with other sources of water. Contractors should use adapted dredging equipment (see
more details in Section 4.3.6 on canal maintenance). In some instances, the contractor may
want to install floating dams and nets downstream to catch plants and other debris before
discharging or reusing the drainage water.
Temporary increase in the salinity of drainage water
For a few months after the rehabilitation of the drainage system, the salinity of the
drainage water will increase by several folds as result of improved drainage and the associated
washing of salts from the salinized soils. For each drainage sector in the Ararat valley, Table 18
shows the projected salinity levels after 25 and 75 days in the secondary and main drainage
collectors as well as in the receiving water body. In the two or three months after the cleaning
and deepening of collectors, the salinity of drainage water in the main collectors will increase to

a range of 1.65 mg/l to 4.3 mg/I, from a baseline range of 0.6 to 1.2 mg/i (see Tables 18 and G-
3). Salinity levels will drop to their baseline value after that. Note that while salinity levels will
increase, the level of water in the collectors will drop after cleaning because water will flow
much faster (whereas the flow remains the same) (see Photos 11,12, and 13).

Mitigation measures. The PIU and the "Monitoring and Control of the Rehabilitated
State of Irrigated Lands in the Republic of Armenia" SCJSC will need to study carefully the
sequencing of drainage rehabilitation activities in the Ararat valley in order to control the salinity
of the drainage waters and their ultimate use.  Also, the "Monitoring and Control of the
Rehabilitated State of Irrigated Lands in the Republic of Armenia" SCJSC will need to continue
monitoring water quality on a frequent basis; such monitoring should provide timely feedback to
inform decisions about using the drainage water to irrigate soils of different quality.
More generally, due to the spatial and temporal variations in the availability and quality
of different types of water (irrigation/drainage water, ground water), the PIU, the "Monitoring and
Control of the Rehabilitated State of Irrigated Lands in the Republic of Armenia" SCJSC, and
the MoNP will need to promote sound integrated water resource management in the Ararat
Valley. This may require developing an integrated water resource management model of water
supply (rivers, canals, ground water, drainage water) and water demand (farmers, drinking, fish
farms, receiving water bodies).
Impacts from improper disposal of extracted materials
The rehabilitation project will require the extraction and dredging of huge quantities of
sediments and soils (4,910,000 m3). For illustration, this volume of extracted materials would
cover 245 ha on a layer two meters high or 49 ha with a 10-meter layer. Therefore, it is
imperative to plan the disposal of those materials in advance. Potential negative impacts from
improper management of the extracted materials may include the following:
Chapter 4. Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems  ECODIT, January 2000, Page 51



EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
*  destruction of vegetative cover and damage to the landscape, if extracted materials
are dumped in the countryside;
.  increased frequency and costs of canal maintenance: if extracted materials are
dumped haphazardly along the collector sides, they eventually would return to the
collector under the effect of rain and wind;
.  nuisance to local population, if extracted materials are left near the collector in
residential areas; and
*  pollution of water and soil, with risks to human health and the environment, if the
extracted materials are hazardous (e.g., contain high levels of pesticides) and are
dumped without special precautions.
Polluted materials. In the Ararat Valley, pesticides have been used for the past two
years to eliminate mosquitoes (vector for malaria). These pesticides as well as agrochemicals
used throughout Armenia generally accumulate in the soils. As a result, in some areas of the
Ararat Valley, sediments and soils are suspected of containing high levels of heavy metals and
other persistent pollutants. Once dredged or excavated, these contaminated materials may
become hazardous waste according to the Armenian regulations. If not disposed of properly,
these hazardous wastes could seriously affect people's health (workers and population) and
degrade the environment.
Mitigation measures. The PIU will need to develop tailored management and disposal
plans for three categories of extracted materials, depending on the type (hazardous or not) and
location (near residential areas or not) of the extracted materials. Table 19 indicates the
recommended management and disposal plan for each category of extracted materials. To
determine whether the extracted materials are hazardous or not, the PIU will need to conduct a
sampling and analysis campaign in coordination with the MoNP, as explained below.
Table 19
Management and Disposal Methods for Extracted Materials
Category of Extracted Materials       Management and
According to its Type and Location      Disposal Method
1. Non-hazardous away from populated   Disposal alongside the
areas                                     collector
2. Non-hazardous within populated       Disposal on land as a
areas                                non-hazardous waste
3. Hazardous                            Disposal on land as a
I    hazardous waste
Sampling and analysis. Since some sediments/soils are likely to be contaminated with
pesticides and other chemicals, there is a need for checking the soil and sediment composition
prior to deciding on the proper handling and disposal methods. Sampling and analyzing every
location would not be feasible, nor would a random sampling be satisfactory. Work sites in
areas where pesticides have been sprayed, or where agrochemicals have been used should be
tested systematically. Elsewhere, random sampling would be sufficient to avoid major improper
waste management. It is important to keep a record of the sampling and analysis results in
order to facilitate future maintenance and monitoring activities. The PIU will need to coordinate
the sampling and analysis campaign with the MoNP.

Disposal of non-hazardous materials excavated away from populated areas. If the
materials are non-hazardous and are away from residential areas, the Contractor may dispose
of them  on either side of the drainage collector.  The PIU then will need to submit a
management plan demonstrating that the excavated materials (1) are not hazardous, (2) would
not be washed back into the collector or blown away by the winds, and (3) would not raise the
sides of the collector excessively, complicate the long-term maintenance of the collector, or
hinder farming operations in the area. The PIU will seek approval of the proposed management
plans from riparian farmers and affected population.
Disposal of non-hazardous materials excavated in populated areas. Non-hazardous
materials extracted in populated areas may not be disposed alongside the collector. Instead,
the PIU will need to identify and obtain approval from the local authorities for dumping sites
where land is:
. Available;
* Close to the work area;
 With low agronomic value: and
* Easily accessible by road.
For each dumping site, the contractor shall prepare and submit to the PIU a landscaping
and management plan incorporating the following recommendations:
* Plan and manage the site according to its surrounding landscape and
intended final use: the site could be a future wooded hill, an old quarry that
would be filled up and rehabilitated into agricultural land or a small wood, an
area for wildlife, a park. etc.;
  Assess site capacity and optimize it;
M Manage and use materials according to their physical characteristics:
humidity, particle size distribution, risk of polluting superficial and/or ground
waters with leachates;
* Use rocks and rubble from demolished buildings to form the core part of
heaps and hills;
Place excavated top soils and agriculture-grade soils on top of the heap on a
layer not exceeding 1 meter. When such materials are not available, spread
organic matters and mix them into the top layer of soil, and seed this layer
with a mix of gramineous and leguminous plants to increase the agronomic
value of the soil over time; and
* Water the plantations on a case by case basis, considering the dry climate.
Disposal of hazardous materials. As indicated in section 2.1.2, whenever hazardous
wastes are identified, the PIU will need to work with the MoNP to select the best transport and
disposal method/site and agree on a waste management plan. There is no hazardous waste
landfill in Armenia. The government may need to issue a decree specifying the disposal
methods for excavated materials found to be hazardous.

Water and soil pollution from fuel and oils
Ill-maintained construction and excavation vehicles (trucks, bulldozers, excavators),
improper storage of fuel, and illegal dumping of used oil and other polluting substances would
pollute water and soil.
Decommissioning of pumping stations. Six pumping stations (Marmarashen, Masis,
Sayat-Nova, Sipan, Kalinin, and Arax) will be decommissioned under the rehabilitation project.
Improper demolition methods and improper waste management would have negative impacts
on the environment. For example, improper disposal or handling of equipment and machines,
as well as fuel, oil and other pollutants stored in these facilities or equipment would pose a risk
of environmental pollution.
Mitigation measures. The PIU needs to conduct an inventory of equipment and products
to be disposed of from the pumping stations, document and suggest proper handling and
treatment methods.  Most of the risks can be avoided by routine maintenance of trucks,
bulldozers, and other equipment. Contractors shall take measures to prevent spills or leaks of
fuel and oils (e.g., storage in tanks placed in catchment basins covered with a liner). Also, used
oils and other polluting products need to be collected in appropriate containers and shipped to a
treatment facility for adequate treatment or reuse.
Loss of fertile topsoil during excavation and backfilling
Excavation of trenches to lay down pipes and drainage ducts and improper back filling
could affect the quality of soil and the productivity of agriculture. If this operation is not done
properly, top soils (suitable for agriculture) will be mixed with other grades (deeper layers).
leading to degraded soil quality and reduced agricultural production on this portion of land.
Mitigation measures.  Contractors shall implement the following recommendations
during excavation and back filling on agricultural lands:
* Scrape and put aside the top layer of soil suitable for agriculture;
* Excavate lower layers and pile them up separately; and
* When filling back trenches, replace the fertile soil on top of other layers.
Impacts from temporary access roads and work areas
Temporary access roads and temporary dumping sites for excavated materials can
destroy natural habitats, disrupt wildlife and ecosystems, enhance soil erosion, and degrade the
landscape.
Mitigation measures. Proper planning and management of temporary access roads and
work areas is required to limit impacts and enable future rehabilitation. Road and work zone
planning must respect the following recommendations:
Choose and delineate carefully all access roads and work areas. Manage
and monitor them closely so that they do not expand unduly during
construction;
Chapter 4. Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems  ECODIT, January 2000, Page 54



EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
* Scrape and store preciously the top agricultural grade soil layer (about 20
cm). Store these soils in piles not exceeding one meter (soils lose their
agronomic qualities in thicker layers);
* If ground works will last more than one year, seed the piles of agricultural-
grade soils with a mix of gramineous and leguminous plants. These plants
will help to improve the structure of the soil and increase its organic content;
and
* Compact the top surface of access roads and work areas to facilitate water
runoff and avoid flooding the area. This will require to dig drainage ditches
and connect them to natural drainage axes.
When rehabilitating the access roads and work areas, the contractor will need to take
special precautions, such as:
1. Scratch the soil with a specialized engine to de-compact it;
2. Put the fertile topsoil carefully back in place; and
3. Level the areas.
Impacts on sensitive habitats
Parts of the drainage network are adjacent to the State Reservation of "Vordan Karmir",
which provides habitat to the endemic, red-color worm of the same name that was previously
used to extract dye (e.g., to dye carpets). Nature monuments in this area include the Oniks
mines and the Artashat and Khor Virap marble mines. Wetlands include:
* Ararat marshes, with a vast diversity of vegetation (about 100 ha are salinized bogs
located between the Yerevan-Eraskh highway and "Ararat" mineral thermal water
springs);
* natural wetlands (near the villages of Khartunakh and Jrarat and the Masis Railroad
station) in the canyons of Kasakh, Hrazdan, and Sevjur rivers; and
- lake and bog ecosystems formed in the canyon of the Hrazdan river and in some of
the old sand extraction mines, which provide habitat for water fauna and birds.
There are no sites listed under the Ramsar convention in the Ararat Valley.
The lack of maintenance of the drainage network has led to secondary soil salinization
and the conversion of several wetlands into marshes (bogs), with gradual changes in vegetation
and the ecological conditions of the wetlands. By lowering the water table and reversing the
secondary soil salinization, the proposed IDP will help to restore the ecological balance to the
wetlands.
Mitigation measures. The PIU shall take all necessary measures to avoid disrupting the
Vordan Karmir State Reservation and to protect the endemic vordan karmir insect and its
habitat. In particular, the PIU will need to coordinate with the MoNP to monitor the impacts, if
any, of the proposed drainage rehabilitation on the vordan karmir habitat, the wetlands, and the
nature monuments of the Ararat Valley, and to take appropriate corrective measures as
appropriate.

Accidents and increased traffic
All construction, excavation, and demolition activities present intrinsic safety risks. The
use of heavy trucks and earthwork vehicles can lead to accidents, with potential safety hazards
and injuries to workers and people. In addition, a relatively large amount of excavated materials
may need to be shipped off-site for disposal, which would induce an increase in local traffic.
Assuming that 15 percent (i.e., about 74,000 m3) of all excavated materials are carried away by
trucks with a capacity of 10m3, 74,000 truckloads would be required during the construction
phase. If the drainage rehabilitation works took seven years to complete, this would mean an
average of 40 truckloads per working day. Although this increased traffic would be temporary
and not very significant. it could have potential negative localized impacts on population and the
environment (e.g., road safety and accidents, air pollution and dust, and noise).
Mitigation measures. Common safety measures should be applied to all activities during
the construction phase. A plan including prevention measures and safety procedures should be
submitted, to be implemented and enforced by a safety supervisor at each work site. Such a
plan would be part of the management and disposal plans mentioned previously and would
include an awareness campaign among the local inhabitants, proper signs (e.g., stop signs) to
limit the risk of accident, and careful selection of transport routes to reduce inconvenience and
the accident risks. For example, trucks may be prevented from running during rush hours
(safety issue) or at night (noise problem). If dust is a major concern (e.g., near inhabited areas),
water would need to be sprayed on the roads to prevent dust suspension. Trucks and other
heavy vehicles should be well-maintained to avoid excessive air emissions, oil leaks and other
sources of pollution.
4.3.6 Potential negative impacts during operation and maintenance and
proposed mitigation measures
Several potential negative impacts may arise during the operation and maintenance:
Canal sedimentation;
Salinization due to irrigation methods;
* Improper canal maintenance;
* Impacts on fisheries;
* Loss of soil fertility;
* Increased pollution due to the use of agrochemicals, and
* Health and sanitary hazards.
Canal sedimentation
The semi-arid climate of the Ararat valley, with its intense rainstorms and strong winds,
can produce extreme erosion conditions. The eroded topsoil eventually finds its way to canals
and collectors, filling them up gradually.
Mitigation measures. To reduce soil erosion by winds and water, the PIU would need to
encourage farmers to adopt the following practices:
Chapter 4. Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems  ECODIT, January 2000, Page 56



EA of Irrigation Development Project                        Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
* Plant wind breaks and hedge rows between agricultural lots (e.g., rows of
poplars at the Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute); and
*  Close irrigation furrows to force all the irrigation water to percolate through
the ground.
Salinization due to irrigation methods
Irrigation methods can have a direct impact on soil salinization depending on the quality
of irrigation water. In the Ararat valley, farmers irrigate by gravity either by flooding a whole
area (submersion of a field) or by distributing water in furrows. Both irrigation approaches can
lead to soil salinization depending on the water salinity and SAR values (see Table 5), as
explained next. The fraction of water that is not used by the plants is called the leaching
fraction; high leaching fractions mean low irrigation efficiencies
Irrigation by submersion.  Water percolates uniformly through ground layers and
salinization might occur in deeper layers, below the agriculture-grade soil layer. Salinization
would depend directly on the salinity of irrigation water and the leaching fraction. This type of
salinization does not affect immediately the plant growth; however, repeated irrigation by
submersion would lead to salt build-up in the top soils, rendering those soils non-suitable for
agriculture in the long-term.
Irrigation with furrows. In this case, salts would accumulate both in depth and on the
surface, typically in the middle of the upper space between two furrows (see Figure 8), i.e. in the
agriculture-grade layer. If the seeds are planted in one row between furrows, they would be
located exactly where the salts accumulate. and plant growth would be affected.
Mitigation measures. The PIU will need to undertake a baseline soil salinity campaign to
provide a basis for measuring the future performance of the proposed project and for using
irrigation/drainage waters of different qualities in the most optimal way. To control in-depth
salinization, the PIU and its partners will need to monitor on a routine basis the irrigation water
quality (TDS or conductivity), the irrigation efficiency, and the efficiency of the drainage system.
Also, soil washing (using water from the Araks river, see Section 4.1) will help reduce the
salinity of soils, if done properly.
To prevent salt accumulation on the surface, the PIU will need to educate farmers about
sound irrigation practices, such as:
1. Prepare a larger space between two furrows and plant seeds in two rows
located at each edge of that space (see Figure 9). Salts would continue to
accumulate in the middle of the space between furrows, but because the
seeds are further aside, plant growth would be less affected; or
2. Alternate the allocation of water to the furrows (e.g., irrigate only on every two
furrows at a time). The accumulation of salts will be slightly displaced and
would not coincide with the seed row.

Improper canal maintenance
Poor canal maintenance contributes to environmental degradation. Typically, if the
equipment used for canal dredging is not appropriate, plants and sediments will be extracted
indiscriminately. Extracted materials disposed of on the collector sides would return to the
collectors under the effect of rain or wind, or spread pollution if they are contaminated. 111-
maintained dikes, slopes, and canals could lead to the following negative consequences:
*  Plant growth on canal slopes would be limited or non existent, which would
lead to decreased slope stability and increased turbidity of the water (plants
catch floating or suspended materials);
*  Slopes could collapse leading to further soil erosion;
*  Sediments would run off to the canals and eventually toward recipient rivers
or lakes;
*  Plant and animal biodiversity would be reduced; and
.  The overall health of the ecosystem  would be disrupted and perhaps
endangered.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture. IRP/PIU
Mitigation measures. Sustainable management of drainage collectors requires adequate
planning to:
1. Minimize the frequency of maintenance interventions;
2. Improve access to enable adequate dredging of sediments and
cutting/retrieving of undesirable plants; and
3. Organize sound management and disposal of dredged materials.
To mitigate negative impacts, contractors will need to apply the following measures:
*  Modify canal banks and adjust slopes to no more than 45' when possible;
*  Build a dirt road on each side of canals to operate and maintain irrigation and
drainage schemes. This measure is feasible because the Government owns
the right-of-way along canals and collectors: during the land privatization, the
Government retained the ownership of strips of land on each side of canals
(nine meter wide on one side and four meter wide on the other); and
.  Select and manage dumping sites for dredged materials and sediments,
consistent with disposal practices adopted during the construction phase (see
Section 4.3.5).
Contractors will need specialized equipment and vehicles to implement the above
recommendations, including:
*  Adapted plant cutting machine mounted on a mobile arm of a tractor: used to
regularly cut plants growing on the canal slopes (and to prevent uprooting
them): and
*  Specialized mechanical shovel with a far-reaching arm to extract sediments.
Conventional dredges are not recommended due to their lack of accuracy,
especially when the bottom of the canal is not wider than 1 meter.
Impacts on fisheries
Two types of commercial fish farming are prevalent in the Ararat valley: trout farming
and fish farming in large artificial lakes. Some fish can also be found in the old sand mine
pockets that have been filled with water by the rising ground water table. Small fish are hatched
and grown in several "pisciculture" farms throughout Armenia (see Map 7).
Trout fish farms. Dozens of farms in and near the Masis area depend on freshwater
from the artesian wells to grow trout fish (see Photo 16). Those commercial farms pay a
modest fee for using the artesian wells and discharge water into the drainage collectors.
Because these trout farms depend on deep underground water from artesian wells, the
proposed drainage rehabilitation project will have no effect on them.
Artificial lakes. In the southern part of the Ararat valley, fish are grown and harvested for
commercial purposes in a few large artificial lakes (see Photo 17). One kilo of fish sells at a
price of 700 Drams). The lakes were built in the sixties on salinized soils that would have been
too difficult/expensive to rehabilitate. At the end of their course, the drainage collectors feed the
lakes with drainage water at a rate 2 m3/s. An agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture

and the lake owners governs the provision and sale of drainage water to the lakes. Water from
the lakes is discharged into the Araks river. The fraction of water lost from the lakes by
seepage into the ground is unknown, but is suspected to be relatively small.
The drainage rehabilitation project is not expected to have any significant or lasting
impact on the fishing activities in the artificial lakes. Drainage waters may be more saline and
turbid during and immediately after project implementation (see Section 4.3.5). However, this
temporary increase in the salinity and turbidity of the water inflow to the lakes is expected to
remain small, and would be diluted by the large volume of those lakes. After the cleaning and
deepening of the collectors (i.e., operation phase), it is expected that the artificial lakes would
continue to operate as usual (e.g., same water level in the lakes), as they have done previously
even when the drainage system was functioning properly (before the 90's).
Old sand mines. The old sand mines have become small ponds with their own localized
ecosystem: cattails, grasses, small fish, etc. These ponds also provide ideal breeding grounds
for mosquitoes and other vectors for water-borne diseases such as malaria. Once the water
table is lowered, the ponds would dry up and this recent pond ecosystem would disappear.
Also. the incidence of malaria and other water-borne diseases would be reduced.
Mitigation measures. As explained previously, dredging and excavation activities will
need to be timed and phased to minimize the increase in salinity and turbidity of drainage
waters discharged to the artificial lakes. ECODIT recommends that the water level and salinity
in the lakes be monitored during and after the implementation of the drainage rehabilitation
project. Also, as suggested previously, ECODIT recommends disposing of a portion of the
sediments and soils dredged/excavated from the collectors into the old sand mines, but only
after the water table has been lowered.
Loss of soil fertility
Irrigation, washing and drainage alone would not be sufficient to maintain the soil quality
for agricultural purposes. Soil fertility may decrease overtime if no other actions are taken to
protect the soils.
MitiQation measures. The PIU needs to encourage farmers to complement the use of
agrochemicals with the use of organic fertilizers such as manure. Crop rotation also is a good
source of organic nutrients; for example, the Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration
Institute has tested and recommends alternating the planting of gramineous and leguminous
plants from one season to another.
Fertilization needs to be adapted to irrigation conditions and to the growth stage of
crops. The PIU and its partners need to train farmers on how and when to use fertilizers and to
conduct public awareness campaigns to inform the population and farmers about the risks of
pollution posed by agrochemicals.
Increased pollution due to the use of agrochemicals
The improvement in irrigation and drainage probably would be followed by an increase in
the use of agrochemicals to boost agricultural output.  Improper or excessive use of
agrochemicals would have potential impacts on the soil and water quality.

Mitigation measures. Chemicals and fertilizers should not be the first solution (let alone
the only one) applied to these lands. Other techniques such as crop rotation and integrated
pest management (IPM) could improve soil fertility and productivity without increasing the risk of
pollution. Local population and farmers should receive information on how to properly use
fertilizers and pesticides through public awareness campaigns and training programs.

5. CONVERSION OF IRRIGATION SCHEMES FROM PUMPING TO GRAVITY
This component of the Irrigation Development Project (IDP) will convert 18 selected
irrigation schemes in different parts of the Republic of Armenia from pumped irrigation to gravity
irrigation. Due its magnitude and importance, the PIU has separated the irrigation scheme in
the region of Yeghegnadzor from the rest of the irrigation schemes. Likewise, this chapter will
analyze the Yeghegnadzor scheme separately from the other schemes. Therefore, this chapter
is organized as follows:
1. Objectives of the conversion component;
2. Conversion of the Yeghegnadzor irrigation scheme; and
3. Conversion of 17 smaller irrigation schemes.
5.1 Objectives of the Conversion Component
During the Soviet times, energy was cheap and abundant. Planners built pumping
stations on rivers, canals, and lakes/reservoirs to provide irrigation water in different parts of
Armenia. Since the beginning of the nineties, however, electricity has become much more
expensive and not readily available. Also, faced with a severe shortage of financial resources,
the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) enterprises can no longer afford to maintain the
pumping stations at the same level as previously. Today, most pumping stations are working at
only a small fraction of their design capacity, with a high proportion of pumps in a state of
disrepair. As a result, several areas that were irrigated during the Soviet times are not currently
irrigated due to the lack of irrigation water. The Govemment continues to fund the low-level
operation of the pumping stations but can ill afford to continue this subsidy because pumped
irrigation has become economically non-viable.
The conversion component of the IDP will convert 18 selected irrigation schemes from
pumped irrigation to gravity irrigation. As suggested above, the main objectives of this
conversion are to (IDP/PIU, 1999 d):
*  reduce considerably the O&M costs of the irrigation system;
* solve the problem of financial shortage of O&M enterprises;
n provide reliable irrigation to all the areas that used to receive irrigation water in the
past (i.e., when the pumping stations were working);
* increase crop yields and allow the cultivation of cash crops; and
* decrease pressure for migration away from rural areas.
The PIU has targeted a selection of 18 irrigation schemes for conversion from pumping
to irrigation. After disregarding a number of irrigation schemes for various technical reasons
(e.g., irrigation water deficit, lack of on-farm irrigation network), the PIU conducted a detailed
economic assessment of converting 26 irrigation schemes from pumped irrigation to gravity
irrigation. This assessment confirmed the economic feasibility of the conversion for 18
schemes, including the Yeghegnadzor scheme. Table 20 outlines the main positive impacts of
the conversion component.

5.2 Conversion of the Yeghegnadzor Irrigation Scheme
This section describes the conversion of the Yeghegnadzor irrigation scheme (based on
IDP/PIU, 1999d and IDP/PIU, 1999e), identifies the key potential environmental impacts of this
conversion, and proposes possible mitigation measures for each key negative impact.
5.2.1 Description of the Yeghegnadzor conversion project9
In the dry mountainous marz of Vayots-Dzor, the Yeghegnadzor irrigation scheme relies
heavily on pumped irrigation. Its five pumping stations are currently operating at slightly over
one-third of their capacity, consuming annually 15.7 million kWh of electricity (or 37 percent of
their design capacity) and supplying 12.19 million m3 of irrigation water (or 40 percent of the
design capacity). As a result, only 40 percent (1,896 hectares, out of a total of 4,770 ha) of the
land covered by the irrigation scheme is currently supplied with irrigation water.
The IDP would eliminate most but not all of the pumping stations. It would take water
from the Yeghegis river at an elevation of 1,550 m (village of Alayazi) and carry this water by
gravity to irrigate the 4.770 ha of land through a combination of open concrete canals (15.8 km),
steel pipelines (1.2 km), and steel-pipe siphons (7.2 km) totaling 24.2 km. The new water
system would use some of the old pipelines used by the pumping stations but, given the head
supplied by the elevation of the new water intake, the project design institute expects that there
would be no need for pumping for the most part. Map 14 shows the Yeghegnadzor irrigation
conversion scheme, including the proposed project, the two alternatives considered, and the
location of different river flow monitoring stations.
The conversion from pumping to gravity of the Yeghegnadzor irrigation scheme will
require building:
*  a new water intake (design capacity of 4.5 m3/s) from the Yeghegis river, a
couple of kilometers from the village of Alayazi; and
* 24.2 km of water conveyance consisting of 15.8 km of open canals and 9.1
km of siphons/pipelines.

5.2.2 Main potential impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures
We have identified the following potential negative impacts during the construction of the
infrastructure above:
*  Disturbance to the Yeghegis river flow, water quality, and aquatic ecosystem;
*  Possible landslides;
*  Landscape degradation;
*  Impacts on historic-cultural and nature monuments;
*  Impacts on planted fruit trees and terrestrial ecosystems; and
*  Accidents.
In the remainder of this section, we describe each potential impact and propose possible
mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate that impact. In most instances, the PIU has already
taken several noteworthy measures to mitigate the potential impacts listed above.
Disturbance to the Yeghegis river flow, water quality, and aquatic ecosystem
The proposed water intake will be built in a relatively pristine area of the Yeghegis river
basin. At that location, apart from a small drinking water pipeline that runs along the road, the
Yeghegis river basin offers a remarkable vista with towering mountains and a lush green river
bed. The water intake would be built in the tiny space between the road and the river Yeghegis.
If the Contractor does not take adequate protective measures, the construction of the water
intake, and presumably of the river diversion, could pollute the river and affect the ecosystem.
For example, if the concrete is mixed on site using water from the river, such water withdrawals
could alter the river flow regime and also possibly the quality of the water, if special handling
precautions are not taken. Construction works also could disfigure the rock formations in and
near the river bed and disrupt the aquatic ecosysytem.
Mitigation measures. The Contractor must take all precautionary measures to avoid
unduly polluting the river and its banks or disrupting the ecosystem during the construction of
the water intake. In particular, once the construction is completed, the Contractor shall remove
all construction equipment and materials from the site and, to the extent feasible, return the site
to its pre-existing conditions.
Landslides and risk to human health and property
A significant portion of the 24.2-km conveyance line (open canals and pipelines/siphons)
may have to be built in a steep terrain that is prone to landslides. As a result, the Contractor will
have to excavate large quantities of soil and rock to provide a stable foundation for the open
canal and the maintenance road adjacent to it. Soil and rock excavation could trigger landslides
of varying scales; large-scale landslides could cause serious injury or death to site workers and
perhaps damage to orchards and crops (depending on the location). Such landslides also
would disfigure the natural landscape of the mountains.
Mitigation measures. In the final design, the consultant engineer should undertake a
detailed a soil survey and geotechnical assessment to select the optimal canal route; i.e., terrain
presenting the lowest slope (less than 45 degrees) and least prone to landslides. Contractor
should take precautionary measures to protect workers and the public during excavation works.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
Landscape degradation
Construction of the conveyance line will require excavation of several thousand cubic
meters of rock and soil. Haphazard dumping of those excavated materials on the ravine side of
the canal could exacerbate soil erosion due to removal of the vegetative cover, reduce rainwater
infiltration and increase rainwater runoff, and scar the mountain landscape. Damaging the
magnificent landscape of the Yeghegis river valley could deal a serious blow to the potential for
tourism and related income to the local population.
Mitigation measures. The Contractor shall develop a construction site management plan
indicating clearly the site access roads and management methods for excavated and refill
materials. To the extent possible, the Contractor shall avoid dumping Df excavated materials in
the ravine below the canal. Instead, the Contractor shall maximize the reuse of excavated
materials as refill materials in building and stabilizing the canal and access road foundations.
Also, where necessary to prevent soil erosion and protect the landscape, the Contractor shall
seed the excavated materials with local varieties of plants and flowers. Use of a hydro-seeder
would be highly indicated.
Impacts on historic-cultural and nature monuments
The Yeghegnadzor region is uniquely rich in cultural heritage and nature monuments.
The proposed conveyance line would cross an area rich in historic-cultural monuments and
sites, including:
* Remnants of the ancient town of Eghegis (IX-X century A.D.), located 1-2 km
southwest from Alayazi village;
 Agarakadzor bridge, 4 km southeast from Yeghegnadzor; and
* Tanahat cathedral, 5 km east from Vernashen village.
Without adequate planning, the construction of this conveyance line could destroy or
degrade some of those monuments and sites. The scheme is not within or adjacent to a
specially-protected nature area (i.e., state reserve, state reservation, national park, or nature
monument).
Mitigation measures. As part of the detailed design of this conversion scheme, the
design engineer shall work very closely with the Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments
Preservation to select the optimal route for the conveyance line.' The routing will need to
respect certain requirements and conditions that depend on the type of historic or cultural
monument encountered, especially in the Yeghegis valley. This could include minimum setback
distances from the closest historic-cultural monuments or sites (e.g., 10 m, 100 m, 300 m
depending on the site's size and historic-cultural importance). Also, the Contractor shall take all
necessary steps to stop construction work immediately if excavation works uncover potentially
historic-cultural sites or monuments that were not previously known or identified on the map.
The Contractor then shall work with the PIU and the Department of Historic and Cultural
Monuments Preservation to determine adequate steps to protect those monuments or sites
before proceeding with the construction works. The Department has expressed its interest in

participating in this important monitoring and review; the Department's active participation is
required to ensure that potential impacts are adequately mitigated and construction activities are
not delayed unnecessarily.
Impacts on the biodiversity of the project region
During the first km or two, the conveyance line would go through apple and walnut
orchards, which would require uprooting several hundred trees. The natural ecosystem of the
Rind-Aghavnadzor section of the irrigation network is characterized by a rich diversity of wild
grains and is considered as one of the relatively better preserved wild grain habitats in Armenia.
The construction works could have a negative impact on that special ecosystem.
Mitiqation measures. Other things being equal, the design engineer should work with
the PIU to select the route that destroys the least number of fruit trees and other trees. When
uprooting of some fruit trees is inevitable, the PIU shall compensate their owners for the
potential loss of income generated by those trees. Also, the PIU shall take measures (e.g.,
careful routing of conveyance line) to ensure that the water conveyance line and the irrigation
activities shall not disrupt the natural habitat of wild grains in the Rind-Aghavnadzor section.
5.2.3 Main potential impacts during operation and maintenance and proposed
mitigation measures
We have identified the following potential impacts during the operation and maintenance
of the converted Yeghegnadzor irrigation scheme:
* Insufficient availability of water resources certain years;
Sanitary flow considerations;
Barriers to fish migration up the Yeghegis river; and
* Canal sedimentation and water losses.
In addition. unsustainable agricultural practices, while not resulting directly from this project
component, could dilute its positive impacts in the long term. Appendix G (Section G.6)
describes those impacts associated with unsustainable agricultural practices and the EA Team's
general recommendations to mitigate them.
Insufficient availability of water resources
The area of Yeghegnadzor is one of the driest regions in Armenia (see Figure 5 and
Map 5) and water resources are scarce. Moreover, diversion schemes upstream of the project
area (i.e. Arpa-Lake Seven tunnel) currently reduces further the natural water availability in the
Yeghegis river (see Box 10). The availability of water for the proposed irrigation scheme will
depend on the proper allocation of water from different sources, nameiy the Yeghegis river and
the Ketchut reservoir (on the Arpa river).

Lake Sevan and VorotanlArpa-Lake Sevan Tunnel
The water level in Lake Sevan has been lowered by about 19 m over a period of 40 years. The
i water has been utilized for agriculture and hydropower generation. In order to increase the inflow, water is
transferred from river Arpa to Lake Sevan through the Arpa-Sevan tunnel. In addition, in 1996, the
Government of Armenia set a limit of 370 million m3 for the annual discharge from the lake. Besides the
Lake Sevan Environmental Action Plan (see Section 2.5.2), various measures have been formulated
aimed at raising the Lake's level by three meters (from the end of 1996 level) by the year 2015.
The Government has set a minimum limit of 250 Mm3 to be diverted per year through the Arpa-
Lake Sevan tunnel starting from 1998. The Arpa River Diversion transports water from the Arpa and
Yeghegis Rivers to Lake Sevan via a two-segment 48.3 km-long tunnel built from 1963 to 1982. The
system consists of five major components:
*   Ketchut Reservoir, which stores water diverted from the Arpa River;
*  The Arpa-Yeghegis segment of the tunnel, which is 18.6 km long, with a diameter of 3.7 m and a
design flow capacity of 18 m3Is;
*  The Yeghegis River Conduit, which controls the flow of the Yeghegis River, allowing it to be diverted
into the Arpa Diversion;
I * The Yeghegis-Sevan segment of the tunnel, which is 29.7 km long and has a diameter of 4.1 m and a
design flow capacity of 25 m3/s; and
*  An open channel connecting the downstream mouth of the Arpa tunnel to Lake Sevan.
In September of 1978, the Government decided that a second diversion was required to provide
additional water to Lake Sevan, and in 1982 the Government approved a plan to divert an average of 165,
million m3 of water per year from the upper Vorotan River. The project is under construction and consists l
of three primary components:
3  A water intake structure at Spandarian Reservoir on the upper Vorotan River:
.   An 21.6 km long tunnel with a diameter of 3.0-3.3 m and a design flow capacity of 15 m3/s, extending
from the Spandarian River intake structure to Ketchut Reservoir; and
*  An outlet canal through which the Vorotan Tunnel will discharge water into Ketchut Reservoir

broken down as follows:
*  11.4 Mm3 (or 47 percent) diverted from Ketchut reservoir;
*  10.6 Mm3 (or 44 percent) diverted from Yeghegis river; and
* 2.2 Mm3 (or 9 percent) of water inflow from the mountains inside the
Yeghegis-Sevan segment of the tunnel.

Table 21 also indicates that the median monthly flows (period 1981-1998) in the
Yeghegis river at the Hermon monitoring station (a few kilometers upstream of the future water
intake) are 8.04 Mm3 and 4.82 Mm3 for the months of July and August, respectively.  In
comparison, during a site visit to the Yeghegis river on July 26, 1999, the ECODIT Team
observed a flow of bnly about 1.5 m3 /s (or 3.9 Mm3 per month) at the location of the future
water intake. This observation is consistent with the average flows reported at Hermon and with
the fact that 1999 has been a remarkably dry year in Armenia.
The proposed scheme would require a total of 30.7 Mm3 of irrigation water per year,
distributed as per Table 22. Clearly, under current water allocation patterns, water flows in the
Yeghegis river downstream of the Hermon monitoring station would not be sufficient to meet the
water requirements of the proposed water conversion scheme during the months of July and
August in a "median" year. For example, 8.67 Mm3 of irrigation water would be needed during
the month of August (see Table 22), compared to only 4.82 Mm3. that are expected to be
available in August in a median year (Table 21).

The PIU is fully aware of this situation and has envisioned that additional water would be
diverted from the Ketchut reservoir, through the Arpa-Yeghegis tunnel, into the Yeghegis river to
meet anticipated water shortages for the months of July and August. For example, in a median
year, about 3.85 Mm3 (8.67 minus 4.82) of additional water would need to be diverted from the
Ketchut reservoir into the Yeghegis river during the month of August. This would increase the
average monthly amount of water diverted through the Ketchut-Yeghegis tunnel from 5.52 Mm3
to 9.37 Mm3, well within the throughput capacity of the tunnel (18 m3/s).
But can the Ketchut reservoir sustain this additional diversion of water without affecting
current water users and causing ecological and health impacts in the Arpa river downstream?
Clearly, a fraction of the water currently flowing into the Arpa river is pumped at different
locations to provide irrigation water for some of the 1,896 hectares of irrigated land in the
Yeghegnadzor area. Most of this pumping would cease under the proposed project and those
lands would continue to get their irrigation water, but by gravity from the new water intake near
Alayazi village.
Still, the proposed conversion scheme would require more irrigation water than the
amounts currently needed to irrigate 1,896 hectares. But, other things being equal (same
farming practices, same climate), the same quantities of water would be required to irrigate the
4,700 hectares of land under the proposed conversion scheme as was previously required when
the pumping stations were operating and electricity was available and cheap (during Soviet
times). Therefore, subject to careful water transfer from Arpa to Yeghegis, irrigation water
availability would be the same under the proposed conversion project than it was in the eighties
when the same 4.700 hectares were irrigated by pumping.
While water would be available in a median rainfall year, however, flow data suggest that
there would be shortages in less-than-median rainfall years. As long as the diversion of water
into Lake Sevan continues to get top national priority, water probably would not be available to
irrigate the 4,700 hectares of land under the proposed conversion scheme in less rainy years.
This water stress situation would continue, even after the future Vorotan river diversion
becomes operational, because the Vorotan diversion is designed to increase water flow into
Lake Sevan and not to provide irrigation water for the Yeghegnadzor scheme.
Mitigation measures. Clearly, the PIU will need to secure the proper water permits and
water allocation agreements before starting any construction and/or rehabilitation works. In
particular, the PIU will need to apply for a water permit from the Ministry of Nature Protection's
Water Resources Department (see Section 2.1.2). The water permit shall guarantee that the
proposed conveyance line will receive the required monthly amounts of irrigation water to render
the Yeghegnadzor conversion project viable. The water permit would authorize the PIU to divert
certain monthly amounts of water from the Yeghegis river at the new water intake for irrigation
purposes.
At the same time, the PIU will need to secure a regional water reallocation agreement,
whereby certain monthly amounts of water would be diverted from the Ketchut reservoir to the
Yeghegis river (in addition to the amounts currently diverted to Lake Sevan). The new water
allocation scheme would need to respect the following conditions:
* Meet applicable sanitary flow requirements, both in the Arpa river and in the
Yeghegis river;

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
*  Meet the minimum annual inflow of 250 Mm3 into Lake Sevan from the Arpa-
Lake Sevan diversion;
*  Meet the current and future demand requirements of downstream users;
*  Provide for routine monitoring of water flows and uses at different points in
the system; and
*  Allow for revisions and fine-tuning depending on the monitoring results.
Of course, given the limited availability of water in the region and the competing
demands for water (Lake Sevan, irrigation, drinking, sanitary), use priorities will have to be set
and water quotas may not be guaranteed for all years.
Sanitary flow considerations
As explained above, the detailed design of the conversion of irrigation schemes in the
Yeghegnadzor region must provide for sufficient residual flow in both the Yeghegis and Arpa
rivers to protect both human health and environment. According to preliminary calculations
using methods that were applied during the Soviet times, the sanitary flows for the Yeghegis
and Arpa rivers are equal to 0.54 m3/s and 0.37 m3/s, respectively. Because the system design
is based on the 50th percentile of monthly river flows as measured by the nearest gauging
station (Hermon), the water requirements of the irrigation system will be met on average once
every two years. During low precipitation years (i.e., on average once every two years), the
water resources will not be sufficient to meet the competing demands of irrigation, drinking,
Lake Sevan replenishment, and sanitary flow. Also, the sanitary flow estimated using the Soviet
methods may not be sufficient to protect human health and the environment of the Yeghegis
and Arpa rivers.
Mitigation Measures. The PIU and Armhydromet shall monitor the residual flow in the
Arpa and Yeghegis rivers after project implementation to ensure that the sanitary flow
requirements are met. This would require installing a monitoring station downstream of the new
water intake on the Yeghegis river. Now new monitoring station would be needed on the Arpi
river because there are already two monitoring stations at the Yeghegnadzor and Areni
locations.
In addition, the PIU and the Ministry of Health shall monitor human health conditions in
the Yeghegnadzor region to ensure that the initial sanitary flow estimates are sufficient to
protect human health. Also, the PIU and the MoNP shall monitor the ecological conditions in
both rivers (fauna and flora) to ensure that those sanitary flow estimates do in fact protect the
aquatic ecosystems of both rivers. If not, it may be necessary to revise the sanitary flow
estimates for each river as well as the regional agreement on water allocation.
Barriers to fish migration up the Yeghegis river
The Yeghegis and Arpa rivers, as well as the Ketchut reservoir are considered to be
surface water bodies of higher fishing value in the Republic and are subject to the special
requirements of Decree 687. On the Yeghegis river, local red-spotted fish ("karmrakhait") would
find it difficult to swim upstream if a weir (small dam) is built to divert the water to the intake.
This would disturb the lifecycle of the fish and restrict their ability to spawn and reproduce.
Chapter 5. Conversion of Irrigation Schemes             ECODIT, January 2000, Page 70



EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
Mitigation Measures. The PIU and design engineer must meet the special requirements
of Decree 687 in order to preserve the fish resources of the Yeghegis and Arpa rivers. In
particular, as part of the water intake detailed design, the design engineer must include a
special ramp on the weir (a fish ladder) to enable the free passage of fish migrating upstream.
The design of this fish way shall provide the ideal conditions to facilitate the upstream migration
of the red-spotted fish.
Canal sedimentation and water losses
Soil erosion is a natural process in the semi-arid and steep mountains of the
Yeghegnadzor region. Eroded soil and fallen rocks could settle in the open canal. Over time,
sediment build-up in the canal would lead to the growth of weeds, the slowdown of canal water,
and eventually water spillover from the canal. Water losses also could occur if the concrete
canal breaks or is fractured. In the winter, temperature drops to below zero and the snow cover
varies from 0.50 m to 1 m in the Yeghegnadzor mountains. This cold temperature and snow
cover could cause the concrete canal to freeze and crack/break in different locations.
Mitigation measures. The design engineer shall take all necessary measures to keep
fallen soil and rocks from reaching the open canal. For example. the detailed design could
include a concrete ditch on the mountain side of the open canal --and parallel to it-- to trap fallen
stones and soil before they reach the canal. The canal design also shall take into account the
steep temperature variations (between day and night and between summer and winter) to
ensure that cracks will not develop in the canal structure. Also, the canal operator may want to
keep water running through the canal in the winter to prevent the canal from freezing. In
addition, the canal operator shall maintain and clean (i.e., remove sediments and weeds) the
open canal on a periodic basis. The canal operator also shall inspect the canal, side ditch, and
access road on a routine basis to identify potential problems (e.g., water leaks, fallen rocks) and
take appropriate measures (e.g., removing rocks) to correct them in a timely fashion.
5.2.4 Analysis of alternatives
Several alternatives to the proposed conversion scheme for Yeghegnadzor have been
studied in the past. The PIU reviewed those alternatives and compared the three most
"feasible" ones (see Table 23). Map 12 indicates the conveyance line routes for the proposed
conversion scheme and the other two alternatives. All options would transfer water from the
Arpa river to the Yeghegis river. The proposed scheme appears more advantageous than
Alternative #2 at all levels. Compared to Alternative #2, the proposed scheme would:
  Irrigate a larger surface area (4,770 ha compared to 4,529 ha);
*  Require building a much shorter conveyance line (24.2 km instead of 40.25 km);
*  Use much less irrigation water (30.67 Mm3/yr. compared to 38.07 Mm3/yr.); and
* Cost less than half as much to construct ($9.36 million compared to $20.66 million).

The proposed scheme also appears generally more advantageous than Alternative #1.
but not from all perspectives. The proposed scheme would cost less than Alternative #1, both in
absolute terms ($9.36 million versus $21.86 million) and on a per-hectare basis ($1,960/ha vs.
$3,270/ha.). Also, it would require building a much shorter conveyance line (24.2 km instead of
55.88 km) and would not require building a tunnel. However, while the proposed scheme would
require less irrigation water in absolute terms (30.67 Mm3/yr. compared to 38.8 Mm3/yr.), it
would require more water than Alternative #1 on a per-hectare basis (6,420 m3/ha/yr. compared
to 5,805 m3/ha/yr.).  Also, the proposed scheme would not save as much electricity as
Alternative #1 and has a lower productivity indicator.
From an environmental perspective, the tunnel under Alternative #1 would not eliminate
the need for building concrete channels. In fact, Alternative #1 would require building about 37
miles of concrete channels, more than twice the length of channels under the proposed scheme.
However, the concrete channel under Alternative #1 would not go through the Yeghegis river
Valley with its rich cultural heritage. Furthermore, the tunnel (Alternative #1) would create large
quantities of excavated materials (rocks and gravel) that would require adequate disposal,
would require a long time to build, and may cause death and personal injury from accidents.
For example, the 49.3-km long Arpa-Sevan tunnel took 18 years to build.

5.3 Conversion of 17 Smaller Irrigation Schemes
This section describes the smaller 17 conversion schemes proposed in different marzes,
identifies potential impacts during construction and operation, and recommends specific
measures to mitigate those impacts. Generally, the impacts identified and mitigation measures
recommended. when applicable, are similar to those identified for the Yeghegnadzor scheme,
but are smaller in scale. The PIU has already taken most of those potential impacts into
consideration as part of the project planning and design.
Of the 18 irrigation schemes targeted for conversion. four schemes are either within or
adjacent to a specially-protected nature area:
*  Vardenis Scheme (#12) is within the Lake Sevan National Park;
*  Azatech Scheme (#14) is within the Her-her State Reservation;
*  Tsav-Shikahogh Scheme (#17) is adjacent to the Shikahogh State Reserve
(see Map 13);
*  Getahovit Scheme (#5) is adjacent to the Ijevan State Reservation; and
*  Ijevan Scheme (#6) is adjacent to the Ijevan State Reservation.
5.3.1 Description of the project component
Table 24 summarizes the current situation and the proposed conversion for each of the
18 irrigation schemes, including the Yeghegnadzor scheme (Scheme 13). For example, in
1999, Irrigation Scheme #1 (Aygedzor) had a surface area of 20 hectares and three pumping
stations along the Akhinja river. Under the proposed conversion, the scheme would irrigate 950
hectares of land by gravity through a 13-km pipeline from the Aygedzor reservoir. Water intake
would increase from 0.10 Mm3 to 4.76 Mm3 per year. Overall, the conversion project would
increase the irrigated surface area from 5.718 ha (currently) to 15,257 ha and would require
building 179 km of conveyance lines (concrete channels, pipelines and siphons). All the lands
that will be irrigated after the conversion used to be irrigated when the pumping stations were
working (see Section 5.1). According to the IDP, no irrigation of new lands is planned. The
amount of irrigation water would more than double, reaching 85 Mm3 per year compared to 36
Mm3/year currently. Section 5.1 outlined the main positive impacts of the project to convert
irrigation from pumping to gravity.
Each of the 18 schemes falls into one of three categories, depending on the source of
water replacement:
I) Moving the water intake upstream along the same river or canal;
II) Moving the water intake from a river/canal to the reservoir that is feeding that
river/canal; and
l1l) Tapping another river or canal as a source of water.

5.3.2 Main potential impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures
The construction of the 17 smaller conversion schemes will entail the same types of
works (e.g., building water intakes and concrete channels, installing steel pipelines and siphons,
etc.) as for the Yeghegnadzor scheme, but at a smaller scale. Therefore, the construction of the
17 conversion schemes may have the same types of potential negative impacts as those
identified for the Yeghegnadzor scheme (Section 5.2.2), albeit with varying levels. Therefore,
the potential negative impacts during construction are:
*  Disturbance to existing river flow, water quality, and aquatic ecosystem;
*  Possible landslides;
*  Landscape degradation;
Impacts on historic-cultural and nature monuments;
Impacts on planted fruit trees and terrestrial ecosystems; and
. Accidents.
For each type of impact, the EA Team recommends the same types of mitigation measures as
in Section 5.2.2.
5.3.3 Main potential impacts during operation and proposed mitigation measures
Likewise, the same types of potential negative impacts can be expected during the
operation of these 17 conversion schemes. As explained in Section 5.2.3, the key potential
impacts during operation are:
*  Insufficient availability of water resources;
*  Sanitary flow considerations;
*  Barriers to fish migration; and
*  Canal sedimentation and water losses.
The rest of this section will describe those impacts specific to the 17 conversion
schemes.
Insufficient availability of water resources
Table 25 summarizes the annual water flow (50th, 75th, and 97th percentiles), monthly
water flows for July and August (50th percentile), and minimum monthly flow during the summer,
as measured by the closest monitoring station along the new water source for each scheme.
The table also indicates the annual and July-August monthly water intake requirements for
irrigation for each scheme. A quick comparison of supply (annual and monthly flows) and
demand (water intake) generated by the conversion schemes suggests that water should be
available to meet the water requirements of each scheme. This is not surprising considering
that the PIU has already used water availability to eliminate a number of schemes in areas with
limited water resources (e.g., Lusakhbjur, Lernavan, and Saroukhan).

For example, Scheme #4 would require 8.56 Mm3/yr, which is far less than the 97-th
percentile of the annual water flow in the Debed river at that location (431 Mm3/yr). Also,
Scheme #4 would require 0.82 and 0.87 m3/month of irrigation water during the months of July
and August. much less than the median monthly river flows of 24.3 m3/mo. and 16.3 m3/mo_ at
that location. The monthly water requirements for July and August are also less than the
minimum monthly flow during the summer of 11.1 m3/mo.
In some instances, although the water requirements for July and August would be
satisfied during a median year (i.e., 50-th percentile), they may not be satisfied during a year
with less rainfall (one year in two on average). For example, for Scheme #1, the monthly water
intakes of 0.44 m3/mo. and 0.47 m3/mo. for the months of July and August, respectively, would
not be met in a minimum year (monthly flow of 0.48 m3/mo.) considering other potential uses
and sanitary flow requirements.
Sanitary flow considerations
Table 26 presents the estimates of monthly sanitary flow and monthly residual flows for
July and August after project implementation (in a median year) for each conversion scheme, as
provided by the PIU and their design engineers. The table shows that the sanitary flow
requirements would be met by all conversion schemes during a median-rainfall year. However,
because the residual flow is too close to the sanitary flow for some schemes (e.g., Schemes 3
and 4), the sanitary flow would not be met in less rainy years if no reduction is made to the
amount of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes. Note that when the residual flow is exactly
the same as the sanitary flow (Schemes 1 and 14), river flows are controlled by the actual
discharges from the reservoir upstream. As illustrated in the table, sanitary flow considerations
are not applicable to irrigation canals or drainage collectors (Schemes 8 to 12 and 16) because
those canals are artificial structures designed to convey water.
Mitiqation measures. As for the Yeghegnadzor conversion scheme, the analysis above
highlights the need to:
-  Secure water needs through separate water permits and institutional
arrangements for some schemes;
- Put in place adequate monitoring and allocation procedures, with provisions
for reduced intake amounts in less rainy years;
, Provide for revising the water intake amounts if monitoring and field
observations suggest that sanitary flows have been underestimated (or
overestimated).
In particular, sanitary flow requirements need to be met on a daily flow basis and not on
a monthly flow basis (see Appendix G, Section G.2 on the minimum daily flow for the Potomac
river near Washington, D.C.).

Table 27 summarizes the specific requirements applicable to individual conversion
schemes. Where applicable, measures should be put in place to:
1. Protect the flora and fauna registered in the Red Book;
2. Protect fish resources in accordance with Decree 687; and
3. Safeguard historic-cultural and nature monuments.
The remainder of this section identifies specific concerns for individual conversion schemes,
including historic-cultural monuments, nature monuments, and other sensitive habitats that need
special attention.

Conversion Scheme #12: Vardenis (Gegharkunik marz)
Vulnerable habitats
I The scheme is in the steppe landscape and includes the area of Lake Gilli,
which was dried up and converted into arable land (see Appendix G, Section
G.5). In the past, various species of water and bog flora and fauna inhabited
the area; the species disappeared from the area almost immediately after the
lake was dried. Some of the birds found new habitats in different parts of the
Lake Sevan basin as well as other wetlands of Armenia.  The area's
vegetation of the area has changed and has become more typical of arid
areas;
2. The scheme is within the Sevan National Park, where the use of the water,
flora and fauna resources is subject to special permit requirements (Law on
Specially-Protected Areas, Article 11);
3. River Masrik flows into Lake Sevan and provides fish-laying grounds for three
endemic species living in Lake Sevan. It is subject to the special protection
requirements of Decree 687 (1991), including guidelines and regulations on
fish resources by the MoNP; and
4. A project is under preparation for the rehabilitation of Lake Gilli under the
UNDP project "The rehabilitation of the ecological balance of Lake Sevan"
and as part of the "Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan." The project has
received preliminary approval and would be financed by the Global
Environmental Facility (GEF).
Specific mitigation measures
. The proposed conversion project may be in conflict with the proposed
restoration of Lake Gilli. The Government of Armenia may want to engage in
wide public consultations with concerned and knowledgeable stakeholders

and decide on the best course of action before implementing this conversion
scheme;
* Water use from reservoirs, dams, etc. will require permitting from the MoNP
and must be in strict compliance with Decree 687 (1991) on fisheries; and
* The south-western part of the scheme is adjacent to the peat-bogs, which are
currently used for peat-mining. A special attention should be paid to the
wetlands and to protecting the ecological balance (Convention on
Biodiversity, Articles 8 & 14).
Conversion Scheme #14: Azatek (Vayots-Dzor marz)
Vulnerable habitats
1. The scheme passes through the Her-her State Reservation (1.5 to 2 km
section);
2. Fossils of Nummilites tesgizehen sist are found in Azatec village: and
3. The degraded Azatec mountainous kserofit ecosystems are rich in wild pear,
almond, plum and other wild grain varieties of genetic importance.
Specific mitigation measures
- Obtain water permit from the MoNP, including applicable requirements for
passing through the Her-her state reservation;
-  Ensure the protection of the nature monuments;
-  Meet fishing standards and the requirements of Decree 687 at the Arpa river;
and
* Protect the unique ecosystem of wild plants of genetic significance.
Conversion Scheme #15: Khndzorut (Vavots-Dzor Marz)
Vulnerable habitats
1. Although the scheme is not within any protected area, there are unique tree
and bush ecosystems and several endemic and rare plant species such as
wild pear, rose-hip, almond, and wild grains. The area has an important
stock of genetic agricultural resources.
Specific mitigation measures
 Need to protect the unique and endangered plant species in the area during the
construction of the open channel and pipelines, in particular the section between
Khndzorut river intake and the catchment area; and

Conversion Scheme #17: Tsav-Shikahog (Siunik marz)
Vulnerable habitats
1. "Shikahogh" (Red Soil) State Reserve, which is cut across by the project area
(water intake, etc.);
2. "Sosu Purak" (Pine Forest) State Reservation downstream of the Tsav River,
between the altitudes of 700 m to 800 m; and
3. Historic monuments. such as the Srashen village church and its cemetery.
Specific mitigation measures
* Need to protect endangered fauna and flora: there are 46 endangered plant
species and 24 endangered vertebrate species in the area. These species
may be seriously affected due to the construction of new water conveyance
schemes. Because the area is characterized by kserofit ecosystems and is
located in a transitional geo-ecological zone, any changes to the water
balance will upset the ecological balance. Without adequate precautions to
protect nature and water, vegetation and reptiles will be affected first, leading
to the disruption of the whole ecological balance;
i Need to maintain the natural regime conditions of the State Reserve and
safeguard its natural development process (e.g., keep noise levels down)
during construction works (water intake, conveyance line, etc.) in the
"Shikahogh" State Reserve; and
* Need to protect terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity of the "Shikahogh" State
Reserve and the Tsav River, in particular sanitary flow requirements through
"Sosu Purak" (Pine Forest).

6. DAM SAFETY IMPROVEMENT
This component of the proposed IDP calls for improving the safety of 20 priority dams
(embankment type) in different parts of Armenia (see Map 14). In addition to improving dam
safety, the Dam Safety Project (DSP) will establish an effective monitoring system and an
emergency warning system for all dams. This EA focuses on the potential impacts associated
with the rehabilitation of the 20 priority dams. This chapter is organized in four sections as
follows:
1.    Objectives of the dam safety component;
2.    Description of the dam safety component;
3.    Main potential impacts during construction and proposed mitigation
measures; and
4.    Main potential impacts during operation  and  proposed  mitigation
measures.
6.1 Objectives of the Dam Safety Component
Three complete dam failures occurred in Armenia in 1974, 1979, and 1994. All reported
accidents could have been avoided if proper surveillance and O&M were in place. Such
observations suggest that other dam failures cannot be ruled out if the situation of dam safety in
Armenia is allowed to remain out of control.
The dam safety component of the IDP calls for improving the safety of 20 priority dams.
The primary objective of this component is to protect the population and the socio-economic
infrastructure downstream of the dams facing the highest risk of failure. In particular, this
component is expected to have the following positive impacts:
*  Better protection for about 350,000 people downstream, thanks to improved
dam safety and strengthened warning and emergency systems;
.  Better protection of the water resource as well as the dam-based and
downstream socio-economic activities and infrastructure;
*  Better monitoring and control of existing erosion and reservoir sedimentation:
and
*  Better O&M and longer sustainability of existing dams. reducing the need for
new dams and associated environmental impacts.
6.2 Description of the Dam Safety Component1"
The project will improve, through rehabilitation and reconstruction, the safety of the 20
priority dams listed in Table 28. The table also presents the main characteristics and the
proposed improvement works for each targeted dam. The project will carry out rehabilitation
works primarily; no new construction will take place except for the construction of new spillways
to protect existing dams. The major works with potential environmental impacts are:
World Bank, 1997 and WB/MoA, 1999

1.     Construction of new spillways;
2.      Rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing spillways; and
3.      Slope stabilization and strengthening.
The 20 targeted dams have a total reservoir capacity of 380 Mm3 and a total catchment
area of 2,684 km2. About 350,000 people currently live at risk of dam failure downstream of
those 20 dams.

6.2.1 Construction of new spillways
According to current plans, new spillways will be required and constructed at five dams:
Aparan, Karnout. khalavar, Her-Her, and Sovietashen. The new construction will bring their
total spillway discharge capacity (existing plus new capacities) to international norms. This is
urgently needed for safety purposes because overtopping is considered the most critical failure
mechanism for embankment dams. In general, the new spillways will be constructed in the
vicinity and in parallel to the existing spillways, reducing the economic cost and the
environmental impacts (Hadj-Mabrouk, 1999).
6.2.2 Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of existing spillways
Rehabilitation/reconstruction work is currently planned on all 20 dams except the
Karnout dam. Current plans envision closing the old spillway of Karnout dam after construction
of the new one. The work will vary from site to site, from complete reconstruction to minor repair
(Hadj-Mabrouk 1999).
6.2.3 Slope stabilization/strengthening
The project is currently expected to improve the stability of seven dams under
earthquake loading: Aparan, Gegardalich, Karnout, Sarnakhpiour, Sovietashen, Tavshud, and
W. Bazmaberd. Depending on the case, this would require the strengthening of one (generally,
on the reservoir side) or both of the dam slopes.
6.3 Main Potential Impacts During Construction and Proposed Mitigation
Measures
Considering the rehabilitation nature of the project and the type of works to be carried
out, the negative impacts on the environment are expected to be insignificant or minor.
Nevertheless, the construction of new spillways, the rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing
spillways, and slope stabilization/strengthening may involve excavation, tunneling, concrete
construction, fabrication of temporary buildings, creation of access roads, and opening of new
quarries, which may have the following potential negative impacts:
* Landscape degradation and soil erosion;
* Impacts from improper transport and disposal of excavated materials and
demolition debris; and
* Impacts on water quality and aquatic life.
The strengthening of dam slopes will require large but not excessive quantities of stone,
gravel, and soil materials. For the Karnout dam, for example, it is estimated that slope flattening
would require about 55,000 m3 of soil materials (Hadj-Mabrouk, 1999). It may be necessary to
use existing quarries or open new ones to supply those materials.
Landscape degradation and soil erosion
All dam safety improvement works will take place in areas where the land has previously
been disturbed, so no new pristine areas will be affected. Nevertheless, building of access
roads and water spillways, and opening of new quarries, could uproot plants and trees, degrade
the landscape irreversibly, and exacerbate soil erosion. Conversely, the project will improve the
Chapter 6. Dam Safety Improvement                       ECODIT, January 2000, Page 89



EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
landscape and reduce soil erosion impacts in some cases. For example, the project will replace
open trenches by tunnel waterways for some dams. Open trenches not only are an eyesore in
the landscape but also are more exposed to hill stone, landslides, and garbage dumping.
Map 15 overlays the targeted dam locations with the five States Reserves and the
Sevan National Park. All of the 20 dams targeted for safety improvement are not within or near
a State Reserve or the Sevan National Park, except for the Azat and Gegardalich dams, which
border on the State Reserve of Khosrov.
Mitigation measures.  The Contractor shall take all precautions to minimize land
disturbance, uprooting of trees, soil erosion, and unnecessary scarring of the natural
surroundings (including opening of new quarries). For example, as appropriate, the Contractor
shall use existing quarries instead of opening new quarries, or route access roads judiciously to
prevent cufting through wooded areas. The Contractor shall make its best efforts to restore all
sites to their pre-existing conditions. For example, the Contractor shall put in- place soil of equal
quality and plant new ground cover and trees to reduce erosion. Also, the Contractor shall
prepare operation and closure plans and obtain all necessary permits from the MoNP and
local/regional authorities for existing and new quarries.  The Contractor shall minimize
landscape impacts from the disposal of excavated materials and demolition debris (see next
impact). Contractors shall use special care for ali safety improvement works on the Azat and
Gegardalich dams.
Improper transportidisposal of excavated materials and demolition debris
The projected works will generate significant, but manageable amounts of excavated
materials (e.g., from digging new tunnels) and demolition debris (e.g., from replacing concrete
slabs). At the Aparan dam, for example, about 19,000 m3 of materials will be excavated to build
a new emergency spillway tunnel. Also, the concrete slabs on the reservoir side of the dam will
be removed and replaced with new ones. Improper transport and disposal of those inert, non-
hazardous materials could degrade the landscape and pollute the air temporarily (dust).
Clearly, however, local contractors currently reuse those materials that can be recycled. For
example, during a visit to the Aparan dam (August 20), the Contractor in charge of rehabilitating
the water outlet and tunnel informed the ECODIT Team that they are reusing the concrete slabs
removed from the dam's water outlet at one of their construction sites.
Mitigation measures.  To the extent possible, the Contractor shall reuse/recycle
excavated materials and demolition debris. For example, to the extent desirable and applicable,
the Contractor shall reuse excavated or dredged materials (e.g., from digging new tunnels,
sediment dredging) as raw materials to stabilize dam slopes. Also, the Contractor shall make
every effort to reuse removed concrete slabs, either on site or at another construction site. The
contractor shall obtain permits from the necessary government agencies (MoNP, marz and local
authorities) that will specify transport methods/routes and disposal methods for all excavated
materials, in conformity with MoNP's environmental guidelines. The Contractor shall implement
measures to minimize dust emissions (e.g., by spraying with water) and other air and noise
pollution from operating motor-powered equipment.
Impact on water quality and quantity and aquatic life
The rehabilitation and construction works will not alter the original capacity of the dams
or affect the quantity or quality of water stored in the reservoir. This is provided that slope
stabilization works take place during the summer when reservoir water levels are low and the
Chapter 6. Dam Safety Improvement                        ECODIT, January 2000, Page 90



EA of Irrigation Development Project                       Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
dam slopes are exposed to the air and sun. Nevertheless, if proper precautions are not taken,
dangerous liquids could seep into the reservoir and water from concrete mixing/pouring
(concrete, chemical additives), equipment engines (petroleum, oil), and various washing
operations (sewage, wastewater).
Decree 687 (1991) has identified six of the 20 targeted reservoirs (Arpi Lake, Aparan,
Azat, Mantash, Sarnaghbyur, and Aygedzor) as surface water bodies that require special
procedures to preserve their value for fishing (see Section 2.2.6). It is not anticipated that the
proposed rehabilitation works would have any impact on those fisheries, or harm the aquatic
fauna and flora of the 20 reservoirs, if standard precaution measures were taken.
Mitigation measures.  Contractors shall undertake the proposed works in a timely
fashion and, depending on the works to be performed (e.g., slope stabilization), while reservoir
water levels are low. The Contractor shall take all precautions to prevent the spillage or
discharge of dangerous liquids such as concrete, petroleum products, chemicals, or other
construction materials into the reservoir. Such measures may include on-site storage, in
protected sheds, of the minimum required amounts of chemicals and careful drainage of used
oils/fluids from engines for off-site disposal. Special attention is required at the Mantash Dam
because it is used as a source of drinking water. The Contractor also shall put in place
adequate measures to protect the flora and fauna, especially in the six fishery reservoirs
identified by Decree 687.
6.4 Main Potential Impacts During Operation and Proposed Mitigation Measures
The dam safety component will not result in any significant negative impacts during
routine operation because it will not alter the capacity or routine operations of the dams.
Nevertheless, the ECODIT has identified the following two potential impacts:
*  Reservoir sedimentation: and
* Emergency water discharges.
The Dam Safety Project will reduce significantly the risks of dam failure but cannot eliminate
them totally. Appendix G outlines recommended measures to improve emergency response
preparedness for any residual catastrophic dam failure events. Because such risks existed
before the project and cannot be attributed to it (in fact, the project will reduce them), the EA
team recommends that the GoA undertake such measures in parallel with the proposed dam
safety improvement project (but not as a required mitigation measure under this EA).
Reservoir sedimentation
If access roads and quarries are built upgradient from the dam reservoirs, such works
may erode the soils locally; those eroded soils could be washed (by rainwater) or blown (by the
wind) into the dam reservoir. However, this soil loading would remain insignificant compared to
the current sediment loading of those reservoirs. According to Mr. Gabayan of the Dam
Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (DOME), reservoir sedimentation is a serious concern
for several dams in Armenia, including Aygedzor, Vardakar, Khalavar, Sevaberd, Tavoush, and
Tavshud. Reservoir sedimentation could reduce reservoir capacity, block the water entrance to
the reservoir, clog the water outlet, and affect water quality. Moreover, reservoir sedimentation
could affect dam performance and safety.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                        Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
Mitigation measures.   Although the proposed works will not increase reservoir
sedimentation significantly, the EA team recommends monitoring reservoir sedimentation and
sediment loading into the identified reservoirs, and soil erosion in the reservoir catchment areas.
Monitoring of sedimentation can be in the form of visual inspections and topographic surveys
(when water levels are very low) and bathymetric surveys (for the lowest parts of the reservoir).
This monitoring would allow the DOME to examine possible options to manage and control
sedimentation, including sediment removal. and to take the necessary measures.
Emergency water discharges
The increased capacity for emergency discharges, while it will improve dam safety,
could lead to further soil erosion downstream when the emergency discharge spillways are
functioning. Increased soil erosion could result from the intense energy released by the rapid
discharge of large volumes of water.
Mitigation measures. The design of the emergency spillways shall incorporate the
standard features for amortizing the energy carried by the released waters and reducing soil
erosion impacts downgradient.

7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
This chapter presents the EA Team's proposed Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
for the IDP project, consisting of four components:
1. Mitigation measures and institutional responsibilities for implementation;
2. Environmental monitoring;
3. Capacity building and training; and
4. Capital and recurrent costs.
7.1 Mitigation Measures and Institutional Responsibilities for Implementation
Chapters 4 to 6 identified the potential negative environmental impacts, during and after
construction, of each component of the proposed IDP. For each potential impact, Chapters 4 to
6 also described specific measures to eliminate, offset, or reduce those adverse impacts to
acceptable levels. For each potential impact described in the previous chapters, Table 29
identifies:
*  the proposed mitigation measure(s); and
*  the parties or agencies charged with implementing those measures, separated
into:
-- executing agencies, responsible for executing the measure;
- supervising agencies, responsible for supervising the executing agencies
to ensure that they are executing the mitigation measures as planned;
and
monitoring agencies, in charge of monitoring the extent of implementation
and the effectiveness of the mitigation measures and of adjusting the
program if needed.
For each component, the table distinguishes between the construction phase and the operation
and maintenance phase.
We can group the proposed mitigation measures and institutional responsibilities as
follows, depending on the identity of the monitoring agency:
(1) World Bank (WB): includes all measures calling on the PIU and associated
design institutes to obtain permits for water use and discharge and for the
disposal of dredged sediments, excavated soils, and demolition debris. The
World Bank will need to ensure that such permits are obtained from relevant
agencies (MoNP, local and regional authorities) before the construction works
are tendered out;
(2) PIU: includes all measures implemented by contractors, farmers, and other
institutes, supervised by institutes affiliated with the MoA (e.g., Drainage
Enterprise), and monitored by the PIU; and
(3) Partner agencies to the PIU and MoA: includes all measures requiring some
sort of monitoring by key partners of the PIUIMoA for this project, in particular
the MoNP and its affiliated agencies (Armhydromet, Monitoring Center), the
Ministry of Health, and the Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments
Preservation; e.g., monitoring of:

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
-- river flows (Armhydromet) and ecological conditions downstream of new
water intakes to check if flows remain within permitted sanitary flow levels
and make adjustments to those levels if warranted;
-- sedimentation of dam reservoirs;
-- the design and implementation of waste sampling and analysis
campaigns to determine the appropriate disposal method for dredged
sediments and excavated soils;
-- the transport and disposal of excavated materials to ensure that permit
requirements are being met (monitored jointly by MoNP, MoH, and local
and regional authorities); and
- route selection and construction activities that may have an impact on
historic-cultural monuments.
7.2 Environmental Monitoring
The three categories above show the wide range of monitoring functions, from document
review and visual field observations to field measurements, sampling and analysis.  For
example, as a monitoring agency, the World Bank simply would verify that the PIU has secured
the appropriate water and waste disposal permits (e.g., review written documentation, talk to
senior staff at the permitting agency such as MoNP). In contrast, actual field measurements of
environmental indicators (e.g., analysis of drainage water quality by the Drainage Enterprise)
are more elaborate and require advance planning and budgeting.
For each key environmental parameter requiring monitoring, Table 30 outlines the
monitoring requirement, the monitoring agency, and the estimated capital and recurrent costs of
the monitoring requirement.
7.3 Capacity Building and Training
Clearly, the proposed EMP will require building the capacity of the executing,
supervising, and monitoring agencies charged with implementing the plan.  This section
proposes the following key capacity building and training tasks:
1. Organizational set-up;
2. Procurement of equipment and supplies; and
3. Technical assistance and training.
7.3.1 Organizational set-up
As the key agency in charge of executing the IDP and of supervising and monitoring the
implementation of the EMP, the PIU will have to designate a dedicated staff member to
coordinate and oversee the implementation of the EMP.
Also, the EA team recommends forming an Environmental Committee charged with
monitoring the implementation of the EMP. This Committee would include the Environmental
Officer (PIU) and representatives of the following monitoring agencies:
MoNP (EIA Department, Monitoring Center, Armhydromet, Water Resources
Protection Department, Hazardous Substances and Waste Management
Division, Department of Bioresources Protection);
Chapter 7. Environmental Management Plan                ECODIT, January 2000, Page 94



EA of Irrigation Development Project                     Ministry of Agnculture, IRP/PIU
*  Ministry of Health;
*  Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments Preservation;
*  Operation and Maintenance Enterprises:
*  Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute: and
*  Water Problems and Hydraulics Research Institute.
The EA team further suggests breaking this committee into working groups, one for each
component of the IDP, for practical and efficiency reasons. The Environmental Committee
could be chaired by the PIU Environmental Officer or the representative of the EIA Department.
7.3.2 Procurement of equipment and supplies
Table 31 summarizes the basic equipment and supplies needed to implement the
proposed EMP and the estimated capital costs of those equipment/supplies.
7.3.3 Technical assistance and training
To support the implementation of the EMP, the EA team has identified the need for
technical assistance (TA) in the following environmental management areas:
*  Designing and implementing a hazardous waste sampling and analysis
campaign and a hazardous waste management plan (TA targeting MoNP,
MoH, and laboratories);
e  Best management practices for the maintenance of irrigation canals and
drainage collectors (TA targeting the Drainage Enterprise and PIU); and
*  Designing fish ladders on water intake weirs (TA targeting Design Institutes
and MoNP).
Technical assistance could be in the form of formal or hands-on training programs, orientation
visits abroad, and short or long-term consulting support.
7.4  Capital and Recurrent Costs
As explained previously, Tables 30 and 31 provide the estimated capital and recurrent
costs of the proposed environmental monitoring requirements as well as the capital costs of the
equipment and supplies required to implement the EMP. Building on those cost estimates and
adding the costs of other EMP requirements not included in those two tables, Table 32
estimates total capital costs of $889,000 and annual recurrent costs between $137,400/year to
$187,400/year for the entire EMP. The mechanical shovel/versatile dredger and the specially-
equipped tractor for cutting plants cost an estimated $490,000, or over half of the total capital
costs of the EMP. The disposal of excavated materials (hazardous waste and non-hazardous
waste inside populated areas) could cost between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, or between
one third and half of the total annual recurrent costs of the EMP. After taking out the costs of
measures that are already included in the IDP project (P) or are alread carried out (or should be
carried out) under other funds (0) (e.g., State Budget), the remaining additional costs of the
EMP would be $810,000 for capital costs and $49,900/year for annual recurrent costs.

8. CONCLUSIONS
This chapter concludes this report with the following sections.
1. Summary of findings; and
2. Limitations of EA.
8.1 Summary of Findings
The proposed Irrigation Development Project (IDP) aims primarily to 1
rehabilitate and improve existing  irrigation schemes and  infrastructures.
Because it will not create new irrigation schemes or build important new
infrastructure such as dams, the IDP will have none of those significant impacts
typically associated with such large projects. The positive socio-economic and
environmental impacts of the IDP outweigh its potential negative impacts. which
remain  acceptable subject to full implementation  of the  Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) recommended by this EA.
To preparate the IDP, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has already
identified in advance several potential negative environmental impacts of the
proposed project and incorporated into the project design adequate measures to
eliminate, offset, or reduce those adverse impacts to acceptable levels.  In
particular, for each project component, the PIU  has identified different
alternatives to achieve the objectives sought and has compared those I
alternatives on the basis of technical, economic, financial, and environmental
concerns.
Positive impacts. The proposed IDP will have significant positive impacts for the farmers
and people of Armenia. In particular. it will:
*  Improve agricultural output and productivity;
* Increase income for tens of thousands of farmers and their families throughout
Armenia;
* Increase the supply of water for irrigation (by increasing intake and/or reducing
losses and associated demand pressures on precious water resources such as Lake
Sevan);
* Save millions of US dollars annually in energy costs;
* Reduce the dependence on pumping, which is expensive and unreliable, to supply
irrigation water;
* Reduce water-logging and flooding of tens of villages and the spread of malaria in
the Ararat Valley; and
* Safeguard human life and property for 350,000 people living below the 20 dams
targeted for safety improvement.

Potential neaative impacts.   The EA  has identified several potential negative
environmental impacts associated with each component of the proposed IDP, both during
construction and operation and maintenance. Table 33 provides in matrix form the key potential
negative environmental impacts associated with each component of the proposed IDP.

Mitigation measures. Clearly, not all of these impacts will occur necessarily or with the
same magnitude for all components of the proposed IDP. The EA Team has proposed several
mitigation measures to eliminate, offset, or reduce those adverse potential impacts to
acceptable levels. Table 34 lists the key types of mitigation measures proposed for each
component of the IDP according to the executing agency:
. PIU;
* Design institute (Water Design Institute, Drainage Industrial Enterprise, Dam
Operation and Maintenance Enterprise);
* Contractors (collector dredging, water intake construction. etc.) and
consultants (e.g., sampling and analysis campaign);
.  Farmers;
* Water User Consumer Cooperatives (WUCCs); and

Implementing agencies. For each potential negative impact, the EA has identified the
parties or agencies charged with implementing the associated mitigation measures, which may
be grouped into three categories: executing, supervising, and monitoring agencies. The EA has
also grouped the proposed mitigation measures and institutional responsiblities into three
categories depending on the identity of the monitoring agency: World Bank, PIU, and partner
agencies to the PIU.
Environmental monitoring. EMP monitoring functions range from document review and
visual field observations to field measurements, sampling and analysis. The EA has outlined
the key environmental monitoring requirements for each component of the IDP. For each key
environmental parameter requiring monitoring, the EA has outlined the monitoring requirement,
the monitoring agency, and the capital and recurrent costs of the monitoring requirement.
Capacity building and trainina. The proposed EMP will require building the capacity of
the executing, supervising and monitoring agencies charged with implementing the plan. The
EA has outlined key capacity building and training tasks in the area of organizational set-up,
procurement of equipment and supplies, and technical assistance and training. Specifically, the
EIA Team recommends that the PIU designate an Environmental Officer among its staff and to
form an inter-agency Environmental Committee to oversee and monitor the implementation of
the EMP. The Committee would comprise the Environmental Officer (PIU) plus representatives
of the MoNP (EIA Department plus various other concerned departments), the Ministry of
Health, the Department of Historic and Cultural Monuments Preservation, Operation and
Maintenance Enterprises, the Soil Science, Agrochemistry and Melioration Institute, and the
Water Problems and Hydraulics Research Institute
The EA has identified the basic equipment and supplies that need to be purchased to
implement the proposed EMP and the estimated capital costs of those equipment/supplies.
Basic equipment and supplies include laptops, computers, specially-equipped tractor to cut
plants along canals and collectors, far-reaching mechanical shovel/versatile dregder,
piezometers. water and soil test kits, hydraulic monitoring stations and flow meters, and
bathymetric survey equipment.
In addition, the EA team has identified the need for technical assistance in the following
environmental management areas:
e  Designing and implementing a hazardous waste sampling and analysis
campaign and a hazardous waste management plan (targeting MoNP, MoH,
and laboratories);
*  Best management practices for the maintenance of irrigation canals and
drainage collectors (targeting the Drainage Enterprise and PIU); and
*  Designing fish ladders on water intake weirs (targeting Design Institutes and
MoNP).
Technical assistance could be in the form of formal or hands-on training programs, orientation
visits abroad, and short or long-term consulting support.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
Capital and recurrent costs. The proposed Environmental Management Plan will cost
about US$889,000 in capital costs and between $137,400/year and $187,400/year in annual
recurrent costs. This total budget includes the costs of certain measures that are already
included in the IDP Project (P) or are already carried out (or should be carried out) under other
funds (0) (e.g., State Budget). When the costs of such measures are subtracted, the remaining
additional costs of the EMP are $810,000 for capital costs and $49,900/year for annual
recurrent costs. The mechanical shovel/versatile dredger and the specially-equipped tractor for
cutting plants cost an estimated $490,000, or over half of the total capital costs of the EMP. The
total EMP includes a budget of $50,000 to $100,000 each year for the disposal of excavated
materials (hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste inside populated areas), or between one
third and half of the total annual recurrent costs of the EMP. Actual disposal costs will depend
on the results of the hazardous waste sampling and analysis campaign.
8.2 Limitations of the EA
The EA Team has conducted this EA under very strict time constraints. The Team did
not visit all project sites or identify all possible individual impacts of each single project under the
IDP. For a multi-component project of this type, it would not be feasible or realistic to visit and
assess each project and project area individually. Such an undertaking would be out of the
scope of this EA and would have required visiting and assessing six irrigation schemes to be
rehabilitated, 18 irrigation schemes to be converted from pumping to irrigation, and 20 dams
targeted for safety improvement. Instead, the EA team has targeted a few "representative"
project areas for field visits and complemented those visits with a thorough review and analysis
of written documentation on the various project components and project areas.
This approach allows us to identify the most likely range of potential impacts and
formulate the most appropriate and reasonable set of mitigation measures.  However,
unforeseen impacts may arise from certain individual projects; some of the impacts identified
may also require other, more adapted mitigation measures than the ones described in this EA.
Therefore, it will be important to adapt/adjust the findings and recommendations of this EA as
needed during project implementation. The Environmental Committee and the Environmental
Officer in charge of implementing the EMP will need to be alert to this possibility and acquire the
know-how and flexibility to adjust the EMP to specific situations as they arise.
Another serious limitation of this EA has been the difficulty to find reliable source
materials and documents in English. While the PIU has done an excellent job of translating
most progress and design reports from Armenian or Russian into English, several of the
translated materials were not in final draft and had not been adequately translated. More
generally, most of the materials on the environmental situation in Armenia are not in English,
except for the recent reports on the State of the Environment, the National Environmental Action
Program, and the Lake Sevan Action Program. The EA Team was able to address this
language difficulty thanks to the cooperation and support of the PIU team members and also to
the experience and commitment of our local consultants on the team.

APPENDIX E
PHOTOS
This appendix presents photos taken during field visits to the Hoktemberien canal, Ararat
Valley, Yegheganadzor area, and Aparan dam. All photos were taken by  Joseph Karam of
ECODIT.
1.1 Reconstruction of Hoktemberian Canal and Increase of Intake from Araks River
Photo 1.    The Araks River, looking upstream from the Karaghalla dam. The picture shows
the dike that helps to divert water to the Hoktemberien canal.
Photo 2.    The three gates of the water intake to the Hoktemberien canal. The IDP would
repair the three gates and add three more gates.
Photo 3.    Looking downstream from the water intake structure: Hoktemberien canal (left)
and Araks river (right). Most of the residual water flow downstream comes from
the Armenian side of the river, due to leaks in the sand release gates (see next
picture).
Photo 4.    Leaking sand-flushing gates at the water intake. During July and August, water
leaking from these gates provides the bulk of the residual flow downstream (2.5
m3/s from the Armenian side). The IDP project would repair the leaks in these
gates, which would reduce residual flow to a trickle. The water intake operator
opens the gates twice or three times (during the spring) per month for a whole
day to release sand back into the river. Such releases of water may not be relied
upon to secure the sanitary flow in the river downstream (2.5 m3/s on each side)
because they occur only two or three days per month.
Photo 5.    Beginning of the Hoktemberien canal. The canal operator dredges the settled
sands on a regular basis. Dredging and off-site shipment/disposal of sands from
the entire length of the Hoktemberien canal cost about $34,000 annually.
Photo 6.    Impressive waterfall next to the Hoktemberien hydropower station (1.5 MW) (left
to the waterfall, not seen on photo). Because the station was not operating that
day, the water was channeled through a bypass waterfall before continuing its
course to irrigate the Ararat Valley lands adjacent to the Araks Valley. Increase
of water flow into this and other hydropower stations along the Hoktemberien
would produce an additional 1 million kWh annually.

the background.

1.3 Rehabilitation and Improvement of Ararat Valley Drainage
Photo 8.    The IDP will rehabilitate this 17-km canal (10 m3/s) leading to the Arevshat
pumping station. Concrete slabs will need to be replaced and disposed of
properly.
Photo 9.    Water flowing from these two artesian wells (about 200 I/s each) mixes at the
Arevshat pumping station with the canal water of Photo 8 plus drainage water
(collector not shown). The pumping station is often not working and the water
flows by gravity through another channel to low-lying inhabited areas, flooding
them. The IDP will build a pipeline to transport these waters to the Hrazdan
River.
Photo 10.    Water from this poorly-constructed artesian well (500 Us) cannot be tapped
properly and instead has flooded 100 ha of land nearby, leading to loss of
agricultural land and development of malaria. The villagers needed about
$12,000 to raise the water source at the well, tap 100 I/s of water and carry it by
gravity to irrigate about 100 ha of their land. However, they could not raise the
funds necessary for such a project. The IDP will rehabilitate this artesian well
(and 64 other artesian wells) and tap its water more efficiently.
Photo 11.    Work in progress: The cleaning of a main collector. The equipment used is not
well adapted to cleaning operations: it lacks precision, destabilizes the slopes of
the collector, and widens the bottom of the collector unnecessarily.
Photo 12.    This main collector has been cleaned recently, as evidenced by the lowered level
of water and the still floating cleanup debris.
Photo 13.    Cleanup is always done on the same side of the collector, except for one wide
collector (20 m) that requires cleaning from both sides. Likewise, extracted
materials are disposed of on the same side of the collector. Strong winds and
rainfall carry some of those deposited materials back into the collector.
Photo 14.    Closed drainage system (720 ha) in Artashat. The ECODIT team could not get
close to the manholes (shown in photo) due to water logging of the soil. This
water logging is leading to secondary soil salinization. The IDP will replace the
drains and secondary collectors of this closed drainage system, thus improving
drainage and halting the secondary salinization of the soil.
Photo 15.    This pump is not working and will be taken out of service by the IDP. The pump
used to serve two purposes: pump drainage water (1) from the closed system
drain into the collector and (2) from the collector into the agricultural lands for
irrigation. Once the main collector is deepened, the drainage water will be able
to flow by gravity from the closed system drain into the collector. The IDP will
rehabilitate only select pumping stations to be used for irrigation.
Photo 16.    Trout farms like this one depend on fresh artesian well water. The IDP will have
no impact on the deep underground aquifer and thus will not affect trout farms.

Photo 17.    This large fish farm, in the southern part of the Ararat Valley, uses the artificial
lakes built in the fifties on salinized soils that were deemed too salinized to
rehabilitate. The IDP is not expected to have any significant or lasting impact on
those commercial farms. Ararat Mountain chain in the background.

IIl. Dam Safety Improvement
Photo 21.    The Aparan reservoir, seen from the dam. Outlet tower under rehabilitation
under a separate project. Notice the low level in the reservoir: rainfall has been
very limited this year and this picture is dated August 20, toward the end of the
irrigation season.
Photo 22.    Aparan dam upstream slope. The Dam Safety Project would replace partially the
old reinforced concrete slabs with new ones.
Photo 23.    Concrete slabs removed as part of the ongoing rehabilitation of the water outlet
at the Aparan dam. The Contractor is reusing those slabs at another of its
construction sites in the region.
Photo 24.   Inlet of emergency spillway at the Aparan dam.  The IDP project would
rehabilitate this spillway (add layer of concrete, etc.) and build another parallel
emergency spillway.
Photo 25.    Outlet of emergency spillway at the Aparan dam. Special design precautions are
necessary to reduce the energy of water discharged through this type of spillway
and minimize erosion impacts downstream.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
F.1   SCOPING SESSION
At the beginning of the EA, a scoping session was held at the Armenia II Hotel on
November 22, 1999. Over 50 representatives of the public sector, government, regional (marz)
and village administrations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media, and
international organizations participated in the scoping session. In addition, three TV stations
(Haylur program, Armenia TV Station, and A1+ TV Station) and two newspapers (Republica
Armenia and Mshakuht) and the "Agropress" information agency followed the scoping session
and reported on it extensively. A separate report has documented the proceedings of the
Scoping Session (PIU/ECODIT, 1999). The key findings are summarized below.
* All participants stressed the importance of the proposed IDP and welcomed
the EA and the opportunity to participate in the scoping session;
*  Several participants from  villages and regions (marz) attested to the
significant positive benefits of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, the
precursor to the proposed IDP, and urged the PIU to continue in the same
direction;
- According to the Head of the Department of Environmental Expertise of the
Ministry of Nature Protection, the Terms of Reference for the EA meet the
requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) law of the
Republic of Armenia. The EA, if conducted as presented, should pass the
environmental expertise examination with high marks;
i  Several participants mentioned the following positive impacts of the proposed
IDP: preventing the secondary salinization of soils, improving land fertility,
saving energy by eliminating the need for pumping, reducing the incidence of
malaria, etc.;
*  Drawing on the preliminary results of the social assessment of the project.
some participants highlighted the importance of the human factor in shaping
the environmental impacts of the project.  They called for raising the
environmental awareness of farmers as an integral part of the project. One
participant suggested holding public hearings in the field to explain the
objectives and contents of the proposed IDP;
*  One participant stressed the need to consider economic feasibility and
ensure cost recovery in designing the proposed IDP and mitigation
measures.  He called for an integrated approach to water resources
management, keeping in mind the various sources and uses (drinking,
irrigation, hydropower, fishing) of water in Armenia;
*  Participants expressed the need for more coordination among different
projects, such as agricultural and biodiversity projects;
*  One participant suggested that the dam safety improvement project would not
be complete without strengthening Armenian capabilities to respond quickly
to dam safety emergencies (e.g., dam rupture);

.  All participants applauded the high level and quality of the professionals
engaged to conduct the EA. The effective participation of the local experts on
the ECODIT Team will help to ensure effective implementation of the
mitigation and monitoring measures to be recommended by the EA. After the
EA, local members of the EA Team should continue to be involved in project
implementation and evaluation; and
*  Several participants stressed the need to build on the lessons learned from
years of experience with soil and water monitoring in the Ararat Valley; they
also called for putting in place adequate monitoring of the plant-soil-water
system during and after project implementation.
F.2   PARTICIPATORY WORKSHOP
A workshop to present and discuss the findings of the draft EA report was held at the
Tekeyan Center on December 2, 1999. Mr. H. Kloyan, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, opened
the workshop with a welcome speech, followed by Mr. A. Kazarian, PIU Executive Director, who
presented the scope and objectives of the upcoming IDP.
Mr. J. Karam, EA coordinator, then presented the preliminary findings and
recommendations of the EA. Using photos taken by the EA Team, he described the main
positive and negative potential impacts of the proposed IDP and the EA Team's recommended
mitigation measures. After the lunch break, Mr. Karam described the proposed Environmental
Management Plan.
Mr. luri Javadyan concluded the workshop by thanking all the participants for the
presentations and discussions. He invited the participants to become more familiar with the EA
preliminary findings and submit written comments to the PIU. He also urged the EA Team to
respond to the oral and written comments and to focus the EA report on the significant impacts
of the proposed project.
F.2.1 Questions and answers before the break
Question by R.Andreasyan, "Irrigation" SCJSC: The water from the Hoktemberien canal
does not have a high salinity level. Also, water from gushing artesian wells cannot lead to water
logging.
Answer: You are correct on both accounts. The Araks river water has a low level of
salinity. In contrast, certain other sources of irrigation water have relatively high salinity levels,
such as the Hrazdan channels. Also, water from leaking artesian wells can lead to localized
flooding of low-lying areas; water logging occurs when the water table is close to the surface.
Sorry if the translation was perhaps misleading.
Question by R.Andreasyan, "Irrigation" SCJSC: The reconstruction of the Hoktemberien
main canal, including the headworks, could have potentially significant environmental impacts,
which did not come out of the presentation.
Answer: The reconstruction of the Hoktemberien canal, including the headworks, is not
the same as building a new water intake and weir (small dam). Therefore, the EA Team
expects the environmental impacts of the reconstruction to remain relatively small compared to
the impacts of building a new weir, water intake, and canal.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agnculture, IRP/PIU
Question by Mr. Karen Grigoryan, PIU: Has ECODIT considered other than mechanical
methods to extract sediments from canals?
Answer: The key idea is that current sediment extraction methods use standard dredging
equipment and may not be the most suitable for canal dredging and maintenance. Current
extraction methods are leading to the widening of the canal base and to the collapse of the
canal slopes. The EA Team has proposed the use of a specialized mechanical shovel to
ensure a more precise extraction of sediments and soils along a well-defined axis. This would
help to keep the canal bottom narrow and the canal sides at a 45-degree slope. When the
canal sides are stabilized at a 45-degree slope, then a specialized tractor-mounted machine can
be used to cut the grass along those slopes and maintain their stability (i.e., prevent them from
collapsing).
Question: In which countries are the proposed canal maintenance measures used?
Answer:  The canal maintenance measures that we have proposed are best
management practices in countries such as France and the United States of America.
Question by Mr. Volodya Narimanian: How and when will water use permit applications
be submitted as part of implementing the EA recommendations?
Answer by Ms. 1. Gabayan: Permit applications will be submitted in due course in
accordance with the law.
Question by Mr. Boris Ghazaryan: Have you considered the "zero" option for the
drainage network rehabilitation?
Answer by V. Tadevosyan, Director of the Drainage Enterprise: The "zero" option has
existed since the early 90's and has led to the current sad and difficult situation in the Ararat
Valley: water-logging of tens of villages, secondary soil salinization, and decreased agricultural
productivity.
Question: How would the rehabilitation of the drainage system comply with the Ramsar
Convention?
Answer by Ms. S. Mouradyan: There are no sites listed on the Ramsar Convention in the
Ararat valley.
Question: How could the Hoktemberian canal discharge increase from 25 m3/s to 53
m3/s?
Answer: The capacity of the water intake will increase thanks to the construction of three
additional gates.
F.2.2 Questions and answers after the break
Question: The functions of the design institutes and the PIU are separated in the report
but are presented jointly in the transparency. Please explain this variation.
Answer by Ms. 1. Gabayan and Mr. J. Karam: The design institutes will be responsible
for incorporating specific environmental features into project design (e.g., fish ladders on weirs),
at the PlU's request. ECODIT presented those functions together to simplify the presentation

and in recognition of the link between the functions of the PIU and of the design institutes. The
report spells out clearly the specific functions of each institution.
Question by Ms. Nune Bakunts, Ministry of Health: Who should execute the land and
water monitoring, and using what standards and indicators?
Answer: Various monitoring organizations have responsibility for monitoring and should
continue to assume that responsibility under the project. For example, the Drainage Enterprise
and the Soil Science Institute for soil and water quality monitoring in the Ararat Valley.
Question by Ms. Nune Bakunts, the Ministry of Health: What about monitoring and
controlling the microbiological contamination of water?
Answer: Notwithstanding the importance of this issue, it is important to remember that
any microbiological contamination of the water existed before the proposed IDP project and
would not be affected by it. Since the IDP would not affect the microbiological contamination of
water, analyzing this impact is beyond the scope of this EA.
Question: Only 350 out of the former 1,000 boreholes are in good condition. Monitoring
would not be possible without rehabilitating the network of monitoring boreholes. Will the
project fund such rehabilitation?
Answer: The project will set aside a special budget to implement the final Environmental
Management Plan, including monitoring requirements.
Question by Ms. Nune Bakunts: As a representative of the Ministry of Health, I am
surprised that the proposed monitoring program does not include provisions for health
monitoring. Also, given the health dimension of the project, in particular in the Ararat Valley,
shouldn't the Ministry of Health be represented on the project's Environmental Committee?
Answer: You are right: monitoring of health conditions in the Ararat Valley is a key
measure of performance of the proposed IDP. Fortunately, the Ministry of Health already
monitors the health situation in the Ararat Valley (e.g., number of cases of malaria). The EA
team has assumed that the Ministry of Health would continue to do this monitoring and would
share its findings with the PIU to help it evaluate the extent to which the rehabilitation of the
Ararat drainage system is contributing to reducing the incidence of malaria, This exchange
could be done within or outside the proposed Environmental Committee.
Question: Is the current legal framework in Armenia sufficient to ensure proper project
implementation?
Answer: Yes, and the legal and institutional framework is described in the EA report.
Question by Mr. Artem Sargsyan: What is the status of water monitoring stations in
Armenia? Do you envision a role for NGOs in monitoring?
Answer by Mr. Vilik Sargsyan: Currently 98 water monitoring stations are operating in
Armenia.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
Question by Mr. Artem Sargsyan: Do you envision a role for NGOs in monitoring?
Answer: NGOs have an important role to play in all aspects of environmental
management, especially at the local level. In the United States, volunteers from NGOs and
community groups participate in monitoring rivers and streams. Experience shows that NGOs
can make a big difference if they are motivated and professional.
Question by Mr. V. Narimanyan (not Volodya Narimanyan from MoNP? please
double check): What are the damages caused by irrigation in steep mountain areas? Why not
mitigate those impacts by using drip irrigation as in done in other countries, for example in Saudi
Arabia?
Answer: Again, it is important to separate existing impacts from the potential impacts of
the proposed IDP. Also, drip irrigation may or may not work in mountain areas that are subject
to sub-freezing temperatures.
Question by Mr. Chagharyan: What are the amounts and terms of the upcoming World
Bank loan for this project?
Answer by Mr. A. Kazarian, PIU executive director: The term of the loan is for 35 years,
with a grace period of 10 years (i.e., without paying interest or principal). The amount of the
loan will be about US$ 80 million. The EA is funded by grant money.

ADDITIONAL DATA AND COMMENTS
This appendix provides the following additional data and comments:
1. Irrigation water charges in Armenia;
2. Sanitary flow calculations for the Potomac river;
3. Environmental action planning in Armenia;
4. Rehabilitation of the drainage system in the Ararat Valley;
5. The draining of Lake Gilli and current restoration plans;
6. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices; and
7. Emergency preparedness for catastrophic dam failure.
G.1 IRRIGATION WATER CHARGES IN ARMENIA'
At the beginning of each irrigation season, the WUCC signs an agreement with the OME
for the purchase of irrigation water. The price of water is calculated by the OME and must be
approved by the Government of Armenia by decree. Irrigation water charges paid by the
WUCCs to the OMEs were set at 2.1, 2.2 or 2.4 D/m3 for 1999, depending on the region.
Charges were previously set uniformly at 1.9 D/m3 for 1998. The 1999 water charges allow the
OME to recover about one-third of the full costs of irrigation water supplied to the tertiary
irrigation network (capital plus O&M), estimated at an average of 6.3 D/m3. The goal of the
Government of Armenia is to reach full cost recovery by the year 2005.
In turn, WUCCs sell irrigation water to the farmers. The price paid by the farmer is equal
to the sum of two shares:
1. The water charge paid by the WUCC to the OME: in 1999. 2.1, 2.2 or 2.4
D/m3, depending on the region (as explained above); and
2. The WUCC water charge, or the amount that the WUCC needs to charge to
recover its own costs of operating and maintaining the tertiary irrigation
system (salaries of WUCC staff such as accountants and water master, O&M
charges, repairs costs, etc.). A Government decree set the WUCC water
charge at 1.5 D/ m3.
As of 1999, each farmer must pay his dues in cash at the local Post Office. The local
Post Office is then responsible for transferring the payments received to the bank accounts of
the OME and the WUCC, according to their respective shares. The OME then pays the DME
0.24 D/m3 for the water purchased from reservoirs.
In addition to the charges mentioned above, a water resource charge of 0.2 D/m3 is paid
to the state budget for water withdrawn from Lake Sevan. In the Ararat Valley, many drainage
collectors have been transformed into irrigation canals. Farmers currently do not pay water
charges for irrigating with drainage water.

G.2 SANITARY FLOW CALCULATIONS FOR THE POTOMAC RIVER2
Cognizant of the need to preserve and balance the various resources and uses of the
Potomac river, the State of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources spearheaded in 1981
an assessment of the sanitary flow requirements for the Potomac river. The "Potomac River
Environmental Flow-by Study" assessed the effects of low flow on the environment (e.g.,
wildlife, water quality, fisheries), recommended a minimum daily environmental flow, and
suggested actions to maintain the recommended minimum  flow.  Various stakeholders
participated in the study, including concerned U.S. (federal) and state environmental agencies.
local authorities, and water and sanitation utilities.
The study examined the various Potomac river resources and uses (fisheries,
macroinvertebrates, wildlife, recreation, and drinking water) and assessed the potential impacts
on them of low river flows. The study considered the following factors:
*  Practical water management realities (historical flow frequency, water supply
demand, water use restrictions);
*  Downstream areas of potential impact and areas of significant concern;
*  Species of most concern, especially during their juvenile life stage (e.g.,
small-mouth bass); and
*  Low flows and duration necessary for a significant decline in some species
population (including juvenile population), and recovery time before normal
conditions resume.
The study found that historical low river flows had negligible or short-term impacts on
non-fishery resources and uses (e.g., boating and wildlife). In contrast, fishery resources,
especially the juvenile smallmouth bass population, would be the most affected by low river
flow. Taking into account practical water management considerations (water supply needs and
natural flow frequencies), the study recommended a minimum daily environmental flow of 100
million gallons per day (mgd) (equivalent to 4.38 m3/s) below Little Falls dam to protect the
integrity of the fishery, and a minimum flow of 300 mgd from Little Falls dam upstream to Great
Falls. The study found that the minimum flow should be set as a "daily average" rather than a
"weekly average" to protect the integrity of the fishery.
The study developed tailored mechanisms for allocating water between the Potomac
river and the local water utilities, including special precautions in drought years. Specifically, the
Washington Aqueduct normally withdraws 200 mgd from Potomac river, usually at the Great
Falls intake. When the river flow is only 500 mgd just above the Great Falls intake, the study
recommended reducing the amounts of water withdrawn by the water utility to ensure that the
sanitary flows of 300 mgd (upstream) and 100 mgd (downstream) are met.
The sanitary flows of 100 mgd and 300 mgd have been in place since 1981. During the
summer of 1999, the region went through a serious drought and the Potomac river was at its
lowest levels in many years. If the drought had continued, the Washington Aqueduct would
have had to reduce its water intake from Great Falls in order to meet the 100 mgd sanitary flow

limit. Also, several environmental NGOs (e.g., Nature Conservancy) argued that the limit was
set too low to protect the ecosystem of the river and called for raising it.
G.3   ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLANNING IN ARMENIA
The Government of Armenia, with financial assistance from the World Bank's
Institutional Development Fund, has prepared two complementary environmental action
programs: the National Environmental Action Program (NEAP) and the Lake Sevan Action
Program  (LSAP).  Efforts are also underway to prepare an Integrated Water Resources
Management Plan (IWRMP).
G.3.1 National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)
The NEAP identifies environmental priorities and outlines various measures for
strengthening environmental policy, institutional development, and legal reforms across all
sectors. In order to prepare the NEAP, the MoNP established eight working groups (WGs) and
coordinated their efforts:
WG 1 Environmental Policy, Regulatory and Institutional Issues
WG 2 Environmental Health
WG 3 Air Quality and Atmospheric Protection
WG 4 Water Quality and Water Resources Management
WG 5 Municipal and Industrial Waste Management
WG 6 Land Resources, Land Use and Protection Management
WG 7 Forestry
WG 8 Biodiversity.
The eight working groups produced eight separate reports detailing their findings. The World
Bank summarized the findings and recommendations of the eight working groups and outlined
the key actions in "Main Report of the National Environmental Action Program" (NEAP, Main
Report, 1999)
G.3.2 Lake Sevan Action Program
Initiated in 1996 and completed in 1999, the Environmental Action Program for Lake
Sevan outlines the major issues and prioritizes the necessary actions to restore the ecological
conditions of Lake Sevan according to economic, social, and environmental criteria. The
Program identified the following three main priority concerns (LSAP, Main Report, 1999):
*  Loss of strategic reserve of water for irrigation and hydropower production
caused by the lowered water level;
*  Threatened ecosystem stability caused by the reduced water level and the
deterioration of water quality; and
*  Reduced amenity and cultural value.
A World Bank mission in 1998 had concluded that too much reliance has been placed on the
diversion of other water resources as the means for rehabilitating Lake Sevan's ecological
condition. The mission found that raising of Lake Sevan's water level by six meters would take
at least 90 years if it relied on the Vorotan River Diversion project. Instead, the mission
recommended developing a sustainable water management plan and strengthening institutional
and legislative measures.

G.3.3 Integrated Water Resources Management Plan
The Government of Armenia has started preparing an Integrated Water Resources
Management Plan (IWRMP) to address the key challenges in the water sector and support the
economic restructuring strategy. The IWRMP should develop an integrated policy framework
with specific guidelines to ensure the optimal and sustainable allocation of water resources
across all relevant sectors, taking into account physical, economic, financial, environmental, and
social considerations (NEAP, Main Report, 1999).
The MoNP estimates that it will take two years to complete the IWRMP, which is
expected to include the following activities (see NEAP, WG4, 1998 and NEAP, Main report,
1999):
*  Develop a legislative and policy framework that supports sustainable water
resources management;
*  Enhance institutional capacity for implementation and enforcement of
environmental regulations in the water sector;
*  Establish priorities for short-, medium-, and long-term  rehabilitation and
investment of major water-related infrastructure;
*  Protect Lake Sevan and its freshwater reserves;
*  Develop a comprehensive water balance modeling tool;
*  Improve and strengthen international agreements-on sharing transboundary
water; and
-  Improve the efficiency and reliability of water services and cost recovery.

G.4.2 Improving health and sanitary conditions
Rehabilitating the Ararat Valley drainage system will reduce the breeding grounds for
vectors, but will not eliminate them completely. Without careful attention and control, water-
borne diseases and poor sanitary conditions could come back quickly after the end of the
rehabilitation project.
In the past two years, pesticides have been sprayed to get rid of mosquitoes and limit
the spread of malaria in the Ararat Valley. Using chemical insecticides might be effective to
reduce the vectors' population, but it could lead to other negative impacts on the environment
(e.g., pollute drinking and irrigation water, contaminate fish and aquatic life, and bioaccumulate
and threaten predators and raptors).
Recommendation. Controlling the growth of disease carriers requires constant effort
and effective surveillance of irrigation conditions, especially:
*  Control and monitoring of water distribution;
* Proper building and annual maintenance of canals;
*  Efficient drainage of excess water; and
*  Good irrigation efficiency.
Insecticides, if needed, should be used only locally, in small quantities, and with proper control
and handling.
G.5 THE DRAINING OF LAKE GILLI AND CURRENT RESTORATION PLANS
The Lake Gilli area is located in the southeastern corner of the Sevan basin, at the
mouth of the Masrik River. With a water surface area of about 860 hectares, the lake was a
complex wetland ecosystem and a habitat for migratory waterfowl and aquatic species. Gilli
acted as a cleaning reservoir for the waters of the Masrik River and other streams (settling of
sediments. biological treatment) before they entered Lake Sevan. Reeds provided an important
nesting place for several different bird species. Because Gilli is located on the international
flyway of many migratory waterfowl species, many species stopped there for weeks at a time to
feed during their migration.
In 1960, the government decided to drain Lake Gilli by diverting the direction of the
Masrik River away from Lake Gilli. According to the Ministry of Nature Protection, the entire
Sevan basin currently has fewer bird species than were present in the Gilli area alone in 1939.
Previously, 159 bird species existed in the Lake Sevan basin. Since the draining of Lake Gilli,
33 bird species have been registered in the Armenian Red Book of endangered species. The
draining of Gilli has also had a negative effect on Sevan's fish population because Lake Gilli
was used for spawning. Today, the Gilli area consists of open peat mines and croplands.
The idea of restoring Lake Gilli has been on the table since 1978 but without any
implementation. However, the UNDP-funded "Lake Sevan Ecological Balance Restoration"
Project will finance a project to restore the former Lake Gilli in order to preserve the biodiversity
of the Sevan basin. Also, the MoNP has submitted a biodiversity strategy activity to the
Secretariat of the "Convention on Biodiversity" and has reached an initial agreement concerning
the Lake Gilli Restoration project.

G.6 PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
Although unsustainable agricultural practices are not a direct impact of the proposed
IDP, their continuation may dilute the positive impacts of the project in the long term. This
section describes the long-term impacts of unsustainable agricultural practices and suggests
appropriate mitigation measures. It would be desirable for the country to undertake such
measures in the overall context of agricultural development.
G.6.1 Water conservation and reuse
Consistent with standard practice in agricultural development projects, the proposed
conversion schemes are designed based on the 75th percentile flows. This means that, on
average once very four years, sufficient water may not be available to meet the competing
demands of population, irrigation, and sanitary flow. As explained in Chapter 5, this water
stress situation is especially true for Conversion Schemes 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14. Because farmers
do not appear familiar with or practice techniques of water conservation and reuse, drought
years would result in sharp decline in agricultural output and economic loss to farmers in water-
stressed regions.
Recommendation. The Ministry of Agriculture will need to incorporate the proposed IDP
as it updates its contingency plans for drought years. During drought years, water may not be
available to meet the irrigation requirements of several conversion schemes. As it moves from
rehabilitation to development of the irrigation sector in Armenia, the Ministry of Agriculture may
want to start promoting irrigation water conservation and reuse techniques. The MoA could
begin by implementing pilot water conservation (drip irrigation, aspersion) and reuse (treated
wastewater) activities in areas exhibiting a sharp deficit in irrigation water relative to arable
lands, such as the Yeghegnadzor region (and the southern part of the Ararat valley).
Successful pilot activities will convince farmers to adopt such techniques to increase crop yields
and reduce dependence on irrigation.  Farmers adopting water conservation and reuse
techniques would be able to weather the impacts of drought by being less dependent on scarce
irrigation water,
G.6.2 Agricultural soil management
Several of the proposed conversion schemes would bring back irrigation water to
agricultural land that have not been irrigated for the past 10 years.  For example, the
Yeghegnadzor conversion scheme would return to irrigated agriculture about 2.874 ha of lands
after a 1 0-year interruption in irrigation. While abandonment of those lands has slowly
degraded the quality of their topsoil, their return to irrigated agriculture offers opportunities to
reverse the soil degradation and gradually improve soil quality through sound soil management
practices.
Recommendation. To maintain and improve soil conditions, the PIU could encourage
farmers to use environmentally-friendly and sustainable agricultural practices, including soil
tilling, cropping and crop rotations, rational use of agrochemicals, and organic soil amendments,
water conservation, etc.

EA of Irrigation Development Project                      Ministry of Agriculture, IRP/PIU
G.6.3 Rational use of agrochemicals
Use of pesticides and fertilizers remains quite limited in Armenia because such
agrochemicals are imported (primarily from Georgia) and expensive, and most farmers cannot
afford them. Some farmers are gradually reverting to again use manure as organic fertilizer,
after a period during which manure was used instead as a source of energy.
The conversion schemes will provide irrigation water to lands that used to be irrigated
during the Soviet times but are no longer irrigated/cultivated due to various reasons (energy
more expensive and not readily available, pumps not maintained properly, etc.). Although
agrochemicals are not widely used currently, farmers probably would use pesticides and
fertilizers to increase crop yield in the "newly" irrigated lands in the future (i.e., when farmers'
income and population increase). Excessive use of agrochemicals wouldc.pollute soils, rivers,
streams, and lakes and could limit the opportunities for Armenian agriculture to sell increasingly
demanded free-of-pesticides and organically-grown produce in the international market.
Recommendation. As the PIU moves from rehabilitation to development of irrigation in
Armenia, the Ministry of Agriculture may want to start increasing the scope of its extension
services to educate farmers about the proper use of pesticides and fertilizers and gradually
introduce Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques. Also, the MoA needs to tighten its
control over the import and use of agrochemicals.
G.7 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FOR CATASTROPHIC DAM FAILURE
The Dam Safety Project is designed to significantly reduce the risks of dam failure but
cannot eliminate them totally. Despite those safety improvement works, accidental releases of
large volumes of water could occur, albeit with much reduced probability of occurrence. The
resulting flood surge could lead to significant loss of human lives and property if downstream
populations are not warned and evacuated in a timely fashion, Box G-1 summarizes the
emergency preparedness situation in Armenia.
Box G-1
Emergency Preparedness in Armenia a,
The Emergency Situation Department of the Government of Armenia is
responsible for emergency planning, including radio communication, sirens, and 1
evacuation. During the Soviet period, the military was responsible for emergency i
I planning and there were emergency plans for the 10 largest reservoirs in
Armenia. Presently, new emergency plans are being reviewed and developed.
but they have not been implemented yet.
In 1998, irrigation outlets experienced structural problems that created
potentially serious emergency situations at the Aygedzor dam reservoir (problem
with tunnel) and the Sovietashen dam reservoir (problem with canal). While the
population near Aygedzor was evacuated, cement reinforcement works were
conducted that prevented accidents at both reservoirs. This type of serious
technical problem exists also at the Tavshud and Hakhoum dam reservoirs.

Recommendation. The EA Team recommends that the GoA strengthen emergency
warning systems and preparedness/response plans. These systems and plans must build on
the experiences and lessons-learned from previous dam failures and response (or lack thereof)
in Armenia. The plans must be in writing and result from a consultative process involving all
stakeholders; they must be updated and tested on a regular basis and satisfy the following other
criteria:
*  Conduct probabilistic risk analysis and hazard analysis: what can go wrong? how
likely are releases of different magnitudes? which populations would be affected?
etc.:
*  Install early warning systems (e.g., systems to detect/monitor the structural integrity
of the dams) and maintain them;
*  Increase public awareness and participation and conduct--regular emergency
response exercises; and
*  Mobilize key responders and identify evacuation routes/procedures.
Because the risks of catastrophic dam failure existed before the project and cannot be attributed
to it (in fact, the project will reduce them), the above recommendation is not as a required
mitigation measure under this EA.
