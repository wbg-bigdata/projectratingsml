AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project for which a
Bank loan of US$3.7 million equivalent is proposed. This would be the
first agricultural project the Bank has helped finance in Jamaica. It
would support a three-year lending program for the planting of coconuts and
of citrus, for increasing beef production and for expanding dairy farms.
The Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) would be the borrower and would be
responsible for Project administration.
ii.       JDB is a new multipurpose institution, which became operational
in September 1969 as a successor to the Development Finance Corporation
(D)FC). Large-scale commercial farmers have suffered from a lack of medium-
and long-term development credit. The commercial banks are concerned
mainly with short-term financing and the Agricultural Credit Board (ACB),
a quasi-autonomous organization within the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries, has concentrated on lending to small farmers. The Government,
realizing the need for development credit for larger farmers, has made
this one of JDB's main responsibilities. JDB would establish an Agri-
cultural Credit Section for this purpose. The new section would require
the assistance of internationally recruited experts in the initial stages
and provision for technical assistance has, therefore, been included in
the proposed loan.
iii.      Due to the rapid development of bauxite mining, industry and tour-
ism, the importance of agriculture in Jamaica's economy has been steadily
declining. Agriculture's contribution to GDP was 9% in 1969 compared to
31% in 1950. Agricultural production value declined in 1969 and agri-
cultural products represented only 28% of total domestic exports compared
with 44% in 1963. On the other hand, the value of food imports has increased
to US$72 million in 1969 compared with US$49 million in 1965. The gap in
Jamaica's current account balance of payments widened sharply in 1969 and
the gap was financed largely by private capital inflow. However, an
increase in agricultural exports and import substitution crops is of
increasing importance to the economy.
iv.       The Project has been designed to increase production of citrus
for export and coconuts, beef and dairy products for import substitution,
mainly by investment in land preparation, establishment of new pastures,
fencing and farm and dairy machinery. The estimated net foreign exchange
earnings/savings attributable to the Project at full development would
amount to JS 2.5 million (US$3.0 million) annually of which J$ 0.8 million
(Us$1.0 million) would represent increased exports and J$ 1.7 million (US$2.0
million) savings on imports.



- ii -
v.        Total Project costs would amount to US$8.0 million equivalent.
Sub-borrowers would contribute 20% and JDB would contribute 34%. The
proposed loan, equivalent to about 46% of total Project costs, would cover
the estimated foreign exchange component. Sub-borrowers would be charged
8-3/4% per annum interest. The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk and would receive a fee from JDB.
vi.       The range of items to be financed under the Project is very varied
and not suitable for bulk procurement. A number of foreign firms are
represented, assuring keen competition. Supplies are adequate on the local
market and prices competitive. Tariffs on goods to be used within the
Project do not exceed 6%. Therefore, procurement would be through normal
commercial channels.
vii.      The financial rates of return are estimated to range from 16 to
22%. The overall economic rate of return is estimated at about 17%. Appro-
priate assurances have been obtained and accordingly the Project is suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$3.7 million equivalent for a term of 16 years
including a grace period of five years.



JAMTAICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.(1      An FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission to Jamaica in June 1969
idlentified two agricultural credit projects--one for small farmers, and
the other for large farmers. The Government is negotiating with the
Inter-American Developmenit Bank (IDB) for funds to finance the Small
Farmers' Project. Final preparation of the lending program for the Large
Farmers' Project was completed by an FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission
which visited Jamaica in January 1970. This would be the first agricultural
loan by the Bank Group to Jamaica and would support a three-year lending
program to large farmers for the development of new citrus orchards, the
planting of coconuts, and the expansion of beef and milk production.
1.02      The Bank loan would be made to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB),
a multipurpose development institution constituted in March 1969. JDB is
the successor to the Jamaica Development Finance Corporation (DFC) which
lent with mixed success for industry, tourism and housing. Neither JDB
nor its predecessor has had experience in agricultural lending. A Bank
pre-appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. M.J. Walden, D.B. Argyle and
K.E. Nougaim visited Jamaica in January 1970 and concluded that JDB,
suitably strengthened, could be a direct borrower of a Bank loan for an
agricultural credit project.
1.93      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
J3muaica in June 1970 consisting of Messrs. W. H. Spall and K. W. Berg (Bank),
R. Hiewson (FAO) and C. Bell (Consultant).
II.  BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Jamaica, a tropical island with an area of some 4,400 sq Di
(2.8 million ac), lies in the Western Caribbean Sea. It is about 150
mi long with a maximum width of about 50 mi.  Population at the end of
1969 was about 2 million.
2.o2       Inland hills of limestone and shiale rise to some 7,400 ft in the
Blue 14ountains (east of the island, see Map).  Average rainfall varies
frorm 140 in, well distributed in the northeast, to less than 50 in of
seasonal rain in the south. Commercial farming is concentrated on fertile,
flat alluvial soils on the coastal plains, while subsistence farming prevails
iTn the hillv inland terrain. The island is prone to hurricanes, which caused
considerable damage in 1944 and 1951 (Annex 1).



- 2 -
2.03      Bauxite mining, industry and tourism have developed rapidly, while
agriculture's rate of growth has lagged significantly below the average of
other sectors and it has in fact stagnated in recent years (1966/69); con-
sequently, the relative contribution of agriculture to the island's
economy has declined.  In 1969 it was 9.0% of GDP compared to 10.3,  in 1968,
11.6% in 1965 and 31.0% in 1950. But despite its declining share of CI)P,
agriculture is highly important to Jamaica. It is still the largest source
of employment, engaging about 40% of the labor force.
2.04      Agricultural exports (1969, US$70 million) represent 28% of total
exports and are second in importance after aluminia and bauxite (56%o to-
gether), but their percentage has steadily declined (36% in 1966 and 44%
in 1963). The most important agricultural export products in 1969 were
sugar (US$34 million), bananas (US$15 millioni), citrus (US$8 million) and
pimento (US$5 million).  Food imports in 1969 rose to US$72 million compared
to US$49 million in 1965. Imports of sugar, fish and meat products showed
the largest increases and meat imports in particular rose to 13,200 ton
(US$11 million) in 1969 compared to 11,500 ton in 1968 after having doubled
between 1962 and 1967 (Annex 1).
2.05      Jamaica has been financing development programs in rural areas
which have had a substantial welfare component. These have helped alleviate
income disparities but agricultural production, particularly export and im-
port substitution crops, could be increased rapidly by orienting agricul-
tural development policies more towards encouraging commerical farming.
The Government recognizes this and is now pursuing a policy under which it
continues to provide assistance to the economically less strong as well as
to provide assistance for the commercial part of the rural sector. Increased
agricultural exports and import substitution are vital if the balance of
payments position (estimated at an overall deficit of about US$14 million
in 1969 compared to a surplus of US$34 million in 1968) is to be improved;
this Project is a first step in this direction.
2.06      Jamaican agriculture was founded on sugarcane, which is still
dominant, although other crops (bananas, coconuts, citrus, cacao, coffee
and pimento) have become important. In recent years the sugar industry
has suffered major setbacks caused by drought, agricultural labor shortage
and processing and transport problems resultine in low reinvestments and
declining production which dropped steadily from 560,000 ton of sugar (1965)
to 360,000 ton (1969); a large amount of processing machinery has become
obsolete. Banana production has also declined, in addition to adverse
weather this was caused by internal and external marketing problems; banana
exports declined from 200,000 ton (1966) to 150,000 ton (1969). About 17,000
ton (1969) of copra is produced from 95,00J0 ac of coconut plantations.
Production has recovered steadily after a damaging hurricane in 1944 and a
less severe one in 1951, but the industry is now suffering from the devasta-
ting lethal yellowing disease. Fortunately, a new coconut variety (Malayan
Dwarf) has been found which is highly resistant to the disease and less
sensitive to hurricane damage than old plantations (Jamaica Tall) and re-
planting is taking place, (about 10,000 ac have already been replanted)
which would be assisted by the proposed Project (Annex 2). Citrus production
has remained at about the same average in recent years despite yearly



- 3 -
variations due to adverse weather and Jamaica produces about 3 million
boxes of citrus 1/ of which about 1.3 million boxes are processed into juices
and segments. Most of the rest is consumed locally as fresh fruit, par-
ticularly by the tourist industry, although small amounts are exported
(Annex 3). Another export, pimento, has risen in importance amounting in
1969 to US$5 million export value.
2.07      Out of total land area of 2.8 million ac about 550,000 ac are
cultivated. Sugarcane occupies the largest area (180,000 ac) followed
by coconuts (95,000 ac) and bananas (80,000 ac). Other important crops are
cacao (43,000 ac), pimento (29,000 ac), citrus (27,000 ac) and coffee
(22,000 ac). In addition to cultivated land, there are about 500,000
ac of pasture and 400,000 ac of scrub or "ruinate" which provide occasional,
seasonal grazing (Annexes 4 and 5).
2.08      About 185,000 farms occupy in total 1.5 million ac all of which
is not used agriculturally. Of these, some 181,000 farms (97% of the total)
of less than 25 ac each occupy only 37% of farmland. Farmers of from 25-100
aC (3,0o() farms) occupy 8% of the land and the remainder, 55% or 0.8 million
ac, are held by 1,000 farms with over 100 ac each. The largest landholders
are 18 sugar estates, owning together about 200,000 ac, and four bauxite
mining companies, also owning together about 200,000 ac.  About half of the
land owned by these two groups is cultivated.
2.09      Most of the land is freehold and small farmers are encouraged by
the Government to acquire legal title to the land they cultivate.  The
Ministry of Rural Land Development (MRLD) assists these farmers through its
Regional Land Authorities and Land Development and Utilization Commission.
2.10      MRLD's extension services assist small farmers only.  The technical
officers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) would be
available to assist the large farmers involved in the Project. In addition,
the Citrus Growers Association (CGA)(a farmers' association) and the Coconut
Industry Board (CIB) (a statutory body) have their own extension and research
organizations and these services would be freely available to the Jamaica
I)evelopment Bank (JDB) and Project farmers.  The extension and research
services are considered adequate for the farms involved in the Project.
B. Agricultural Credit
2.11      During 1969, the banking and finance sector maintained the high
level of activity and rapid expansion which began during the last
quarter of 1967. While the 1968 financial situation was characterized by
excessive liquidity, 1969 was marked by a resurgence of demand for loans and
a rapid expansion in bank credit, and by mid-1970 Jamaica was suffering from
a liquidity shortage.  Total commercial bank lending rose from J$ 174 million
(US$209 million) at the end of 1968 to J$ 244 million (US$293 million) in
1969, an increase of 41%.

2.12      Lending to agriculture cannot be determined precisely since loans
are categorized according to borrowers' stated occupation rather than to
end-use. Thus lending to sugar estates, which is one and a half times greater
than to all other farmers, is classified under "manufacturing" even though
borrowings are largely used for growing cane.  Despite the substantial rise
in overall bank lending (para 2.11) advances to agriculture and agricultural
industry have remained fairly constant over the last four years at about
J$ 30 million (US$36 million), of which about two-thirds was from comriercial
banks and one-third from Government agencies. As at the end of December 1969,
this represented about 15% of total credit to all sectors.
2.13      The Bank of Jamaica is the Central 13ank.  Control over interest
rates is exercised by use of the Bank Rate (currently 6%), and of liquidity
by requiring a minimum liquid assets/deposits ratio from commercial banks
(presently 17-1/2%) and by directions to banks restricting certain types of
credit.  The Bank of Jamaica offers rediscount facilities for first class
papers for a maximum of 270 days at a rate of 7% with a possibility of
extension for another 270 days.
2.14      There are seven commercial banks (all with substantial overseas
equity) and three Government controlled banks: the Jamaica Developmnent Bank
(JDB) (para 4.01 and Annex 6), the Government Savings Bank (which accounts for
9.4% of time and savings deposits of the banking system) and a Governiment
financed Agricultural Credit Board (ACB) which on-lends most of its funds to
small, semi-independent Peoples Cooperative Banks (PCBs).
2.15      Commercial bank lending to agriculture is limited, particularly for
long-term credit; most is provided by the two largest banks---the Bank of Nova
Scotia Ltd. and Barclays Bank Ltd.--and it represents only about 10% of total
bank advances. Some of this credit is medium-term but most is slhort-term by
way of revolving overdraft facilities to sugar companies and large farmers
for seasonal requirements. The prime interest rate is 8% per annum and rates
vary between 8% and 12% depending on borrowers' credit standing.
2.16      The ACB, a semi-autonomous organization within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries, has been the main agent for Government-supported
lending to small farmers. It is mainly concerned with fostering, supervising,
controlling and making loans to 115 PCBs and derives its funds from Govern-
ment grants.  PCBs borrow from ACB at 3% and on-lend at 6% per ann-im.  ACB
has not been efficient; there are too many PCBs for the volume of advances
resulting in high overheads and heavy losses.  Arrears of PCBs loans
average 40% of portfolio, some of it uncollectable. (Total portfolio at the
end of 1969 was estimated to be J$ 11.7 million or US$14 million). ACB also
makes loans directly to farmers at 6% per annum with a maximum of J$ 20,000
(US$24,000) but the number and amount of such loans is small (present out-
standing balances are approximately J$ 250,000). Loans between J$ 10,000
and J$ 20,000 require the approval of the Minister of Agriculture.
2.17       Commercial farmers' credit requirements have been catered for to a
limited extent by ACB and the commercial banks, but long-term development
loans have been very restricted and there is a larc~e unsatisfied demand for



-5-
agricultural credit. Many large farmers, however, have the potential to
greatly increase production if suitable credit were available.
2.18      Until JDB became operational in September 1969 (para 4.01), the
only sources of institutional credit for agriculture were the commercial
banks and the ACB. The ACB is mainly concerned with making loans to small
farmers and it is being strengthened to undertake the Interamerican Devel-
opment Bank (IDB) financed Small Farmers' Project. JDB has been given the
zesponsibility to lend to larger commerical farmers and it would be the
channel for the proposed Bank loan (para 3.14).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The Project, which would be part of JDB's lending program, would
finance large farmers' long-term investments (totalling about US$7.7 million)
over a period of three years. It would consist of: planting coconuts
(34% of total investment) and citrus (20%) and expanding beef (33%) and dairy
(13%) operations. Also included would be technical assistance to strengthen
the Agricultural Credit Section of the JDB. JDB would be the borrower and
wou'd administer the Project. The total Project cost is estimated at J$ 6.6
million (US$8.0 million) and the Bank's contribution would be US$3.7 million
or 46%, covering the estimated foreign exchange cost. Incremental production
arising from these investments would increase citrus export earnings and
replace imports of copra, beef and milk, thus improving Jamaica's balance
of payments position.
3.02      The following table shows the investments expected to be made over
the three-year period:

About 140 farmers would participate in the Project and would essentially be
well established farmers already operating farms cultivating about 100-200
ac; they would have considerable additional idle land which would be developec
under the Project. It is assumed that JDB's commitments would be made
within the first two years of the Project. Phasing of farmers entering the
investment program is estimated as follows:

B. Detailed Features
Coconuts
3.03      Subloans would be made for planting Malayan dwarf coconuts
(usually temporarily interplanted with bananas during the first five years)
to about 50 farmers, each planting approximatelv 100 ac (total 5,000 ac)
over a period of about two years. Farmers would be given loans for a maxi-
mum of 15 years, including four years of grace if coconuts are temporarily
interplanted with bananas, or for 15 years including six years of grace if
plantations are rehabilitated without bananas. Loans would cover up to 80H
of investment costs for three years including:  land preparation, planting
material, farm-road construction, machinery and equipment, pesticides,
fertilizer and labor (Annex 7).
Citrus
3.04      The Project would include planting about 3,000 ac of citrus, mainly
oranges and grapefruit, and some ortaniques. 1/ About 30 farmers, most of
whom alreadv have citrus orchards, are expected to plant about 100 ac each
over a period of two years. Loans to farmers, which would be for up to 15
years including seven years of grace, would help finance up to 80% of total
investment costs over a three--vear development period including: land prep-
aration, planting material, farm-road construction, fertilizer, pesticides,
machinery and equipment, and labor.
Pasture Establishment for Beef Production
3.05      The expansion of beef operations through pasture improvement
(mainly pangola grass planting) would be financed. About 45 farms with 200
ac of existing improved pasture are expected to plant an additional 300 ac;
in all about 13,500 ac of new pasture would be established. Eachi farm is
expected to develop the additional pasture in about two years and would re-
ceive a loan for up to 12 years including five years of grace covering up
to 80% of the investment costs for a three-year period.  Investments woulcd
be made in:  land preparation, fertilizer, weed control, fencing and corral
establishment, tractor and equipment, water supply installation and live-
stock purchase.  Farmers would need to purchase about 1,100 heifers for the
1/   A cross of oranges and tangerines.

Project. It is estimated that not all might be readily available on the
domestic market when needed, and accordingly the higher cost of about 500
imported heifers has also been included in Project cost estimates.
Pasture Establishment for Milk Production
3.n6      Existing dairy enterprises would get long-term loans for expanding
their operations. About 15 farms would each establish 110 ac additional
improved pasture, a total of about 1,650 ac. Loans would cover up to 80% of
investment costs for the first three years including: land preparation,
fertilizer, weed control, fencing, tractor and equipment, farm-road construc-
tion, dairy equipment and water supply, feed storage and livestock
purchase. Terms of the loans would be up to 10 years including three years
of grace.
Technical Assistance
3.07      JDB's new Agriculltural Credit Section requires the initial assist-
ance of internationally recruited experts, and provision for two experts
(an ag,ricultural economist with banking experience and a livestock expert)
for three years has been includede in the proposed loan (para 4.07). Other
locally recruited staff would be employed as required to assist in appraisal,
sunervision and accounting and to replace the experts after about three
years.  In addition, technical officers of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (MAF) and the extension andl research staff of the Citrus Growers
Association ancd the Coconut Industry Board would assist JDB and Project
farmers.
C.  Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost
3.08      Total Project cost is estimated at J$ 6.6 million (US$8.0 million)
of Twhich 46%, J$ 3.1 million (US$3.7 million) would be foreign exchange.

Financing
3.09      A Bank loan of US$3.7 million (46% of Project cost) would cover
the estimated foreign exchange component of the Project. Farmers would be
required to contribute at least 20% of individual investments, which is con-
sidered reasonable and within their means. The remaining portion of Project
cost, about 34%, would be financed by JDB. The total Project cost of JS 6.6
million would be financed as follows:

3.10      Loans to farmers would be repayable over a maximum period
varying between 10 and 15 years (paras 3.03-3.06) including three to seven
years of grace. With loans commencing in two successive years, the last
repayment to JDB would be made 16 years after the start of the Project. The
cash flow projection (Appendix 6-1) indicates that repayment of the Bank's
loan over 16 years, including a grace period of five years, would be appro-
priate. Accumulation of temporary surpluses would reach a peak of J$ 0.9
million (US$1.1 million) in the twelfth year which would be sufficient to
cover unforeseen slippage in commitments and disbursements.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.11      The items to be financed are varied and would not be suitable for
bullk procurement through international competitive bidding.  In most cases,
land development would be undertaken by small local contractors, while goods
renuired for on-farm investments, including planting material, agricultural
machinery and equipment, fencing, fertilizer and livestock would be obtained
through existing commercial channels. Goods having a high foreign exchange
component are mostly imported from Cormonwealth countries, EEC countries,
and USA; a number of suppliers are represented, assuring keen competition.
Supplies of goods required for on-farm investments are adequate, prices are
competitive and services satisfactory. It is, however, expected that not
all heifers required (1,100) might be readily available locally and provision
has been made in the Project to import about 500 heifers. Existing channels
are satisfactory. Tariffs levied on imported goods required for Project
investments do not exceed 6%. Adequate facilities exist for servicing and
maintaining agricultural machinery and equipment. Procurement would, there-
fore, be through normal commercial channels.
Disbursement
3.12      With JDB's coimmitments being made over two years, disbursements to
farmers under the Project would cover three years. Allowing for possible
delays, Bank disbursement is expected to cover 3-1/2 years (Annex 8). The
Bank would reimburse JDB against appropriate statements and documents 57%
(i.e. 45% of investment cost) of all loans disbursed under the Project in
respect of investments for coconuts, citrus, beef and dairy operations up to
an amount provided for in each category, which would be US$1.2 million for
investments in coconuts, US$0.7 million for citrus, US$1.1 million for beef
and US$0.5 million for dairy. This represents the average estimated foreign
exchange element of investment costs (para 3.08). In addition, the Bank
would reimburse 100% of foreign exchange costs for two internationally
recruited experts to be employed by JDB. In the event the expenditures
under anv category provided for should decrease, the amount of the loan
allocated to such category and no longer required therefor may be reallocated
to another category to allow full utilization of the loan. The same would
apply to the amount provided for technical assistance.



- 10 -
E. Administration and Coordination Committee
3.13      JDB would administer the Project assisted, wlhere appropriate,
by technical officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Coconut Industry
Board and the Citrus Growers Association. Liaison and coordination between
the various bodies concerned would be provided by a coordination committee.
Coordination Committee
3.14      Liaison and coordination between Ministries, Government depart-
ments, industry boards and associations, ACB and JDB are deficient. It is
essential that agricultural policies and efforts be coordinated, particularly
when programs overlap, e.g. availability of planting material or heifers.
Consequently, the Government has established a coordinating committee which
consists of: the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fislheries as Convener and Chairman; and one senior official from each of
the Ministries of Finance and Planning, and Rural Land Development and the
JDB. The committee's terms of reference are to review at least quarterly
Government programs for agriculture to ensure that any program of agricul-
tural credit is properly coordinated within the context of Government
policies and priorities and to facilitate the orderly and rapid development
of the agricultural sector. Assurance was obtained during negotiations
that this Committee would continue to be maintained.
IV. JMAICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (JDB)
Establishment
4.01      JDB was established under the Jamaica Development Bank Act of
March 31, 1969. It is the successor to the Government-owned Development
Finance Corporation (DFC) most of whose assets were taken over by JDB. DFC
operated with modest success due to limited capital and insufficient long-
term resources. Major changes after reorganization and renaming it JDB were:
increased capital, government takeover of five loans in arrears, inclusion
of agriculture in the lending program and a change in management (Annex 6).
JDB's authorized share capital is J$ 10 million (US$12 million) of which
the Government will own 60% and the Bank of Jamaica (the Central Bank) 40%.
As at December 31, 1969, issued and paid-up capital amounted to J$ 4.5 mil-
lion, all subscribed by the Government.  The Government has agreed to
subscribe its remaining portion according to a schedule of payments extending
over the next three years, and the Central Bank has agreed to subscribe its
portion as required for JDB's operations. During negotiations, assurance
was obtained that these commitments would be met.
Resources
4.02      JDB derives its resources from its own capital and borrowings.
Under the JDB Act, its total liabilities must not exceed seven times the
amount of paid-up capital and reserves. It may issue debentures or bonds to
secure its borrowings. As at December 31, 1969, borrowings outstanding
amounted to J$ 9 million (US$10.8 million) giving a debt equity ratio of about



- 11 -
1.5:1. Additional loans amounting to about US$ 10 million equivalent have
been negotiated with various foreign institutions. In general, these are
long-term loans and repayment would extend on average over about 10 years.
By the time these loans are expected to be drawn, JDB's share capital will
have been raised, and assurances were obtained that, during the period of
the proposed Bank loan, the debt/equity ratio would not exceed 3:1 without
the prior approval of the Bank.
Use of Resources
4.03      To date, JI)B's resources (including those inherited from DFC) have
been used for granting loans for, and making equity investments in, industry,
tourism and housing.  No loans have yet been made for agriculture (para
4.07). At December 31, 1969, loans outstanding for these purposes amounted
to J$ 13 million (US$15.6 million) (including loans amounting to J$ 4
million to two wholly-owned subsidiaries).  Shareholding in companies amounte,
to J$ 1.5 million (US$1.8 million) which includes J$ 1.25 million (US$1.5
million) in one wholly-owned subsidiary, Hotel Corporation of Jamaica Ltd.,
which owns the Jamaica Hilton Hotel.
Previous Results and Financial Position
4.04      JDB's history has been too short to judge adequately its profit-
ability. Similarly, it is difficult to predict accurately its future levels
of activity in the sectors it serves (industry, tourism and agriculture).
For the period September 3 to December 31, 1969 a loss of J$ 11,000 was
incurred but costs have been inflated by non-recurring costs of the transfer
from DFC, by the building up of adequate staff and the continued operation
of three overseas branches inherited from DFC. These branches will be
closed during 1970/71. Five-year projections (Appendices 6-3 and 6-4)
indicate a steady increase in JDB's portfolio and profits (profits rising
from J$ 69,000 or USSS3,000 in 1971 to J$ 1.3 million or US$1.5 million in
1975, but these projections may require adjustment in the light of experience
Nievertheless, JDB should be able to earn profits and build up its reserves,
starting in 1970, and should have no difficulty in servicing its debts.
4.05      Arrears in respect to the portfolio inherited from DFC are almost
11% of total outstanding loans. However, J$ 1.3 million (USt1.6 million)
of these arrears are attributable to wholly-owned subsidiaries of JDB.
Excluding the subsidiaries, arrears amount to J$ 250,000 (US$300,000), equiv-
alent to 3% of outstanding loans. Against possible losses on loans there is
an existing reserve of J$ 800,000 (US$1 million). Additional annual pro-
vision would be made (Annex 6). While it is too early to make a definitive
judgment, nor is there adequate information, it appears that on one of the
two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hotel Corporation of Jamaica, no loss will be
experienced. In regard to the other subsidiary, no realistic forecast can be
made. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that JDB has concluded an agreement
with an international company which is expected to become effective by the
end of this year. Under this agreement, Jamaica Ceramics will be reorganized
and the international company will provide additional equity and expert
managerient.  It is hoped that in the long-term, no loss will be incurred.
In a(lition to the reserve for losses, there is a capital reserve amounting
to JS$ 1.2 million (UiSS1.4 million).



- 12 -
Organization and Management
4.06      Full details of JDB's organization and management are given in
Annex 6. JDB's Board of Management, nominated by the Minister of Finance,
consists of 11 members including the Chairman, the General Mtanager and
representatives of the Central Bank and MHinistry of Finance. Directors are
appointed for a three- to five-year term subject only to removal by the
Minister of Finance or the unanimous votes of all other members. The present
Board represents a fairlv diversified cross section of private sector and
Government interests. The Chairman and all members of the DFC Board
became members of JDB's Board and four new members, including the new
General Manager, were added. The Deputy General 'Manager has recently
resigned and a replacement is essential to support the General Manager.
JDB has already selected a qualified individual for this post. The employ-
ment of tlle Deputy General Manager has been made a condition of loan
effectiveness.
4.07      JDB has had no previous experience in agricultural lending.  An
Agricultural Credit Section is being established, the head of whiich has
already been appointed; an experienced agriculturist with some service in
a Jamaican commercial bank. He would need, however the support of an
agricultural economist with considerable banking experience and a livestock
specialist, both to be internationally recruited. An amount of US$200,000
is included in the proposed loan for the employment of the two experts for
a period of three years each. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that JDB would appoint in consultation with the Bank the agricultural econo-
mist and the livestock specialist of suitable qualifications and on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. This would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. Assurances were also obtained that any change of the head
of the Agricultural Credit Section would be made only after prior consulta-
tion with the Bank. Other locally recruited staff would be employed as
required to assist in appraisal, supervision and accounting and to replace
the internationally recruited experts in due course.
4.08      JDB, a multipurpose institution (Annex 6), has recently adopted
appraisal and supervision procedures which should ensure a sound agricul-
tural lending program. A Policy Statement (Appendix 6-5), which has been
agreed by the Bank and JDB, incorporates policies which would safeguard the
overall financial position of JDB such as scope of operations; siz2 of
commitments; security requirements; and lending principles. Assurances on
these points and that JDB would not materially alter the Policy Statement
without the prior approval of the Bank were obtained during negotiations.
Lending Policies and Procedures
4.09      JDB's agricultural staff would assist applicants to prepare
detailed plans including preparation of farm plans, income and expendi-
ture estimates and cash flows. Advice and assistance would be obtained,
where necessary, from the technical officers of the Government and appro-
priate industry organizations (para 2.10). JDB's staff would appraise



- 13 -
the projects in terms of incremental returns and submit recommendations
to its loan committee which would furtlher examine applications before
submitting them to management and to the Board. Loans in excess of
USSlC.0,000 equivalent would require prior approval by the Bank. Teclhnical
staff would periodically visit borrowers' properties to ensure that funds
were being used properly and that progress was satisfactory. Assurances
were obtained that the above procedures would not be altered without prior
approval of the Bank.
Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
4.10       In view of the comparatively high cost of agricultural lending,
JDD has decided to restrict Project subloans to a minimum of J$ 20,000
(US$24,009) (Annex 6).  Small borrowers would be catered for by the ACB
whose upper loan limit is J$ 20,000 (para 2.16). JDB now charges 9-1/2%
per annum on industrial and tourism loans. The commercial bank lending
rate to prime borrowers is 8% per annum and commercial banks charge from
3% to 12% for short-term loans according to borrowers' creditworthiness.
Sub-borrowers under the Project would be charged 8-3/41% per annum. In
addition, sub-borrowers would be clharged annually a commitment fee of 1/2
of 17 on undrawn loan balance, plus a service fee of 1/2 of 1%' before the
first loan disbursement is made. The total charges to farmers are considered
reasonable and would enable JDB to meet the expenses of the Agricultural
Credit Section and make a profit over a five-year period (Annex 6-6). The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk and would receive from JDB
a fee of 1/10 of 1% on loans outstanding to sub-borrowers, such fee to be
included in the 8-3/4% rate to sub-borrowers.  Assurances were obtained
that these conditions would not be altered for any subloan extended under
the Project without prior approval by the Bank.
4.11      Cash flows of typical borrowing farms shown in Appendix 7-2
indicate that the following repayment periods for loans to sub-borrowers
would be appropriate:

During negotiations assurances were obtained that these periods would
not be exceeded without the Bank's prior approval.



- 14 -
Accounts and Auditing
4.12      The Jamaica Development Bank Act requires that separate accounts
and records be kept for each main section of JDB. JDB would, therefore,
maintain a separate account for the Agricultural Credit Section and sepa-
rate accounts of Project operations. The Act also requires that JDB's
accounts be audited annually by auditors approved by the Minister of
Finance. In addition, the Auditor General is entitled to examine the
accounts if so directed by the Minister. Presently, the accounts are
audited by the Jamaican office of Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co. As-
surances were obtained that JDB's accounts would continue to be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that the audited accounts
and auditors' report would be sent to the Bank within four months of the
end of JDB's fiscal year.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARNMERS' BENEFITS
Production
5.01      Under the Project, about 23,000 ac of mostly idle land would be
brought under cultivation; about 15,000 ac of it would be planted with im-
proved pasture and the rest (about 8,000 ac) would be established with tree
crops. About 140 large farms are expected to benefit for the first time
from long-term credit facilities. The incremental value of annual produc-
tion due to these investments would be about J$ 3.5 million (US$4.2 million)
at full development after twelve years. Full production of each individual
investment would be reached at year 5 for dairy, year 7 for beef, year 9 for
coconuts and year 11 for citrus. When all investments have reached full
maturity, after 12 years, an estimated annual incremental production of
about 21,000 ton of coconuts (5,500 ton of copra), 55,000 ton (1.3 million
boxes) of citrus, 1,000 ton of beef (carcass) and 600,000 imp gal of milk
would result.  This represents the following percentages of Jamaica's
present production:  copra - 32%, citrus - 42%', beef - 7%O and milk - 6%.
Production of copra due to this Project would help Jamaica to recover from
disease damage and regain its production level of the mid-1960's. All
Project production of citrus, beef and milk would be an expansion above
present production.
Ilarketing
5.02      The domestic market can readily absorb the incremental produc-
tion of milk, coconuts (copra) and most oranges, whlile there are good
export prospects for all other citrus. Considerable quantities of beef
(US$11 million), vegetable fats and oils (US$2.6 million) and milk prod-
ucts (US$10 million, including eggs and honey) are presentlv imported,
and the incremental production of these items would partly replace these
imports and help satisfy a rising local demand stimulated by the tourist
industry.



- 15 -
5.03      Local demand for copra and milk is firm; marketing is controlled
and secured bv the Government. (Copra production of old plantations is
declining because of the devastating lethal yellowing disease). Good
marketing facilities are provided by the Coconut Industry Board (a statutory
board), the Jamaica M1ilk Product's Condensery (a Nestle subsidiary) and
four private pasteurizing plants. Although there is a strong and growing
demand for beef in the country, (meat imports rose from 11,500 ton in
1968 to 13,000 ton in 1969) meat processing and marketing is not entirely
satisfactory. About one-third of cattle slaughtered is handled by two main
abattoirs in Kingston (Government-ow-ned) and Ocho Rios (private) (Annex 4),
one-third by small abattoirs and butchers, and the remainder by farmers
themselves. Slaughter facilities in Ocho Rios are modern and satisfactory
but installations in the Kingston abattoir are inadequate. A feasibility
study on replacing the Kingston facilities by a modern enlarged abattoir
and meat processing complex recently has been completed. The Government is
aware of the urgency of such an investment which is essential if part of
the rising meat imports is to be replaced. It is expected that improved
facilities would be available when full production of beef from the Project
would be reached (1977). Assurance was obtained from the Government that
it would consult with the Bank on the steps to be taken to facilitate the
availability of adequate slaughter facilities.
5.04      All incremental production of grapefruit, either as processed
fruit (segments and canned juice)or as fresh fruit, is expected to be exported.
IIost of the incremental production of oranges (about 75%) would be consumed
locally as fresh fruit due to fast rising demand, particularly from the
tourist industry, wiile the rest (about 25%) is expected to be processed
into juice and exported. Local consumption of fresh fruit rose from 1.2
million boxes in 1966/67 to 1.7 million boxes in 1968/69. Minor areas of
ortaniques (about 500 ac) would be planted mainly for export purposes.
Oranges, grapefruit and ortaniques, both as fresh fruit and canned products
have a good market in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, particularly for
fresh grapefruit and ortaniques.  Demand, wihich presently exceeds supply,
is expected to continue. Marketing and processing facilities through the
Citrus Growers Association and numerous small traders are satisfactory.
Prices
5.05      Current prices provide sufficient incentive to farmers to invest
in coconuts, citrus, beef and dairy production, and the present price levels
of these products are not expected to fall in the near future. In 1967, farm-
er prices for coconuts were increased by the Coconuts Industry Board (which
has the monopoly over the local markt-et and imports) by 13% and were guaranteed
for seven years, to encourage replanting. This price is about 10% above
predicted future copra world market prices (para 5.07), but since an increas-
ing number of trees of tl-he Jamaica Tall variety are expected to die, local
demand is expected to absorb all this Project production (Annex 2). Citrus
prices for export have fluctuated from year to year but have not changed on
average.  Orange prices for locally consumed fresh fruit, however, have
risen considerably due to the fast growing tourist consumption, making these
prices more attractive than those for fruit delivered to processing plants



- 16 -
for export. It is for that reason that 75% of the Project production is
expected to be consumed locally (para 5.04). Government control of meat
prices was removed in early 1970. They have maintained a satisfactory
level and are unlikely to be controlled again. Milk prices have been
increased in 1969 by 15,' and are expected to rise further due to rising
demand and import restrictions.  Farm-gate prices used in the farm plans and
financial projections are shown in Appendix 7-1.
Farmers' Benefits
5.06      On the basis of investment costs, yields and price assumptions
detailed in four models (Appendices 7-1 and 7-2), farm incomes after debt
service and income tax liabilities are estimated to be as follows at full
development:

5.07      Farmers' financial benefits have been estimated on four illustra-
tive types of farm enterprises (Appendix 7-2). These show that a substantial
net income should result from the proposed investmrents. The financial rates
of return for the various investments are estimated to be between 16 and 22%.
To test the financial returns' sensitivity against varying yields and prices
of farm products, and fluctuations of investment costs, alternative assumptions
have been used which show the following rates of return in comparison to the
"best estimate."

These returns should provide sufficient incentives to producers to engage
in the intended investments.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would for the first time provide long-term credit
for large Jamaican farmers to enable them to increase their production
of coconuts, citrus, beef and milk. In the recent past, agriculture's
rate of growth has lagged significantly below the average and this Project
would encourage commercial agriculture which has been rather neglected in
recent years. The increased production deriving from this Project would
improve Jamaica's balance of payment position both by increased export
earnings (citrus) or by import substitution (vegetable oils, meats and
dairy products). Annual foreign exchange net earnings and/or savings attrib-
utable to the Project would reach about US$3 million equivalent, after
considering the cost of imported inputs (estimated at less than US$1 million),
at the Project's full development, of which about 1JS$1 million equivalent
would be export earnings. Annual debt service would amount to about
US$480,000. Additional, but non-quantifiable, benefits would result mainly
from institutional improvements of JDB, and demonstration effects on non-
Project farmers.
6.02      By developing and planting about 23,000 ac of mostly idle lands,
the Project would enlarge the country's agricultural industry and would
stimulate production beyond this acreage by making considerable earnings
available for reinvestment in agriculture. Lending for coconut planting
would accelerate the on-going program of planting HTalayan dwarf coconuts
which are highly resistant to lethal yellowing disease, currently devasta-
ting Jamaica tall coconut plantations.
6.03      The Project's overall rate of return to the economy over an average
life of 20 years is estimated at 17% (Annex 9). The sensitivity of the
econormic rate of return hias been tested against changes in investment costs
anTd prices and yiel(1s.  An increase in investment costs of 10% would reduce
the rate of return by 2 percentage points (15%); a similar decrease in
costs would increase the rate by one percentage point (18%).  A 10% increase
in the value of produiction because of increased prices or yields would
increase the rate of return by 3 percentage points (20%). A comparable
decrease in production value would decrease the rate by 4 percentage points
(13%').



- 18 -
6.04      Grower Associations (CGA and CIB) have their own research and
technical assistance services (Annexes 2 and 3). There are relatively low
import and turnover taxes on agricultural machinery and equipment; fertilizer
prices are subsidized (20%) and milk price is supported to encourage local
production, but prices paid to producers (US$0.11/liter) are acceptable when
compared with other countries. The Project would generate considerable tax
revenues for the Government (para 5.06), but the precise amount is difficult
to assess since it would vary in accordance with sub-borrowers' total incomes
from all sources. Jamaica has a progressive income tax system, but assuming
that the average net income tax rate to be paid by borrowers is 20%, the
annual tax payable at full development (after the eleventh year) would be
about J$ 340,000 (US$408,000).
6.05      In calculating Project returns, secondary benefits such as the
domestic value added by processing project products have not been taken
into account. Social benefits of increasing employment on farms and in
processing facilities, which would ease Jamaica's employment problems,
also cannot be measured; though not quantifiable, these factors tend to
enhance the Project's already satisfactory economic rate of return to
the economy.
VII.   RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained to ensure
satisfactory Project performance. Some of the principal ones were;
(a) a qualified individual would be employed as Deputy
General Manager as a condition of loan effectiveness
(para 4.06);
(b) an agricultural economist and a livestock specialist, both
internationally recruited and acceptable to the Bank, would be
appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank as
a condition of loan effectiveness (para 4.07); and
(c) the Government would subscribe an additional J$ 1.5 million
to JDB's capital according to an agreed schedule over a 3-year
period, and the Bank of Jamaica would subscribe J$ 4.0 million
as required for JDB's operations (para 4.01).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan to JDB of US$3.7
million for a term of 16 years including a 5-year grace period.

JAMAICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND
General
1.        Jamaica, a tropical island of some 4,400 sq mi (2.8 million ac)
lies in the Caribbean Sea. The island is about 150 mi long and 50 mi wide.
About 60% of the land is suitable for agriculture with commercial farming
concentrated on the coastal plains and subsistence farming in the hills.
2.        The coastal lands in the north and east are narrow but more ex-
tensive plains occur in the southwest. Inland hills of limestone and shale
rise to about 7,400 ft in the Blue Mountains (see Map). The soils are rea-
sonably fertile; a detailed soil survey is available.
3.        Kingston has a deep water port and there are other deep water piers
at Montego Bay, Port Antonio, Rocky Point and Ocho Rios. Elsewhere, (Savanna
la Mar, Lucea, Oracabessa) exports are loaded by lighter or at shallow wharfs
(Bowden). Improvement of loading and shipping facilities is required par-
ticularly for bananas and sugar.
4.        Average rainfall varies from 140 in of well distributed rain in
the northeast to less than 50 in of seasonal rain in the south with two
peaks in May and October.
Agriculture in the Economy
5.        Due to the rapid development of mining (bauxite), industry and
tourism and the decline in agricultural growth, the relative importance of
agriculture in the island's economy has been steadily declining. Agricul-
ture's contribution to GDP was 9.3% in 1969 compared to 10.3% in 1968, 11.6%
in 1965 and 31.0% in 1950.
6.        In 1969, exports of agricultural products represented 28% (US$70
million) of total exports (US$250 million) and are second in importance after
alujminium and bauxite (56%), but its percentage has steadily declined (36% in
1966 and 44% in 1963). The most important agricultural exports were sugar
(US$34 million), bananas (US$15 million), citrus (US$8 million) and pimento
(US$5 million).
7.        The value of food imports in 1969 amounted to US$72 million compared
to US$70 million in 1968 and US$58 million in 1967. Imports of sugar and
sugar preparations, fish and fish preprations and meat and meat preparations
showed the largest increases. Imports of meat (fresh, chilled or frozen)
rose to 13,200 ton in 1969 compared to 11,500 ton in 1968.



ANNEX I
Page 2
8.        Nevertheless, agriculture is very important to Jamaica.  It is
still the largest source of employment engaging about 40% of the labor force.
Agricultural exports and import substitute crops could be increased if
Jamaica's agricultural development were oriented towards encouraging com-
mercial farming rather than to social welfare to subsistence farmers, as
has been the Government's policy in the past. Increased exports and import
substitution are vital if the balance of payments position (estimated at an
overall deficit of about US$14 million in 1969 compared to a surplus of
US$34 million in 1968) is to be improved.
Agricultural Production
9.        Jamaican agriculture was founded in sugarcane which is still
dominant, although other crops (bananas, coconuts, citrus, cacao, coffee
and pimento) have become important. In 1969, the sugar industry suffered
a number of major setbacks which resulted in a fall in production from
456,000 tons in 1967/68 to 360,000 tons in 1968/69, the lowest since 1957/58.
10.       Banana exports also declined from 200,000 ton in 1966 to 150,000
ton in 1969.  Citrus production was about 3 million boxes 1/ in 1968/69 of
which about 1.3 million boxes went for processing. Export earnings from
citrus and citrus products increased from J$ 5.3 million (US$6 million) in
1968 to J$ 6.7 million (US$8 million) in 1969. Pimento exports in 1969 were
about 3,000 tons, a considerable increase over previous years.
11.       Coconut production has declined, however, due to lethal yellowing
disease losses and two years drought. Copra production declined from 20
thousand tons in 1967 to 17 thousand tons in 1969. It will take some years
before the replanting programs now taking place have impact to increase copra
production, and imports are increasing.
12.       Beef and milk production is increasing somewhat.  1969 carcass beef
production of about 15,100 ton and milk production of 9.6 million imp gal
were insufficient to meet demand and sizeable quantities were imported.
3,400 ton of beef and 15,500 ton of milk and dairy products were im-
ported in 1969 in total worth J$ 17.3 million (US$20.8 million).

The Evolution of Agriculture
13.       Development of sugar estates proceeded rapidly with sugarcane
undoubtedly occupying the best soils and most accessible areas. By 1832,
there were 670 sugar factories operating (of these only 18 estates and
centralized factories now remain). Further agricultural development proceeded
on large landholdings where coconuts, cacao and pastures were planted on less
fertile soils.
14.       An increasing population and labor freed from the sugar industry
rapidly established a small subsistence farm sector in the less accessible
areas. A dualistic pattern of agriculture resulted, still apparent in the
present structure of the agriculture industry.
15.       Each important crop has its own industry body, established initially
for export crops. The sugar industry is controlled by the Sugar Manufacturers
Association and the Cane Farmers Association. Coconut growing is assisted
and organized by the Coconut Industry Board and citrus by the Citrus Growers
Association. Bananas are the responsibility of the statutory Banana Board.
These specialized crop agencies conduct their own research, provide technical
services, control quality and quotas and set farm-gate prices.
16.       Most small farmers are engaged in food crop production where there
is no effectively organized marketing and little research. (Government
Agricultural Marketing Corporation has had little impact.) The small farmers
have in the past been strongly assisted by the Government while the larger
farmers growing sugarcane, coconuts, citrus and bananas are largely considered
independent.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
17.       Demanding farm work especially sugarcane cutting and loading has
become less attractive and although the overall unemployment situation is
marked, there is often a shortage of farm labor. This is found especially
in areas where alternative and more lucrative employment opportunities exist
such as the areas with bauxite mining and tourism.
18.       Government have recently taken cautious steps to put agriculture
on a sounder footing. The decision to establish the Jamaica Development
Bank's agricultural lending program for commercial size farmers (while im-
proving the small farm activities of the Agriculture Credit Board) follows
closely the reshaping of Government's approach to Jamaican agriculture.
Land Use, Farm Size and Tenani,
19.       Out of the total area of 2.8 million ac, about 550,000 ac are
cultivated.  Sugarcane occupies the largest area (180,000 ac) followed bv
coconuts (95,000 ac) and bananas (80,000 ac). Other important crops are
cacao (43,000 ac), pimento (29,000 ac), citrus (27,000 ac) and coffee (22,002
ac). In addition, there are about 500,000 ac of pasture and 400,000 ac of
scrub or "ruinate". In many cases, intercropping is practiced (i.e.,
coconuts/bananas or coconuts/pimento).

20.       There are about 185,000 farms with a total acreage of 1.5 million.
Of these, some 181,000 farms (97% of the total) of less than 25 ac each
occupy only 37% of farmland. Some 145,000 farms of this group are less than
5 ac. Farms of from 25-100 ac (3,000 farms) occupy 8% of the land and the
remainder, 55% or 0.8 million ac are held by 1,000 farms with over 100 ac each.

21.       The largest individual landholders are the 18 sugar estates and
the four bauxite mining companies. Land acquired by the bauxite companies is
mainly farmland and the bauxite occurs in isolated and deep pockets. Mining
activity is scattered and the companies either lease land to farmers or
farm it themselves with a preponderance of citrus and cattle.

22.       There has been increasing subdivision of large properties.  The
number of farms larger than 100 ac was 1,210 in 1954 but only 994 in 1968.
one hundred seventy-seven such farms larger than 100 ac were split up or
left farming between 1961 and 1968:

23.       Most of the land is freehold and small farmers are encouraged to
acquire legal title to the land they cultivate. Leasehold titles exist
but are not favored by Jamaicans.
The Work of the Land Development and Utilization Commission
24.       The Land Development and Utilization Commission (LDUC) was
established in 1966 to stimulate full utilization of farmlands. Where lands
are idle or underutilized, notices are served prior to the issuance of idle
land orders, after which Government can take steps to acquire the land.
Farmers either undertake development plans or sell the farm in part or whole.
25.       About 1,300 larger farms have been inspected covering about
809,000 ac. About 12% of this land was adjudged idle (on 386 farms) but only
38 idle land orders were issued covering 27,000 ac. On the other farms,
additional developments are in progress. The crops being expanded are
mostly sugarcane, bananas, citrus, coconuts and improved pastures.

Source:   LDUC June 1970.
26.       The LDUC has detailed records of land use on all large farms in
Jamaica. One of the major problems has been the shortage of long-term credit
to which farmers with underutilized lands could be directed. The Commission
expects to work closely with the Jamaica Development Bank in this connection.
Extension and Research Services
27.       Agricultural extension was formerly the exclusive responsibility
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. In Januarv 1969, a new Ministry
of Rural Lands Development (\MRLD) was created to give greater thrust to
Government programs for small and medium farmers. Responsibility for larg-er
farmers (more than 100 ac) remained in the former Ministry, now renamed tile
'inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries (:AF).
28.       Governments agricultural sector functions are divided between
MAF and MRLD. While one agricultural planning unit serves both Ministries,
greater coordination is needed to assure adequate supplies of planting
material, to integrate agricultural development programs and to avoid
duplication of services including research and extension.
29.       The statutory Boards (Coconut Industry Board, Cacao Industry Board
and Banana Board) and grower associations (Citrus Growers Association) have
their own technical advisory staff and conduct their own research programs.
They liaise closely with the MAF and their extension and research services
are satisfactory.

THE COCONUT INDUSTRY
General
1.        Most of Jamaica's requirements for edible oils are supplied by the
coconut industry.  A Coconut Control Authority established in 1945 plays a
general supervisory role in the industry, while the statutory Coconut
Industry Board (CIB) regulates marketing, undertakes basic research and
provides technical assistance to producers.
Coconut Industry Board(CIB)
Es tab lishment
2.        The CIB is a statutory body created in 1945.  It has nine members,
five elected by coconut growers and four nominated by the Government. It
is a well-run and efficient organization, vital to the continued success
of the coconut industry.
Functions
3.        The CIB has exclusive rights to purchase copra throughout
Jamaica, to sell copra to local processors and to import and export copra
and vegetable oils. Two CIB subsidiary companies process most of the
copra available into margarine, cooking oil, soaps and other copra products.
4.        The CIB also undertakes basic research, provides technical
assistance to producers, operates a windstorm insurance and a lethal
yellowing disease replanting program, and supplies fertilizers at cost
to growers. It is also responsible for selecting seed nuts and for
ensuring that adequate supplies of seedlings are available throughout
Jamaica.
Resources
5.        The Board's resources derive from the differential between the
CIB purchase price of copra and the sale price to processors presently
J$ 21.80 per ton of copra handled (para 21); accumulated resources (J$ 1
million or USS1.2 million at December 31, 1969); and a bank overdraft
amounting to J$ 472,000 (US$566,000) at December 31, 1969. CIB receives
no Government subsidy.
Use of Resources and Financial Position
6.        Resources are used for research (para 7), windstorm insurance
(para 10), a lethal yellowing fund (para 27), and administrative expenses.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
The financial position deteriorated in 1968 and 1969 because of the decline
in copra production and constantly rising cost of operations, including
research. Net deficits resulted in those years and drawings were made on
reserves built-up until 1967. These reserves are adequate to finance
operations for some years to come but if CIB should become financially
embarrassed Government would undoubtedly assist, as it has done in the case
of the Banana Board.
Research Program
7.        The Research Department is staffed by three expatriate scientists,
an advisory officer, 30 field officers and assistants and six laboratory
assistants. Annual expenditure has risen to J$ 135,000 (US$162,000) in 1969,
45% of which was for salaries and allowances. The United Kingdom Ministry
of Overseas Development and FAO provide additional assistance.
8.        Research was started in 1961 on two main activities: (a) develop-
ment of more efficient cultural methods including the use of fertilizers,
herbicides and intercropping practices; and (b) yield improvement by seed
selection and breeding with emphasis on resistance to lethal yellowing
disease.
9.        Regular field days are held for farmers and a series of fertilizer
and herbicide demonstration plots has been laid out.  The Department is also
responsible for advising on fertilizer programs using foliar analysis but
its work is heavily concentrated on the lethal yellowing outbreak.
Windstorm Insurance Scheme
10.       The CIB operates an insurance scheme for loss of bearing trees
from hurricane or floods. Benefits are not payable for loss of crop or
for young tree losses and are calculated according to the growers actual
deliveries of coconuts to copra factories in preceeding years with a
maximum coverage of J$ 8.0 (US$9.60) per tree. Benefits are payable only
when a minimum 5% loss of trees occurs and when at least 50% of the stand
has been replanted. They cover roughly 50% of real losses.
11.       Total net assets of the Insurance Fund at December 1969 were
J$ 2.4 million (US$2.88 million) and reinsurance covered additional claims
up to J$ 6.4 million (US$7.7 million). The liability of the Fund, based
on copra deliveries, was a total of J$8.3 million (US$9.94 million).
Coconut Growing
12.       The main variety of coconuts grown is the Jamaica t:all, an open
pollinated palm usually planted at about 40 trees/ac, yielding an average
30 nuts per tree/year. Newly planted coconuts are usually temporarily inter-
planted with bananas, and in particularly small plantations permanent
interplanting with bananas, citrus or pimento is common.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
13.       Although growing a temporary interplanted crop can reduce young
coconut palm development through shading and nutrient and water competition,
it is on balance an advisable measure. The young coconut plants benefit
from the fertilizer and the attention given to the interplanted crop provid-
ed shade is carefully controlled, and there is little weed growth.
14.       Permanent intercropping, although useful with the Jamaica tall,
is not recommended with the Malayan dwarf variety. The dwarf is planted
at about 110 trees/ac and yields an average 55 nuts per tree/year on
commercial estates.
Availability of Planting Material
15.       The eight CIB controlled nurseries set 588,000 selected Malayan
dwarf seed nuts during the first six months of 1970. About 180,000 extra
nuts will be set by year-end and total seedling availability should be about
570,000. 1971 plans anticipate a seedling production of 600,000. The
seedlings are sold to farmers at J$ 0.15 (US$0.18) each delivered to the
farm by CIB transport.
16.       There are adequate supplies of seed nuts available in Jamaica to
meet these requirements. Should any unforseen circumstance occur (such as
hurricane or storm damage), CIB staff have already selected parent trees in
the island of St. Lucia.
Production Patterns
17.       There are an estimated 4.8 million bearing coconut trees (about
95,000 ac) in Jamaica. Production is highly concentrated and although
there are scattered trees throughout the island, most nuts used for copra
are produced by fairly large estates. About 7,700 growers deliver nuts for
copra but only 2,200 of these are registered growers owning more than 100
bearing trees each. The registered growers deliver about 85% of coconuts
used for copra. Some 215 large growers deliver 56% out of the 85% supplied
by registered growers.
18.       Copra is dried in 57 factories (29 commercial; 28 growers) with a
total capacity of about 32,000 ton/year. Forty-five of the driers are
located in the three eastern parishes of St. Thomas, Portland and St. Mary
where 97% of all coconuts are grown.
Production Levels and Demand
19.       The current level of copra production is about 17,200 ton/year.
About 80% of total coconut production is converted to copra, the remainder
being sold on the local market. Although copra production had generally
risen by about 3-1/2% per year between 1954 and 1967 to a level of 19,280
ton, the effects of 1966/68 droughts and increasing lethal yellowing
disease are now reflected in declining production.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
20.       The CIB estimates that the current copra requirement is about
20,000 ton. The demand appears to be increasing at about 5% per
annum and is projected at 33,000 ton by 1980. Copra and oil imports are
increasing to meet the deficit. Details are as follows:

Source:  Coconut Industry Board data 1970.
Price Structure
21.       Prices for nuts and copra are fixed and guaranteed to remain
stable for seven-year periods. New prices were introduced in August 1967.
These prices are:
Purchase Price (Grower Price)
Coconuts J$ 2.25 per unit equivalent to J$ 20.40 per 1,000
nuts of Malayan dwarf and to J$ 25.00 per 1,000 nuts of Jamaica
talls.
Copra J$ 152.75 per ton.
Selling Price (Coconut Board to Processors)
Copra J$ 174.55 per ton.
22.       The grower prices are for husked nuts placed at any copra drier
which are rarely more than 10 mi from any grower.  The CIB pays a transport
allowance to farmers for nut deliveries of J$ 0.53 per 1,000 nuts for
5-10 mi.  The guaranteed grower price is in effect a guaranteed farm-gate
price.
Lethal Yellowing Disease
23.       Although lethal yellowing disease was probably present in Jamaica
for over 70 years, it was confined to scattered plantings in the West. In
1961, however, the disease suddenly appeared on the northeast coast where
the larger coconut farms are concentrated and has since rapidly spread to
most major areas. The CIB estimates present losses at 100,000 bearing
trees per year.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
24.       Affected trees drop their nuts, the growing point and inflores-
cences turn black and degenerate, and the leaves turn bronze. Death is
extremely rapid once symptoms appear. The most common coconut variety in
Jamaica, the Jamaica tall, shows no resistance and lethal yellowing spreads
rapidly through infected farms completely killing out the palms in four
or five years.
25.       In sl3ite of eight years research by the Ministry of Agriculture
and the Coconut Industry Board, assisted by FAO and USAID, neither the
disease nor the vector has been identified and all attempts at trans-
mission have failed. Research is currently centered on the probability
of an insect-borne virus-like disease.
26.       Forttnately, the Malayan dwarf variety has shown high resistance
to the disease even when interplanted with Jamaica talls. Isolated deaths
have occured but these were almost certainly hybrid plants cross-pollinated
with tall pollen. Despite its resistance, research should continue to
Identify the disease and the vector, and to establish innoculation tech-
niques for more rapid varietal resistance testing.
Lethal Yellowin& Reejlant ing_Scheme
27.       Replanting programs are based on the Malayan dwarf.  The dwarf is
less susceptible to hurricane damage, bears earlier and yields more (6,000
nuts/ac, compared with 1,200 nuts/ac for Jamaica talls, but nuts are some-
what smaller).
28.       CIB offers assistance to registered growers when 2-1/2% lethal
yellowing losses are recorded, of about J$ 54 (US$64) per ac including
planting material. This represents only 25% of the costs of replanting
(about J$ 230,US$276 for four years). Unless additional funds become
available the scheme may have to be curtailed.

THE CITRUS INDUSTRY
General
1.        The Citrus Growers Association (CGA) regulates the citrus export
trade. Fresh fruit, canned juice and segments and frozen concentrate are
exported mostly to the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries where
protective tariffs are enjoyed. The Association does not control citrus
sold on the domestic market. There is also one private processing company
(the Citrus Company of Jamaica Ltd.) which is allocated fruit supplies by
CGA.
Citrus Growers Association (CGA)
Organi zation
2.        The CGA is an association of growers, with about 21,000 members,
operating as a limited liability company. It has a network of local branches
which organize fruit pick up and advise farmers when to harvest if they wish
to sell to CGA. CGA owns two subsidiaries, Jamaica Citrus Growers Ltd. and
Caribbean Preserving Co. Ltd. The former has a processing plant at Bogwalk
whilst the second subsidiary also had a processing plant in Kingston but
this was closed in 1970 in order to centralize operations and increase the
throughput of the Bogwalk plant.
Functions
3.        The CGA regulates the export of citrus, both fresh fruit and
processed products. It also provides a field advisery service, a spraying
service and has given short-term loans to growers from a 1961 United Kingdom
loan of US$450,000. While the CGA does not conduct research itself, it
contributes to the British Caribbean Citrus Association's Research Unit
located in Trinidad.
Resources and Use of Resources
4.        The CGA has only a nominal issued capital of J$ 300 (US$360).  It
derives its income from its trading and processing activities. It has loans
from Government of J$ 193,000 (US$232,000) and from the United Kingdom
Government of US$450,000. CCA uses its resources for its commercial acti-
vities, the provision of field advisery services, a spraying service and
granting short-term loans to growers.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Citrus Growing
5.        Citrus is produced throughout the island but commercial groves
are concentrated in the central zones of Clarendon, St. Catherine and
St. Mary. CGA estimates that the total acreage of citrus groves is 27,000
ac (oranges 20,000; grapefruit 3,000; and ortaniques 4,000).
6.        The main varieties are:  for orange - Valencia and Washington
navel; and for grapefruit - Marsh and Duncan. Budwood selected by CGA and
Ministry staff is used in all nurseries. Some nucellar material is being
multiplied and will be used when more general testing has been completed.
7.        Little tristeza or gummosis occurs in Jamaica and both sour
orange and rough lemon are used as rootstocks. The most serious pests are
citrus scale, slugs and the fiddler beetle which can all be controlled by
regular spraying.
8.        Commercial groves are normally planted at 100 trees/ac and inter-
cropping is discouraged. Trees are first reaped in their fifth year and
reach full bearing by about the tenth year. Average commercial yields are
about 300 boxes/ac (80 lb each) of oranges and 550 boxes/ac (90 lb each)
of grapefruit.
9.        Some northeast areas of Jamaica 1/, with better distributed rain-
fall, produce mature fruit in August and September. Early grapefruit
produced there catches the fresh fruit export marlet in Europe before
supplies from other countries are available.  The main crop flush comes
between December and N"arch when most goes for proccssing.  Ortaniques
grow well only at elevations above 800 ft and their growing is rather
restricted by poorer soils.
Availability of Planting Material
10.       CGA estimates that some 850 ac of citrus was planted in 1969/70
in contrast to 420 ac in 1968/69. September to November is the main
planting season and budded plants take 18-24 months to prepare from the
date of seed sowing. CGA controls the quality of planting material.
11.       Plants are supplied at subsidized prices J$ 0.15 (US$0.18) each
by seven Ministry of Agriculture nurseries, about five private nurserymen
and two CGA nurseries. The availability of plants in nurseries (ready
for sale in fall 1971) was only about 100,000 at the time of appraisal.
August 1970 sowings, however, were planned to produce a further 180,000
plants bringing the total plant availability for 1971 to 280,000 (about
2,500 ac), which would be sufficient for JDB Project requirements.

Productive Levels
12.       Deliveries of citrus to CGA have dropped since 1961-66 when 1.5
million boxes per vear were handled, to the 1969/70 crop level of 1.0
million boxes. The decline is attributed to two years of drought (1966/67)
in the citrus areas and to increasing amounts of fruit being sold on the
donestic market (mainly due to the rising tourist industry). CGA estimated
that they received only 25 to 30% of the 1969/70 orange crop.

13.       Total production is estimated at about 2.1 million boxes oranges,
0.8 million boxes grapefruit and 0.1 million boxes ortaniques.  The value
of eyport earnings was J$ 6.7 million (US$8.0 million) in 1969, forming 12%
of africultural exports.
Markets and Prices
Domes tic _rading
14.       The local market for fresh fruit has expanded rapidly.  This was
mainly because of the rising tourist industry. Demand for oranges in parti-
cular has risen by an estimated 100% between 1965 and 1969 with simultaneous
price rises. Most of the marketing is done by small traders; very little by
Government Agricultural Marketing Corporation. Orange prices range from
JS 0.60 (US$0.72) per box in crop to J$ 2.50 (US$3.00) in July/August before
picking starts with a weighted annual price of J$ 1.40 (US$1.70) per box at
farm-gate.
CGA Purchases
15.       Prices vary according to season and intended use of the fruit.
CGA publishes a price before the crop and adjusts this three or four times
during the season giving about 14 days notice on each occasion. Growers
frequently withhold fruit hoping for better prices if the crop cannot be
sold on the domestic market.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
16.       Average farm-gate prices (weighted) for citrus in 1969/70 were:
Oranges for fresh
fruit exports           J$ 1.00         (US$1.20) per box
Oranges for juice

Grapefruit for juice

Ortaniques for fresh
fruit exports           J$ 1.20         (US$1.44) per box
Market Prospects
Oranges
17.       Growth prospects for the CGA/United Kingdom Ministry of Health
contract for hot pack concentrated orange juice appear limited. The contract
is negotiated annually and was 900 tons in 1970. Frozen concentrate sales,
however, are expected to expand further in the Caribbean Free Trade Area
(CARIFTA). Most frozen concentrate is exported to Canada and Germany and
this should expand through existing special trade agreements.
18.       Export prospects for fresh oranges appear limited because of high
shipping costs, unattractive skin color and tough cellulose. Current levels
of 29,000 boxes are about 50% of 1960/67 shipments. The domestic market
is, however, projected to continue expanding and will absorb an increasing
proportion of total production.
Grapefruit
19.       Early fresh grapefruit fetch good prices in Europe before supplies
from other countries arrive on the market (August/September) and 1968/69
shipments were about 47,000 boxes (1960-67 average 65,000 boxes). Jamaica
could considerably expand these markets if more fruit were available and
markets could be expanded in New Zealand (January/February).
20.       Canned grapefruit segments and juices appear to have good futures
in the United Kingdom market. Citrus Growers of Jamaica Ltd., with a well
established brand (Trout Hall), has undertaken consultant market surveys
which indicate a greatly unfilled demand. Currently, about 400,000 boxes
of fruit are used for canning segments while 116,000 boxes are used for
juice and concentrate.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Other Citrus
21.       Ortaniques are exported as fresh fruit to New Zealand, Germany
and United Kingdom. Becaase of drought, 1968/69 levels of 14,000 boxes
were only about 40% of normal levels. There is a strong demand in New
Zealand and the United Kingdom which cannot be met because of low production.
The Farmer and Marketing
22.       The future for citrus in Jamaica appears satisfactory especially
for the domestic orange market and for export grapefruit. Farmers naturally
sell on the most lucrative markets available, which is expected to increase
further because of the rising tourist industry. Most of the orange crop
(75%) is destined for local traders with the fluLsh diverted to the CGA for
processing when CGA prices and local prices reach the same levels. This
pattern is expected to continue, as is the pattern of grapefruit marketing,
where as much early fruit as possible is sold for fresh fruit exports (25%
of total crop) and the balance for segment processing. Farmers are interested
in planting oranges and grapefruit in about equal amounts and 1969 citrus
plantings were double that of 1968 (to 850 ac).

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
THE BEEF INDUSTRY
General
1.        Beef production in Jamaica lags behind demand and increasing
quantities of high and medium grade beef are imported. Imports of 6,000
sh tons were equal to about 40% of local production in 1969.
2.        The Jamaica Livestock Association has encouraged the beef indus-
try for some years and farm gate and retail price controls were set free
in January 1970. There is still little organized marketing and producers
individually sell to butchers or to cattle buyers. The butchers slaughter
in local municipal abattoirs and sell the carcass beef to meat retailers
or directly to consumers.
3.        The sugar estates and bauxite companies are important cattle
farmers. Recent trends are for a considerable expansion on bauxite
properties, the conversion of uneconomic sugarcane fields into pastures,
and a move into coconut areas, often into estates devastated by lethal
yellowing disease. Further expansion is expected on large areas of unused
lands (ruinate) with increasing areas of improved pastures and more supple-
mentary feeding of local molasses, coconut meal and citrus pulp.
Raising Beef Cattle
4.        Jamaica has about 500,000 ac of grassland of which about 250,000
ac are improved pastures (carrying about 1 A.U. per ac) and 250,000 ac
are native grasses or commons (carrying about 0.4 A.U. per ac). In addition,
some 400,000 ac of ruinate or scrub provide occasional seasonal grazing.
About 100,000 ac of the improved pasture in Jamaica is pangola grass
(Digitaria decumbens), the remainder mostly guinea (Panicum maximum). In
common with most other Caribbean Islands, farmers in Jamaica have increasing-
ly planted pangola grass which is drought resistant and resists overgrazing.
Pangola is highly responsive to fertilizer application and there is little
weed growth to control.
5.        The total herd is estimated at about 350,000 head of which about
18% are dairy cattle. Registered slaughter in 1969 was 61,500 head
representing an extraction of about 18%. Commercial beef herds are pre-
dominantly brahman or zebu crosabreds. The Jamaican Red (red poll x zebu)
and Jamaica Black (angus x zebu) are locally developed breeds which do well.
6.        Beef cattle are grazed year round although in cattle areas there
is a well marked dry season of three to five months during which increased
supplementary feeding is needed. Bulls run with the herd throughout the
year in most herds but seasonal breeding is increasing. Weaning percentage



ANNEX 4
Page 2
averages about 60% and adult mortality about 3%. Calves are weaned at about
nine months weighing about 450 lb live and heifers are usually bred at
2-1/2 to 3 years.
7.        There is little trade in weaned steers for fattening; most farmers
rear their own steers through to slaughter weight. On improved pastures,
steers are usually finished at 900 lb at about two years old or at 18
months with high levels of supplementary feeding over the last 100 days. On
native pastures, this finished weight is attained at between three and
four years of age.
8.        Foot and mouth disease has never been recorded in Jamaica and
there is a low incidence of brucellosis. The most serious diseases are
anaplasmosis and piraplasmosis against which indigenous cattle have high
resistance. Regular dipping schedules control ticks and vaccination
against anthrax and hemorrhagic septicemia is performed regularly.
Availability of Breeding Stock
9.        Jamaica has a surplus of pure bred bulls and has developed a
small export trade (100 bulls per year). Bulls of adequate quality are
available for local purchase at an average price of J$ 500 each.
10.       Heifers are more difficult to obtain since farmers are currently
building up their own herds and in-calf heifers are not generally available.
About 600 unbred heifers are sold each year from herds within the island at
an average price of J$ 120 each.
11.       The Government does not discourage the importation of breeding
cattle and has good quarantine facilities, developed for a large dairy
heifer import scheme. Imported cattle are susceptible to anaplasmosis and
piraplasmosis but with careful acclimatization and exposure, importation
presents few problems. The cost of these animals (about J$ 430) is,
however, considerably higher than local cattle. The JDB Project would
require about 1,100 heifers in total, and in case these would not be
available when required, the possible importation of 500 heifers has been
considered in Project cost estimates.
Production Patterns
12.       Most beef cattle are produced in the west and about half of the
national herd is on some 200 farms of over 500 ac each. Some of the
largest herds were developed by sugar estates and more lately by bauxite
holdings (who now have an estimated 25,000 head alone).
13.       Most slaughter cattle are grassfed but Jamaica has increasingly
practiced supplementary feeding on pangola grass using the limited local
citrus pulp, coconut meat, wheat middlings or brewers grains. Little maize
is grown locally because returns are lower than sugarcane or bananas and
few cattle farmers produce maize or elephant grass silage.

Coconut meat         5,500 ton/year         J$ 35 per ton
Wheat middlings    18,000 ton/year          J$ 34 per ton
Corn imported          unlimited            J$ 54 per ton
Corn local            very limited          J$ 72 per ton
Production Levels and Demand
14.       Beef production rose slowly between 1960 and 1969 to a level of
15,100 ton from some 61,500 cattle slaughtered. Beef imports rose to
6,000 ton (1969) over the same period.
15.       Pig production has expanded rapidly from a 1965 slaughter of
79,000 head to some 129,000 head or 6,000 ton of pork in 1969. Imports
of fresh and salt pork have declined accordingly from 2,150 ton in 1965
to 1,500 ton in 1969. Poultry production has also increased to a
1969 level of 13,200 ton in 1969 but imports have continued to rise from
2,200 ton (1965) to 4,200 ton in 1969.
16.       The total value of meat and meat products imported in 1965 was
J$ 6.5 million (US$7.8 million). In 1969, the value was J$ 9.1 million
(US$10.9 million).
17.       The overall demand position for beef is strong but there are three
distinct consumer demands in Jamaica:
(a) The hotel industry - demanding high quality U.S. or Canadian
cuts from grainfed cattle.
(b) Upper and middle income consumers - buying the best local
beef and imported grassfed frozen beef from Australia and
New Zealand.
(c) Lower income consumers - buying mostly local beef and some
imported frozen beef.
18.       The high grade U.S. imports pay 33% import duty.  They form about
8% of all beef imports and 26% of the value of beef imports. United King-
dom Commonwealth countries supply the remainder at a preferential import
duty of 15%. The lower value frozen beef imports offer possibilities of
import substitution by local production.

Marketing and Prices
19.       Butchers and traders buy cattle on the farm: no auction system
operates in Jamaica.  Butchers slaughter in municipal abattoirs and pay a
fee for use of facilities. Most of the carcasses are then sold through
the butchers own retail outlets, the remainder through supermarkets or to
other retailers who employ their own cutters. There are 850 licensed and
an unknown number of unlicensed butchers in Jamaica.
20.       There are two main slaughterhouses: Kingston (municipal) and Ocho
Rios (Reynolds Bauxite). About 16,000 head are slaughtered yearly in
Kingston and about 4,000 in Ocho Rios. The other 40,000 animals are
slaughtered in small country abattoirs and on farm.
21.       The Kingston abattoir is an unsophisticated structure designed
for about 400 cattle per week and has no facilities for processing offals
or for storing meat.  It does not meet modern sanitary requirements and
throughput could not be significantly expanded. The Ocho Rios abattoir, on
the other hand, is a modern abattoir used at present mostly for pig
slaughter and with a cattle throughput (about 80 per week) only 20% of
designed capacity.
22.       Slaughter facilities are not an overriding problem at present
but clearly, the Kingston abattoir needs replacing.  The Kaiser Development
Corporation (bauxite industry) is currently studying the feasibility of
constructing a feedlot/abattoir/meat processing complex which would be
locally owned and operated near Kingston. Until these studies are completed
(end 1970), the Government is deferring a decision on how best to replace
or improve the Kingston municipal abattoir.
23.       Government controlled the maximum official prices of slaughter
cattle (liveweight), of carcass beef and of retail cuts until January 1970.
Controls were removed following informal agreement by the Jamaica Livestock
Association membership to maintain on farm prices at previous free market
levels and this has been adhered to. Farm gate liveweight prices are
currently J$ 0.24 (US$0.29) per lb for steers on pangola grass and supple-
mentary feed, J$ 0.22 (US$0.26) per lb for grass fat steers and J$ 0.18/0.20
(US$0.22/0.24) per lb for cull cows or heifers.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
THE DAIRY INDUSTRY
CGe ral
1.        Jamaica has a small milk industry and a growing demand for
quality fluid milk. Condensed milk and powdered milk have traditionally
occupied market demand and 1969 imports of milk and milk products amounted
to J$ 8.3 million (US$10.0 million).
2.        Producers sell most of their milk as untreated fluid milk but a
condensary and four pasteurizing plants also supply the domestic market.
Annual production is about 9.6 million imp gal from a milking herd of
60,000 head, while 70% of commercial production comes from about 200
larger farms located mostly in the south and southwest of Jamaica. All
farm-gate prices are Government controlled and Government recently banned
the importation of USA sterilized fluid milks to further encourage local
production.
Milk Production
3.        Dairy farms are concentrated in the hill country zone (rainfall
70 in to 90 in; dry season two to three months) or in the coastal plains
which are considerably drier (rainfall 40 in - 60 in; dry season three to
five months).
4.        The larger farms are equipped with milking machines, cooling
facilities and farm machinery but milk sheds are generally inadequate.
Cattle are milked twice daily and the average lactation is 500 imp gal with
700-800 imp gal common. The most popular dairy breed is the Jamaica Hope
(Jersey x Sahiwal) but Holsteins are increasingly used. Their yields are
higher but they require better management.
5.        Government maintains an artificial insemination service which
is widely used. Farmers pay a fee of J$ 0.50 (US$ 0.60) per service
using semen from high grade bulls (the top 3 bulls in the A-l center have
dams with 1,800-2,000 gal per lactation). Calving percentage averages 80%
and weaning percentage 75%. The calvlng interval is commonly 13-14 months
with a high percentage of heifers first calving at three years. Male
calves are disposed of for slaughter at one to four weeks and adult mortality
is low (2%).
Availability of Dairy Cattle
6.        Jamaica established a dairy development scheme in 1965 which
required the importation of dairy stock. The Agricultural Development
Corporation (ADC) has acquired considerable experience in importing 10-30
day old Holstein heifer calves, rearing them and selling them to
farmers.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
7.        The demand for these heifers has been less than projected and
ADC will have 1,000 heifers available in 1971/72 at price of J$ 240
each. Farmers have good experience with such stock which is acclimatized,
disease resistant and already in-calf when purchased.
The Dairy Development Scheme
8.        The Government's scheme to encourage milk production on small to
medium family operated enterprises has had fair success. A large part of
the scheme consists in training farmers on a Government owned farm and in
settling them on 25 ac farms with housing, milk sheds, cattle and pastures
already established. Credit is also available for established farms of
25-100 ac with 20 to 80 cows. The maximum loan is US$15,000.
9.        The USAID loan of US$1.5 million (1965) should be fully
committed by December 1.970 but ai appreciable demand for credit to produce
milk has come from farms larger than those eligible under the dairy develop-
ment scheme.

11.       Total demand for milk, butter and cheese in 1969 was estimated to
be about 27.4 million imp gal of fluid milk equivalent, of which the
equivalent of 18.4 million impt gal were imported or 67%.  The production
deficit has increased and J-aicreasing imports have been required to a
current value of about US$8 million.

Marketing and Prices
12.       In 1940, a Nestle subsidiary established a condensary in Central
Jamaica designed to reconstitute imported skim powder and to produce
canned condensed milk. Under the terms of its franchise, the condensary
was obliged to accept all fluid milk offered by Jamaican farmers of accep-
table standard and to pay minimum prices established by Government.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
13.       To meet these obligations, the condensary operates two collection
and cooling stations and collects milk along main roads throughout Jamaica.
Milk is collected from about 800 farmers but only 65 supply more than 20
gal per day each and 555 supply less than 2 gal per day.
14.       Larger farmers increasingly supply a strong demand from four
pasteurizing plants (1.5 million imp gal in 1969) and milk supplies to the
condensary have declined from 3.0 million imp gal in 1952 to a 1969
level of about 1.7 million imp gal/year. Total capacity of the condensary
is 8 million imp gal/year. The pasteurizing plants collect milk in the
same areas and often along the same routes as the condensary and keen
competition for quality cooled milk has arisen.
15.       Farmers have a guaranteed market and minimum price for their
milk. Farm gate prices are adjusted for seasonality, quality and quantity.
Basic 1970 prices vary between J$ 0.34 and J$ 0.40 per imp gal (US$0.41 -
0.48) with additional premiums for butter fat, chilling and well managed
dairy sheds. Guaranteed prices with premiums reach from J$ 0.39 to J$ 0.46
per gal (US$0.47 - 0.52).
16.       The pasteurizing plants pay higher prices than the guaranteed
minimums; commonly about J$ 0.53 per imp gal (US$0.64). Their year round
prices are higher than those offered by the condensary which pays the
minimum guaranteed price.

JAMATCA DEVELOPMENT BAN"K (JDB)
ETsta>lisliment
1.        The J3D  was established under the Jamaica Development Banl Act
dated. March 31, 1969 which came into effect on Septemb'er 3, 1969.  It is
the successor to the Government-owmed Development Finance Corporation (DFC).
DEC was created in 1959 to provide funds for the development of industry,
touri.-sm and housing.  It operated witlh onl, modest success due to Lilited
capital and insUfficient long-terr, resources.  I,hren, in 1967/68, a nu.ber
oF larger borrowers could not meet their commitments, the volume of lending
declined.  The Covernment decided to reorganize the institution ancl rename
it the Jamaica Development Bank.  JDB took< over most of the assets of DFC.
Tle major chaniges were: (a) an increase in autlhorized capital by J$ 6
million (to J$ 10 million) of which the Government would subscribe J$ 2
million and the Central Bank J$ 4 million; (b) the take-over by Government
of five large loans that were in arrears; (c) the inclusion of agriculture
as a new avenue of lending; and (d) a change in management.
Poli ci es
2.        Under the Act, the JDB may engage in lending for: (a) industrial
enterprises; (b) tourist industry enterprises; (c) housing enterprises;
(d) agriculture development enterprises; and (e) other development enter-
prises approved by the Mlinister of Finance. JDB's policy statement would
limit its fields of activitv to the financing of industrial, tourism and
commercial farming enterprises. 1-lousing loans would be gradually phased
out.
3.        The minimum individual loan would be J$ 20,000 with an upper
limit of 10% of JDB's net worth.  Participation in the equity of a single
enterprise would be linited to 20% of the issued share capital of the enter-
prise and the maximum aggregate equity holdings of JDB would not exceed 100%
of JD)1E's net worth.  JDB would not ordinarily finance, with all forr.s of as-
sistance, more than 50% of the total assets of an enterprise but this
percentage might be increased in special circumstances where development
priorities are high and where the financial condition and prospects of
the borrower would warrant a higher percentage financing by JDB.
4.        During the period of the Bank loan, JDB would not exceed its
debt equity ratio of 3:1 without prior approval of the Bank. An agreed
Policy Statement, which would not be altered without the Bank's prior
approval, is at Appendix 6-5. However, an additional provision is required,
namely that JDI3's maximum participation in any single enterprise (including
loans, equity and guarantees) should not exceed 25% of JDB's net worth.



ANIIEX 6

Organization and Management
5.        JDB's Board of Management, nominated by the Minister of Finance,
consists of 11 members including the Chairman, the General 'Manager and
representatives of the Central Bank and Ministrv of Finance. Directors are
appointed for a three to five-year term subject only to removal by the
Minister of Finance or the unanimous votes of all other members. The present
Board represents a fairly diversified cross section of private sector and
civil service interests.  The Chairman and all members of the DFC Board
became members of JDB's Board and four new members, including the new General
,IManager, were added.
6.        JDB's General Manager was previously witlh the Mkinistry of Finance
and Central Bank. In order to supplement his experience in credit banking,
he has employed an advisor for one year from April 1970. The advisor is a
very experienced, retired Assistant General Manager of the Industrial Devel-
opment Bank of Canada who was also Financial Advisor to the ,'alaysian
Industrial Development Finance Corporation. Good use is being made of the
advisor's services in helping to improve organization, financial planning
and control procedures. The Deputy General Manager resigned recently. but
a competent and qualified individual has been selected to replace him.
7.        JDB has a staff of 19 professionals but although many are academi-
cally well qualified, there is a lack of long-term financing experience at
thlis level. The Project staff presently consists of four - one officer each
for industry, tourism and agriculture plus the general economist. To insure
the success of the Agricultural Credit Project, a new Agricultural Credit
Section will be established consisting of a Chief who will be an experienced
agriculturist, an expatriate agricultural economist with an extensive banking
experience, an expatriate livestock expert, an agronomist, a counterpart to
thie expatriate agricultural economist, an assistant livestocl; officer, an
agriculture supervisor, and other clerical and secretarial assistants as may
be necessary.  Additional staff will be recruited for the other Project
livisions and for the Accounting Section.
S.        JDB inherited DFC's overseas branches in London, Toronto and -New
York. The cost of maintaining tlhese offices - 25,' of JDB's total adminis-
trative expenses - is not justified in terms of tile volume of business
generated and they will be closed during 1970/71.  This would improve JDB's
profitability position.
Resources
9.        Besides its capital (whlich should amount to J$ 10 million by
1974), JDBs resources derive from borrowings from Government, banks and
other financial institutions.  By law, its total liabilities must not
exceed seven times the amount of paid-up capital and rcserves. It may
issue debentures or bonds for the purpose of exercising its borrowing
powers. As of December 31, 1969, borrowings outstanding amounted to J$ 9
million (US$10.8 million).  Additional borrowings amounting to about USQ
10.8 million equivalent have been negotiated.

Use of ½esources
1.       To date, JT'T3's resources (including those inherited from DFC)
have been used. for granting loans from, and equitv investment in, industry,
tourism and housing. As of December 31, ln69, loans outstanding for
t'iese purposes amounted to JS 13 million (USS15.6 million) including loans
arotunting to J$ 4 million to two vwholly-owned subsiliaries.  Shareholding
in companies amounted to J$ 1.5 million (US$1.8 million) which included
Je 1.25 million (USel.5 million) in one wholly-owned subsidiary, tlle
llotel Corporation of Jamaica Ltd., which owns the Jamaica Hilton Hotel.
Fiiancial Position
Loan Portfolio
11.       Appendix 6-2 shows balance sheets for JDB as of September 30, 1969
antd December 31, 1069.  Then the loan portfolio was taken over from DFC, five
loans amounting to J$ 1.2 million (US$1.4 million) were excluded from the
transfer since they were considered high rislk loans made mainly for social
reasons which should, therefore, be the responsibility of the Government.
As at June 30, 1970, arrears (excluding those in respect of subsidiary
conpanies - see paras 12 and 13) amounted to J$ 226,000 (U,S$271,000) in
respect of principal and J$ 29,000 (US$34,000) in respect of interest. A
review of the portfolio and the individual loans in arrears indicates that
there are serious risks attached to three of these loans which amount to
Jh 41fn,000 (JS492,000). Not all of this anount would be lost since a
part of it is well secured. The loss under the most unfavorable circumstances
is estimated at J$ 200,0o0 (US$240,000). TThen JDB took over the loans from
DFC, a reserve against losses of J$ 8no0,on (I'S$l million) was created and
still exists.
Subsidiary Companies
Jamaica Ceramics
12.       The shares of Janaica Ceramics were taken over by JDB at zero
booK value in view of the continuing losses sustained by the company.
A,s at June 30; 1970, loans outstanding to this company amounted to some
J$ 1 million (US$1.2 million) all of wlicih were overdue.  Negotiations have
been concluded withi an international company for the reorganization of
Jamaica Ceramics.  Under thle apreement, wvhich should become effective on
'ovember 1, 1970, the international company would provide additional equity
and expert management. It is anticipated thiat, in the long term, no loss
would be incurred.
13.       Hotel Corporation of Jamaica Ltd. This company owns the Jamaica
HTilton llotel. The shares were transferred to JDB using as a basis of
valuation the equivalent cost of building a hotel of similar standing
(1$ 13,020 per room).  This gave JDB's J3  200 participation (100 ordinary
slhares at J3  2 each), a valuation, and lhence a capital profit of J$ 1.25



ANNEX 6
Page 4
million. As at June 30, 1970, loans outstanding amounted to J$ 3.2 million
(US$3.8 million) of which some J$ 265,n0 were overdue.  The hotel is
leased to the }lilton Company on a 20-year lease and JDB receives two-thirds
of the gross operating profit as a rental payment. This is applied against
the reduction of the loans.  A recenit addition of 90 rooms should male thie
enterprise more profitable and a five-year projection for 1971-75 indicates
that JDB should receive annually, on average, about J' 530,000.  Assuming
that this rate of profitability continues, it would be sufficient to
service the loan over 10 years at the interest rates of S-11/2  per annum.
The investment in this company represents about 25, of JDB's total balance
sheet. JDB realizes that this is excessive and will endeavor to dispose of
part of its interest in the company.
Reserves
14.       At present, JDB has a reserve against losses of J$ 800,000
(TUS$1 million) plus capital reserves of J$ 1.2 million (US$ 1.4 million).
Under the law, JDB is required to transfer to a reserve fund a minimum of
25% of its net profits until such reserves shall amount to a sum equal to its
paid-up capital. The present reserves appear adequate to meet foreseeable
losses.
Future Earnings
15.       For the period September 3 to December 31, 1969, JDB incurred a
loss of J$ 11,000. Costs would appear high but have been inflated by non-
recurring costs of the transfer from DFC, the building up of adequate staff
and the continuance of the three overseas branches inherited from DFC.
These branches would be closed during 1970/71 and would materially assist
in reducing JDB's operating expenses. Income projections for five years
(Appendix 6-3) indicate that in 1971 JDB should make a profit of J$ 60,00f
(US$83,000) rising to about J$ 1.3 million (US$1.6 million) by 1975.
The latter figure would represent a rate of return of 137 on a share capital
of J$ 10 million.
16.       The present loan portfolio has an average interest rate of albout
8% and mainly reflects DFC's lending wlhen interest rates for individual
loans ranged from 6 to 10-1/2% depending on creditworthiness and source of
finance. The percentage return on assets is lowered by the low income to
date from equity investments. In future, a standard interest rate of 9-1/2%
per annum would be applied to new industrial and tourism loans. The interest
rate for agricultural loans would be 8-3/4% per annum and this would be
sufficient to meet the expenses of the Agricultural Credit Section and allow
a small profit margin (see Appendix 6-3).
17.       Given the strengthening envisaged for the Agricultural Credit
Section and the overall policies adopted, JDB should prove a sound borroxuer
for the proposed loan.

Accounts and Auditing
I18.      JDB's accounting system is presently being examined by the Jamaican
office of M'essrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co. and will require reorganization
in the light of JDB's anticipated expansion. Additional trained staff is
being recruited.  Tle accounts are audited by an independent firm of auditors
(Oessrs. Price, W4aterhouse and Co.) and under the direction of Minister of
Finance, the Auditor General may also examine the accounts. Audited
accounts together with a copy of audited reports must be submitted to the
Minister of Finance. The law requires that transactions relating to the
var;iOus divisions of the bank shall be kept separate and shall be dealt
xwftlh separately in the annual accounts and reports.

(i) Industrial Enterprises;
(ii) Tourist Enterprises;
(iii) Agricultural Enterprises operating on a commercial
basis.
2.        To  qualifv for the Bank's assistance, an enterprise should be
financially viable and its projected operations should be consistent with
the national economic development priorities.
3.        The BanI. will seek to encourage Jamaican ownership and control
of enterprises and will seek to foster the development of the local capital
narl.et tlhrouglh its various activities.
B.        Form of Assistance
4.        The Banl will make its financing available to enterprises by means
of:
(i) loans;
(ii) equity investments;
(iii) guarantees;
(iv) underwriting of security issues; and
(v) issuing of debentures, convertible debentures, preference
shares, ordinary shares and other similar appropriate means.
C.         Size of Commitment
5.         (i)  The minimum size of loans made by the Bank will be J$ 10,000

Appendix 6-5
Page 2
(ii)  The maximum loan to any single enterprise sihould ordinarily
not exceed 10% of thle Bank's net worth, i.e. paid up equity
plus free reserves;
(iii) The Bank should normally limit its participation in thc
equity of a single enterprise to a maximum of 21% of the
issued share capital of the enterprise;
(iv)  The equity holdings of the Bank should not at any time
exceed 100% of the Bank's net worth; and
(v)  The maximum financial Darticipation in any single enter-
prise (including both loans and equity holdings) should
not exceed 25% of the Bank's net worth.
D.        Percentage of Enterprise to be Financed
6.        The Bank should ordinarily not finance, with all forms of assist-
ance, more than 50% of the total assets of an enterprise. A higher percentage
should be financed only in special circumstances, where development priori-
ties are high and where the financial conditions and prospects of the
client, as well as his financial commitments, justify it.
E.        Security
7.        The Bank should seek to obtain adequate security on loans made,
while being satisfied with the viability of the project and the earnings
potential of the enterprise.
F.        General Lending Principles
8.        (i)  The Bank will aim at financing only sound projects which
on the basis of careful study are considered to be financially
viable and would be backed with satisfactory technical
and administrative management;
(ii)  The Bank will seek to avoid taking a management control
of any enterprise which it finances. W4here, in exceptional
circumstances, such action may be required to protect the
Bank's interests, the Bank will seek to divest itself of
its management control wqhenever appropriate arrangements
can be made;
(iii)  The period of repayment on loans made by tlhe Bank should
be related to the anticipated economic life of the asset
financed and a careful assessment of the repayment capacity
of the enterprise;
(iv) The Bank will not lend to projects which are of a
speculative nature;



ANNEX 6
Appendix 6-5
Page 3
(v) The Bank will refinance only in special circumstances; and
(vi) As a general rule, the Bank should not make loans for working
capital. In deserving circumstances, however, it might be
necessary for the Bank to assist a company which would experi-
ence difficulty in providing working capital.
C.        Financial Policy
(i)  The Bank.'s interest rate and other fees should be fixed from
time to time in the light of current market rates but the
rate of interest and other fees charged on any particular
loan should be fixed for that loan. The Bank will set a rea-
sonable margin over the cost of borrowing in order to cover
its administrative expenses, and to build up its reserves and
surpluses;
(ii) The Bank shall ensure that the total of its medium- and
long-ternm debt outstanding does not exceed three times the
total of its share capital plus free reserves;
(iii) The Bank will not undertake any foreign exchange risic in res-
pect of loans made from its foreign exchange resources;
(iv) The Bank will not declare dividends until its reserves have
accumulated up to the level of its paid up capital; and
(v) The Ban. will endeavor to revolve its equity portfolio.
