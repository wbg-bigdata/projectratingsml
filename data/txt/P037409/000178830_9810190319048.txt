INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMME2NDATION OF TnE PRESIDENT
TO TEHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 0N A
PROPOSED LOAN TO TIIE STATE OF ISRAEL FOR A SECOND
HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the State of Israel in an anmount in various currencies equivalent to
US$30 million for a highway construction project. The proposed loan would
be for a 20-year term including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4%.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the second for Ihighways in Israel.  The
first, made in October 1962, provided US$22 million for construction of main
and district roads and a transport survey. It was satisfactorily completed
in 1966.
3.        Bank missions visited Israel in November 1969 and August 1970 and
identified a number of high priority road projects which appeared suitable
,for Bank financing. Following the completion of feasibility studies, the
vGovernment prepared a program which was appraised by a Bank mission in
pecember 1970. Negotiations took place in Washington in April 1971. Tlhe
Povernment was represented by a cdelegation headed by Mr. Ze'ev Sher, Deputy
Attorney General.
4.        The Bank has to date made seven loans to Israel; no IDA credits
have been made. A summary statement of these loans as of Mlay 31, 1971 is
attached as Annex I. There have been no IFC operations in Israel.
5.        Implementation of the projects financed under previous loans has
been satisfactory. The loan for agricultural credit (No. 709-IS) became
effective on January 21, 1971. Of Loan No. 689 to the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Israel made in June, 1970, 40 percent has been committed and
10 percent had been disbursed on May 31, 1971, slightly ahead of the pro-
jections prepared at the time of negotiations. A sewerage project is in a
preliminary stage of preparation.
PART II - TIEl ECONOMY
6.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Israel" was issued on July 22, 1969 (EMA-7b) and two updating memo-
randa (EMA-18a and EMA-28a) were distributed on March 20 and September 15,
1970. The next economic mission to Israel is scheduled in the second half
of this year. A country data sheet is at Annex II.

7.        Economic expansion continued at a fast pace during 1970 althouglh
the real rate of growth slowed down somewhat as the economy approached full
employment. GNP at constant prices increased by about 7 percent last year
compared to 9 percent in 1969 and almost 15 percent in 1968. Demand pres-
sure remained strong mainly because of rapidly rising defense expenditures
which in 1970 accounted for 59 percent of ordinary government spending and
about 26 percent of GNP.   Investment also rose fast while private consump-
tion was restrained by higher taxation, wage controls and credit restric-
tions. Total domestic demand at current prices increased by 19 percent or
almost three times as fast as real domestic output.
8.        The increasing gap between local demand and production put pressure
on prices and imports. Consumer prices, which had risen at an average of
only 2 percent during 1967-69, rose by 6 percent in 1970. Similar trends
could be observed for other price indices. At the same time, imports of goods
and services 'increased by 20 percent to a new record level of $2.6 billion
and augmented domestic production by about 50 percent. Export earnings, on
the other hand, increased by not more than 8 percent due mainfy to marketing t
difficulties of citrus and diamonds as well as to the buoyant internal demand}
which apparently diverted some resources from the export sector to domestic
uses. The result was a current account deficit in the balance of payments
of $1.26 billion in 1970 as against $0.92 billion in 1969 and $0.68 billion
in 1968.
9.        To cope with the situation, the Government made strong efforts to
maintain internal equilibrium, to stimulate exports, and to mobilize addi-
tional foreign resources for the financing of the growing external gap. Ad-
ditional taxes, compulsory savings, monetary restrictions and incomes controlts
aimed at containing domestic demand. Rebates of import duties for exporters
together with larger export subsidies have given additional incentives to ex-
port. Above all, however, the Government succeeded in raising large addition-
al foreign funds. Unilateral transfers from Jewish communities abroad and re-
stitution payments increased by $177 million to $636 million during 1970,
covering more than half the current account deficit. In addition, large con-
cessional loans were obtained mainly from the United States. Consequently,
the country's foreign reserves which had declined fast during 1968 and 1969,
recovered somewhiat in 1970 and early 1971.
10.       The large-scale foreign borrowing has led to a rapid increase of
Israel's external indebtedness. The total amount of medium-and long-term
debt reached the equivalent of $2.6 billion at the end of last year, com-
pared to $2 billion at the end of 1969. Debt service payments for 1970
were estimated at some $180 million, or about 13 percent of the country's
gross foreign exchange earnings. Because the growth in export earnings has
slowed down, the burden of debt service in 1971 is expected to be consider-
ably higher despite the concessional terms at which the bulk of new debt was
contracted. Hence, unless circumstances permit a substantial reduction in
defense outlays, Israel may have to curtail private consumption and invest-
ment and to slow down the rate of economic growth if it is to keep external
debt service within manageable limits.

PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Ilighway Construction Project-Israel"
(No. PTR-74). A Loan and Project Summary is at Annex III.
12.       The very high rate of economic growth achieved by Israel over the
past decade has been accompanied by even higher rates of growth in traffic.
Roads are the main mode of transport and carried more than 98 percent of
surface passenger transport and about 30 percent of the freight traffic in
1969.  The motor vehicle fleet has grown from 51,000 in 1960 to about
219,000 in 1970.   Israel has basically a good highway network, providing
all-weather access to almost all parts of the country. lhowever, sections
are congested and need additional capacity if they are not to become ob-
stacles to the expansion of production and exports. The main objective of
the 1971-75 highway program, which is based on a Bank-financed 1965 trans-
port survey and subsequent studies, is to provide the required additional
capacity.
13.       The road works included in the proposed project comprise about
63 percent of thie Government's 1971-1975 hiighway program.  None of them is
located in occupied territories. Military traffic constitutes an insignif-
icant fraction of total movement on the project roads and has not been taken
into account in estimating traffic on them. The largest single project item
is the first plhase of the Ayalon expressway, designed as a collector for
inter-urban traffic and a distributor for traffic thirough the main east-
west arteries of Tel-Aviv.   The other works, most of whichi are situated in
the densely inhabited central part of the country, have been selected to
eliminate bottlenecks,' reduce travel distances an(I permit faster travel
speeds.  The loan would also finance some additional equipment for the
Central Roads Laboratory of PVD for the testing of materials and soils,
as well as weighing devices for a proposed axle-load study and for the en-
forcement of regulations regarding vehicle weights.
14.       The total cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of
US$91.3 million, and its foreign exchange cost at US$37.5 million based on
the most likely distribution of construction and consultant's contracts be-
tween Israeli and foreign firms. The proposed loan of $30 million would
cover the foreign exchange cost of consulting services, the c.i.f. cost of
imported equipment, and most of the foreign exchange costs of the road con-
struction. The local expenditure costs and the balance of the foreign ex-
change costs of construction would be financed by Israel.
15.       The combined internal economic return on investment in all road
works contained in the project is 22 percent and for individual ones, the
return ranges from 14 percent to 33 percent. First year benefits range
from 10 to 25 percent, indicating that timing is appropriate.



-4-
16.       While responsibility for public transport policy is with the Min-
istry of Transport, wiich also assists local authorities to plan and finance
arterial road improvements in urban areas, the Public Works Department (PWD)
of the Ministry of Labor has under its charge the planning ancd construction
of inter-urban highways.   The PW) is competent and will execute all the proj-
ect workcs except the Ayalon expressway in Tel-Aviv. A special authority
(The Netivey Ayalon Company Ltd.) has beeti created, under the control of the
Government, to plan, construct, and maintain the Expressway.    Consultants
will be employed by both PWD and the Netivey Ayalon to assist in the super-
vision of construction. Assurances hiave been obtained from the Borrower tlhat
these agencies will be adequately staffed to ensure the execution and super-
vision of the Project.
17.       Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. Under the first Bank Highway Project in 1962, foreign con-
tractors showed no interest in submitting bids. As the local contracting
industry was not at that time well developed, the Bank agreed to force-
account work with sub-contracting to local contractors. Since that time,
local contractors lhave gained experience and capacity to undertake large
highway construction projects and foreign contractors have become interested
in bidding for contracts in Israel. During the preparation and negotiation
of the project the Government indicated its willingness to take advantage of
this increased interest of foreign and local private contracLors, and six
foreign and eight local construction firms hiave already been prequalified to
bid on the proposed project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AN4D AUTHIORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the State of Israel,
the Report of the Committee provicded for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
agreement generally follows the pattern of those for recent highiway loans.
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would com1ply witlh the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the BPank.
PART V - RECONThENfI)ATION
20.       I recommend that the ExecuLtive Directors approve the proposed loan.
