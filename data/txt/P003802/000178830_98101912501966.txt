1. DEVELOPMENT AND HIGH-LEVEL MANPOWER
Development and High-Level Manpower Constraints
1.01      Indonesia's development can be characterized by an imbalance between
the growth of the economy and the development of human resources. The economy
has maintained a rapid rate of growth in recent years, with an annual increase
in real GDP averaging about 8% between 1971 and 1977. There has been a
correspondingly high rate of increase in employment, which grew at over 4%
p.a. from 40 million in 1971 to 50 million in 1977.  However, this growth of
the economy and employment has not been accompanied by an equally rapid
improvement in human resources, posing a constraint to national development.
1.02      While workers with primary education or less are abundant in
Indonesia, only 9.3% of the labor force have achieved secondary education, and
an even smaller 0.7% of the total labor force have attained higher education.
The skill structure of Indonesia in 1976, as measured by education level, lags
behind that of some other East Asian countries as shown below:

1.03      The comparatively slow formation of high-level manpower in
technical, scientific and managerial fields, in particular, has become a
severe constraint on Indonesia-s development activities. The acute shortage
of manpower in these fields, coupled with the fact that remuneration in the
private sector is far more attractive than in the public sector, has hampered
the efforts to staff government agencies and educational institutions. For
example, in 1979, about one-third of the technical positions in the Department
of Public Works had to be filled by underqualified technicians who needed an



-2-
extensive period of on-the-job training. Universities find it difficult to
recruit staff; the engineering faculty of the University of Indonesia has to
depend upon part-time staff for 80% of its needs. In addition, Indonesia has
had to depend heavily upon foreign technical assistance for formulation and
execution of development projects. The financing of specialist services
accounted for about 10% of the total base project costs of recent World
Bank-assisted agriculture and transportation projects./l  This is higher than
the technical assistance provided for development projects in some other East
Asian countries./2
Projected Needs for High-Level Manpower
1.04      Development of Technical/Scientific/Managerial Manpower.  An
important component of Indonesia's development strategy is to improve the
supply of trained human resources. Priority areas for high-level manpower are
in the technical/scientific/managerial fields related to the development of
the productive sector (i.e., in engineering, science, agriculture, and
management), as well as in the social sector in the education and health
fields.
1.05      Recent growth patterns in output of Indonesia's economy are shown
below (Table 1.2). There has been a marked increase in the share of mining
and industry and a decline in the share of agriculture.  This pattern holds
also for employment, although at smaller magnitudes of changes, with the
exception of mining whose share in employment remained constant. The share of
services in output remained constant, although its relative share in
employment grew. Inferences of importance to the education sector can be made
from these growth patterns. First, the absorption of labor in the mining
sector is slow due to the application of capital intensive technology. Such
technology presupposes a supply of highly trained technical personnel.
Second, relatively higher productivity of labor in industry, coupled with a
higher projected growth rate of industrial output (Table 1.3) means a rapid
rise in demand for workers with higher technical skills. Third, large
accumulations of financial resources over a short period of time, primarily
from petroleum sales abroad, have increased the need for high-level manpower
able to manage large resources. Fourth, although improved productivity in
/1 The share of technical assistance in agriculture, transportation and
water supply projects approved during 1979 and 1980 ranged from 5% to
26%, with the median at about 10%.
/2 For example, the share of technical assistance in sampled agriculture,
transportation and public utilities projects approved during 1977 and
1980 ranged in the Philippines from 0.3% to 6.5% with the median at
about 5%; in Malaysia from 1.1% to 7.4% with the median at around 2%;
and in Thailand from 4.2% to 10.2% with the median at about 7%.

agriculture can meet the dual development criteria of growth and equity,
traditional agriculture faces diminishing returns to labor input unless
accompanied by other inputs, including skilled and innovative high-level
agriculturalists.

1.06      Required Level of Technical/Scientific/Managerial Manpower.  The
required future level of manpower may be projected on the assumption that the
proportion of an occupation in a given sector is a function of productivity
change envisaged in that sector. The productivity in turn depends upon a set
of assumptions on changes in output and employment. Output projections
available at present indicate that Indonesia's economy will grow at an annual
average rate of about 7% until the middle of the 1980s. Considering the low



- 4 -
rate of open unemployment (2% to 3%) and the current level of the labor
force participation rate (about 55%), it is assumed that employment will
increase at an annual average rate of 3%, which is higher than the projected
growth rate of the labor force (2% p.a.) but lower than the historical growth
rate of employment (4.7%, Table 1.2). By extending these growth rates to
1990, output, employment and productivity in 1990 are calculated to be as
follows:

This represents an increase in the occupational coefficients for high-level
manpower from 1979 to 1990, of 0.00062 to 0.00094 in engineering, 0.00017 to
0.00029 in science, and 0.00023 to 0.00037 in accountancy and economics.
1.08      At present, the Government estimates that practicing engineers,
scientists, agriculturalists, economists and accountants are 15,000, 5,000,
8,000, 5,000 and 1,600, respectively. The annual additional needs for
high-level manpower in these fields for the 1980-90 period can be calculated
as below by applying the above coefficients (Table 1.4) to sectoral employment
projected for 1990 (Table 1.3), and assuming an annual average rate of
attrition at 3%:

The above projections indicate that for the next decade Indonesia would
require an annual average increment of about 5,500 engineers, 1,900
scientists, 2,200 agriculturalists, 900 accountants and 1,300 economists.
These requirements significantly exceed the present university output, by 73%
in engineering, 74% in science, 61% in agriculture, 78% in accountancy and 77%
in economics, indicating the need for increasing the capacity of the
university system -to produce a greater number of graduates in those fields.
2. ISSUES IN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
Overview
2.01      Since 1950, Indonesia's university education has expanded rapidly.
Enrollment has increased by more than 20 times to over 250,000 and the number
of public institutions has risen from only 2 in Java to 30,/l distributed
throughout Indonesia, while 70 new private institutions /2 have been estab-
lished.  Despite this expansion, university education suffers from problems of
/1 Excludes 11 teacher training colleges.
/2 Excludes 37 teacher training colleges, 195 academies and 62 technical
schools.



-7-
of insufficient output, poor quality and inadequate management. With these
problems, the existing university education system can meet only about
one-fourth of the high-level manpower needs for national development in the
1980s in the fields of engineering, science and economics, and about
two-thirds in agriculture.
Basic Features of University Education
2.02      Administration.  Overall authority for education, including higher
education, rests with the Ministry of Education and Culture. The Directorate
General of Higher Education (DGHE, Chart 1) within the Ministry, has direct
control over the 41 public higher education institutions. DGHE, through its
coordinator for private higher institutions, administers over 350 private
institutions but an unknown number of others are not registered and operate
without Government supervision. The Director General for Higher Education is
the chief administrator of higher education. In carrying out his executive
functions, he works through the DGHE, while in planning he is assisted by:
(a) standing advisory staff consisting of experts on secondment from universi-
ties; (b) ad hoc committees on basic issues; and (c) a board consisting of the
executive secretaries of 11 academic disciplines consortia./l
2.03      Structure.  Higher education in Indonesia is given by four main
types of institutions: (a) universities with several semiautonomous faculties;
(b) institutes with a number of faculties in a single professional field; (c)
teacher training colleges (IKIPs); and (d) academies with a single faculty. A
principal degree (Sarjana) and an intermediate degree (Sarjana Muda) are
awarded upon completion of a five-year and three-year program respectively
(Chart 2). These degrees are given by the universities, institutes and IKIPs.
Diploma/certificate level courses of two to three years' duration are given by
the academies /2 and, on a limited basis, by the universities.
2.04      Dimensions of the University System./3  In 1978 some 250,000 total
students, nearly 2% of the 19-25 age cohort, were enrolled in universities and
/1 Consortium for education, social sciences and humanities, medical
sciences, engineering, mathematics and natural sciences, law, economics,
agricultural sciences, literature, psychology, interdisciplinary
*             studies.  These consortia are composed of representatives from both
public and private institutions of higher education. They are
responsible for preparing minimum curriculum for their discipline, which
is reviewed and upgraded every two to three years.
/2 The seven existing public academies will be consolidated into one
university in 1980 and are considered as such in this report.
/3 The term "university system" as used in this report denotes universities
and institutes only (para. 2.03).



institutes giving Sarjana and Sarjana Muda degrees. Of these, about 150,000
students were enrolled in 30 public institutions and the remaining 100,000
students were enrolled in the 70 private institutions (Table 2.1). Of the
total enrollment in the public university system, 75,000 students were
enrolled in the disciplines of engineering, science, agriculture and economics
combined. In 1978, graduates in these fields together accounted for about 60%
of total output./I

2.05      Engineering Education.  The enrollment in institutions giving
engineering degree courses has grown from 16,500 students in 1973 to 24,500
in 1978 (about 8% p.a.) and their Sarjana graduates have increased from 600
to 1,400 over the same period. The demand for such courses is high: in 1978,
39,000 students applied and 5,000 (13%) were accepted into the engineering
faculties at these institutions. The four institutions with the largest
engineering faculties are the Institutes of Technology, Bandung and Surabaya,
and the Universities of Gadjah Mada and Indonesia.
L  In 1978 private institutions produced about 300 in engineering, science,
agriculture and economics, accounting for only 7% of the total output in
these fields.



2.06      Science Education.  The 11 universities/institutes with science
faculties give degree programs in biological, geological and physical science
and also perform the service function of giving courses in basic science to
other science-based faculties such as engineering and agriculture. The total
enrollment in science degree programs increased by about 7% in two years, from
6,900 in 1976 to 7,400 in 1978. Total graduates increased over 30% from the
year before to 450 in 1979. There were 10,300 applicants for science degree
programs in 1978, of whom only 1,700 (17%) were accepted.  The Universities of
Gadjah Mada, Padjadjaran, North Sumatra, Indonesia and Andalas, and the
Institutes of Technology, Bandung and Surabaya, are the institutions with
largest science degree programs.
2.07      Agriculture Education.  The degree programs in agricultural science,
given by 27 institutions comprise 7 major areas: crop production, veterinary
medicine, animal husbandry, forestry, fisheries, agricultural engineering and
food technology. Enrollment expanded rapidly at 12% p.a. from 11,400 in 1973
to 20,100 in 1978, and Sarjana degree graduates grew from 1,100 in 1976 to
1,300 in 1978. There were 24,700 applicants for agricultural science programs
in 1978 and 4,900 (20%) were accepted. The University of Gadjah Mada has the
largest agricultural faculty, followed by the Institute of Pertanian, Bogor
and the Universities of Hasanuddin, Brawijaya, Padjadjaran, Andalas and North
Sumatra.
2.08      Economics Education.  The economics faculty at the 25 universities
with degree programs in economics consists of general economics and business
administration, and in some instances, accountancy. Students specialize in
one of the three fields after the third year. In 1978, only seven faculties
produced accountancy graduates at Sarjana level. Enrollment grew rapidly at
13% p.a. from 13,300 in 1973 to 23,500 in 1978. Of total enrollment in 1978,
12,700 students were enrolled in the first three years of the course and of
the remaining 10,800 students in the program, 2,000 were enrolled in general
economics, 7,000 in business administration, and 1,800 in accountancy. In
1978, there were 33,400 applicants to economics faculties, and 5,000 (15%)
were accepted. The University of Indonesia has the largest economics degree
program, followed by the Universities of Padjadjaran, Gadjah Hada, Hasanuddin,
North Sumatra, Airlangga and Andalas.
2.09      Financing.  Total expenditure on education in Indonesia has
increased rapidly during the recent past, from about 2% of GNP in 1969 to 3.5%
in 1976/77.  Of this, about 1% came from private sources and the rest was from
public sources, mainly the Central Government (11% of its budget). Of the
total Central Government educational funds in 1975/76, 69% was allocated to
primary, 21% to secondary and 10% to higher education. There has been a
rapid increase in the funds allocated to higher education: funds channelled
through the DGHE increased from Rp 16 billion in 1974 to Rp 60 billion in 1978
(an average rate of 66% p.a.). In the same period, the routine education
budget grew at an annual rate of 30% to Rp 32 billion, and the development
budget increased at an average rate of 55% p.a. to Rp 28 billion. Despite



- 10 -
this rapid growth, Indonesia's investment in higher education has been
comparatively small. This is evident when Indonesia's ratio of expenditure on
higher education to GNP is compared with that of other East Asian countries:

/a  Although the investment in higher education had grown rapidly since
1973, its share in GNP in 1976 remained at about the same level with
that in 1973 since GNP itself increased rapidly. The corresponding
share in Asian countries (excluding Japan) in 1976 was estimated at
0.62%.

Paper No. 246).
2.10      The recurrent cost per student for university education in Indonesia
is about US$350 per student. This is lower than the average unit cost per
student in Asian countries./I To partly compensate for the low recurrent
allocation, tuition fees averaging about US$130 per year are charged by the
universities/institutes, amounting to over one third of per capita income.
Issues in University Education
Low Level of Output
2.11      A major issue in university education in Indonesia is the inability
of the system to produce sufficient output of trained manpower needed to carry
out development programs. Present university education has not kept pace with
the expanding need and can meet only about one fourth of projected manpower
/1  In 1976, public recurrent expenditure per student in higher education
institutions in Asian countries averaged US$560, according to a UNESCO
source, The Allocation of Resources to Education throughout the World
(1980).

needs in engineering, science and economics/accountancy and about two-
thirds of the needs in agriculture (para. 1.08). This low level of output
is chiefly due to internal inefficiency. The internal productivity of
Indonesia's university system (ratio of degree level output to total
enrollment) /1 is only 5% while, in a perfectly efficient fig_a-year program
of study, productivity is 20% when intake is constant, 18% when intake is
annually increased by 5%, and 16% when the annual increase in intake is 10%.
2.12      The low productivity of Indonesia's system is attributed to high
rates of failure (in some instances about 50% of first year students fail in
final examinations) and dropout (about 80% of a cohort). For instance, the
proportion of the cohort of students that entered the University of Andalas
in 1969 and graduated by 1979 was only 11% in economics, 17% in science, and
35% in agriculture. Similarly, the proportion of students that entered the
University of Gadjah Mada in 1968 and graduated in 1978 was only 18% in
biology, 25% in engineering and 21% in geography.
2.13      Enrollment and output data in Table 2.3 show that internal produc-
tivity is low in all fields of specializations. If productivity were
increased to an average of 12-15%, output could be nearly doubled in science,
engineering, and agriculture and tripled in economics without increasing
enrollment. The situation, however, varies significantly across universities
and faculties and over time. Although the average productivity of engineering
degree programs is low, some faculties have made considerable improvements.
The Institute of Technology, Bandung reports that its productivity ratio has
risen from 5.6% to 7.1% between 1973 and 1978, and that the average student
now takes 5.5 to 6 years to complete the Sarjana program which ideally takes
4.5 to 5 years. The Institute of Technology, Surabaya, has reportedly also
reduced its dropout rate from 70% to 30% and its productivity ratio has risen
from 1.6% to 8.3% between 1973 and 1978. These improvements were accomplished
through a combination of instituting a credit system of course requirements
(para. 2.20) and an intensive staff development and visiting professor
program.
/1 Efficiency in student flow is best described by an input/output which
represents a ratio of student-years spent per graduate to the normal or
prescribed duration of the program. In the absence of data on repetition,
progression and dropout rates to calculate the above index, a crude
measure of internal productivity is used.

The increase in productivity of the faculties of engineering, science,
economics and agriculture at the Universities of Indonesia (UI), Gadjah Mada
(UGM) and Andalas (UNAND) has been considerable between 1973 and 1978 (Table

2.14      The low internal efficiency of the university system is attributed
to various factors, including insufficient time devoted by staff to teaching,
poor quality of staff, the inadequacy and poor planning of physical facili-
ties, inappropriate promotion and graduation policies, and the socioeconomic
status of students.
2.15      Teaching Staff.  There are two staff-related causes for the high
rates of failure and dropout, and for the long time it takes for students to
graduate: insufficient instruction time, and poor quality instruction.
Although the ratio of full-time staff to students is good, at 1:12
(Table 2.3), that measurement is deceiving because full-time staff do not
spend enough time teaching or tutoring students. Of the assigned weekly
teaching load of 9-12 hours on average, only 3-6 hours may be devoted to
actual instruction. This is largely due to inadequate university salaries
compelling most of the faculty members to hold other jobs. Staff sometimes
take time off from work, without permission or penalty to attend to their jobs
or they neglect the routine teaching duties in favor of "project" duties which
attract additional payment. It is, therefore, not uncommon that when students
are ready to write their theses, the department chairman will not find enough
faculty members to supervise them. Those that do supervise a thesis may take
5 to 6 months to read a proposal or chapter because of their other
commitments. As a result, students take one to two years to complete the
thesis requirement that should only take six months.
2.16      The high rate of failure (90% in some courses) is also caused by the
poor quality of instruction. Much of this can be attributed to the low
academic and professional qualifications of faculty members (para. 2.23). For
example, less than 3% of staff in public universities hold Ph.D. degrees./l
In order to ameliorate these staff-related causes of inefficiency, policy
measures should be developed to set minimum standards of teacher work load and
teacher qualifications. In addition, steps need to be taken to improve staff
quality.
2.17      Physical Facilities.  Physical facilities of most universities are
inadequate due to the lack of investment, poorly planned due to the absence
of campus master planning, and poorly scheduled due to the lack of class
scheduling. These problems constitute a constraint to improving internal
efficiency of the university education system. Specialized facilities, even
when used beyond planned capacity, are not sufficient to accommodate all
students enrolled in a particular year. Consequently, some students have to
wait for another year to be accommodated in the course. For lack of
facilities, certain faculties are forced to use existing, but inconvenient,
facilities elsewhere. For example, civil engineering students at the
University of Indonesia have to take practical laboratory work at the
Institute of Technology at Bandung, about 190 km from Jakarta. The Economics
Faculty of the University of Gadjah Mada is using facilities of the university
administration. The Science Faculty of the University of Andalas is situated
within the campus of IKIP-Padang, occupying temporary buildings with
inadequate space for teaching and laboratory work.
/1 The correlation between productivity and proportion of faculty with Ph.D.
(based on Table 2.3) is positive (r = 0.48).



- 14 -
2.18      There is also a problem of overcrowding and underutilization due to
poor campus planning and class scheduling. Facilities have not been laid out
according to a campus master plan. Consequently, sharing of facilities
between departments and service teaching are greatly curtailed. Many rooms
and laboratories were built too small to accommodate enough students to allow
for an efficient student:teacher ratio. Poor class scheduling has led to
underutilization of existing facilities.  Lecture rooms may be used only in
the morning and laboratories only in the afternoon. Because many teaching
staff are part-time and have their regular jobs in the morning, a large
proportion of instruction takes place in the afternoon, leaving many
facilities idle in the morning. The Faculties of Science and Engineering at
the University of Gadjah Mada have reported that more than 55% of the lecture
rooms and 70% of the laboratories are used less than half the available time.
In order to improve student flow and output, there is, therefore, a need to
provide adequate facilities to accommodate students and, at the same time, to
use more rigorous planning and scheduling to improve the utilization and
sharing of existing and added facilities.
2.19      Promotion and Graduation Policies.  Students are promoted on the
basis of final semester examination results, and only in a few cases are there
intermediate examinations that give an early indication of students' progress.
If a student fails in part of a semester's program, the entire semester is
repeated.  Since there is no probation system or ceiling on the number of
times a student can repeat a course, students take an average of eight years
to complete the course requirement for a degree program. The major
bottleneck, however, appears to be the completion of a thesis required for
graduation. What would normally take about six months may take one to two
years because of shortages or unavailability of thesis supervisors or
inadequate facilities to carry out research projects on the basis of which a
thesis is written (para. 2.15). Table 2.5 shows the average time taken to
graduate for the 1978 graduating cohorts of the Universities of Indonesia
(UI), Gadjah Mada (IUGM) and Andalas (UNAND):

2.20      A credit system as is now being introduced (para. 2.33), will
gradually modify promotion and graduation practices. The replacement of the
thesis requirement by a set of courses or a short paper, as is being presently
tried in some universities (e.g., University of Andalas, the Institute of
Technology Bandung, and the Institute of Pertanian Bogor), will improve the
efficiency of student flow through the system.
2.21      Socioeconoic Factors.  Because of high opportunity cost of
foregone earnings, many students drop out of the education system before
reaching the higher-level, with the poorest of students not even completing
primary education. For those students that do reach the higher level, many
are forced to drop out totally or temprarily because of cost. As higher
education expands, it is likely to attract more students who cannot be
supported by their families. Of the parents of science students at the
University of Andalas, 20% are farmers and 14% retired persons, most of whom
face opportunity costs in terms of youths foregone earnings plus the expenses
to send them to universities. Since regular university tuition fees are
equivalent to about one-third of per capita income (para. 2.10), the burden to
a poor family could be substantial. In addition, unofficial student fees /1
of an unknown amount increase the cost per student. To help reduce these
burdens, it is necessary to increase financial aid to students and to consider
offering late afternoon and evening courses for working students. Shortening
the lenght of time it currently takes a student to graduate would also reduce
these burdens.
Poor Quality of University Inputs
2.22      The low efficiency in university education is closely linked with
weaknesses in the quality of inputs, reflected in underqualified staff,
inadequate instructional materials, and ineffective teaching methods.
2.23      Staff Qualifications.  The academic and professional qualifications
of university faculty staff are low. In 1978, there were 12,000 full-time
staff at public universities, of whom only 2.8% (340) were doctorate-degree
holders (Table 2.3). Among the four disciplines of engineering, science,
agriculture and economics, agriculture had the higher percentage of staff
with PH.Ds (6%). However, academic qualifications of staff vary according to
universities (Table 2.6). The Universities of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada,
which are major universities in Indonesia, had comparatively well-educated
staff in economics, while their staff in engineering and science were poorly
qualified. The qualifications of the staff of the University of Andalas are
/1 Teachers often charge students extra fees for normal services such as
admission, lecture notes and outside tutoring.



- 16 -
below the average of other universities and significantly lower than the staff
of the Universities of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada in the fields of science and
economics. Overall, the majority of staff teaching students in the Sarjana
program have, themselves, attained only the level of Sarjana degbee. Most are
also graduates from the universities where they teach. For example, about 90%
of the over 500 staff at the University of Andalas are graduates of Andalas.
Academic and educational qualifications of staff need to be improved so that
by 1990 at least 50% of the staff would hold degrees beyond Sarjana./I

(e.g., Universities of Singapore, Malaya, the Philippines and Chulalong-
korn) hold a minimum of master's degrees.

2.24      Instructional Materials.  There is serious inadequacy in the supply
of textbooks and other instructional materials in Indonesia which compounds
the weakness in the quality of education caused by poorly trained staff.
Although Bahasa Indonesia is the medium of teaching, there is a shortage of
basic textbooks in Bahasa Indonesia for most disciplines: in a list of about
200 reference texts for the minimum curriculum for the Faculty of Economics at
*       the University of Indonesia, less than 40 textbooks are in Bahasa Indonesia,
and these are mostly government reports. Library stocks of textbooks in any
language are also limited. The student/book ratio of major Indonesian
universities ranges from 1:8 (Gadjah Mada) to 1:15 (Indonesia).  In compari-
son, the University of Singapore has a ratio of about 1:100; the University of
Malaya, 1:60; and the University of the Philippines, 1:30. Individual study
and use of printed materials and library assignments to supplement classroom
work are, therefore, not a usual part of the learning process. To overcome
these problems, instructional materials should be developed with the first
priority given to printed materials in Bahasa Indonesia on subjects related to
high priority disciplines.
2.25      Teaching Methods.  The short supply of instructional materials and
laboratory facilities and equipment reinforces the already strong inclination
of teachers toward the lecture method and rote learning. The lecture method
can be effective when it brings together the results of wide, up-to-date
reading by a lecturer. However, as used by inexperienced and underqualified
staff, lectures tend to be dull expositions of textbooks. Oral presentations
are supplemented by brief lecture notes prepared by the teacher and sold to
the students to replace textbooks as the primary source of information.
Seminars, tutorial and other small-group teaching methods which allow discus-
sions are occasionally used in some disciplines but they are the exception
rather than the rule. To make the teaching/learning process more effective,
staff should be trained in more efficient teaching methods and equipped with
appropriate instructional materials.
Inadequate Capacity of Management
2.26      The problems of low output and poor quality are further intensi-
fied by inadequate management capacity at both central DGHE level (system
management) and local university level (institutional management).
2.27      System Management.  The Directorate General of Higher Education
(DGHE) is responsible for formulating policies, developing plans, coordinating
curriculum development and measuring the efficiency of execution of policies
and plans (para. 2.02). The effectiveness of the DGHE is, however, con-
strained by two problems: the absence of a permanent cadre of professional
staff, and the lack of monitoring/evaluation and management information
systems. First, management positions at DGHE are mainly filled on a temporary
basis with seconded university staff who are not experienced in management and
planning on a system level. Being both temporary and inexperienced, they



- 18 -
the implementation of its policies, measures and guidelines. Moreover,'there
is no management information system for the collection, analysis and distribu-
tion of comparative indicators (e.g., progression, dropout and repetition
rates) for all universities. Both a monitoring and evaluation system and a
management information system are needed to provide information for the
formulation and modification of policies. Improved planning and management,
through establishment of such systems, training and the appointment of
permanent staff would strengthen the DCHE's capacity to provide assistance to
universities in their academic and campus planning.
2.28      Institutional Management.   Many of the problems identified and
discussed earlier are management problems: e.g., the recruitment and deploy-
ment of staff, their training and effective supervision, and the efficient use
of facilities. The existing university management structure suffers from
three important weaknesses: limited skill and lack of continuity among
managers, poor coordination among faculties and subject departments, and
absence of systems to provide needed performance data. First, the rectors,
assistant rectors and deans who administer universities are generally seconded
from regular academic staff and hold office for a limited period. They are
expected to carry modified teaching loads in addition to their administrative
duties. Rectors and deans are changed every four and two years respectively,
and the continuity in administration is disrupted.  Such staff need training
in preparation for their duties and also need full-time, professional assist-
ance in order to function efficiently. This points to the need for a cadre of
permanent, professional managers who will provide a means of organizing and
managing university resources (e.g., teaching accommodations, examinations,
student records, personnel, physical facilities, management information) and
provide that element of continuity and consistency in the development and
implementation of university policy which is lacking at present. Second, the
excessive autonomy of faculties and subject departments has disadvantages in
terms of duplication of services, inconsistencies in academic and administra-
tive standards, and inefficient use of resources. This points to the need for
rationalization of services managed by a professional cadre. Finally,
universities lack management information systems to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of different policy measures and to feed information into a
central system at the DGHE level (para. 2.27).
Government Subsector Ob;iectives, Strategy and Programs
2.29      Obiectives.  The Government aims to develop universities as a sup-
portive element to national development by producing sufficient number of
well-educated graduates. Among disciplines the Government gives priority to
education/teaching, technology, basic sciences, management, agriculture
and health. In light of national development priorities, these are the
disciplines most needed for Indonesia's development.
2.30      To achieve the objective, the Government plans to:  (a) increase
internal productivity (i.e., increase the potential of available physical
and human resources to produce more graduates); (b) expand and improve



- 19 -
physical facilities and staff to accept more students; (c) improve student
services and welfare; and (d) strengthen the management and organization of
universities. A special emphasis of the Government is on the improvement of
productivity and management. This emphasis is reflected in the 1979/80
budget, of which 41% and 29% was allocated for productivity and management
improvement, respectively.
2.31      In terms of specific objectives, the Government plans to have a con-
tinued increase in the student population in higher education institutions
until 5% of the 19-25 age group are enrolled by the year 2000. This expansion
implies that the student population will increase at an average rate of 5% to
6% annually, with priority being given to development of the fields in which
high-level manpower is needed. This enrollment increase will be related to
plans to improve productivity: the Government's guidelines call for the
improvement of productivity by 10% p.a. at public universities. This will
cause the current level of productivity, 5% (graduates as % of total enroll-
ment), to rise to 10% by 1983/84. A public university with productivity
lower than 5-6% will not receive support to increase their intake. Instead,
such a university will be asked to make all efforts to increase productivity
without lowering the quality of education.
2.32      The Government has set the targets of the student population and
productivity (Sarjana level) to be reached by 1983/84 as below:
Table 2.7:  GOVERNMENT TARGET SHARES OF TOTAL ENROLLMENT,

Health                                5.5                 14.0          2,000

/a  Calculated assuming that enrollment in 1978 in each field will grow at

Source: DGHE.
Overall the rate of productivity (para. 2.13) is expected to double between
1978 and 1984. With this productivity, the output in 1984 will meet about
50% of average annual incremental needs for engineering and science manpower
and 90% of the same need for agricultural manpower.

2.33      Strategy.  As an important measure to improve internal efficiency,
the Government announced in July 1979 the gradual introduction of a credit
system of course requirements (Ministerial Decree No. 0124/U/1979). Under
the credit system, each course of study will consist of a set of required and
elective courses. A student who successfully completes a course will be
given educational credit for it, independent of his/her performance in other
courses, and will be eligible for graduation when he/she attains the number of
credits required for the degree or diploma.
2.34      Under the same decree the Government also introduced a new system of
educational stratification, consisting of four strata of diploma (So),
Sarjana (Sl), Pasca Sarjana (02) and Doctoral (S3) programs (Chart 2).
The number of credits needed to complete each of the four strata are 35-120
for So (the wide range reflects a variety of courses from one to three
years in duration); 140-160 for SI; S1 plus 60-80 for S2; and S2 plus
60-80 for S3.
2.35      The Government plans to provide all public institutions of higher
education with an opportunity to improve and expand their programs in a
sequence of steps: planning, preparation, implementation and evaluation. The
whole sequence will take about ten years - the planning stage, lasting one to
two years, will prepare academic and physical master plans; the preparatory
stage, lasting one to two years, will develop management and organization
frameworks, staff development programs and architectural planning. The
implementation stage and the evaluation stage will last five years and two
years, respectively. At present there are eight institutions which the
Government classifies as sufficiently advanced to pursue the development
objectives (paras. 2.29-2.30) in relation to Sl and/or S2 programs. They
are the Institutes of Technology, Bandung and Surabaya, the Institute of
Pertanian Bogor, and the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada, Airlangga,
Hasanuddin and Andalas. The Government has initiated development programs
with the major assistance of USAID and the Asian Development Bank (paras.
2.40-2.41) for all of these institutions except the Universities of
Indonesia, Gadjah Mada, and Andalas.
2.36      Programs.  The Government-s plans for university development
for the next five years include the initiation of programs to improve and
expand the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas at new campus sites, and
the University of Gadjah Mada at its present site.
2.37      The University of Indonesia (UI) in Jakarta is divided between two
campuses, about 5 km apart, occupying a total of only 41 ha. The separation
of the University into two campuses poses problems for interdisciplinary
study, which UI plans to promote. The campuses are overcrowded (e.g., 10
staff in a department have an office space of 20 sq m, although an area of
10 to 15 sq m per staff is the norm); no space is available for new programs
*such as environmental and rural development studies, or for practical work
in engineering and science. Some engineering students take courses at the
Institute of Technology, Bandung, 190 km from Jakarta, because needed prac-
tical facilities are not available at UI (para. 2.17). A new campus site of



- 21 -
300 ha has been acquired at Depok, 30 km south of Jakarta (toward Bogor). The
new campus site would be of adequate size to enable UI to increase its present
enrollment of over 10,000 to 20,000 by 1990 and to provide new programs and
needed practical facilities. The unification of the campus would facilitate
interdisciplinary study and rationalization of university management func-
tions. The new location is within commuting distance from Jakarta and staff
housing is already being constructed at the site by the Government.
2.38      The University of Andalas (UNAND) is spread over six campuses in and
outside Padang. Present facilities are not only insufficient (e.g., science
students take courses at a teacher training college in Padang), but none of
the six campus sites is large enough to develop a campus where various
programs of study can be coordinated. The Government is in the process of
acquiring 200 ha of land at Linau Manis, 14 km from Padang, to relocate UNAND.
The new site, to be developed under a campus master plan, will provide a
unified campus to promote better coordination among programs and more
efficient utilization of facilities as well as provide needed room for
expanding the present enrollment of 4,000 to 12,000 by 1990.
2.39      The University of Gadjah Mada (UGM) is located on a single campus
spread over 170 ha in Jogyakarta. Since the opening of the University in
1949, physical facilities have been added without overall university develop-
ment planning or campus master planning. The facilities of the science and
engineering faculties are overcrowded and need to be expanded. However, as
faculty buildings have been constructed close to each other, there is no room
to enlarge facilities. There are no facilities for the economics faculty
which presently conducts its courses in an administration building. The
University plans to bring central administrative services, which are
scattered, into one place. The University expects to grow from the present
enrollment of 15,000 to 20,000 by 1990. In view of these long-term develop-
ment plans, the Government intends to acquire an additional 10 ha of land
adjacent ot the present campus, help UGM with campus master planning, and
construct necessary additional buildings.
External Assistance to Higher Education
2.40      Assistance of Bilateral/Multilateral Agencies and Foundations.
Indonesia's higher education system has received aid from two principal orga-
nizations: USAID and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). USAID has provided
funds for advanced training for staff of higher education institutions in the
fields of science, technology and related social sciences. The Institute of
Technology, Bandung has been the main recipient of this aid but the staff of
selected faculties of other institutions have also been trained:  the
Universities of Andalas (science), Airlangga (management), and Indonesia (law,
campus planning) and the Institute of Pertanian Bogor (interdiscipline
programs). The bulk of USAID assistance, however, has been to higher
agricultural education, for staff and curriculum development. The University
of Gadjah Mada, Institute of Pertanian Bogor and University of Padjajaran have
been the major recipients of this aid.



- 22 -
2.41      The important assistance to higher education from ADB has been' to
two institutions: the Institute of Technology in Surabaya and the University
of Hasanuddin in Udjung Pandang (Sulawesi). This aid involves extensive
upgrading of f ilities and equipment and, in the case of Hasanuddin, reloca-
tion to a new campus. In addition, private nonprofit foundations have been
assisting higher education in Indonesia. The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations
are such organizations. They generally provide grants for technical assist-
ance and training.
2.42      World Bank Group Assistance.  Since 1971 the Bank Group has
supported national development in the education sector by extending financing
for specialized training to produce low- and middle-level manpower, improve-
ment in the quality of schooling, and expansion of education opportunities.
Bank Group lending initially financed three small projects, totaling US$24.2
million, that met evident educational and manpower needs, i.e., teacher
training, and secondary level technical and agricultural training. Subse-
quently four projects, totaling US$113.0 million, were identified on the basis
of a comprehensive Bank Sector Survey (Indonesia: Education Sector Survey
Report - Report No. 443a-IND, February 1975). These projects are helping to
meet educational and manpower needs for public administrators, primary and
secondary school teachers, and low and middle-level technical and agricultural
workers.
2.43      Further economic growth requires the development of higher education
in scientific, technical and managerial fields. A subsector study on higher
technical education (Higher Technical Education Subsector Survey - Report
No. 1837a-IND, January 1978) concluded that a priority area of education
investment should be higher technical education to ease an acute high-level
technical manpower shortage. A loan of US$49.0 million has been made, as a
first response to the survey, for assistance in establishing a new polytechnic
system in Indonesia. Following further recommendations of the study, the
Government prepared a project proposal with UNESCO assistance (Towards the
Consolidation of Higher Education in Indonesia, January 1976) for improvement
and expansion of university education in selected priority fields, i.e.,
engineering, science, agriculture and economics (including business adminis-
tration and accountancy). In view of the magnitude of Indonesia-s human
resource development problems, the Bank Group should continue its three-
pronged support to: (a) basic education spanning the first nine years of
schooling; (b) higher education to provide an adequate supply of manpower in
areas crucial to Indonesia's development; and (c) development of administra-
tion to improve the effectiveness of Government personnel charged with
implementation of development programs.
2.44      To date, two Project Performance Audit Reports have been prepared
on education projects in Indonesia. The first Project Performance Audit
Report (No. 2998, dated June 2, 1980, SecM80-440), reviews performance on
the First Education Project (Cr. 219-IND). This audit stresses the impor-
tance of including fellowships to train teachers and school administrators,



- 23 -
and the timely appointment of key staff to project implementation units to
ensure the success of the project. To address these findings, the proposed
project includes substantial fellowships and a provision to set up a
University Development Office (a project implementing task force) with the
early appointment of its key personnel. In addition, the university
development program would be assisted in phases, so that unforeseen
development at appraisal could be reflected at an later stage. This phased
approach reflects experience in other university development projects in the
Asia region, where implementation has averaged nine years and where complexity
of the task was underestimated. The second Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 3058, dated June 30, 1980, SecM80-527), reviews performance on the Second
Education Project (Cr. 288-IND), and describes the project as being success-
fully implemented. The major findings of the audit are: (a) the need for
more advanced project preparation; (b) the over-provision of technical
assistance; and (c) the shortage of staff housing and boarding facilities.
This project is addressing the first issue through a phased approach to
university development with this project being, in effect, a careful
preparatory planning phase. The establishment of criteria for fellowships
allocation and the preparation of terms of reference for technical assistance
should help avoid the second issue. The third issue is being addressed by the
Government and expects to be further reviewed at appraisal of Phase II.
3. THE PROJECT
Program Objectives and Strategy
3.01      The proposed project would be the first phase of the Government's
university development program designed to assist Indonesia's university
system in providing sufficient output and quality of high-level technical/
scientific/ managerial manpower needed for national economic growth (para.
1.08). To achieve this goal, the program would address the major issues of
university education - low output, poor quality of educational input and
inadequate management capacity (para. 2.01). Outlined below are the specific
objectives and corresponding measures of the proposed program which would help
resolve those issues:

Rationalize university administrative
organization and staffing.
3.02      In the first phase of the program, which would be financed by the
proposed project, the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas would
develop and experiment with policy measures, and implement staff and
management improvement components designed to increase output, quality and
management capacity. Further, these universities would complete academic,
organizational and physical master plans for their expansion. DGHE would also
be strengthened in its capacity to collect data and develop, monitor and
evaluate policy measures in order to manage universities as a system. In the
second phase of the program, policy and staff development measures developed
in the three universities would be adopted on a phased schedule throughout the
university system. Also, in the second phase, the physical facilities for the
selected faculties would be constructed and equipped for the Universities of
Indonesia and Andalas at their new campus sites and for Gadjah Mada at the
present campus site (paras. 2.37-2.39).



- 25 -
3.03      Implementation of the proposed project would last five and a half
years. A second phase project would overlap approximately two years with this
project and take about six years to complete. The second phase would expect
to start when:
(a)  the three universities have
- adopted adequate policies to improve efficiency and quality;
- awarded about half of proposed fellowships to improve staff
quality;
- finalized academic,/l organizational and campus master plans,
equipment lists, and building designs;
- established central administrative, monitoring/evaluation and
management information offices;
(b)  two of the three universities have:
c completed tender documents for building construction and
equipment procurement;
(c)  the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas have:
- initiated site development works; and
(d)  the DGHE has:
- prepared a plan for a reform of its organization, and a
schedule to implement the plan.
The Bank and the Government delegations agreed on the activities to be
completed before proceeding to the second phase project and on the schedule
for completing the activities.
Scope of the Project
3.04      The project would finance technical assistance (including
architectural and engineering services), equipment and civil works (initial
site development works only) to:
(a) increase university output in the four selected fields over short,
medium and long terms through (i) development of policies at the
three universities, and (ii) architectural and engineering
/1 An academic master plan of a university describes the growth and develop-
ment of each faculty in the university by discipline, enrollment and
staff.



- 26 -
preparation for expanded physical facilities of the Universities of
Indonesia and Andalas at new campuses and at the present campus of
the University of Gadjah Mada;
(b) improve the quality of university inputs in the four selected fields
through (i) raising educational qualifications of teaching staff at
the three universities, and (ii) increasing the relevance and
quantity of teaching materials; and
(c) strengthen the university system and institutional management
through (i) establishing monitoring/evaluation and information
systems, a university development office, and a management training
program, and (ii) rationalizing university administrative
organization and staffing.
Increasing Output (US$21.4 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.05      Policy Development.  To improve student flow and output over the
short term, change in promotion and graduation policies relating to course and
thesis requirements would be introduced in engineering, science, agriculture
and economics at the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas. The
Institute of Technology, Bandung and the Institute of Pertanian, Bogor, have
recently experimented with a credit system of course requirements and a thesis
with a fewer number of credits attached (paras. 2.13, 2.20). Their experi-
ments have shown that these measures can bring a quick impact on output
increase. The Government assured that by June 30, 1982, in the four fields
supported under the project, a credit system of course requirements and an
alternative to the present thesis requirement for the Sarjana degree /1 would
be introduced at the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas.
3.06      Over the medium term, the project would seek to introduce other
policies to increase output as well as quality. The policies would provide
targets to be adopted by the four fields at the three universities in the
following main areas:
(a) staff utilization (paras. 2.15, 2.16) - minimum teacher workload for
teaching, research and consultancy, ratio of management to
academic staff, and ratio of staff to students;
(b) utilization of physical facilities (paras. 2.17, 2.18) - space
utilization, time tabling and allocation of teaching accommodations;
(c) promotion and graduation (paras. 2.19, 2.20) - student evaluation
schemes, repetition and years needed to complete a degree program;
/1 Students could either write a thesis or take six additional credits in
course work and a comprehensive examination.



- 27 -
(d)  access to education (para. 2.21) - financial aid programs; and
(e)  quality of education (paras. 2.23-2.25) - staff qualifications
and performance, and process of curriculum development.
Annex 2 sets out the policy areas, targets and timeframe to achieve the
targets in the four fields at the three project universities. The Government
will submit an annual report on progress of stated policy implementation to
the Bank.
3.07      The monitoring and evaluation units to be established under the
project within the DGHE and each of the three universities (para. 3.18) would
elaborate the policies in terms of annual targets and an implementation
strategy. Policies would be issued by the respective authorities (e.g., the
Minister of Education, the Director General of Higher Education, university
rectors) depending upon the nature of policies. The monitoring and evaluation
units would also follow up implementation of the policies and the results
would be fed back to decision-making bodies for further action.
3.08      In order to provide an information base to help develop a policy
implementation strategy, the project would include the following studies:
(a) a feasibility study of financial and administrative schemes to
enable staff to devote their full time to university life
and carry out their responsibilities in teaching, research and
service; and
(b) a study of the value of entrance tests and other criteria for
admission in predicting academic success of students as well as
the relationship between student motivation (as expressed in
preference for a particular course of studies) and student
performance.
These studies would be carried out by local consultants under the supervision
of the monitoring and evaluation unit to be established within the DGHE. The
project would finance one man-year of foreign specialist services to assist
with the design and methodology of the above studies and six man-years of
local specialist services and six man-months of observation trips to foreign
universities to conduct the studies.
3.09      Preparation for Expanded Enrollment Capacity.  As a long-term
measure to increase output in the four selected fields, the project would
prepare for the expansion (to be completed under Phase II) of the selected
physical facilities of the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas at new campus
sites and of the University of Gadjah Mada at its present campus site (paras.
2.36-2.39). By 1990, the enrollment capacity of the three universities would
expand from 13,640 in 1978 to 19,800 (Table 3.2). Reflecting manpower needs
(para. 1.08), the engineering, science and economics faculties would incease
their enrollment significantly while the agriculture faculties would maintain



- 28 -
their present enrollment size. Assuming conservative increases in internal
productivity,/l this increase in enrollment at the three universities would
meet about one third of the annual incremental needs for high-level manpower
in economics/accountancy and science, and about 20% and 10% of thŽ needs in
engineering and agriculture, respectively. The remaining gap in the supply of
these graduates is expected to be met by a combination of improved internal
efficiency at other universities, including the Institute of Technology
Bandung and the Institute of Pertanian Bogor, and increases in enrollment at
other universities, including the Hasannudin University and the Institute of
Technology, Surabaya, which are being assisted by the Asian Development Bank.

would provide science courses to about 5,000, 4,000 and 2,000 students
respectively from other faculties.

12% for engineering and science, and 15% for agriculture and economics.



- 29 -
3.10      In support of the above planned increases in enrollment, the project
would finance expatriate and local professional services (para. 4.10). These
specialists would help the three universities complete their academic master
plans, campus master plans, equipment lists, building designs, and preparation
of tender documents for civil works and equipment procurement. The project
would also finance initial site development work at the new campus sites of
the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas. Agreement was reached on a
schedule for each of the three universities for completing different stages of
preparation including a schedule for acquiring 200 ha for the University of
Andalas and an additional 10 ha for the University of Gadjah Mada (Annex 4).
The Government delegation also assured that the academic and campus master
plans would be submitted to the Bank for review.
Improving Quality (US$22.1 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.11      Staff Development.  To upgrade the educational and professional
qualifications of teaching staff (para. 2.23), this project would include a
technical assistance component, which would provide for 177 fellowships to
foreign universities (total of 460 man-years) and 30 visiting expatriate
professors (total of 60 man-years) to the faculties of engineering, science,
agriculture and economics at the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and
Andalas (Table 3.3). The second phase would expect to include about 300
fellowships totalling about 800 man-years. Fellows would take, in addition
to academic courses, courses in curriculum development and instruction (e.g.,
teaching methods and development of instructional materials) in respective
field. By 1985, on the average, about one third of the 1,300 total staff in
these faculties would have obtained education beyond a Sarjana degree (para.
2.23). By 1990, about half of the expected total of 1,500 staff would have
obtained education beyond a Sarjana degree (Table 3.4).

to the Universities of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada, and about 10 man-years to
the University of Andalas. In addition, another 50 man-years would be
included to enable about 50 fellows who are now studying abroad under a
Government sponsorship to complete their advanced degrees.

3.13      The thirty professionals who would be recruited from overseas (para.
3.11) would be assigned to the faculties of the four selected fields at the
Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas, to assist in the develop-
ment of curriculum and teaching methods, and aid junior staff in preparing for
further training. They would also serve to fill the gap left by Indonesian
staff who would study abroad or fill teaching positions for which Indonesian
staff cannot be recruited due to teacher shortages. An overseas agency would
be contracted to place fellows at appropriate institutions and recruit
suitable foreign professors according to the criteria and schedule agreed with
the Bank; and fellowships would be awarded according to criteria and
procedures agreed with the Bank.
3.14      Candidates in previous fellowship programs in Indonesia have had a
low rate of passes (about I0%) in the English language test (TOEFL /1)
required for admission to most universities in English speaking countries.
/1 Test of English as a Foreign Language, administered by the Educational
Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey.



-  32 -
Since the Government projects that most fellows would be studying in English
speaking countries, the project would help finance English language training
courses (generally three months in duration) for the candidates before they
take the test. Courses would also be given in another language (e.g., French,
German) if the need arises. The courses would be conducted at the Universi-
ties of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas for their candidates. The Govern-
ment and Bank delegations agreed on a program and schedule of language
training courses.
3.15      Instructional Materials Development.  To improve the quality of
teaching and provide students with better access to learning, the project
would support the development of teaching materials (para. 2.24). During
project implementation, textbooks (120 titles, 150,000 copies) would be made
available for basic courses in engineering, science, agriculture and
economics. The consortia in each of these four fields under the DGHE (para.
2.02) would identify appropriate books which would be translated into Bahasa
Indonesia and edited for relevance to Indonesia by professional staff under
the supervision of the Directorate of Research in DGHE. The books would be
printed by university presses and private firms. The project would provide
financing for: (a) four man-years of overseas training to eight editors (two
each for engineering, science, agriculture and economics); (b) translation,
editing and layout/designing of 120 titles; and (c) printing equipment
(composing machine, reproduction camera, printing machine and cutting machine)
for the presses at the Institute of Technology, Bandung (ITB) and the
University of Gadjah Mada. The Government assured the Bank that before the
reproduction of any textbook under the project, it would obtain the consent of
the author and the publisher of any such textbook to the proposed
reproduction.
3.16      The project would improve public university libraries by providing
professional journals and reference books in engineering, science, agriculture
and economics totalling about 150,000 copies. To strengthen the libraries of
the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas specifically, the
project would also provide six man-years of overseas fellowships for library
staff. One library staff member from each university would receive two
man-years of specialized training in library science and administration.
Strengthening University Management (US$4.0 million equivalent excluding
contingencies)
3.17      The project would assist DGHE in improving its planning and manage-
ment functions. A monitoring and evaluation system, a management information
system, a university development office and a management training program
would be established on an ad hoc basis under DGHE-s present structure. A
plan and schedule of implementation to reform the organizational structure of
DGHE will be prepared according to a schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para.
3.03).



- 33 -
3.18      Monitoring and Evaluation System.  The project would introduce a
monitoring and evaluation system which would help develop and evaluate the
policy measures designed to improve the internal efficiency, quality and
management of university education (para. 3.07). The system would consist of
a central unit within DGHE and a local unit at each of the three project
universities. The central unit would be under a steering committee of three
persons, representing the Directorate of Academic Affairs, the Directorate of
Research and a proposed project implementation task force (para. 3.21). The
unit itself would consist of two professionals and one administrative staff,
who would be assisted by one man-year of foreign specialist services and by
six man-years of local specialist services to be provided under the project.
Each project university unit would be staffed by two university members and be
assisted by one man-year of foreign specialist services.
3.19      Under the monitoring and evaluation system, the central unit would:
(a) standardize the indicators of internal efficiency, quality and management;
(b) in collaboration with a project university unit, set the annual targets of
achievement and develop an implementation strategy for each university;
(c) establish the technique of monitoring and evaluation; (d) receive data on
indicators and feedback on implementation measures from the three university
units; (e) arrange for data collection on standardized indicators from other
universities; (f) analyze data and evaluate strategies and measures; and
(g) advise the Director General of Higher Education on the introduction of new
policy measures. The monitoring and evaluation system would be extended to
all higher education institutions under the second phase of the university
development program.
3.20      MIanagement Information System.  As a further measure to strengthen
the planning functions of DGHE and of each of the three project universities,
a management information system would be introduced. The system would enable
DGHE and the three universities to collect the information and data systema-
tically and continuously on such inputs and outputs of universities as
students, staff, costs, facilities, materials, graduates, and graduate
employment. The project would include eight man-years each of local and
foreign specialist services to establish the management information system.
In addition, three man-years of the local specialist services would be
supported to develop a uniform system of university accounts so that proper
comparisons may be made on income and expenditures between faculties within
the same institutions and among universities. Under the second phase of the
university development program, the management information system would be
extended to all higher education institutions.
3.21      University Development Office.  To facilitate implementation of the
proposed project and provide professional services to non-project universi-
ties as needs arise, an ad hoc task force has been set up within the DGIIE
(para.  4.02).  The proposed project would include 16 man-years of foreign
specialist services in project management. This task force would be



- 34 -
incorporated into the regular organizational structure of the DGHE during
Phase II and become a central university development office charged with
planning and implementing future university investment programs.
3.22      University Management Training Program.  The project would help
develop a cadre of trained personnel in university management by introducing a
training program. The program would give courses for top university managers,
middle-level university administrators, and key staff at DGHE. To develop
and administer the program, DGHE would establish a management training unit
comprising a director, two administrative assistants and 20 trainers. Under
the project, these 20 persons, who would be drawn from universities and DGHE,
would receive six man-months of overseas training in the skills and procedures
of administrative and academic management. Upon return, they would develop
the training program and materials, and initiate training with assistance of
four man-years of foreign specialist services included in the project.
3.23      The training program would include courses in management skills and
procedures for individual universities as well as for the university system,
and seminars on higher education policy and its administrative implications
resulting from new guidelines in higher education announced by the Director
General at the annual rectors' meeting. Each training course would be short
lasting two to three weeks and altogether about six courses would be conducted
annually. Courses would be provided at an existing facility including a new
National Institute of Administration building which should be completed in
Jakarta early in 1981, with assistance provided under the World Bank Fourth
Education Project (Loan 1237-IND). During implementation of the project about
one-fourth of the existing 3,000 rectors, deans and other senior university
staff, and key DGHE staff (about 130) would be trained.
3.24      Rationalization of University Organization and Staffing.  The
project would help rationalize the organization and staffing of the
Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas.
3.25      In order to reduce the duplication of administrative services within
each of the three project universities, an organizational and staffing master
plan would be prepared for each, to rationalize their management and use of
resources. The proposed project would provide six man-years of local and
three man-years of foreign specialist services to help prepare these master
plans which would establish such key central service offices at each of the
three universities as personnel, comptroller, financial aids, staff recruit-
ment, staff training, student records, admissions, student placement, campus
maintenance and library. The organizational and staffing master plans would
include a staff appointment and training schedule for each office to be
established.
3.26      In support of this rationalization of university management, the
project would also prepare for the provision of central administration and
library buildings for the two relocating universities - Indonesia and



- 35 -
Andalas - to be constructed under the second phase of the university develop-
ment program. Similar to the preparation for the selected academic buildings
(para. 3.10), the project would finance professional services for building
designs and preparation of tender documents for civil works and equipment
procurement.
4. MANAGEMIENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
4.01      Arrangements for the execution of the proposed project include:
(a)  establishment, and staffing of project implementation
task forces at the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and
Andalas and at the Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE);
(b)  implementation schedules for all project components; and
(c)  implementation procedures comprising:  (i) procurement procedures,
including selection and acquisition of land, tendering and
awarding contracts for works and goods, selecting and contracting
experts, selecting and awarding fellowships; and (ii) financing
procedures, including budgeting, disbursement and reimbursements./l
Management Arrangements
4.02      Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE).  A task force has
been set up in the DGHE on an ad hoc basis to supervise implementation of the
proposed project and provide professional services to academic and physical
developments of non-project universities (para. 3.21). Under its present
organizational structure and staffing, DGHE would be unable to implement the
proposed project without reorganizing and expanding its staff (para. 2.27),
which could be a lengthy process. Establishment of an ad hoc task force,
however, can be arranged relatively easily since it is done on a project
basis, which means that it would be financed out of the development budget
rather than regular recurrent budget funds. The implementation task force
would, however, be incorporated into the regular organizational structure of
the DGHE and become a university development office.
4.03      The task force would be responsible for coordinating the project
university-specific components (staff development, physical facilities expan-
sion, institutional management improvement) by issuing guidelines to the uni-
versity project management teams. It would also be responsible for directly
implementing the project components that would not be university-specific
(policy development, teaching materials development, system management
/1 Financing procedures are discussed in Chapter 5.



- 36 -
improvement) with consultants provided under the project. The task force
would liaise with the Bank and submit progress reports to the Bank as
required. It consists of three sections which have the following functions:
(a)  education and training:  issuing guidelines including targets for
enrollment, output, efficiency, class size, and quality; administer-
ing foreign expert services and fellowship programs; defining
terms of reference of studies supported under the project;
implementing the teaching materials development program; and
coordinating the establishment of monitoring evaluation and
information systems at the DGHE and the universities;
(b)  physical:  ensuring consistency and uniformity in capital outlays,
budget planning and cost control for providing physical facilities
(civil works, furniture and equipment); assisting the universities
in writing equipment specifications and procuring equipment under
ICB; assisting the universities with preparation of appropriate
accommodation schedules and architects- briefs and equipment lists
according to directives issued by the education and training
section; and
(c) financial: reviewing and approving, as appropriate, the requests
for development budgets to provide necessary project funds;
development of project accounting and auditing procedures and the
preparation of applications for disbursement (withdrawals from the
loan); and keeping control of these aspects as conducted by each
university.
A central advisory procurement service unit established in the Ministry of
Education in 1980 would give technical advice to the DGHE task force in
managing procurement aspects of the project.
4.04      Staffing of the DGHE Task Force.  The task force is headed by a
director who reports to the Director General of Higher Education. The
sections would have the following professional staff: (a) the education and
training section - a chief, educational planner, training specialist and two
technical assistance administrators (one for experts and one for fellowships);
(b) physical section - a chief, an architect/engineer and equipment special-
ist; and (c) the financial section - a chief, cost estimator/controller and
accountant. The task force-s director and sections would be provided with the
necessary support staff. Persons with suitable qualifications to head the
task force and its sections have been appointed from staff within and outside
the DGHE. The Government assured that all staff would be appointed according
to a schedule agreed with the Bank. The Government has also drafted terms of
reference for the task force, and prepared plans for training of project
implementation staff, both of which are satisfactory to the Bank.
4.05      Universities.  The Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and
Andalas have assigned the responsibility for project implementation to their



- 37 -
existing university development offices. A university project implementation
team has been established within each development office, which is under the
rector's office, to carry out the educational, physical and financial aspects
of university subprojects. Terms of reference for the university project
teams have been prepared and are acceptable to the Bank.
4.06      Civil works would be implemented by the teams according to direc-
tives and guidelines formulated by the DGHE task force (Annex 3). The task
force would assist the teams with writing specifications, tendering and bid
evaluation of equipment. The three universities would award and sign the
equipment contracts. The task force would arrange for the issuance of letters
of credit and payment to foreign suppliers. Local handling and installation
of equipment would generally be arranged by the universities. These proce-
dures follow the current government practice (e.g., Buyer's Credit and
Japanese Bilateral Aid Program).
4.07      For the technical assistance program, the Universities would select
candidates for the fellowship programs on the basis of agreed selection
criteria and procedures (para. 3.13). The DGHE task force would assist the
Universities in the selection of the experts, and sign contracts for experts
serving universities upon approval by the university concerned. An agency
capable of implementing both the fellowships program and experts' services
program would be contracted by the task force (para. 3.13), in consultation
with the universities. The task force would also arrange for training
programs under the proposed loan for the University project teams in project
management, selection and briefing of architects firms, selection and
supervision of civil works contractors, and procurement of equipment.
Implementation
4.08      Implementation Period.  Implementation of the proposed project would
cover all preparations up to the point of tendering for the construction and
equipping of buildings and would last five and a half years. This would
include such activities as academic master planning, campus master planning,
architectural and engineering designs, preparation of tender documents for
civil works, furniture and equipment, the first part of the staff development
program comprising 60 man-years of expert services and 560 man-years of
fellowships, and, in the cases of Universities of Indonesia and Andalas,
initial campus development work./l The completion date of this project
/1  Only the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas would carry out initial
campus development works under Phase I, since they would be relocated to
new campuses. For Gadjah Madah, campus development work would be carried
out under Phase II parallel with building construction. Initial site
development works would comprise grading, road construction, provision of
water and power supply, campus telephone connections and sewerage
system.



- 38 -
would be June 30, 1986. The second Phase lasting about six years would
include the completion of campus development work, the construction of
building, the procurement of furniture and equipment, and the completion of
staff developm-eit programs (Table 4.1). Annex 4 sets out the schedule for
implementing each component of the proposed project (Annex 4).
4.09      The three universities are likely to implement Phase I at different
speeds, so that some would be ready for tendering Phase II construction and
equipment packages earlier than others. Therefore Phases I and II would
likely overlap about two years. The loan request for Phase II would be
assessed when the conditions for proceeding to the second phase (para. 3.03)
have been met.
4.10      Professional Services.  Qualified architects and engineers would be
appointed to prepare campus development plans, sketch plans, detailed engi-
neering and tender documents. In consultation with the DGHE task force,
university project implementation teams would appoint foreign and local firms
/consultants as appropriate for the university campus planning and develop-
ment, building designs, and preparation of tender documents for furniture
and equipment for the three universities. Selection and contracting would
follow standard government procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.11      Land Acquisition.  Land has been selected for the new campuses for
the Universities of Andalas and Indonesia. Andalas is in the process of
acquiring 200 ha outside Padant (para. 2.38). Land (300 ha) selected for the
new campus of the University of Indonesia, which is about 30 km from the
center of Jakarta, is adequate and has been fully acquired. The existing
campus of Gadjah Mada contains about 170 ha. An additional 10 ha, adjacent to
the campus is being acquired by Gadjah Mada for the expansion of the Univer-
sity. The Government assured the Bank that it would acquire adequate land
for Andalas and Gadjah Mada acceptable to the Bank according to a schedule
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.12      Procurement.  Under the proposed project, tender documents would be
prepared for about US$90 million equivalent of civil works and about US$40
million equivalent of equipment, of which US$17 million and US$5 million, res-
pectively, would be procured under the proposed project and the remainder
under Phase II. Civil works and equipment packages would be grouped to the
extent practicable to increase competition in bidding. Tender documents for
bid packages for civil works above US$1,000,000 and equipment above US$300,000
would be prepared for international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. They would stipulate that for bid
evaluation, domestic manufacturers and suppliers would be given a preferential
margin of 15% or the existing customs duty, whichever is the lower, over the
c.i.f. price of competing equipment imports. Tender documents for civil works
packages below US$1,000,000 and equipment packages below US$300,000 would be
prepared for local competitive bidding in accordance with Government
procurement practices which are acceptable to the Bank. Under the proposed

project, miscellaneous items, in packages not exceeding US$20,000 equivalent
could be purchased off-the-shelf on the basis of at least three price
quotations up to a total of US$0.5 million. Books and journals would be
procured through competitive bidding locally advertised or through direct
purchase after negotiations for the best discount. Prior Bank review would
be required for contract awards for civil works packages estimated to cost
US$500,000 and the printing equipment packages estimated to cost US$100,000
equivalent. Tender and contract documents would follow the standard format
agreed between the Bank and the Government.
4.13      Technical Assistance.  The technical asssistance program (Annex 5)
would be implemented according to para. 4.07. The Government has drafted
terms of reference for the specialists to be financed under the project
acceptable to the Bank.
5. COST AND FINANCING
5.01      The total costs of the proposed university development program are
estimated at about US$294 million equivalent; Phase I: US$65.2 million and
Phase II: about US$229 million. The proposed loan would finance the total
foreign exchange component of Phase I, about US$45.0 million (69%), and the
Government would finance the remaining US$20.2 million. The project costs
(investment and recurrent) are reasonable and the financing plan is
feasible.
Cost
5.02      The estimated cost of Phases I (Annex 6) and II is summarized in
Table 5.1 below:
5.03      Base cost.  Base cost estimates for civil works, goods and services
refer to January 1980 prices. Professional services amount to US$5.3 million
equivalent based on 5% of the estimated cost of construction for design work
up to tendering and 5% for site supervision. These percentages conform to
BAPPENAS standards and are reasonable. The base cost for site development
works at the Universities of Indonesia and Andalas has been calculated by
consultants and is realistic. Equipment costs are based on preliminary lists
which are reasonable in scope. The technical assistance component would
include 1,308 man-months of specialist services of which 348 man-months are
for local experts, and 7,506 man-months of fellowships of which 540 man-months
are for local training (Annex 5). The average man-month cost of foreign
expert services, including salary, fees, international travel and subsistence
is estimated at US$8,000. Man-month costs of local experts including salaries
and allowances would average US$1,000. The costs of fellowships including
travel (international and/or domestic), tuition and boarding would amount to
about US$1,500 per man-month for overseas training and US$190 per man-month
for domestic training.

/a  At this stage cost estimates of the second phase construction are global since:  (a) area alloca-
tion per student place per field of study is crude; and (b) unit cost of construction scheduled
to start about three years from now cannot be accurately determined because of difficulty of pre-
dicting inflation trends. However, the estimated gross areas for Phase II are accurate enough to
determine the cost related to professional services to be financed in the Phase I project.

5.04      Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$12.2'
million includes: (a) physical contingencies estimated at 10% of the base cost
of the project; and (b) price contingencies estimated at an average of 25% of
the base cost ind physical contingencies. Estimated price increases from the
base cost date (January 1980) are:

5.05      Recurrent Cost.  Recurrent annual cost generated by the proposed
project is estimated to be at about US$3.5 million equivalent (in 1980 prices)
and to account for about 4% of the DGHE budget in 1985/86. This estimate is
based on the assumptions that the recurrent expenditure of the Ministry of
Education and Culture will grow at 10% p.a. in real terms as it did between
1975 and 1979, and DGHE will continue to share about 20% of the total
recurrent epxenditure of the Ministry.  Considering the priority given to
higher education development and in particular to the proposed project to ease
the present acute shortage of high-level manpower, the share of 4% in DGHE's
projected recurrent budget in 1985/86 would not constitute a budgetary
constraint to' the implementation of the project. Maintenance arrangements for
physical facilities constructed under previous Bank Group-assisted projects
have proven to be satisfactory.
Financing
5.06      Capital cost.  The proposed Bank loan of US$45.0 million equivalent
would finance 100% of the foreign exchange component of the project, or 71% of
project costs net of duties and taxes (69%, including duties and taxes). The
Government funds and loan proceeds would be allocated for different categories
of expenditures as follows:

would be disbursed over a period of six years as shown-in Table 5.4.
5.08      Disbursements would be made on the basis of:
(a) 20% of the cost of civil works;
(b) 100% of the CIF cost of equipment, 95% of the ex-factory cost
of equipment and 75% of the cost of equipment procured locally
off the shelf;
(c)  100% of the cost of fellowships and specialist services; and
(d)  100% of the cost of professional services.
To the extent practicable, applications would be aggregated in amounts of
US$50,000 or more prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement from the
proceeds of the proposed loan. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1986. The three project university teams would keep separate
accounts, and the DGHE task force would consolidate them. Accounting records
would be annually audited by the State Auditor which the Bank considers as
an independent auditor.

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      There are three principal benefits of the proposed project:  (a)
increased output of high-level graduates to meet development needs, through
improvements in internal efficiency and preparation for construction of
facilities in the second phase needed to expand enrollment at the three
project universities; (b) improved quality of output, through staff develop-
ment, provision of educational materials and better teaching methods; and (c)
increased management capacity for administration and planning of higher
education at DGHE and the three project universities, through rationalizing
organization and staffing, staff training, policy development and management
support services. In addition, the project would lay the groundwork for
further increases in output under the second phase of the university
development program by providing policies for improving internal efficiency
that would be developed and experimented with under Phase I and would be the
basis for improving efficiency throughout the university system under Phase
II. The improvements in management capacity under the project would also
provide the basis for improvements to management of the university system as
a whole under the second phase.



- 45 -
6.02      The increased output generated by the proposed project, by 1985,
should meet approximately 15% of the annual need for high level manpower in
engineering, 25% of the need in science, 10% in agriculture, and 20% in
economics/accountancy. Together with the increased enrollments to come under
the second phase and the introduction of policy measures to increase
efficiency throughout the university system, by 1990, almost all of the
manpower needs in engineering, science, agriculture and economics should be
met by output from the three project universities and other higher education
institutions. The second major benefit of the proposed project, the improve-
ment in the quality of output, would expect to increase the productivity of
the graduates of the three universities in their chosen fields upon completing
their education. The third major benefit, institution building, should have
the short term effect of helping to increase the level and quality of output
of the university system, and the longer term effect of improving the overall
operation and planning for future development of the higher education system.
Risks
6.03      A major risk inherent in a university development program of the
scope proposed under this project is the difficulty in coordinating implemen-
tation of various components. Universities are usually autonomous and
university development, especially involving more than one university and
campus relocation, entails decisions by many authorities. This difficulty of
coordination has resulted in numerous changes in the scope, costs and imple-
mentation periods of the Bank's previous university projects in Asia. In
order to reduce this major risk, the Government's university development
program consists of two phases. The phased approach would make it easier to
modify the project scope, costs and time needed for completion of the program
in view of possible changed circumstances at the end of this project.
6.04      A more specific risk associated with the proposed project is related
to the implementation of staff development. A large number of fellowships for
existing and prospective teachers are proposed under the project. However,
there is a risk that the proposed number of fellowships might not be fully
utilized due to a past low rate of passes in a language test required by a
receiving institution. This risk would be reduced through an intensive
English training scheme provided under the project.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreement was reached between the Government and the Bank delega-
tions on:
(i)  terms of reference of the DGHE implementation task force and
specialists to be financed under the project (paras. 4.04 and 4.13);



- 46 -
(ii) schedules to implement the various project activities (para. 4.08);
and
(iii) the following other project matters: conditions for proceeding to
a second phase project (para. 3.03); selection criteria and
procedures for award of fellowships and contract of an agency
(para. 3.13); plans for training project implementation staff
(para. 4.04).
7.02      The Government agreed with the Bank that:
(i) by June 30, 1982, in the four fields supported under the project
a credit system of course requirements and an alternative to the
present thesis requirement for the Sarjana degree would be intro-
duced at the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas
(para. 3.05);
(ii) the Government would introduce policies to achieve minimum targets
applicable to the four selected fields at the three universities
according to a schedule satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish the
Bank with an annual report on progress of stated policy implemen-
tation (para. 3.06);
(iii) the Government would obtain the consent of the author and the
publisher of any textbook before reproducing it (para. 3.15); and
(iv) the Government would complete the acquisition of required land
for the Universities of Andalas and Gadjah Mada which would be
acceptable to the Bank, according to the schedule satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 4.11).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for a loan of US$45.0 million equivalent to the Republic of
Indonesia for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.
