SUMMARY
The proposed project restructuring entails several changes to:

   (i) reallocate some loan proceeds from Component B1 (Utility Investments) to Component
            B2 (Flood Protection Investments) in order to better align the investments with the
            project objectives;
   (ii) extend Component B2 (Flood Protection Investments) beyond the Central Posavina area,
            in the Sava River, to cover investments also in the Drava and Danube river basins;
   (iii)more adequately define the scope of the technical assistance (TA) under Component A1
            (EU Accession Support) aiming at facilitating the water sector reforms;
   (iv) reallocate loan proceeds between Component B1 (Utility Investments) to Component A
            (Technical Assistance) to better reflect the costs for consulting and TA services for
            the preparation of sub-projects under Component B, the preparation of sub-projects
            and studies for future EU financing, and the cost of TA for strengthening of project
            utilities;
   (v) drop one of the project indicators, (Volume of wastewater treated as per applicable
            legislation); and
   (vi) inform about the revision of the Project Disbursement Letter to allow the Borrower to
            increase the ceiling of the special account from EUR 1.0 million to EUR 2.0 million.

The proposed project restructuring was requested by the Ministry of Regional Development,
Forestry and Water management (MRDFWM), previously called the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Water Management (MOAFWM), and formalized in a letter dated May 13, 2011
sent by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The project restructuring does not entail changes to the
Project’s development objectives, total project costs, disbursement percentage or project
duration. As baselines for the indicators had not been established at appraisal, the opportunity is
taken to include such baselines in the Results Framework (see Annex 1).


PROJECT STATUS
The project objective is to improve water supply services, wastewater services and flood
protection measures in the Sava, Drava, and Danube river basins of the Republic of Croatia. The
project is supported by a Loan of Euro 100 million, financing 95% of the total project costs.

The project was approved on May 30, 2007 and became effective on January 29, 2008. After a
slow start in implementation, mainly due to delays in establishing an effective Project


                                                4
Implementation Unit (PIU) and providing counterpart funds, the project has made considerable
progress. Currently, all 12 sub-loan agreements with local utility companies and
towns/municipalities have been signed. Two of the flood protection components for
rehabilitation of dikes and protection of protective walls have been completed. The TA
component of the project is also proceeding satisfactorily and the PIU is focusing on maximizing
the use of project funds to extend the Project benefits.

Disbursement is behind schedule (at just above 50%) but in view of the advanced status of
procurement, the completion of the project activities by the closing date (end-December 2012) is
considered possible. Financial management and procurement are progressing satisfactorily and
there are no audits outstanding.

Related to safeguard requirements, the PIU has been using simplified tables (matrices) regarding
expropriated land in lieu of standard Land Acquisition Plans (LAPs) and has only recently
submitted detailed reports on the status of land acquisition activities. The Bank missions have
been regularly appraised of land acquisition related actions, but during a recent Bank’s review it
became apparent that these LAPs, while acceptable to the Bank, had not been submitted to the
Bank for prior review and no-objection, as prescribed in the Project’s Policy Framework for
Land Acquisition and Resettlement (LARAP). While there is no indication to date that any
person has been materially harmed, or that there are any outstanding grievances associated with
the Project, the Bank and the Client have agreed to undertake a retroactive review of OP 4.12
compliance, aiming to ensure that due diligence has been applied in land acquisition matters as
agreed in the LARAP. If such assessment identifies issues with land acquisition that have
resulted in material harm, remediation measures will be applied. It has also been agreed that any
future LAP would be submitted to the Bank for prior approval as stipulated in the LARAP and
the Loan Agreement (Schedule 2, Section IB).


PROPOSED CHANGES

   •   Components

Component A – Technical Assistance. The size of Component A2 (Project Implementation
Support) is proposed to be increased. At the time of appraisal, the costs for consulting services
necessary for the preparation of projects under Component B (Investments) had been incorrectly
included under Component B rather than Component A. This restructuring provides the
opportunities to reallocate Loan proceeds to ensure that sufficient funds are provided under
Component A so that withdrawals for consulting services are recorded under the correct category
of expenses.

The scope and size of technical assistance (TA) under Component A1 (EU Accession Support) is
proposed to be revised. As a result of Croatia’s EU accession, investments of more than EUR
4.5 billion in water and wastewater will be needed before the end of 2023. The TA component
will hence be expanded to allow the preparation of a larger number of sub-projects (at least four)
to be financed under future EU cohesion funds and to facilitate implementation of reforms and
institutional strengthening in the water sector to meet EU requirements.


                                                5
Finally, the project has anticipated that under Component A1(EU Accession Support) studies and
TA would be prepared to implement the Water Management Strategy. This will be modified to
ensure that a broad range of activities could be supported relate to water reforms, for example on
Institutional Options in the Water Supply and Wastewater Sector. The wording of the Loan
Agreement will be made less specific, to allow the necessary flexibility in the allocation of
funds.

Component B2 – Flood Protection. The scope and size of this component is proposed to be
expanded. Originally, the flood protection component of the project has focused solely on
investments in the Central Posavina area, in the Sava river basin. However, in recent years,
Croatia has been affected by significant floods. In 2010 alone, the flood-related damages in the
country amounted HRK 1 billion (Euro 150 million equivalent). HV has therefore requested that
available loan proceeds be invested in the flood protection system. Six sub-projects were to be
financed under the scope of Component B2. After restructuring, one of these sub-projects
(Overflow dyke at Jezero) will be dropped from the Project, as this was not properly covered in
the area plans and processing of the permits would be long and difficult to obtain. This will be
substituted with (i) reinforcement of the Sava River dyke (section Gunja-Rajevo Selo) to provide
necessary protection of the population of the two settlement along the River and estimated to
cost EUR 3 million; and (ii) dyke rehabilitation in the Baranja region as the dyke is in serious
need of rehabilitation due to water and weather erosions over time and estimated to cost EUR 2
million.

   •   Financing

           o Project Costs and Reallocation of Loan Proceeds

The proposed changes do not affect the total project costs. However, a reallocation of loan
proceeds across categories is proposed. There is no change to the percentages of expenditure to
be financed under the Loan.

Note: the difference between the two tables is due to the interest during construction and other charges

             o Special Account

In view of accelerated disbursement under the Project, an increase in the ceiling of the special
account from EUR 1.0 million to EUR 2.0 million has been requested. Given the urgency to
increase such ceiling, so that the Borrower can pay contractors for invoices already submitted,
the revision of the Disbursement Letter has been processed independently from this restructuring
and had been made effective.

    •    Results/Indicators

As baselines for the indicators had not been established at appraisal, the opportunity is taken to
include such baselines in the Results Framework (see Annex 1). It is proposed to drop one of the
definitions for Indicator 2, i.e. the Volume of wastewater treated as per applicable legislation.
This indicator is misleading because it is dependent on the volume of water entering the
wastewater system, level of precipitation, etc. which is highly variable and not linked or
controllable by the Project. Progress of the Project in meeting the objectives of providing
wastewater services is in fact better monitored by another indicator related to the percentage of
sewerage coverage, which will continue to be monitored.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
The PIU undertook the appraisal of the two new flood sub-components which are suggested to
be included under the Project. The PIU has submitted an Addendum to the Appraisal Report of
Component B2 (Flood Protection), covering the same elements analyzed at the time of the
Project appraisal in 2007. This has been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.

The additional TAs for the preparation of projects and studies for future EU financing and for the
strengthening of project utilities do not require a formal appraisal, but all revisions have been
agreed in advance with the Bank through supervision missions and duly reflected in updated
Procurement Plans.

   •   Technical

The supplemental appraisal of the additional flood protection investments indicates that the
necessary technical documentation (feasibility studies, preliminary and main designs), and valid
construction permits have been obtained for both investments. The works are to be implemented
under professional supervision to ensure the quality of the works. Works include only
reinforcement and restoration of existing structures, and there will be no expansion or
construction of additional structures.

   •   Economic and financial analysis

Since the additional flood protection investments deal only with rehabilitation of existing
structures, the benefits of such investments are evident but to a large extent difficult to quantify.
They are represented by avoiding/reducing flood-related damages. A financial analysis is not
required as there will be no financial inflows from these sub-projects.

   •   Social

The expansion and increase of dikes is taking place inside the existing public water domain area,
which is a designated corridor for flood protection structures, and therefore there will not be any
land acquisition. However, should any land requirements emerge during implementation, the
project has a Resettlement Policy Framework in place which is being updated to include specific
guidance for site screening and preparing LAPs consistent with OP 4.12. This will be used as
guidance for the preparation of any Resettlement Action Plan/Land Appropriation Plan. These
LAPs would be submitted to the Bank for prior approval as stipulated in the Resettlement Policy
Framework.

   •   Environment

The two additional flood protection sub-projects are not expected to result in any significant
incremental change from an environmental point of view, as these types of activities are fully in
line with the original project scope. The environmental category of Financial Intermediary will
continue to be applicable and the following environmental safeguards policies apply:
Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitat, and Forests. The appraisal of projects will continue


                                                 8
to follow guidelines set in projects Operational Manual and Environmental Framework (EF)
which is its integral part. The EF requires that a proper environmental screening is carried out, an
Environmental Management Plan or an Environmental Impact Assessment is prepared and the
project is fully disclosed to the public and concerns raised by the public are addressed. Measures
to be taken to address these two policies have been covered under the Environmental
Management Plan of the two new flood protection sub-projects.

   •   Exceptions to Bank Policy

The proposed additions do not trigger any new safeguards policy, and do not require any
exception from existing Bank policies.
