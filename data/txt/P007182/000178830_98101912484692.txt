PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA - FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 576-GU)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the First Education Project in
the Republic of Guatemala for which Loan 576-GU provided US$6.3 million
in December 1968.   The loan was fully disbursed and the project completed
by October 1975, when the loan account was closed.
The audit report consists of a project performance audit memorandum
(PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department and a Project Comple-
tion Report (PCR), dated September 13, 1978 and revised May 24, 1979, prepared
by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a first
draft prepared by UNESCO. The audit memorandum is based on a review of the
Appraisal Report (No. TO-681b) dated October 11, 1968, the President's Report
(No. P-650) dated November 12, 1968, the Loan Agreement and the letters
supplementary thereto dated December 16, 1968, the PCR and the draft PCR
prepared by UNESCO. Material on the Bank's files relating to this project has
been reviewed.   Discussions have been held with Bank staff associated with
this project and with the Second Education Project in Guatemala, and reference
has been made to the Appraisal Report (No. 926-GU) on this Second Education
Project. No visit to Guatemala was undertaken by OED staff in connection with
this audit.
Copies of a Spanish translation of the draft audit report were sent
to representatives of the Borrower on September 27, 1979.  English transla-
tions of the comments received are reproduced at pages 12 and 13; they have
been taken into account in the final version of the audit report.
The audit memorandum, while concurring generally with the PCR,
differs from it in its assessment of the reasons for the comparative failure
of the project to realise its main objective of introducing practical courses
into  secondary education.    The memorandum  examines project generation in
more detail than does the PCR and is more critical than the PCR of the Bank's
supervision efforts.

(LOAN 576-GU)
HIGHLIGHTS
After a lengthy project generation stage involving four Bank recon-
naissance missions and appraisal the Loan Agreement in respect of this project
was signed on December 16, 1968.  The loan provided US$6.3 million, one half
of estimated total project costs, to assist the Borrower in secondary teacher
training, the improvement of secondary school curricula which were to stress
science and practical subjects, and agricultural education at both secondary
and post-secondary levels. The project facilities were substantially comple-
ted by June 1975 and the Loan was fully disbursed by October 29, 1975 when the
Loan account was closed.
The quantitative objectives of the project have been largely
achieved except for the secondary teacher training institution whose enroll-
ment is only one-third of its capacity. The project has succeeded in training
secondary school science teachers but practical subjects have been introduced
into the project secondary schools to a very limited extent and the post-
secondary agricultural course originally envisaged operated only for two
years.
The physical implementation of the project was satisfactory; the
schools built under the project are simple, austere and, with one exception,
earthquake-resistant. However, the project encountered many problems of an
educational nature partly because important legal and administrative problems
had not been resolved by the time of loan signature despite the lengthy
project generation period (PPAM, paras. 9, 12).  The University, although an
autonomous body, was involved neither in the loan negotiations nor in the
drawing up of the UNESCO/UNDP Plan of Operations for the technical assistance
for the secondary teacher training school although this was a University
institution (PPAM, paras. 11, 12, 15). This UNDP/UNESCO technical assistance
came to an end at the time the new premises had been built under the project
(PPAM, para. 14). There was a lack of continuity in Bank educational supervi-
sory staff (PPAM, para. 21) and Bank managers did not take up with UNDP/UNESCO
the vital question of training for practical subject teachers (PPAM, para.
22).
A further point of special interest is that very careful project
implementation planning is needed where schools and the institution on which
they will depend for their teacher supply are included in the same project
(PPAM, para. 14).






PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA - FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 576-GU)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
1.        Following a Bank mission to Guatemala in September/October 1964,
the Government requested in early 1965 the visit of a project identification
mission.   This mission,  sent by UNESCO in May/June 1965, proposed a wide
range of project components at various levels in teacher training, agricul-
tural education, education and training for industry, and general secondary
education,  including considerable technical assistance.   Its first report,
issued in September 1965, was discussed with the Government during a February
1966 Bank mission.   Progress was slow because of evolving Bank education
policy, the need for the Bank to discuss with UNESCO and FAO, and changes in
the Government.   Further reconnaissance missions in August 1966 and January
1967 were undertaken.
2.        Following these missions, the possible project items under discus-
sion were narrowed down to elements in general secondary education, secondary
teacher training, agricultural education, and industrial vocational education.
Project items in the first two areas were regarded by Bank staff as reasonably
well defined while those in the latter fields were considered as presenting
problems. As a result a further Bank reconnaissance mission visited Guatemala
in June 1967 in conjunction with two members of the UNESCO project preparation
mission to determine collectively whether full project preparation should be
undertaken.  It was decided to proceed with full project preparation immedi-
ately, and the Government requested financing from the Bank in August 1967.
3.        The project was appraised  in the field in January-February 1968
and a post appraisal mission visited Guatemala in June 1968.   The project
as appraised, accepted by the Government and approved, comprised the cons-
truction, furnishing and equipping of:
(i)   a Secondary Teacher Training School (Escuela de Formacion de
Profesores de Ensenanza Media - EFPEM) for 700 students at the
national university;
(ii) extensions to the existing Technical Institute of Agriculture
(Instituto Tecnico Agricola - ITA) to bring its enrollment
capacity to 600;
(iii) six secondary schools in Guatemala City (total enrollment
capacity 5,520) and nine secondary schools in the provinces
(total enrollment capacity 7,880).



- 2 -
The major change from the original request was the deletion of 10 general
secondary schools in the capital city.   Total project costs were estimated
at US$12.6 million. In November 1968, a loan of US$6.3 million, one half of
total project costs, was approved and the following month the Loan Agreement
was signed.
4.        The  teacher  training  school  was intended  to  emphasize  science,
mathematics and practical subjects; its annual output of 300 graduates from
pre-service courses and 75 from in-service courses was expected to contribute
about 85% of the new and 50% of the retrained personnel required to fulfill
the government's objective of a fully-qualified secondary school staff by
1980. The project secondary schools were to provide facilities for program
improvements especially in science and practical subjects, with courses being
adapted to the requirements of pre-vocational training. Project assistance to
the agricultural institute was designed to increase its capacity from 275 to
600, to triple its output of agricultural skilled, workers ('peritos') with a
revised modernized curriculum and to begin new two-year post-secondary tech-
nician specializations which would graduate 80 annually.
5.        In  a  supplementary  letter  to  the  Loan Agreement the Government
stated that it intended to:
(i)   provide diversified curricula at the EFPEM emphasizing science,
mathematics and practical subjects;
(ii) establish guidance programs to divert students from academic to
pre-vocational streams in secondary education so as to help meet
manpower needs;
(iii) train guidance personnel to implement the above programs;
(iv) provide, in cooperation with the National University, post-secondary
level specialisations at the ITA; and
(v)   extend  appropriate  technical assistance programs to the ITA  (for
which USAID was already providing technical assistance).
There were four conditions of effectiveness of the loan: (i) the establishment
of the Project Unit; (ii) employment of architects; (iii) all necessary
action having been taken for the creation and initial operation of the EFPEM;
and (iv) the government having entered into an agreement with an institution
to provide technical assistance for the EFPEM.
6.        Some difficulty  was encountered  in meeting  these  conditions and
the loan was declared effective on August 15, 1969, four months later than



- 3 -
had been envisaged. In April, 1971 the Bank agreed to delete from the project
one of the schools in Guatemala City because of the proximity of other project
and non-project institutions. The Project description was amended accordingly
in May, 1972.  The Closing Date of the Project, originally January 31, 1975,
was amended to July 31, 1975.   The loan was fully disbursed by October 29,
1975 when the project was substantially completed.   Final project cost was
US$12.0 million equivalent, US$0.6 million below the original estimates.
7.        While the physical facilities provided under the project have
provided better educational opportunities at the secondary level, the major
objective of improving the quality of secondary education by the introduction
of practical subjects has been only very partially attained.   The ITA has
contributed to agricultural development by assisting in the supply of skilled
workers, but the other project objective of supplying specialized manpower
through ITA courses at post-secondary level has not been achieved nor has
quality improvement of the current upper secondary level course. The reasons
for these failures are explored in the paragraphs which follow.
II. PRINCIPAL ISSUES
Project Generation and Design
8.        The generation of the project extended over nearly four years and
involved no less than four Bank reconnaissance missions.   The project which
ultimately emerged, consisting of secondary schools, a training school for
secondary teachers and an extension to an existing agricultural institution,
appeared not to be complicated and there was direct connection between most of
its components.  However, the operation of the project institutions had been
insufficiently clarified during the project generation stage and serious
problems resulted.
9.        The EFPEM was expected to operate within the structure of the
National (San Carlos) University, and the Appraisal Report (para. 5.07) stated
that it "would function under the cooperative sponsorship of the University
and the Ministry of Education by an accord reached in February 1967."  This
form of words might have given the impression that the University and the
Ministry had reached an agreement on the EFPEM itself; this, however, appears
not to have been the case.  The February 1967 agreement has not been traced:
however, in its December, 1967 request to UNDP for the financing of technical
assistance for the EFPEM, the Government merely stated that it had signed an
agreement with the University on February 7, 1967 with the object of putting
into operation various joint projects for educational development. The exact
status of the EFPEM had not been defined and this was to have serious reper-
cussions on the project.



- 4 -
10.       The EFPEM was the institution which was intended to train teachers
in mathematics, science and practical subjects for the project secondary
schools and the Bank was therefore interested in its beginning to function
as soon as possible, because the trained teachers would be needed by the
secondary schools included in the same project.  Indeed it was specified, in
the Loan Agreement (Section 5.03) signed in December, 1968, that the EFPEM
would commence its academic activities in January, 1969 with an enrollment of
not less than 200 students.  These students were to be enrolled in temporary
facilities - presumably in the Faculty of Humanities - although the existing
teacher training programs in the Faculty had been criticised in the Appraisal
Report (para. 2.09) on the grounds that (a) they were only a subsidiary
responsibility of the Faculty, (b) cooperative arrangements with the employing
authority - the Ministry of Education - were lacking, and (c) factors other
than appropriateness of education and quality of performance were taken into
account in the appointment and promotion of teachers in the Faculty.
11.       As the EFPEM was a crucial project element and the difficulties
regarding teacher supply and appointment were appreciated it is difficult to
understand why the University, which under the Guatemalan constitution was
autonomous and was responsible for all post-secondary education including
teacher training, was neither involved in the negotiations nor a party to the
legal documents.   The Bank appeared to envisage an EFPEM separate from the
Faculty of Humanities but within the University; the Faculty wished the EFPEM
to be under its jurisdiction.  There seems to have been some confusion as to
whether all practical teacher training should be given on the EFPEM premises,
as the Bank apparently thought necessary, or simply under the auspices of
EFPEM as appears to have been the Government's intention at various stages
in the project, and this was never resolved. In discussions within the
University, after the Loan Agreement had been signed, other Faculties them-
selves expressed the wish to train teachers in the specialities for which
these Faculties were responsible.   For a time the Bank even considered that
the Ministry might undertake the training of its own teachers without refer-
ence to the University. These problems relating to secondary teacher training
should have been squarely addressed during the reconnaissance, preparation and
appraisal stages, but were not.  They were briefly mentioned in the back-to-
office report of the appraisal mission but were not mentioned in the final
appraisal report.
12.       Under the Loan Agreement (Section 5.01(f)) the Borrower was required
to enter into an agreement, satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, with an
institution to provide technical assistance to the EFPEM for a period of at
least five years. This technical assistance was secured from UNDP with UNESCO
as executing agency, and it was thus necessary for the Government to sign a
Plan of Operations acceptable to the Bank with UNDP/UNESCO before the Loan
could be declared effective.  This Plan of Operations was the subject of in-
tensive discussions between the Government, the Bank, UNDP and UNESCO in the



-5-
months following loan signature, with differing points of view being expressed
as to whether or not the University should be a party to signing the Plan of
Operations, the content of the Plan itself, and the obligations of the Univer-
sity in implementing it. In August, 1969, the Bank accepted a letter from the
Rector of the University to the Minister of Education as adequately involving
the University in the Plan of Operations although Bank legal staff were not
completely satisfied with the position because the University had merely
committed itself unilaterally and, as an autonomous body, could easily change
its position. It seems clear that interest in declaring the loan effective as
soon as possible influenced the Bank's judgment in this case.  The Bank was
aware that the position was not entirely satisfactory, recognizing "that from
time to time the Higher University Council would need to pass the resolutions
necessary to perform the program contained in the Plan of Operations."
13.       This Plan of Operations, though accepted by the Bank, was deficient
in not making specific reference to the training of practical subjects secon-
dary teachers as spelled out in the Appraisal Report and the Loan Agreement.
A draft of the Plan of Operations received in the Bank in mid-1969 stated that
the EFPEM would place special emphasis on the exact and natural sciences, and
that it would "train new secondary teachers every year for both the basic and
the diversified cycle."   Bank staff, describing the UNDPIUNESCO project in
January 1973, when it had encountered a series of difficulties, indicated that
the UNDP/UNESCO assistance was for "training new teachers in sciences and
mathematics, humanities and social sciences."  The PCR is confusing on this
point - in para. 4.24(a) it mentions that one of the functions of EFPEM was to
"train new teachers for secondary schools in the areas of science, mathematics
and practical subjects" (emphasis added).l/   The Plan of Operations, in fact,
never explicitly mentioned the training of teachers for practical subjects.
The EFPEM has not trained practical teachers, and the practical subjects
courses in the project secondary schools have not generally been instituted.
14.       The Bank, seeking to get the EFPEM operational, albeit in temporary
facilities, requested UNDP and UNESCO as executing agency to launch the tea-
cher training programs as soon as possible, and indeed EFPEM began functioning
on a limited basis as early as March, 1969. The UNESCO staff found themselves
in a difficult situation because of the ill-defined relationship between the
University and the Ministry of Education; further they were operating in
inadequate physical conditions to remedy which the project was providing
better facilities. By the time the new Bank-financed facilities for the EFPEM
had been constructed the UNDP/UNESCO project had ended. This situation points
1/ In the draft of the PCR prepared by UNESCO, no mention was made
of practical subjects at this point.



- 6-
to the need for especially careful planning where schools and the institution
to train teachers for them are included in the same project.  It also points
to the need to harmonize the inputs of technical assistance and physical
facilities.
15.       Similar difficulties to those experienced by the EFPEM also affected
the ITA where the post-secondary course was discontinued after only two years,
partly because of the failure to reach an agreement between the University and
the ITA on the accreditation of these students for further studies at univer-
sity le-vel (PCR, para. 4.36(a)). This potential problem also received insuf-
ficient attention during the project generation period.
Use of local architects
16.       At the time of the negotiations in late 1968, the Bank was of the
opinion that it was necessary for the Borrower to employ foreign architects.
The government representatives considered that, in regard to school construc-
tion, there were competent local architects.  A compromise solution was sug-
gested and accepted whereby local architects may be associated with foreign
consultants.   However, the Loan Agreement (Section 2.03(a)(i)) provided for
loan expenditures in respect of professional services only to meet payments in
currencies other than the currency of the Borrower. Eventually in August 1970
during implementation and after strong representations from the Borrower, the
Bank accepted the fact that local architects were capable of doing the work
and the Loan Agreement was modified to meet payments in the currency of the
Borrower.
Geographical Distribution of the Schools
17.       As already mentioned (para. 3), several schools in Guatemala City
were eliminated from the project, although the back-to-office report of the
appraisal mission indicated that the mission was prepared to support them.
Various reasons were advanced for these deletions at different times - a
shortage of sites in the capital; insufficient teachers to staff the Guatemala
City schools; the need for decentralization of facilities, with which the Bank
was in sympathy. A limitation in the available funds coupled with government
priorities and the need to supply each of the nine provinces with one second-
ary school appears to have determined final project content. However, as the
PCR indicates (Annex 11) all the schools built in the capital are considerably
over-enrolled whereas those in the provinces are generally underenrolled, thus
indicating that the projection of needs in the capital and those outside of
it was better in the original Government request than in the finally agreed
project, although the destruction of non-project schools in Guatemala City by
an earthquake in 1976 has contributed to this over-enrollment in the project
schools in the capital.



-7-
Project Implementation
18.       The PCR deals well with the implementational aspects of the pro-
ject. Implementation of the project took six and a half years, about twice
the length of time estimated at appraisal (PCR, para. 2.08); nevertheless,
this is about average for an education project.  In particular, the PCR draws
attention to the valuable continuity in project director (para. 2.01), the
lack of coordination between the Project Unit and the Ministry of Education
(para. 2.02), the inadequate briefing of the Master Plan architects (paras.
2.03, 2.04, 2.08), the delays in preparing the Master Plan and those resulting
from cumbersome government procedures for procuring sites, contractors ser-
vices and equipment (paras. 2.04, 2.08) and various deficiencies in project
design (para. 2.05). The impression gained from a review of the project files
is that the project director did a good job under difficult circumstances.
(a) Physical Facilities
19.       Project buildings are austere and, with one exception, successfully
withstood the February 1976 earthquake (PCR, para. 2.09(b)); they have,
however, important design defects (PCR, para. 2.05) and the lack of space
standard guidelines has resulted in ten different sizes of classrooms with
various lengths and widths (PCR, para. 2.09(c)). One of the schools had to be
redesigned because its site had been invaded by squatters and this caused some
some delay.   In part, because of the problems noted above  (para. 10), the
EFPEM does not contain facilities, as the Bank intended, for training prac-
tical subjects teachers (PCR, para. 2.09(c)).   The preparation of furniture
and equipment lists was not done in good time (PCR, para. 2.10) and delays
resulted because of this, compounded by incomplete bids and complicated
government administrative procedures (PCR, para. 2.11). Generally, the
furniture is of average quality and the equipment quality is good, although
some of the necessary equipment had to be included in the Second Education
Project.
(b) Costs and Disbursements
20.       Total project cost amounted to US$12.0 million.   Even though the
Bank loan of US$6.3 million had been originally calculated to cover one half
of project costs, it was fully disbursed in part because of amendments to
the Loan Agreement to finance local architectural assistance (para. 16) and
because in June 1973, the percentage disbursement against civil works expendi-
tures was increased from 45% to 60%, at the request of the project director,
because the project was experiencing cash flow problems. The long-term
justification for the June 1973 action is not clear within the framework of
50% financing; as 50% total financing was incompatible with the individual



- 8 -
disbursement percentages by category, the loan finally covered 52.5% of final
project costs.  It may be mentioned that the loan of US$14.5 million for the
second education project in Guatemala amounted to 55% of estimated total
project costs.   Actual disbursements (see Basic Data) reflect the delays in
project execution.
Supervision
21.       There were seventeen supervision missions during the implementation
of this project, or one every 4-1/2 months.   The missions were much more
concentrated in the first five years of project implementation (14 missions)
than in the last two years (3 missions). No supervision mission visited the
country during 1974. While the initial concentration was perhaps justifiable
as an attempt to solve the problems the project was facing, it is difficult to
justify the small number of missions towards the end of the project, as the
main problems remained.   No member of the appraisal mission ever supervised
the project, the two regular Bank staff members involved being assigned to
work on other projects instead. As in several education projects, continuity
of Bank effort on the architectural aspect was reasonably good while conti-
nuity on the educational side was lacking.  Only three individual architects
were involved in the seven missions including architects whereas six differ-
ent educators took part in the six missions involving educators.l/ In other
words, no Bank educator visited Guatemala more than once in the supervision of
this project.  Further, no agricultural educator ever supervised the project
despite its having a significant agricultural component.   Contrary to the
expectation that the PCR process is intended to reinforce self-evaluation by
operating departments and the borrowers (OMS 3.58, para. 2), the project
completion mission was staffed by UNESCO personnel who had had no involvement
in project supervision and who thus were probably less well placed than Bank
or Government personnel to describe the project experience.
22.       The Bank never saw to it that the Plan of Operations of the EFPEM
specifically referred to practical teacher training although this was a
crucial element in the project.   However, despite their lack of continuity,
most of the educational supervision missions reported on this major problem
confronting the project - viz. the lack of training of practical teachers at
the EFPEM (para. 13) and some recommended that this be taken up with UNDP and
UNESCO, who were respectively funding and providing the technical assistance
for the EFPEM.    Bank headquarters managerial staff did not act on this
recommendation, generally contenting themselves with reminding the Government
that under the terms of the supplementary letter to the Loan Agreement the
Government had stated its intention to train practical subject teachers. Bank
managerial staff did not take up the question with UNDP and UNESCO.  The PCR
states (paras. 3, 6, 2.13) that this failure to provide practical subjects
1/ The footnote to para. 2.06 of the PCR, referring to visits by
three different educators, is erroneous.



- 9 -
training was due to a re-orientation of the UNDP/UNESCO Plan of Operations by
the technical assistance team. The audit has found no clear evidence that the
original Plan of Operations was re-oriented in the manner described, and in
the Bank letters to the country where the problem is mentioned, no reference
is made to any such re-orientation or indeed to the Plan of Operations at all:
reference is made simply to the Loan Agreement.
23.       The Bank also pressed during  implementation for the UNESCO/UNDP
funded technical assistance staff to arrive in the country early, well before
the necessary physical plant was available and, because the funds for tech-
nical assistance were limited, the term of the technical assistance staff
expired just when the Bank-financed buildings were completed (para. 14). The
Bank also approved the designs of the EFPEM buildings despite their non-
inclusion of facilities for training practical subject teachers - on the
understanding that some 200 m2 of the unutilized space allocation would be
used for a technical subject workshop.   Subsequently, the Bank argued that
this 200 m2 space was inadequate for training practical subjects teachers
and the building of further workshops was requested by the Bank, presumably to
be financed outside the project.   During these discussions, the Bank paid
insufficient attention to government proposals to use existing facilities
outside the EFPEM for the training of practical subject teachers.
24.       The Bank's supervision efforts were complemented by visits to
Washington by Government personnel involved in the project.   These visits
were well-timed to help address specific problems and undoubtedly assisted
project implementation.
III.  EDUCATIONAL IIPACT
25.       The major positive achievements of the project were the improvement
in secondary education facilities particularly in the provinces and the new
stress laid on mathematics and science teaching.  The PCR (Chapter 4) deals
well with the educational impact of the project schools and attempts an
evaluation of this impact to the extent possible at this stage.  It records
that:
(i) secondary schools in Guatemala City are over-enrolled
while the provincial schools are underenrolled (para.
4.07). Overall enrollment of nearly 14,000 was 106%
of the capacity envisaged at appraisal;
(ii) practical facilities in first-cycle schools are under-
utilized and very few practical courses are being offered
in the second cycle (paras. 4.10, 4.13);
(iii)  there  are  serious  shortages  of practical  subjects  teachers
and the curricula for these subjects are unclear (paras.
4.13, 4.15);



- 10 -
(iv) the EFPEM has made an important contribution to the supply
of science and mathematics teachers (para. 4.15) but it is
seriously underenrolled and has never trained the practical
teachers envisaged (para. 4.26);
(v) the post-secondary course at the ITA was discontinued after
only two years of operation because of difficulties in accre-
ditation, a cool response from the private sector to its
graduates, and insufficient salary incentives (para. 4.36);
and
(vi)  the student workload at the ITA is too heavy and instruction is
given to groups which are too large (para. 4.37).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
26.       Physical  implementation  of the project has been reasonably good
under a Project Director who remained with the project for several years;
the schools built are functional and austere and resisted, with one excep-
tion, the 1976 earthquake.   The project succeeded in helping to introduce a
secondary school curriculum stressing mathematics and science but was less
successful in its other main objective of introducing the teaching of prac-
tical subjects in secondary schools.l/  The Bank did not try to ensure that
practical teacher training was specifically included in the UNESCO/UNDP Plan
of Operations for EFPEM and subsequently did not take up the practical teacher
training question with UNDP and UNESCO, the organizations responsible for
providing technical assistance for teacher training.   The Bank also under-
estimated the need to involve the University, responsible for teacher train-
ing, in the discussions and in the final Loan Agreement and Bank action
following project supervision missions was unable to resolve the problems.
Inadequate co-ordination between the University and the Ministry of Education
was an important factor in preventing better utilization of the facilities
provided for teacher training.
27.       These problems were possibly exacerbated by the Project Unit being
situated in the Ministry of Works and Communications and itself having
1/  The Regional Office considers that these remarks "do not reflect what is
discussed in paragraphs 4.09, 4.12 and 4.13 of the PCR, particularly in
regard to the project's help in introducing practical subjects into the
curriculum of the project institutions."

insufficient liaison with the Ministry of Education and the University.l/
These problems also affected, but to a lesser degree, the achievement of
project agricultural training where the post-secondary course has been
abandoned (in part because of accreditation difficulties with the University)
but general extension agent training is being undertaken, although under
imperfect conditions regarding student load and excessive class sizes.
28.       Experience with this project indicated that:
(i) closer attention to resolving the organization of the secondary
teacher training program was needed during the project genera-
tion period (paras. 9. 12);2/
(ii) the involvement in loan negotiations, and in the operational
plan for the relevant technical assistance, of the autonomous
University essential to the achievement of project objectives
was needed (paras. 11, 12, 15)-2/
(iii) especially careful planning is needed where schools and the
institution to train teachers for them are included in the same
project (para. 14);
(iv) insufficient attention was paid to ensuring that technical
assistance services are scheduled in relation to the procure-
ment of the physical plant needed for their effective utili-
zation (para. 14)
(v) the Bank initially underestimated the capacity of local archi-
tects to design and build the schools but subsequently amended
disbursement arrangements to enable their use (para. 16);
(vi) individual disbursement percentages by category were incom-
patible with the overall 50% disbursements envisaged (para.
20); and
(vii) the Bank did not take up with UNDP/UNESCO the question
of practical subjects teacher training (para. 22).2/
1/  In the Bank-assisted  second education project a specific unit of the
Ministry of Education has been named to collaborate with the Project Unit
which however remained in the Ministry of Works and Communications.
2/  The Regional Office has commented on each of these remarks to the effect
that even had the Bank taken the action suggested, this may still have
been insufficient to ensure success, because implementation of the project
was seriously hampered by the ineffectiveness of the Ministry of Education
and the lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the
University of San Carlos.

Dear Mr. Kapur:
This is in reference to the draft Evaluation Report on the First
Education Project, covered by Loan 576-GU, between the Government of Guatemala
and the World Bank.
Unfortunately, this Executing Agency is not in a position to give
its opinion on that report, since the persons who were involved in one way
or another within PEMEM in the performance of Loan Agreement 576-GU are no
longer working here. Moreover, all the documentation prepared during imple-
mentation of the Project has been forwarded to the General Files of the
Ministry of Communications and Public Works.
We hope that the other agencies to which you sent copies of the
report will be able to respond.
With regard to the investment of the First Project, according
to the disbursement of same by the Office of the National Controller, as
shown in its report of November 15, 1975, of the Q 12,600,000 budgeted for
the project Q 12,140,583.21 was spent, of which the World Bank contributed
Q 6,300,000 and the Government of Guatemala Q 5,840,583.21.

Due to some alterations to the program in the course of project
implementation, approved by the Bank, the final costs are slightly under the
limit of the target cost. Actual project cost of US$11,998,900 was financed
by the Bank loan of US$6.30 million and a government contribution of
US$5,698,900 with no cost overrun. (Annex 1 shows the comparison of estimated
costs and actual costs.) A technical assistance program provided by UNDP/
Unesco initially supported some of the teacher training programs at EFPEM.
An additional technical assistance program was provided to ITA by USAID.
Project Objectives
The project adopted the strategy of the interim Three-Year Education
Plan 1969-1971, which focussed on quality and relevance of secondary school
programs to manpower requirements, on improved teacher quality, on responding
to social and distributional targets and on improvement and extension of
higher education with emphasis on increased output in critical fields such
as agriculture. Within this context, the principal objectives of the project
were to:
(a) improve the quality, relevance and geographical distribution of
secondary education through the provision of facilities for teaching
academic and practical subjects at new schools, in the capital and
in the departments;
(b) raise the output and quality of secondary teachers through the
creation of a secondary teacher training school;
(c) increase the number of agricultural "peritos" and initiate
courses for higher agricultural technicians by providing new
practical facilities and renovating other facilities at the
existing Technical Institute of Agriculture to improve
curriculum and teaching staff qualification for both levels.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PROJECT EXPERIENCE
1.        The project supported the Government's policy to provide better
educational opportunities at secondary level, particularly to youth living
outside the capital city. This has been accomplished by the provision of over
14,000 places distributed throughout five schools in the capital city and one
in each of the nine departments.
2.        The other major objective was quality improvement of secondary
education by the introduction of new courses, including practical subjects
and reviewed science and mathematics courses. This has been only partially
attained. Although facilities for practical courses were provided--33 science
laboratories, 26 industrial arts and 30 plastic arts workshops and 43
special home economics rooms--they have not been fully utilized in many
schools. This resulted from the failure to implement agreed policies
concerning supply of teaching staff--which in turn led to shortages of
qualified teachers. Furthermore, the gap in the production of practical



- 17 -
subject teachers--industrial arts, home economics, and agriculture--aggravates
the situation. Moreover, adequate curricula have only recently been designed
for the latter courses. This has prevented the introduction of relevant
courses in project upper-secondary level schools. On balance the qualitative
improvements have been less marked than expected.
3.        The lack of an adequate teacher education policy has also impaired
the effectiveness of the Project Teacher Training School (EFPEM) under the
University of San Carlos. This school has only met a small part of the
project objectives set. Inadequate coordination between the University and
the Ministry of Education have been major factors in preventing a more effec-
tive utilization of the facilities provided under the loan. It is essential
that the Ministry and the University agree and act on a coherent plan for a
relevant teacher training program to improve the supply of teachers. An impor-
tant factor has been the unfortunate decision of the UNDP/Unesco technical
assistance team to re-orient the program of the EFPEM exclusively on science
and maths teachers, leaving the problem of teachers of practical subjects
aside.
4.        In the area of agricultural education the project-assisted Technical
Agricultural Institute has been successful in attaining output expansion fore-
seen and in contributing to agricultural development by supplying the quanti-
ties of trained manpower needed. The project objective of supplying special-
ized manpower through courses at post-secondary level has not been attained
nor has quality improvement of the current course in operation at upper-
secondary level. Internal efficiency and use factor of facilities could be
improved if prevailing staff shortages were corrected, and quality of the
program could be attained by improving curriculum and implementing a staff
development program as provided under the Bank-financed second education
project.
5.        Annex 2 shows that many requirements of the major covenants and
conditions stated in the side letters have not been met. Assurances concern-
ing measures designed to improve teacher supply have been only partially
fulfilled. The development of new practical curricula for secondary education
is another area where the Appraisal Report was over optimistic as to the state
of readiness of Guatemala, as it did not have adequate infrastructure to
implement the qualitative aspects of these courses.
6.        Technical assistance for EFPEM, one of the conditions of effective-
ness of the loan, was obtained by the Government from UNDP/Special Fund.
While this assistance contributed with success to the setting up and operation
of the Secondary Teacher Training School, the reorientation of its objectives
drastically limited its effectiveness.
7.        As for ITA, useful technical assistance was provided by USAID during
the two initial years of project implementation (1969-1970). It consisted of
the provision of advisory services and instruction.



- 18 -
8.        The project was administered by a Project Unit headed by a competent
Guatemalan director. Despite initial delays in the preparation of the Master
Plan, the civil works program, including design and construction, was executed
satisfactorily (two sites out of sixteen had to be changed).
9.        The buildings and equipment provided for all project institutions
are generally suitable for the purposes for which they were intended. The
principal bottleneck in the equipment procurement program was the slow prepara-
tion of equipment lists, due mainly to unclear curriculum content, personnel
shortages and lengthy government administrative procedures for contracting.
10.       In 1966, educational recurrent expenditures amounted to 21.6 percent
of total Government recurrent expenditures and 1.7 percent of GNP. In 1976
the respective figures were only 17.6 and 1.5 percent. This is because during
the period the annual growth rate of Government expenditures in real terms
(6.8 percent) was somewhat higher than those of educational expenditures (4.7
percent) and GDP (5.7 percent). This trend is inverse to that prevailing in
many countries. During the same period expenditures for higher education
increased significantly while those for primary education decreased (for
details see Annexes 3 and 4).
11.       The Bank and the Government can draw several lessons concerning
the implementation of Loan 576-GU:
(i) project objectives should have been more realistically formulated
and a more objective assessment of the various local factors
involved in meeting project objectives should have been carried
out. The Government organizational framework and its adminis-
trative capability to implement the project, desirable mechanisms
of inter-institutional coordination and cooperation, and the
regulations related to procurement should certainly have been
more thoroughly appraised and documented;
(ii) covenants in the Loan/Credit Agreement that would commit the
Government beyond its capability should be avoided;
(iii) when innovative elements are included with the aim of extending
project results to non-project institutions or programs on a national
scale, their feasibility (financial, organizational, administrative)
should be assessed realistically;
(iv) educational objectives should be defined as precisely as possible
and not be over optimistic;
(v) care should be taken, especially when the Project Unit is not
within the Ministry of Education, to ascertain that the conditions
do exist or will be effectively created in the country to allow
the Project Unit to function in harmony and with technical help
from responsible Ministries, and that after completion, the
Ministry of Education would be able to take over the projects;



- 19 -
(vi) supervision missions should provide for greater participation of
educators at all stages of project implementation and continuity in
Bank staff should be maintained to the extent possible;
(vii) the architect brief should include an overall indication of the
project's pedagogical objectives;
(viii)  all site works should be visited by the supervision architect
at least once during the construction period.
12.       To increase effectiveness of the recently completed First Education
Project and to facilitate implementation of future Bank-assisted projects, the
following suggestions are made: 1/
(i)  strengthen coordination and collaboration, particularly at the
working level, between the various Ministry of Education
departments and USIPE as well as between them and other agencies
involved in education: for example, between the University of
San Carlos (EFPEM) and the experimental school for the training
of teachers; between the Project Unit (physical development)--the
Curriculum section of the Ministry of Education--and the Educa-
tional Facilities Unit of USIPE and finally between the National
Planning Council (manpower forecasts) and USIPE;
(ii) the Ministry of Education should strengthen its planning and
administration functions as well as its staff development unit,
in particular within USIPE;
(iii) an assessment of medium- and long-term secondary teacher require-
ments by specialization should be made and a program for the
supply and upgrading of teachers should be prepared by the
Ministry of Education, in the framework of a systematic effort to
rationalize production, placement and retraining of secondary
teachers. Implementation of the program should be carried out
with the cooperation of San Carlos University, EFPEM included,
and other universities engaged in teacher education. This would
include incentives for trained teachers, the strengthening of
the supervisory force by an upgrading program and adequate
placement of specialized teachers;
1/   It should be mentioned in this context that during the implementation
period of the first project, a second loan was provided (1212-GU) which
incorporates several important covenants and conditions with the purpose
of addressing the main issues posed by the first loan. It is expected
that if these are adhered to, it would improve the impact of the former.
Indeed, in the agreement referred to above, the Government of Guatemala
and the World Bank have agreed, in effect, on the one hand, to take a
series of measures and, on the other, to assist with technical assistance,
fellowships, equipment and backstopping/monitoring in making the first
project fully efficient. The areas covered are mainly curricular devel-
opment, teacher-training and equipment aspects of upper secondary cycle
as well as administrative reorganization of the Ministry of Education.



- 20 -
(iv) closer coordination is recommended between USIPE and the manpower
section of the National Council for Economic Planning Secretariat.
This would:
- lead to a more rational distribution of vocational options
throughout diversified schools;
- facilitate regional or sub-regional integration of educational
activities to offer a genuine choice to first-cycle secondary
students;
(v)  the current discrimination whereby only the morning section students
of project secondary schools can fully use the available school
facilities (laboratories, workshops, equipment) should be abolished.
Students enrolled at the same school should have equal use of such
facilities even if they belong to other shifts or levels of educa-
tion. This would improve students' opportunities for a better
quality of education;
(vi)  as soon as place shortages derived from the emergency situation
(earthquake) are resolved, enrollment in project schools should
be reduced to standards compatible with school capacity. A school
map to determine catchment areas in relation to enrollment in
secondary schools should be prepared, in order to utilize more
fully the presently under-utilized provincial schools;
(vii)  to improve internal efficiency and use factors of physical
facilities of the Technical Agricultural Institute and to raise
quality of the education program: (a) the Institute's curriculum
should be revised and modernized by reducing the number of
weekly periods and making it more relevant to employment. Major
employing agencies should participate in such revision; (b) current
teaching staff shortages should be corrected and a staff develop-
ment program should be implemented as early as possible; and
(c) participation of the Institute in the provision of short
upgrading and in-service training courses to improve staff
engaged in the agricultural sector should be considered once
point (b) above has been solved.
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Sector Setting
1.01      The Ministry of Education is responsible for primary and secondary
general education and for technical/vocational education. Secondary agricul-
tural education is under the Ministry of Agriculture. All non-private higher
education, including secondary teacher training comes under the responsibility
of San Carlos University (National University). The system consists of six
years of primary education, a secondary program divided into a three-year first



- 21 -
cycle and a two- or three-year second cycle according to the courses selected.
Various types of non-formal training programs are provided by the Ministries
of Education, Agriculture, Health and Labor and other public and private
institutions.
1.02      At the time of initial collaboration between the Bank and the
Government of Guatemala, the system was characterized by moderate growth at
primary level and rapid growth at secondary level, although around 1966/67
only 6-1/2 percent of the estimated age group was enrolled. Efficiency was
low due to inadequate facilities and instructional material, a high proportion
of unqualified teachers (especially at secondary level) and uneven enrollment
distribution. Furthermore at second-cycle secondary education the unbalanced
distribution of enrollment with too much emphasis on primary teacher training
streams and commercial courses was not consistent with employment opportunities.
1.03      The quality and quantity of output at both secondary and university
levels was insufficient. Reconstruction of the secondary school system with
focus on programs to: satisfy manpower requirements, better distribute educa-
tional opportunity; improve teacher quality; and expand training opportunities
for agriculture were among the main sector goals of the interim Three-Year
Education Plan (1969-1971) outlined at the time of appraisal.
ProJect Formulation
1.04      As a follow-up of discussions between the Government of Guatemala
and the Bank, a Unesco identification team visited Guatemala in May-June 1965
to review with the Government its education development strategy. In November
1966 the Government of Guatemala requested Unesco's assistance to prepare a
project for possible Bank Group financing. This mission visited Guatemala
in July-August 1967 after Unesco/Bank Reconnaissance Mission had discussed
with the Government a possible detailed content of a project. The estimated
cost of the proposed project, as appears in the request documents, was
US$9,584,400.
1.05      A Bank/Unesco Appraisal Mission in January-February 1968 and a
subsequent post-Appraisal mission modified the content of the project by
decreasing the number of places proposed at secondary schools (from 22,360
to 13,400) and by modifying the total number of schools and the proportion
of schools in the capital city and the departments. The number of secondary
schools were reduced from 26 (of which 17 in the capital city) at preparation
stage to 15 (of which 6 in the capital city) by the appraisal mission.
1.06      There were no major disagreements between the Government and the
Bank over the educational objectives set forth in the Loan Agreement and
supplementary letter negotiated in September 1968. The Loan Agreement was
signed on December 16, 1968, and became effective on August 15, 1969. It
carried a supplementary letter setting forth four general educational objec-
tives as well as five major areas in which measures would be taken by the
Government of Guatemala for their implementation. The status of fulfillment
of loan and side letter covenants is summarized in Annex 2. The appointment
of the Project Director which was a condition to the loan had already taken
place prior to negotiations, but organizational and administrative difficul-
ties delayed the establishment of the Project Unit and hence loan effective-
ness.



- 22 -
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Management
2.01      In accordance with the loan agreement a Project UniL was established
within the Ministry of Public Works. The agreement stipulated further the
employment of a full-time Director, paid from the proceeds of the loan, and
supporting staff. In addition to the director post, filled by a national,
the Project Unit was gradually strengthened by the appointment of a project
engineer, architects, accountant and draftsmen. Due to administrative problems,
the recruitment of the project educator and/or equipment officer proved
particularly difficult.  The post was left unfilled on several occasions
with subsequent delays in the procurement of furniture and equipment. The
project director turned out to be competent and the fact that he remained
in his post for the duration of the project accounts for its relatively smooth
operation. On the whole, the project director and his staff devoted adequate
time to project implementation except for the lack of proper briefing of
the Master Plan architects, the problems in equipment procurement, and in
the coordination of education aspects. In addition, the project unit was
diligent in its communications with the Bank and quarterly progress reports
were received regularly.
2.02      The main weakness in project implementation was the lack of coordina-
tion between the Project Unit and the Ministry of Education, which was not in
a position to provide pedagogical support. The loan stipulated the establish-
ment of a Committee "composed of representatives of the Ministries of Communi-
cations and Public Works, Education, Finance and Agriculture, and of the
University of San Carlos to advise the Director of the Project Unit." This
committee did not adequately function in the early years of the project
(1969-74).
2.03      As specified in the loan agreement, architectural firms were commis-
sioned for the preparation of the Master Plan and for the design of the project
schools. One firm from Guatemala was selected as Master Plan Consultants and
nine Guatemalan firms of architects were appointed for the design of the
schools. Statements made by the Project Unit on their performance indicate
that the Master Plan consultants did not achieve all what was expected and that
policy changes in project design may have been contributing factors (see below).
2.04      The considerable delays in the preparation of the Master Plan, which
resulted from the necessity to revise inappropriate proposals made by the
Master Plan Consultants slowed down the work of most of the other firms at the
early stage of the implementation phase. It is clear that the Master Plan
consultants had not been properly briefed. Also, there were further delays
due to the dissenting views of the Guatemalan firm or architects arising out
of the Bank's observations on their preliminary designs in terms of construc-
tion standards and costs. The Ministry of Education finally established a
coordination committee (appointed December 4, 1970) whose task was to advise
the Project Unit Director on the preparation of the architect's brief.



23 -
2.05      The consultant architects' responsibilities were limited to the
design and production of bidding documents for each project item while the
Project Unit attached to the Ministry of Works was entirely responsible for
construction supervision. With incomplete guidelines at their disposal
(lacking in particular standard specifications), the architectural firms
produced a more or less adequate design. In some cases, however, the design
has not met economical, or pedagogical or comfort requirements. The most
important general comments are as follows:
-    the design approach of scattered linear buildings on the site
(versus cluster type) resulted in a high percentage of circulation
area and covered walkways (42 percent and more in certain cases)
with consequent increase in construction costs. Also, it created
problems of school administration and supervision;
-    the large span structures and the proposed structural design
solution were too sophisticated and expensive (these comments
were made by the Bank when reviewing the preliminary designs,
but were not given due consideration by the Government); and
-    the excessively large overhangs (up to 3.60 m) together with the
solid concrete vertical sunshades, and the absence of windows--
or limited size of windows--on one side of rooms, considerably
reduce the natural lighting efficiency and ventilation inside
the rooms. Many school directors have complained about the high
expenses involved by the necessity to use electricity all day
long.
2.06      During the implementation of the project there were 15 supervision
missions including a mission which combined supervision of the ongoing project
and preparation of the Second Education Project in Guatemala (Annex 5). There
was a high total of 110 days of field supervision and the average duration was
7.3 days one by a loan officer and in the rest an educator was involved. 1/
Six missions were carried out by an architect, three by an economist.  The
combined mission included general and technical educators, an economist
and an architect. Missions including at least a general educator and an
architect should be encouraged: a more continuous supervision by an educator
would have ensured Government progress in securing project educational
objectives. Sites visited during the various missions were mainly in
Guatemala City and nearby areas.  On one occasion only some sites in the
west provinces were visited. As regards the relationship with the consultant
architects, it is interesting to notice that certain written comments made
by the Bank, when reviewing preliminary designs, were interpreted by the
architect firms as a lack of Bank confidence in their professional judgment.
1/   Lack of continuity of staff is illustrated by the fact that three
different architects, three different economists and three different
educators visited the project.



- 24 -
2.07      With regard to the above it is recommended that:
(a) more continuity in staff be ensured in future supervision;
(b) educators be included to a greater extent in future supervision
missions at all stages of project implementation;
(c) supervision missions for future projects should also monitor
progress in achieving first project educational objectives,
especially regarding: orientation/guidance program for project
secondary schools, full use of their practical facilities,
choice of diversification for second-cycle streams and definition
of the content of these practical courses--in-service and pre-
service teacher training and the role of EFPEM in producing
practical subject teachers--enrollments, teachers and program
structure at ITA.
Project Execution
2.08      The implementation of the project took six and a half years (from
August 15, 1969 to October 31, 1975) as against three and a quarter years
estimated at appraisal (see Annexes 6 and 7 for forecast and actual implemen-
tation schedule). Initial delays in the selection and appointment of the
Master Plan consultants, lack of detailed guidelines from Bank for the prepa-
ration of the Master Plan and the resultant unsatisfactory performance of the
firm selected have been contributing factors to the above situation. Other
elements which increased the duration of the project were mainly lengthy
Government administrative procedures for site acquisition (Zones 5 and 19 and
El Quiche) bidding and contracting procedures for construction and procurement
of furniture and equipment.
2.09      Civil Works
(a) Sites. Most of the 15 sites selected during the appraisal stage
and completed during the implementation of the project give satis-
faction. In the course of the design phase two sites had to be
changed: one in Zone 19 (inadequate soil strength) and Chiquimula
(change in educational program). The site in Puerto Barrios has
imposed expensive unforeseen site works. Also the small area
left in Zone 5, after the site had been invaded by squatters,
has imposed a three-story building. The site selected for
the school in Zacapa, which had never been visited by the
supervision missions, gave serious drainage problems.
(b) Construction. Prequalification of building contractors and
bidding procedures were in accordance with Bank guidelines
and was carried out efficiently; 28 firms were prequalified
of which 16 participated quite actively in bidding. Although
some tenders were grouped on the basis of regional location



- 25 -
or identical programs, contracts were established for each
particular school with the exception of the Teacher Training
School and the demonstration school which have been merged
since they were to be built on the same site, and on the basis
of a design by the same architect. The performance of the
building contractors, most of them well established local
firms, has been of average standard. Contracts established
reasonable construction periods varying from 360 to 400
calendar days, and with minor exceptions contractors completed
on schedule. The construction is simple, the use of the same
building material--brick walls and concrete structure, no
finishes--for all schools accounts for a standard architectural
aspect of the buildings. The concrete structure proved very
resistant since only one school (Zone 5) out of 15 was damaged
by the February 1976 earthquake.
(c)  Space Utilization.  The project worksheets attached to the loan
agreement presented specific schedules of accommodation, including
area per unit, for each project item. These worksheets were
later modified by the Master Plan consultants who had suggested
alternatives based on their study of the curriculum. The proposal
was not accepted by the Bank as it was not consistent with Bank
efficiency criteria concerning teaching load and use factors of
teaching space. A revised version was approved by the Bank on
September 9, 1970. The program implemented did not follow
this version as shown in the comparative study between planned
and built facilities (see Annex 8). Although preliminary
designs of each project institution received the Bank's approval,
there were some ex-post modifications by the Government. The
most important changes are the reduction in the number of
laboratories (-12) and the inclusion of additional commercial
rooms (+10) in almost all secondary schools. Furthermore,
the commercial rooms, and plastic arts rooms indicated in the
worksheets for the teacher training shcool (EFPEM) have not been
built, thus facilities for home economics do not exist in a
school which is supposed to train teachers for the practical
subjects. The absence of well-defined space standard guidelines
and use of those based only on pedagogical requirements and with
little consideration given to the architectural determinants                   -
resulted in the types and sizes of areas for teaching accommoda-
tion (there are ten different sizes of classrooms with various
lengths and widths), thereby reducing the flexibility in the
organization and use of the institution. Teaching accommodation
in the project's institutions follow for the most part, the
principle of rotation--at least for the specialized rooms, work-
shops and science laboratories--in others the home-room principle
is followed with the consequent low-use factor averaging 50
percent of the total number of periods per week.



- 26 -
(d) Maintenance. The design of the schools has taken into considera-
tion the problem of minimum maintenance of the buildings. In
this respect the absence of finishes on both sides of the brick
walls, which therefore necessitates no painting, meet the require-
ments. Most of the schools are now in their third year of opera-
tion and are in remarkably good condition. Only minor repairs
(except in the school in Zone 5) have been necessary after the
earthquake in early 1976. However, there is increased concern
by the school authorities on new aspects in school operation
which are directly associated with maintenance problems.  The
most important is the rising vandalism particularly in urban
schools. Both the present enrollment beyond the school capacity
(as is the case in capital city project schools), and the shift
system when the principle of rotation is not applied, allocating
for instance a laboratory as "home class" for students of the
afternoon shift, encourages careless students in destroying the
premises. Since there is inadequate budgetary allocation for
maintenance, the directors of such schools are unable to carry
out the necessary repairs. In addition, to prevent stealing
of equipment, particularly laboratory equipment, some directors
have locked it in the administration block where it remains
largely unutilized. This is likely to hinder the envisaged
qualitative improvements in the teaching offered at the project
institution.
Furniture and Equipment
2.10      The first available lists of furniture and equipment were sent
to the Bank by the Project Unit in mid-1972, some three years after the
start of the project implementation. This delay was mainly due to: (a) the
problem faced by the authorities to reach an agreement over the content of the
curriculum for experimental schools and for EFPEM; and (b) the lack of pro-
curement specialist in the Project Unit, and administrative constraints
which prevented good candidates from applying for the post. (This particular
post remained unfilled for a period of about a year at the most critical
period).
2.11      Tendering procedures were carried out under ICB for the furniture and
equipment. Packaging of items was carried out to facilitate tendering and
delivery procedures. This initiative, however, did not bring the expected
results since none of the participating firms offered bids on the complete
list of items contained in each bid package. Contracts for furniture were
negotiated after tenders with ten firms and for equipment with fifteen firms.
Because of the incomplete bids and consequent delays, and the imminent opening
of schools for which construction was more advanced than the others (ITA,
Zones 6 and 7), procurement of furniture and some equipment (kitchen, dining
room and laundry for ITA and furniture and teaching equipment for the two
schools) were taken out of the packages and purchased using local procurement
procedures. This, however, resulted in further delays because of the compli-
cated administrative procedures for procurement during and after tenders.



- 27 -
2.12      The shortages of qualified teachers and of equipment together with
delays in delivery of that procured caused the authorities--with Bank
approval--to postpone the start of the second-cycle courses (ciclo diver-
sificado) in those schools. This, of course, delayed the achieving of the
objectives of the project. The procurement of the needed equipment was
later included in the Second Bank-assisted Education Project. This forced
school authorities to adapt to the situation. In Guatemala City, some
schools, when transferred to their new premises, brought along their existing
and obsolete furniture, to meet needs. The conditions seriously worsened in
urban schools when the enrollment increased far above school capacity with
overcrowded accommodation filled with inappropriate furniture (in Zone 7
arts and craft rooms do not have tables, stools in home economics labora-
tories are too low for the height of the benches, etc.). On the whole, the
quality of the furniture is of average standard. Tables and chairs for
social studies are of exceptionally good design. But the main defect
remains the fragility; already many of the schools are filled with broken
furniture. The equipment, science equipment in particular, is good.
Technical Assistance
2.13      The loan agreement stated as a condition of effectiveness the
acquiring of technical assistance and fellowships, for a period of at least
five years to support the development of the secondary teacher training school
(EFPEM). The technical assistance required was requested from UNDP which
initiated preliminary operations in 1968 and a tripartite Plan of Operation
was signed in 1969 by the Ministry of Education, UNDP and Unesco, to assist
in the development of all teacher training programs at EFPEM. However, at
a joint UNDP/Uneseo review mission in June 1972, the program was revised and
extended until July 31, 1974, but its scope and coverage were changed consider-
ably. The project was then reoriented to train teachers of scientific subjects
(and mathematics) only and to develop in-service education programs for
unqualified teachers in those subjects. But the problem was that it did not
make provisions for the training of teachers of practical subjects. In addi-
tion the program was reduced from 546 man-months of specialist services to
375 man-months and from 332-1/2 man-months to 113-1/2 man-months for fellow-
ships. The project provided for 14 specialists and one consultant for a total
of 312 man-months and seven fellowships for a total of 114 man-months, the
latter in order to strengthen the staff of the institution. The specializa-
tions included experts in the three basic sciences and mathematics, education,
technology of education, audio-visual aids and technical/industrial education.
The scholarships were for physics teaching (two), mathematics teaching (two),
chemistry teaching (two) and biology teaching (one). Two of these were local
scholarships. Only two of the scholars are still active in EFPEM. Counter-
part personnel included (in 1974) the director of the school and five teachers
on a full-time basis, seven on a half-time basis and 17 others on a part-time
basis instead of the contemplated total of over 40 professional staff. The
UNDP/SF project provided also for supplementary equipment in order to facili-
tate the operation of the school. The effective expenditure on audio-visual
aids was far below that envisaged in the plan of operation: corresponding to



- 28 -
48 percent 1/ of the estimated amount. For the science laboratories, the expen-
ditures amounted to 95 percent of the estimated figures. The funds initially
allocated to equipment for the workshop for producing teaching materials
disappeared from the revised version of the plan of operation, but an amount
equivalent to 20 percent of the initial sum was nevertheless spent for this
useful purpose. There are conflicting opinions as to the effectiveness of
the specialist services provided. On the one hand, their support to the devel-
opment of the programs for teacher training in science and mathematics subjects
was appreciated as well as their contribution to the effective teaching load of
EFPEM counterpart staff and to the production of text, materials and documen-
tation, in relation to the courses offered at the school. On the other hand,
some complaints were expressed--about their lack of leadership vis-a-vis their
counterparts and about difficulties in their personal relations--regarding
quantity of their output in terms of guides and teaching materials. It seems
clear too that their position, being recruited by the Ministry of Education
but operating within the National University with its autonomous status was
at times uneasy, and certainly affected by the difficult relations between
Ministry of Education and the University and the lack of sufficient counter-
parts. This affected unfavorably morale and consequently effectiveness of
the specialists.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
3.01      Annex 9 presents a comparative study between appraisal estimates
and actual costs. The actual total cost of the project was US$11,998,800
against an appraisal estimate of US$12.6 million, with no cost overrun. There
are several reasons to explain this result:
(i) alteration of the program in the course of the implementation:
one school (Zone 11) was deleted and one was transferred from
an urban area (Antigua) to a less populated area (El Quiche)
with the projected enrollment (1,032) reduced by half (560);
(ii) with the exception of the schools in Puerto Barrios and
Quetzaltenango, all equipment for the diversified courses in
second cycle was deleted;
(iii) some equipment for the first cycle was still to be ordered at
the time of the closing date;
(iv) the working drawings for two schools (Zone 5 and El Quiche)
were prepared by the Project Unit, therefore reducing the cost
of professional services.

- 29 -
Construction Costs
3.02      Annex 10 presents a comparative study between estimated and actual
capital costs in connection with the planned and built capacity of the schools.
For the reasons given above, actual construction costs showed an increased of
only 4 percent above appraisal estimates despite a 5.5 percent increase in
gross area for the 16 project institutions. Moreover, most of the bidding
took place at the time of the world oil crisis and construction costs went
up by 35 percent as compared to the 13 percent estimated at the appraisal
stage. The cost of two project schools which were built in 1974/75 (Zone 5
and El Quiche) increased by 100 percent and 50 percent, respectively. This
was because Zone 5 school had to be designed as a 3-story building and due
to extensive site works required in the other schools. The total construction
cost accounted for 74.8% of the total cost.
Furniture and Equipment
3.03      As only part of the furniture necessary for the project was purchased,
and equipment was limited to first cycle secondary schools (with the exception
of two schools), final costs for furniture and equipment were 8 percent and
11 percent below appraisal estimates, respectively) as shown in Annex 1.
Furniture costs accounted for 7.5 percent and equipment for 8 percent of the
total costs for the project.
Professional Services
3.04      Professional services and administrative costs account for 9.7
percent of the total costs. Professional costs concern fees for architectural
consultants, engineering and site surveys, while administrative costs are
those met by the Project Unit for site supervision during construction, admin-
istration of the project and also production of working drawings and tender
documents for Zone 5 and El Quiche schools. The combined cost represents an
increase of 7 percent over the appraisal estimates.
IV. PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOMES
4.01      The preliminary assessment for the secondary education schools given
below is based largely on returns to the questionnaires sent in advance to
school principals, teachers and students of the project schools, on observa-
tions and discussions during visits to a large sample of project schools and
on information obtained from USIPE. Most of the figures and findings refer
to school year 1976, as the closing date was mid-1975 and the full equipment
was distributed to all schools by the beginning of 1976. The latter is the
only school year to function on a normal basis with all project schools having
their full cohort of pupils. 1/ Few comparisons of project schools with
1/   Except Zone 7 school which had two grades only out of the three at first-
cycle level.



- 30 -
national averages can be made since the most recent school year for which
the Ministry of Education has published statistics is 1975. As for EFPEM and
ITA they were visited several times and discussions were held with their
directors, teachers and accounting section, and for ITA in particular also
with Ministry of Agriculture staff.
Secondary Education
4.02      A major objective of the project was to improve the quality and
relevance of secondary education as well as the distribution of secondary
education opportunities through the provision of facilities for teaching
academic and practical subjects at new schools located in Guatemala City and
the provinces. The project consisted of buildings, furniture and equipment
for: (a) four first-cycle schools (ciclo basico); and (b) eleven two-cycle
schools (basico and diversificado) of which one was to be a demonstration
school for the Secondary Teacher Training School, the other project item.
4.03      There have been changes in structure, number and location of the
schools since appraisal: 1/ in 1976 there were in total fourteen schools,
of which nine are first-cycle schools and only five are two-cycle schools.
Moreover, the earthquake of that year, though it did little damage to the
project schools (cf. para. 3.01), seriously affected their operation because
students from destroyed schools have been brought in so that the schools
accommodate two or even three shifts a day (see Annex 11 for important educa-
tional parameters of these schools).
4.04      The experimental secondary schools of the project were attached by
decree to the Project Unit (under Ministry of Public Works) for about seven
and a half years except for routine administrative matters. The director of
the Project Unit was to be advised by a committee 1/ which has never functioned
properly. The schools reverted finally fully to the Ministry of Education
around the time USIPE (Sectoral Unit for Educational Research and Planning)
was created (in November 1976), but it appears that the relevant ministerial
department was not well prepared for taking over these 14 schools with their
teachers and their special background. USIPE is, however, presently being
strengthened.
4.05      During the entire implementation period of the project, the Ministry
of Education was unable to provide assistance in formulating curricula and
syllabi, and in definition and choice of diversification at second-cycle
1/   At appraisal/loan agreement stage, the 10,040 places planned at first
cycle of secondary and the 3,360 places planned at second cycle were
to be spread among four first-cycle schools and eleven two-cycle schools;
at approved "Master Plan" phase the places were respectively to be 9,630
and 3,840 spread among three first-cycle schools and 12 two-cycle schools.



- 31 -
level. No relevant department was responsible for posting of qualified,
specialized teachers in the project institutions nor for keeping track of
the role and place of project schools within the overall educational needs of
the country. This may explain the considerable deviations in the internal
structure of the project schools from appraisal stage throughout the building
phase and up-to the present year. This is shown clearly in Annex 12 where
the structures contemplated at appraisal (1968), at Master Plan phase (1970),
as approved by the Bank (1970) and those existing in 1976 and 1977 are compared.
In retrospect, it is thus obvious that technical assistance to strengthen
planning and administration should have been included in the project.
4.06      The diversification of these second-cycle sections referred to above
(Annex 12) does not correspond to the ones expected and approved at the Master
Plan stage except, only partially, in one case (school in Zone 19, Guatemala
City). In practice up to 1976, the schools served as first-cycle experimental
schools only, and this was acknowledged in the supervision reports. The
reorientation was decided by the PEMEM office, without throughly discussing
the issues involved with MOE officials, when it became evident that not enough
equipment for practical activities at second-cycle secondary level would be at
the disposal of the schools. The second education project, therefore, included
financing of the shortfall in equipment.
4.07      The single greatest impact of the project was to increase student
places at 14 new secondary schools by 12,960. The actual enrollments in
1976 in the two cycles were respectively 12,413 and 1,535 which amount
respectively to 124 percent and 46 percent of the enrollments foreseen at
appraisal. Details are shown in Annex 11, and it can be seen that there is a
wide variation in the 1976 figures of enrollment as percentage of enrollment
capacity from one school to another. The table further shows that with the
exception of Jutiapa, which offers only 480 places, all provincial schools
were under-utilized with an average enrollment as percentage of capacity of
61 (62 if the enrollment of second cycle is also considered). In Guatemala
City the use factor is much higher, but in two out of five cases this is due
to the earthquake which has destroyed other schools within the catchment area
and caused a situation of real overcrowding in the Zone 7 school with nearly
3,000 students. The schools recruit their pupils mainly (around two-thirds)
from medium-low or low social stratas, as shown by the returns to the ques-
tionnaire from the school directors.
4.08      Annex 13 provides a more complete profile of a sample of students
from the project schools. There are many over-aged students, the average age
of the sample being fifteen years and four months for Grade 7 pupils. They
come from large families with modest background, 42 percent of the fathers and
35 percent of the mothers having at best completed primary education while
8 percent of the fathers and 17 percent of the mothers had no formal education.

also to be represented.



- 32 -
School attendance was good, although time spent on homework is for half of
them less than five hours a week. The replies corroborate staff statements
that science laboratories are in good use but contradict staff observations on
modest use of workshops: it is obvious that workshops are used more than the
science laboratories. One explanation might be the small sample of secondary
teachers of practical subjects (26) who have replied to this item of the
questionnaire and on the other hand the answers of students may refer, more
than those of the teachers, to practical subjects other than industrial arts
(arts, home economics).
4.09      In project schools the principle of rotation is applied.  In most
schools the science laboratory, the various workshops and home economics rooms
are used for the purpose for which they were conceived. However, practical
work is limited by lack of money for expendable materials, of qualified,
specialized teachers, of water, gas or electricity, and particularly for
science and typing, by too high number of students/class (average 47 but
five schools have 50 or more, up to 67). Three libraries are unoccupied
(absence of books, not included in the loan). Ninety percent of the storage
capacity in each school is not used at all. Most specialized rooms designed
for practical activities are used also for theoretical courses and half of
the available area then remains empty. In two schools the audio-visual equip-
ment is centralized in one administration room for security reasons; in two
Guatemala City schools the earthquake affected the facilities for teaching
the arts and typing.
4.10      Each school has a set of 66 science kits for the three different
science areas. These are under-utilized, partly because they do not fit
the syllabus for science, which is heavily biased in favor of biology with
very little chemistry, or because of inadequately trained teachers and the
lack of expendable materials or water supply. The application school in Zone
12 deserves a special mention: in addition to ordinary classrooms it has
two laboratories for teaching practice of science teachers as well as very
large areas and equipment for industrial arts and equipped rooms for home
economics, typing and accounting. By and large, the practical facilities are
under-utilized in time and space by the first-cycle students. It is therefore
recommended that when the emergency measures resulting from the earthquake
end, a school mapping exercise be undertaken to rationalize the utilization
of project schools in relation to the needs of their catchment areas. This
should allow for the proper development of second cycle with the right
diversifications.
4.11      Administrative measures should be taken to ensure that all students
now attending the project schools be given the opportunity to use laboratories
and workshops. This would require sharing the responsibility for and hence
access to equipment at present limited to the original, i.e., pre-earthquake
students of the project schools. Furthermore, the schools should receive suffi-
cient funds for running the laboratories and workshops; and adequate funds for
maintenanc-e should be put at the disposal of the Project Unit. Most of the
school principals report that the pedagogical equipment of their school in



- 33 -
particular for practical activities is good or normal. Audio-visual aids are
sufficient but there is a lack of reference books. The present state of the
physical plant is considered satisfactory.
4.12      The side letter to the Loan Agreement indicates the Government's
intention to reform all secondary school curricula (plans and programs of
study). No specific input was provided by the project to assist in achieving
this objective. However, the UNDP assistance to EFPEM produced some relevant
material, in science and mathematics. There has been no reform of study
programs since the project schools so far have only provided the first cycle
of secondary education which, according to appraisal was not to be changed but
"afford greater opportunities for practical work in science and industrial
arts." The project schools have one or two (in the case of Chiquimula, three)
of the three possible orientations: commercial, agricultural and/or industrial
arts. The commercial orientation provides four periods per week of commercial
subjects in addition to the normal weekly timetable. Nine of the project
schools have a commercial orientation, three have comercial/industrial
and Retalhuleu has both agricultural and industrial orientation.
4.13      According to appraisal, a "practical" stream was to be created in
the upper cycle. The courses of study "would be adapted to the requirements of
pre-vocational training." There were to be three types: technical/industrial
(for boys), home economics (for girls) and agricultural. No such practical
streams were operating in 1976, but in 1977 a timid but encouraging start was
made with the introduction of practical courses in three schools: construc-
tion trades in the application school in Zone 12, general mechanics in Puerto
Barrios and agriculture in Chiquimula. However, these courses suffered from
shortage or total lack of equipment. While the Appraisal Report was suffi-
ciently specific on diversification and the introduction of new courses,
the curriculum reform was inhibited by the lack of clear policy and inadequate
Government planning. In practice, project schools only provide better
facilities, equipment and more qualified teachers than the traditional
schools.
4.14      From a random sample of 68 teachers, project school staff appear to
be predominantly male (71 percent), between 28 and 48 years of age (72 percent)
(Annex 14). They are by and large highly regarded by their principals. Of
the qualified teachers in project schools about 68 percent are specialized
(most of the non-specialist teachers are graduates in "pedagogy" and 8 percent
of the specialized teachers do not teach their speciality). Their formal
educational qualifications by far exceeded the national average in 1976: for
the 14 (first-cycle) project schools an average of 76 percent of teachers were
qualified, against a national average of 25 percent (see Annex 15). This may
be partly because modern facilities provided at project schools encourage
retention of qualified staff.
4.15      The project schools are well provided with 87 specialized teachers
graduates of EFPEM in science and mathematics. There are, however, serious
shortages of qualified teachers for courses such as industrial arts, commerce
and agriculture, less serious in home economics and music, mainly because
EFPEM failed to produce these (Section 5.10). The private Raphael Landivar
University established for two years a training scheme in industrial arts and



- 34 -
this compensated somewhat 1/ for the missing output from EFPEM. As an excep-
tion there are a few cases of gifted and devoted non-specialized teachers (for
example with a background of psychology or pedagogy) assuming the workshop
activities of industrial arts--essentially wood and metalwork and soldering--
with considerable success.
4.16      The returns (Annex 14) of a sample of project school teachers confirm
the observation made during mission visits to schools, that, whereas one-third
of the teachers use textbooks regularly, more than four teachers out of ten
use them only occasionally. The Annex further shows that only one quarter of
the teachers claim to use the audio-visual aids rarely, and that excursions
and special projects are rather popular. The correlation between provision of
science and technology equipment and its use by staff is significant: a
substantially greater number of science teachers regularly arrange practical
demonstrations than do the workshop teachers. This may be explained by the
insufficient number of qualified workshop teachers. The predominance of
part-time teachers has always been a problem. In this respect the project
schools are a success since only 6 percent of the teaching staff is part-time.
This policy applied in the project schools seems to have had wider effects
since the proportion of full-time appointments in government secondary schools
has increased sharply within the last years.
4.17      The loan and side letter covenants relating to internal efficiency
of general secondary education stipulated that the Government would: (a) estab-
lish guidance programs to divert students from academic to pre-vocational
streams in secondary education, thereby (i) increasing the number of graduates
available for training to satisfy middle-level skilled manpower needs and
(ii) adjusting the flow into training for technician and professional fields
in relation to development needs; and (b) train guidance personnel to imple-
ment the above programs and appoint such personnel to the secondary schools
included in the project as well as to other selected secondary schools. The
project provided no physical inputs to assist in the achievement of these
objectives, except implicitly in that the premises of the secondary teacher
training school would serve to train guidance personnel.
4.18      Six out of the fourteen secondary project schools have a counsellor
("orientador") whereas the remaining eight have one or several teachers in
charge of this function. In all schools, however, one teacher acts as
"professor guia" responsible for giving personal and pedagogical advice to
students during their studies. No special training of guidance personnel
was provided and most of the counsellors are psychologists; they are in short
supply due to lack of established posts. Instead, posts had to be created
for the sub-directors of schools, when they became necessary to cover the
various shifts in the same school building. The mission was given to under-
stand that both San Carlos and Raphael Landivar Universities intended to set
1/   About 20-25 industrial arts teachers were trained.



- 35 -
up training schemes for specialized guidance personnel. However, the counsel-
lors tend to limit themselves to the orientation of studies without regard
to regional or national employment possibilities. Nor do students have much
choice of diversification in the second cycle in their home town or vicinity. 1/
It is therefore recommended that:
(a) the Secretariat of the National Council of Economic Planning
undertake a forecast of manpower needs at national and regional
level;
(b) the unit of human resources programming of the Secretariat of
the National Council of Planning and USIPE coordinate their
work in such a way as to create the various streams according
to demand;
(c) consideration be given to:
- coordination of educational provision in a given region
so that outgoing first-cycle students have a genuine choice
of a variety of courses in the second cycle;
- the provision of fellowships to adolescents who have to
pursue their studies outside their home town or vicinity;
- keeping a record of every school output, indicating the
orientation received and the type of studies effectively
pursued.
Due to lack of data it has not been possible to assess whether the increase
of facilities for science and practical subjects has been reflected in exam-
ination scores in those subjects. However, the returns obtained on the spot
from most of the project school directors allow a simple analysis 2/ of the
situation of their schools as regards educational efficiency.
4.19      For the fourteen project schools, the average "yield" 3/ of a grade
in 1976 was 55.6 percent compared with 49.9 percent for the national average.
For a sample of eight schools drop-outs during the school year were less than
1/   Most of the students in project schools have parents with low incomes
who cannot afford to send their children to pursue studies outside their
home town or in private institutions.
2/   There were no data on new entrants and drop-outs between grades nor on
movements of students between schools.
3/   Number of students promoted at the end of the school year expressed as
percentage of initial enrollment.

5 percent. The teacher/pupil ratio at project schools averages 1:28 whereas
the appraisal estimate was 1:27 (for schools which were supposed to include
many more pupils at second-cycle secondary). Compared to the average of non-
project schools at national level, these figures are very high as the official
sector has 1:20 and the private sector 1:9. This is because too many teachers
in non-project schools (in particular in the private sector) are recruited on
a part-time basis. The ratios at project schools vary considerably from one
school to another (minimum 1:21 and maximum 1:37). The average number of
students per class is 47 with a maximum of 60 per class. Since the earthquake
there are no enrollment criteria for project schools: by Ministerial decree
directors must accept all students who apply for entry. It is hoped that after
this emergency period a realistic enrollment policy--based on a school mapping
exercise--be established in order to regulate student flow in the country's
schools and in particular in the project schools. Annex 16 shows there has
been a considerable increase in total secondary enrollment reaching in 1976
133 percent of the enrollment projected at appraisal. Relative to these pro-
jections, the increase in first cycle (137 percent) has been greater than in
the second cycle (125 percent). Promotion rates from first to second cycle
were 88.5 percent in 1974 and 87 percent in 1975 as against 94 percent esti-
mated ten years ago.
4.20      In short, it is clear from the above points that the post appraisal
and negotiation teams over-estimated the Project Unit's capacity to deal with
the educational aspects and to take the main overall responsibility for the
project secondary schools. They also over-estimated the coordinating capa-
bility and spirit of cooperation, at working level, of the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Public Works (Project Unit). It is also evident
that lack of proper planning and knowledge of the project by the MOE officials,
impeded the implementation of practical streams at the upper secondary level.
The teacher training deficiencies in practical subjects have prevented the
quality improvements and the introduction of a work-oriented curriculum. It
is expected, however, that these problems will be improved through the correc-
tive measures mentioned earlier.
4.21      A considerable effort has been made to provide the project secondary
schools with better financial resources than the other public schools at the
same level (cost per student multiplied by 1.8, see Annex 17). In 1976
the total budget of project schools was Q 1,576,000 (see Annex 18); 5 percent
of the "resources" were extra-budgetary: contribution of the parents Q 5
per pupil per year), income from the school shop, cultural and sports acti-
vities, etc. The student cost per year was Q 127 (see Annex 18). In real
terms (Annex 19) this was only 56 percent of the loan forecasts, because
fewer administrative and service personnel than foreseen were used and
because teaching salaries (Annex 20) were very much lower than those used as
basis of computation (use of teaching personnel with lower qualifications,
lack of financial incentives). On the other hand the project schools have
great difficulties in paying for electricity, stationery; expendable and
teaching materials are often missing, working materials are brought to the
workshops by the students and there is no maintenance budget. Thus the
decrease in costs is accompanied by a decrease in the quality of education
and incomplete use of the facilities.



- 37 -
4.22      It will be noted that the cost per stuent per year is Q 110 for the
project schools in the capital city where the student/teacher ratio is 32.5:1
compared to the contemplated 28:1, and where the fixed expenses are spread over
an enrollment which is 40 percent higher than expected. This cost amounts to
Q 150 in the departmental schools where the student/teacher ratio is 24.3:1
instead of the contemplated 28:1, and the fixed expenses involve an enrollment
one third lower than expected. In order to operate in a satisfactory way,
taking into account an increase by one quarter of the expenditures for teach-
ing personnel, the budget of these schools for 1976 should have been (at
constant prices) Q 2,350,000.
Secondary Teacher Training
4.23      The project sought to raise the output and quality of secondary 1/
teachers and to train supervisors, directors of schools and provincial educa-
tional personnel through the creation, within the national university, of a
teacher training college. It provided buildings and equipment for this
purpose.
4.24      The loan agreement implied that the secondary teacher training
college would be established as a self-contained unit within the National
University of San Carlos. Furthermore, the school would be provided with
adequate technical assistance for at least five years and with appropriate
fellowships for training abroad. The institution's status within the
University and in the Ministry of Education and the technical assistance it
required from Unesco/UNDP have been the major problem areas of the project
up to 1972. Implementation has been impaired by insufficient liaison between
the Ministry of Education and the Project Unit and by difficulties between the
Ministry of Education and University of San Carlos. The Higher University
Council was slow to approve the status of the school and the UNDP project.
Agreement between the Government and the Council on the implementation of the
project also took a long time. The various functions of EFPEM were the
following:
(a) train new teachers for secondary schools in the areas of
science, mathematics and practical subjects;
(b) in-service teacher training;
(c) upgrade technically the supervisors;
(d) educational research;
(e) prepare and produce teaching materials for secondary schools.
1/   Both first and second cycles.



- 38 -
4.25      EFPEM would have physical facilities (700 student places) to enroll
about 700 full-time day students and to offer non-formal training courses to
about 180 in-service teachers. The annual output (some 300 new teachers and
75 in-service teachers) would contribute 85% of the new and 50% of the retrained
personnel required to fulfill the objective of a fully qualified secondary
school teaching force by 1980. The program of study would include three years
of regular courses (education, science, mathematics, practical courses) for
the pre-service teachers and one year for the in-service teachers; this course
was to be adjusted in terms of previous education and experience of the current
teachers.
4.26      The above functions have been only partially fulfilled, as there
has been emphasis on the training of science (chemistry, biology, physics)
and mathematics teachers, leaving aside the training of practical subjects
teachers. This has inevitably led to an underutilization of facilities, as
in 1976 the total enrollment (including all programs) was 235, which is about
one-third of the above-mentioned physical capacity. In addition, the annual
output in the last six years has been only about 60 (one-fifth of the planned
number). The highest proportion of graduates has been in mathematics (42%)
followed by those in biology (29%) and physics (13%). As noted earlier, well
over 80% of EFPEM graduates have been absorbed by the project institutions.
Annex 21 gives details on intakes and outputs.
4.27      There are several additional issues adversely affecting EFPEM that
should be mentioned:
(a) since 1977, EFPEM has interrupted its pre-service courses to
accept only in-service candidates. Because of a lack of sufficient
incentives, applicants for the former course were very few as the
basic salary after formal qualification is the same as for those
unqualified teachers already at the teaching force;
(b) the in-service training through 1976 was done at the 14 extensions
of San Carlos University (in five different regions of the country).
These programs, operating only on Saturdays, exclusively produced
graduates in "pedagogy and educational science," without real
specialization for a particular subject. Although about 550
teachers were retrained in this way (1976), the real impact on
the qualified teaching force is difficult to measure as these
teachers may be teaching subjects for which they were not
trained;
(c) precise information is missing to place the pre-service
graduates of the EFPEM school within a national perspective
(as teachers for secondary level are also trained in various
faculties of the National University as well as by three private
universities) and to assess in some detail their role in improving
the unqualified teaching force since appraisal; and



- 39 -
(d)  although some improvements have been obtained partly because of
the project, as the figure of qualified teachers rose from 1%
in 1965 to an estimated 20% in 1971, the 100% figure envisaged
by 1980 will be far from attainment.
4.28      Due to the reduced enrollments the premises are greatly under-
utilized. For instance, four classrooms are used full time by University of
San Carlos students, a number of storerooms are not functional, one of the
two language laboratories is used as a student games room and the industrial
art workshop is used as storage for broken furniture. Given the new orienta-
tion of EFPEM, the initially contemplated (at appraisal and approved Master
Plan stage) practical/special rooms for commerce/typing, music, arts/craft/
drafting and commerce/accounting have not been built, and no equipment was
ordered for them. Facilities, however, are on the whole well adapted to
actual program needs which are well below the ones envisaged initially. There
is a well-stocked library.
4.29      Should it be decided that the school will organize courses for train-
ing practical subject teachers, consideration will have to be given to the
absence of several special rooms as described above, and furthermore to the
insufficient size of the industrial arts workshop. In that case, the coopera-
tion of other universities, colleges or schools and use of some of their
facilities should be considered.
4.30      EFPEM's teaching staff is 36, of whom seven are full-time teachers.
A little over one-third of the teachers are fully qualified for the level
under consideration. The proportion of qualified teachers is highest (nearly
seven-tenths) in the area of pedagogy and psychology, it is over one-third for
biology and chemistry, but is very low in physics and mathematics.  Around
one-fifth of the teaching staff are graduates of the school itself. It is
recommended that efforts be made to recruit more qualified and full-time
staff and to upgrade the qualification of present staff, having in view future
full utilization of EFPEM potential. There is no evidence that the profes-
sional staff is doing serious research and development work in the field of
curriculum and teaching materials. This is aggravated by the lack of coordin-
ation with the Ministry of Education concerning these matters. It is there-
fore recommended that the cooperation between EFPEM and relevant Ministry of
Education departments be improved and that relationships be specified in some
detail, for instance with regard to organization and performance of super-
vision of teaching practice. It is further recommended that liaison with
USIPE for the development of research and Development in Education and in
particular in curriculum development be established and formalized. The
Ministry of Education should furthermore draw upon EPPEM staff and experience
in order to reorient the activities of the school to train practical subject
teachers and to develop a proper balance between in-service and pre-service
schemes as well as between regular programs on campus and extension work.
It is therefore recommended that the entire problem of producing secondary
school teachers be reviewed within a national perspective and that some measure
of harmonization be sought among the various programs of different universities.



- 40 -
This could be done for example by the creation of a "Commission for Teacher
Training" composed by teachers, MOE officials and professional associations.
A few immediate practical steps could be taken to ensure further remedial
action and to improve the efficiency of the project secondary schools mainly
by:
(a) ensuring a systematic in-service retraining of the existing
teachers of secondary schools;
(b) offering upgrading courses to a certain number of school
teachers, operating at primary level but with skills and
attitudes to perform at the secondary level; and
(c) employing on a priority basis, the output of EFFEM and in
general all other qualified graduates of teacher training
programs in the project schools.
4.31      No data are available on repetition or failure rates, but there
appears to be little wastage in the "regular" teacher training system (morning
programs for fellowship holders) of EFPEM. Although no specific information
is available concerning the efficiency of the extension scheme, it is evident
that among the student teachers attending the evening courses there is a high
wastage rate, in the neighborhood of 80% as an average since 1969. Only
60 teachers completed their training in these courses up to 1976. In addition,
the fate of the graduating teachers is not clearly known quantitatively; how-
ever, the mission has been told that perhaps up to 60% of those graduates are
taking the opportunity they had to study at EFPEM, as a first step for further
studies in view of another career: engineering, medicine, etc. The rest
(some 40%) is submitted by EFPEM to the Department of Personnel of the Ministry
of Education for possible follow-up. There is no preferential treatment for
entry in the project schools nor is there an overall policy in the Ministry of
Education in relation to training, placement, tenure or utilization of teach-
ing personnel in public school. Thus, it is recommended that something to
this effect should be developed.
4.32      The operation of EFPEM depends on two sources of revenue:  the
University of San Carlos (extraordinary budget) and the Ministry of Education
(ordinary budget). Total expenditures are Q 244,000 (see Annex 22) fellow-
ships excluded; this represents, in real terms only 40% of the expenditures
foreseen at the time of the loan (Annex 23). The explanation is that the
enrollments have reached only one-third of the projected figure. The student
cost/year was, in 1976 Q 1,039 and is higher in real terms than the origin-
ally estimated cost, because of the spreading of the fixed expenses upon a
smaller enrollment than expected and a lower student/teacher ratio (16)
against the planned 21. These costs could be reduced by full utilization of
the premises of EFPEM which would be well justified in view of the need for
qualified teachers.
4.33      It is to be noted that the expenses for maintenance are insuffi-
cient: Q 9,000 (which is partially devoted, in fact, to buying complementary
equipment) against the required Q 18,000. A more rigorous distinction



- 41 -
between operating expenditures and investments would allow better management
of the school budget.
Agricultural Training
4.34      The technical Institute of Agriculture (ITA) was to extend its scope
and improve the quality of its training by: (a) increasing the output at the
"perito" level or upper-secondary course (grades 10-12); and (b) establishing
a new two-year post-secondary technician course (grades 13-14) in natural
resources, animal husbandry, crop production and agricultural mechanics.
4.35      The above objectives were to be met through the provision of
new workshops, laboratories and dormitories (a total of 600 student places
including boarding facilities) and the renovation of existing academic,
administraive and communal facilities. The target was to bring the enroll-
ment from 275 students (1968) to 600 (1973). The annual output of the
"perito" program was to be about 45 (1973-80) and that of the technician
program (Tecnicos) was to be 80 during the same period. Social equity was
to be improved as ITA would cater for students from rural areas, particularly
those coming from the oriental and northern regions, where low-income
families live.
4.36      The project has met the above objectives only in global terms.  The
post-secondary course was discontinued after two years of operation and there-
fore the faciities provided are currently utilized only for the general
"perito" course at the secondary level.  Major reasons for change in policy
were the following:
(a) failure to reach an agreement between the Institute and the
University of San Carlos 1/ which would satisfy the Institute's
desire that post-secondary studies be accredited to students
wishing to pursue agricultural and allied studies at the
University of San Carlos;
(b) a cool response of the private sector 2/ to employ the
"technicians" from the specialized courses (grades 13-14).
In addition, salaries offered were on a trial basis and
well below those offered by the public sector to graduates
from lower-level courses (Grades 10-12);
(c) the civil-service salary scale did not include a level for
post-secondary course graduates, which discouraged students
from further taking the course at that level; and
1/   According to country regulations higher education studies are under
university jurisdiction.
2/   A major basis for establishing courses of this kind was the expectation
of large private employment.



- 42 -
(d) a high employment demand by the public sector for graduates
from the lower-level general course in agriculture induced
many graduates to take employment upon graduation instead of
enrolling into the post-secondary course.
4.37      For the reasons discussed above, the only course functioning now is
for the training of "peritos" grades (10-12). In 1977, the enrollment was
496 with an output of 180. The fate of these graduates is discussed in
paragraph 4.46. Further details on enrollments and outputs are given in
Annex 24. The qualitative improvements in the ITA Program have been obtained
only to a limited extent. ITA in general and the course in particular have
suffered from several deficiencies. The following are worth noting here:
(a) while this course was planned at appraisal to consist of
41 weekly periods, it was later increased to 55 and apparently
buildings were designed and constructed on the basis of
55 weekly period for the general course. It has not been
possible to establish at which stage of the project the
decision to increase the number of weekly periods over that
proposed at appraisal was taken. Because the school year
is too long (44 weeks) the result is a course with a total
of over 7,000 contact periods. No other school of the
same level is known to have such a large number of total
periods. The pedagogic value of this heavy workload is
questionable; it calls for a larger number of staff and
facilities, with corresponding higher capital and recurrent
costs. These points should have perhaps been examined more
closely by the Bank at the post-appraisal stage. However,
the lack of participation of an agricultural educator in
supervisions may explain the outcome.
(b) the current curriculum devotes about 45% of the time to
classroom work and 55% to practical work (field, laboratory
and workshop). Approximately 75% of the time is taken by
technical agriculture subjects, 17% by general subjects and
8% by socio-economic subjects. According to some of the
major employers, graduates from the Institute have diffi-
culties in communicating correctly their views in writing
and in preparing simple reports. Their training is also
deficient in farm management and economics; and
(c) current staff shortages have led to the division of students
into groups of over 100 under one teacher for classroom work
and into groups of over 30 students for field and laboratory
work, which are excesively large group sizes for an institution
of this type. The configuration of buildings, which were
prepared for other class-size and curriculum, further makes
effective utilization of facilities difficult, a subject
discussed in more detail under the section on "space use
factors ."



- 43 -
4.38      The above problems are aggravated by continuous changes in the ITA
top management and by deficiencies in its general administration. These are
not only reflected in the low quality of the training being offered, but in
persistent shortages of staff and lack of genuine motivation in their teaching
assignments, as the Institute has been regarded by many teachers only as a
place to have a temporary job. The more salient issues are:
(a) the high turn-over of directors (seven in the last seven years,
including those in an acting capacity) which poses a serious
administrative problem. The director's salary is not suffi-
ciently attractive and frequent student turmoil and indiscip-
line make the position even less appealing. It is thus common
to consider the position of director of the Institute as a
stepping-stone for some other more attractive government
position;
(b) ITA has not been granted enough administrative and financial
flexibility to deal effectively with matters requiring prompt
action such as those related to management of the Institute's
farm and goods procurement. For example, a central authoriza-
tion for the Institute to sell and replace a large number of
over-aged and unproductive cattle took nearly one year to
become effective; and
(c) staff shortages--due to unfilled vacancies and insufficient
budget positions--have been reflected in administrative
difficulties to utilize more effectively available physical
facilities. This shortage is partially responsible for the
decision to eliminate a large proportion of newly admitted
first year students (27 percent on average in the period
1975-1977), through an examination taken two months after
the beginning of the school year. While the Institute's
capacity is for 600 boarding students, the number of students
remaining at the Institute after such examination was only
496 in 1977, resulting in under-utilized facilities for the
rest of the year.
4.39      Corrective measures have been taken to solve some of the above
problems. Further improvements should be sought--particularly in curriculum
matters--by (a) reducing the number of weekly periods, (b) utilizing more
effectively the library as a means of instruction, and (c) adjusting subject
matter more closely to employment and development needs. From this latter
point of view, the participation of major employers in curriclum revision
would be useful. However, improvements can hardly be expected if the staff
situation is not adequately tackled by the government. There is need to
better assess the current level of qualification of the staff and their needs
for in-service training (Annex 25). Equally, a more aggressive recruitment
policy should be undertaken so as to ensure an increased number of qualified
candidates for ITA employment.



- 44 -
4.40.     The school offers lectures in ten classrooms whose original capacity
was for 40 students per class. Average weekly utilization of classrooms is
about 21 hours (27.5 periods of 45 minutes each) with a low use factor of
about 47 percent. However, the original ten classrooms have been converted
into six (by removal of partitions) for groups of 80-100 students each. This
has resulted in the paradoxical situation whereby classrooms remain practically
empty during mornings while in afternoons nearly 600 students overcrowd class-
room facilities whose capacity is only for 440 students. If the current
curriculum were implemented by dividing students into normal class-size groups
of 40 students each, the original number of classrooms (ten with capacity for
40 students each) would cope with the teaching load at a use factor of 88
percent (see Annex 26). This would require, however, an increase in staff to
about 45 full-time members and a better distribution of classroom utilization
throughout the total number of weekly working hours at the Institute (45).
The same annex shows that with the number of staff suggested the needs for
laboratories coincide with the number available (five) but a capacity of 20
students per laboratory would have sufficed instead of current 30 students
capacity. This not only leads to under-utilization of floor space (33
percent) but poses the question as to why, if 40 students was the original
classroom size, the laboratories were built for a capacity of 30 students
instead of 20. Although workshops are appropriate in number (three), the
floor space is far above requirements. The original amount of equipment
foreseen in the project at a cost of US$145,000 was reduced to US$91,000 due
to poor programming. This reduction will be, however, compensated by provi-
sions made under the Second Education Project. Since no sophisticated equip-
ment was delivered under the First Education Project, the staff have no diffi-
culties in handling the equipment provided. It is possible, however, that
a broader and more intensive use of equipment would be made if the staff
qualifications were higher.
4.41      Students seeking admission to the Institute are subject to a
rigorous selection process--written examination, psychological and vocational
tests--which is shown by the low proportion of students admitted in relation
to the number of applicants--about 250 admitted in 1977 out of about 1,500
applicants. However, the additional examinations taken by already admitted
students two months after the beginning of the school year reduce drastically
the number of students retained in the first year of studies. The proportion
of newly admitted students completing the upper-secondary course was estimated
at appraisal at 75 percent. Actual figures show that for the 1973-1975 to
1975-1977 1/ cohorts, the average internal efficiency met exactly that figure.
This proportion is likely to rise if a larger number of staff is made available
to the Institute; perhaps this would also make it possible to do away with the
examination noted above. The proportion of first-year students eliminated by
this examination is increasing, which is likely to result in a lower internal
efficiency in the near future.
1/   Output from the secondary course was estimated at about 130 of whom 45
expected to join the labor force and the rest to continue studies at
higher level specialization courses.



- 45 -
4.42      Recurrent expenditures for 1977, as foreseen in the Ministry of
Agriculture's budget, amount to Q 648,000 (Annex 27). All students are scholar-
ship holders, with free food and board. They pay Q. 4 as registration fee;
the latter is paid to the Treasury, together with cash profits from the school
farm (Q 18,000 to 20,000 annually). In real terms (Annex 28) this budget is
15 percent lower than the initial estimates.
4.43      This is mainly because teachers are too few (the teacher/student
ratio is 1:27 instead of 1:17 as expected). The proper operation of ITA would
also require more funds for student food (the present allowance is 70 centavos
per student/day) and for school plant and equipment. Taking these needs into
consideration as well as the present curriculum, which requires a teacher/
student ratio of 1:13, a proper budget for ITA should come to Q 750,000-780,000
in current prices. 1/ With a full enrollment (600 students) the unit cost
would then be Q 1,250 to 1,300, i.e. very close to the actual 1977 unit cost--
inflated because of the under-utilization of premises.
4.44      As mentioned above, centralization is an obstacle to proper manage-
ment of the farm. The present budgetary nomenclature for goods and services
makes it impossible to separate (a) farm and boarding expenditures, and (b) ex-
penses for the purchase of consumer goods, equipment purchase and repair, and
building maintenance. The adoption of a more functional nomenclature would
no doubt be a big step forward for the improvement of the Institute's manage-
ment.
4.45      No assessment is available in the appraisal report on projected needs
of agricultural technicians and therefore on the proportion of such needs that
was expected to be covered by the expanded output proposed in the project. The
stock of middle-level manpower trained in agriculture was estimated in 1967 2/
at about 800 and was about 1,800 in 1977. It is estimated that about 300
graduates have continued their studies at university level, reducing the
current stock for middle-level jobs to about 1,500, nearly double the stock
existing ten years earlier. A mission survey carried out among major agricul-
tural institutions (employing in total 1,100 middle-level agricultural tech-
nicians) indicates that a large majority of the total stock (52 percent) is
employed by the General Directorate of Agricultural Services, Ministry of
Agriculture, followed by the Agricultural Bank (16 percent), the Science and
Technology Institute (4 percent), the Forestry National Institute (2 percent)
and the Agricultural Marketing Institute (2 percent). The balance (24 per-
cent) is employed mainly by the private sector and by other public and semi-
public institutions. The expansion of the Institute with project assistance
has increased annual output from about 45 graduates (1968) to about 180 (esti-
mated for 1977).
1/   Present budget is Q. 648,000.  Additional requirements include:  teaching
staff Q. 152,000, maintenance Q. 30,000, food and maintenance Q, 20,000
to 50,000.

4.46      No unemployment of ITA regular course (grades 10-12) graduates exists
at present. In 1976, a survey carried out by the Institute of 210 graduates
shows that all graduates were employed within six months of graduation, 70% in
agriculture and 10 percent in non-agricultural activities, while about 20%
continued studies at a higher level. However, according to information from
the Institute staff and major employers, employment in the public sector is
not now as readily accessible as before, due to public budget constraints.
Private employment appears to be increasing although preference is given in
recruitment to experienced staff who are employed in public and semi-public
institutions. Some of these institutions, e.g., the Agricultural Bank, are
now reviewing salary policies to avoid losses of experienced staff. New
graduates from the Institute earn a basic salary of about Q 170 per month in
public and semi-public institutions, while the majority of staff earn Q
200-300, which is a reasonable level in relation to salaries earned by staff
trained at the same level of education in other areas.
4.47      Results of the Unesco mission inquiry among major employers indicate
that graduates from the Institute adapt well to working conditions, communicate
better with the small farmer than university graduates and have an adequate
technical level. Some employers have the impression, however, that quality
has deteriorated in recent years while others suggest the need to improve
graduates' level of communication, e.g. preparation of project reports, and
their knowledge of farm economies. An in-depth study of the educational
profile needed to meet major employer demands is suggested. Its results
should be utilized in modernizing the Institute's curriculum and in correcting
the deficiencies discussed above.

Gourcc: Mission from Budget 1977.
Notes:       P past years show that expenditures are practically the same as budget votes.
These headings cover purchase of consumer goods, purchase and repair of equipment and building maintenance all-
together; the distinction between the three headin-s seems theoretical,
/ Calculated on the basis of 70 centavos per student during 360 days; no account is taken of the incidence of
external aid (especially World Food Program) and of farm products consumed by the boarders (milk, vegetables,
MTaking into account the farm income, which is paid to the Treasury, actual expenditures amount to Q 630,000.

Notes (continued)
i Per student cost is calculated as expenditures divided by the number of students living in the Institute during
the whole year. In actual fact part of the first year students are dismissed after the first two months. In
1977, enrolments decreased thus from 585 to 494. This method of selection, which appears abnormal, is discussed
in the body of the report. The method used for unit cost calculation is Justified since expenditures at ITA
do not decrease as a result of lowered enrolment except food expenditures, estimated on the basis of 70 centavos
per student/day. Taking into account farm incomes paid to the Treasury, per student cost would only be around
Q 1,220.

Notes     / 1976 expenditures have been converted into 1968 prices using a deflation ratio of 1.31
for personnel expenditures, assuming that ITA personnel salaries increased at the same
rate as middle schools personnel. For other expenditures, a 1.78 ratio has been used,
in accordance with the ratio adopted in the national accounts at constant prices.
