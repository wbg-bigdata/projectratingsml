Executive Summary

Avian influenza is primarily a disease of poultry and other birds. Spread of the virus to other
animals has been reported, but current evidence suggests that bird to human transmission is
rare. Some recent AI strains appear very contagious among birds and are especially
pathogenic to some domesticated birds, including chickens and turkeys. Humans, as well as
domestic and wild animals that come in close contact with diseased or dead birds, may
become infected and develop the disease.

Bird flu viruses do not usually affect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird
flu viruses have occurred since 1997. The AI strain currently afflicting birds is the Influenza
A (H5N1) virus strain, which is an influenza A virus sub-type that occurs mainly in birds. It
has been around for about a decade, but became more pathogenic in 2003, and has spread
rapidly. It is now called a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

Outbreaks of influenza H5N1 first occurred among birds in East Asia (Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam) during late 2003 and early
2004. As that time, more than 100 million birds in the affected countries either died from the
disease or were killed in order to control the outbreak. Since 2005, the virus has spread further
into the countries of the former Soviet Union, Europe and recently into Africa. Human
infections of influenza A (H5N1) have been reported among people in close contact with
infected birds or bird materials in East Asia, Turkey and Egypt.

The H5N1 virus does not usually affect humans, even those casually exposed. In 1997,
however, the first cause of spread from a bird to a human was seen during an outbreak of bird
flu in poultry in Hong Kong. The virus caused severe respiratory illness in 18 people, 6 of
whom died. The mortality rate for the reported cases has been fairly high. Most of these cases
occurred from close contact with infected birds or contaminated materials. It seems that in
humans the receptors for the virus are located deep in the lungs (unlike receptors for other flu
viruses that are located in the upper respiratory tract) which may explain the need for closer
contact. There is no evidence that humans became infected through the consumption of
cooked poultry meat or eggs.

Infected birds shed AI virus in their oral and nasal secretions, and faeces. Susceptible birds
become infected when they have contact with contaminated excretions or surfaces that are
contaminated with excretions. It is believed that most causes of bird flu infection in humans
have resulted from contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. The international
spread of the disease in birds appears to be mainly related to legal or illegal transport of
poultry and pet birds, but there is also evidence that the virus may be spread by migrating
wild birds.

The overall objectives of the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
Response Project (AICP) is to minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry and
humans by the H5N1 virus and other zoonoses; and prepare control and response plan
to potential influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.
The AICP implementation in Nigeria will focus on public sector capacity building and
improving readiness for dealing with an outbreak of Avian Influenza in domestic
poultry.

The AICP is classified as a category B using World Bank screening criteria, implying that the
impacts are small scale and site-specific; thus easily managed or remedied during project
implementation.

In recognition of the fact that environmental and social concerns may arise as a result of the
project, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) commissioned
an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) study in fulfilment of the World Bank's
requirements for project appraisal. Due to the emergency nature of the project, the preparation

of the EMP as a condition for appraisal was waived; and that the EMP is now being prepared
in the implementation phase.

The EMP defines standard procedures and methods for incorporating environmental and
social concerns into the selection as well as planning and implementation of all sub-projects
carried out under the project.

The EMP addresses the adverse environmental, social and health effects of different carcass
disposal options. Appropriate disposal option were recommended on the basis of both
environmental and economics (operating and capital cost) consideration.

Available disposal methods including incineration, burial, composting, landfill, alkaline
hydrolysis and rendering were considered. The environmental impact, operational challenges
and the ease of maintenance were the factors analysed in recommending a disposal methods

The project will be coordinated from the Federal, State and Local Government level to ensure
proper implementation, while making sure that due consideration is given to all stakeholders
potentially affected by the implementation process. The institutional roles at each of these
levels for project preparation, coordination and implementation of the Environmental EMP
are adequately defined in this document.

A framework for mitigation and monitoring has been provided to ensure that environmental
problems or progresses are tracked at all stages of project cycle. The monitoring plan also
defines roles and responsibilities and defines the routine monitoring of sub-projects.
Monitoring costs are estimated and roles and responsibilities for monitoring are defined where
applicable.

Finally, a consultation plan is developed to provide a framework for achieving effective
stakeholder involvement and promoting greater awareness and understanding of associated
issues so that the project is carried out effectively within budget and on-time to the
satisfaction of stakeholder.

1.1 Background

Bird flu is a disease caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) virus. Avian Influenza (AI) virus
circulates naturally among birds, but they usually do not get sick from them. There are
numerous strains and subtypes of the AI virus and some appear more contagious and/or
pathogenic than others. Some recent AI strains appear very contagious among birds and are
especially pathogenic to some domesticated birds, including chickens and turkeys. Humans,
as well as domestic and wild animals that come in close contact with diseased or dead birds,
may become infected and develop the disease.

Bird flu viruses do not usually affect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird
flu viruses have occurred since 1997. The AI strain currently afflicting birds is the Influenza
A (H5N1) virus strain, which is an influenza A virus sub-type that occurs mainly in birds. It
has been around for about a decade, but became more pathogenic in 2003, and has spread
rapidly. It is now called a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

The outbreaks of H5N1 began in south-east Asia in mid-2003 and have now spread to a few
parts of Europe. To date, nine Asian countries have reported outbreaks: the Republic of
Korea, Viet Nam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic,
Indonesia, China, and Malaysia. Of these, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia have
controlled their outbreaks and are now considered free of the disease. Elsewhere in Asia, the
virus has become endemic in several of the initially affected countries.

During the first documented outbreak of human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1
avian influenza (Hong Kong, 1997), there was 18 human cases. Extensive studies of the cases
determined that direct contact with diseased poultry was the source of infection. However,
there was no evidence of the virus spreading from one person to another. Human infections
ceased following the rapid destruction ­ within three days ­ of Hong Kong's entire poultry
population, estimated at around 1.5 million birds. Some experts believe that that drastic action
may have averted an influenza pandemic.

In late July 2005, the virus spread geographically to affect poultry and wild birds in the
Russian Federation and adjacent parts of Kazakhstan. Almost simultaneously, Mongolia
reported detection of virus in wild birds. In October 2005, the virus was reported in Turkey,
Romania, and Croatia. In early December 2005, Ukraine reported its first outbreak in
domestic birds.

Prior to the present situation, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry were
considered rare. Excluding the current outbreaks caused by the H5N1 virus, only 24 outbreaks
of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been recorded worldwide since 1959. Of these, 14
occurred in the past decade. The majority have shown limited geographical spread, a few
remained confined to a single farm or flock, and only one spread internationally. All of the
larger outbreaks were costly for the agricultural sector and difficult to control.

In Nigeria, the first Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak was reported on
commercial farms in Kaduna, Kano and Plateau States in January 2006. Presently, the H5N1
strain has been confirmed on farms and in wild birds in 16 states namely; Katsina, Kano,
Kaduna, Yobe, Bauchi, Plateau, Nassarawa, Lagos, Ogun, Benue, Anambra, Rivers, Delta,
Kwara, Borno and Taraba. It is also confirmed in Federal Capital Territory, Abuja

This outbreak being the first in Africa has attracted considerable international attention, and
the country is presently receiving support from the World Bank, United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and
Agricultural Organisation ( FAO), Japanese International Cooperation Agencies (JICA), the
United Nations(UN), Department for International Development (DFID) and other bilateral
assistance agencies.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project                       Environmental Management Plan



WHO's Geneva Office has prepared an Action Plan "Responding to the Avian Influenza
Pandemic Threat" and is coordinating the global response to human cases of H5N1 avian
influenza and monitoring the potential threat of a human influenza pandemic.1 The WHO
Action Plan includes activities for individual countries and the international community to
prepare for and respond to a pandemic outbreak targeted at humans. The interventions in the
Action Plan are structured in three phases of a possible pandemic: (a) pre-pandemic:
supporting the FAO and OIE control strategy by increasing collaboration between animal and
human health services and strengthening early warning systems; (b) emergence of a
pandemic: containing or delaying spread at the source; and (c) pandemic declared and
spreading internationally: reducing morbidity, mortality and social disruption, and conducting
research to guide emergency response measures.
FAO2 is active in assessing AI outbreaks and organizing national and regional workshops on
emergency assistance for early detection and prevention of AI among poultry and other birds.
FAO's technical taskforce on AI provides regular updates on the spread of AI and on
technologies related to its diagnosis and prevention. Emergency assistance is supported
through the FAO Emergency Prevention System for trans-boundary animal and plant pests
and diseases and through their Technical Cooperation Program. The OIE3 works closely with
FAO, through the Global Framework for Control of Animal Diseases, and provides technical
expertise to countries at risk. Its guidelines on the standards to be used in the diagnosis and
management of epizootic diseases are used worldwide.

The World Bank has launched a Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) and Human
Pandemic Preparedness and Response, details of which are described in the GPAI program
framework document.4 This document presents the overall framework for World Bank
support to client countries to address the challenges posed by the current AI outbreak and the
possibility of a human flu pandemic. The overall objective of this Program is to minimize the
threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other
zoonoses,5 and prepare for rapid and well implemented response to influenza pandemics and
other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, the Bank will provide
support in the following areas: (a) prevention; (b) preparedness and planning; and (c) response
and containment.

The GPAI will finance activities under the following four components, which comprise the
recommended range of actions for preparedness and response:

i          Animal Health Component: to enhance HPAI prevention and preparedness capability;
           strengthen disease surveillance, diagnostic capacity, and virus research; strengthen
           HPAI control programs and outbreak containment plans; and improve bio-safety in
           poultry production and trade.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project                Environmental Management Plan



           and local (decentralized) coordination of activities, financial management and
           procurement.

The mainstay of outbreak management revolves around sound risk assessment, rapid action
when the first cases are identified, capacity building of institutions and workers in
containment and proper hygiene measures, compliance with all health and safety measures,
and most critically, clear, accurate and timely communications. The response measures
include the use of protective equipment, appropriate culling of infected birds and disposal of
carcasses and contaminated materials.

Most activities under the Avian Influenza (AI) projects are expected to have limited adverse
environmental impacts as they are focused mainly on public sector capacity building and
improved readiness for dealing with outbreaks of AI in domestic poultry. These prevention-
focused activities are expected to result in an overall increase of organization and
preparedness, which would lead to overall positive environmental impacts as project
investments in            facilities, equipment, laboratories, and      training will      improve the
effectiveness and safety of existing AI handling and testing procedures by meeting
international standards established by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).
This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into the
protocols and procedures for culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks. However,
adverse environmental, social and health impacts, mainly inadvertent spread of HPAI,
could occur in an emergency operation involving containment of an HPAI outbreak.

The World Bank requires Environmental Assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank
financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus
improve decision making (OP 4.01, January 1999). The Bank favours preventive measures
over mitigatory measures whenever feasible in order to emphasize the positive
environmental impacts and decrease or prevent all negative environmental impacts associated
with the project activities.

The Nigerian Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project
(AIHP) has been assigned World Bank environmental category B, since it involves moderate
environmental impacts that can be managed during implementation of the project.

1.2 Purpose and Intent

Carcass treatment and disposal sites are environmentally vulnerable due to the potentially
enormous numbers of dead animals' bodies with associated liquids and organic material that
should be isolated from the environment. The presence of pathogens in the carcasses can
present even greater environmental and health risks. Carcass disposal needs to be handled
correctly and quickly to minimize environmental impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil,
air and human health.

Since the Project supports investments for the disposal of carcasses and laboratory wastes, an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is required to be prepared in line with the
requirements of the World Bank (OP/B 4.01) and the existing national regulation (EIA Act
1992).

The EMP provides a framework for measures to mitigate adverse impacts and their adoption
during implementation and operations of projects. It summarizes the anticipated significant
adverse environmental impacts and provides details on the mitigating measures,
responsibilities, scheduling, costs, monitoring and supervision. It includes guidelines for
carcass disposal facilities and also specifies institutional strengthening and training
requirements.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



This EMP has been prepared in compliance with national policies, regulations and guidelines
as well as World Bank guidelines. It is designed to cover the safe disposal of carcasses as
defined in the animal health component. Specifically, the EMP focuses on:

    ·      identifying policy, regulatory and institutional framework; on environmental
           principles, standards and guidelines pertaining to the project;

    ·      comparing different disposal methods including burial, composting, rendering,
           incineration and open burning, and recommending appropriate disposal options;

    ·      assessing the potential environmental and social impacts of carcass disposal and
           proposing mitigation measures to effectively address these impacts;

    ·      establishing the timing, frequency and duration of the proposed mitigation and
           monitoring measures

    ·      establishing clear directives and methodologies for monitoring and supervising of the
           project;

    ·      developing occupational health and safety requirements for workers (carcass disposal
           and rehabilitation); and

    ·      developing guidelines for contractors to deal with the planned rehabilitation activities
           and civil works.

The overall goal of the EMP is to describe the processes that the implementing agencies will
follow to maximize its compliance with applicable guidelines and ensure that disposal of
carcasses is conducted in an environmental sustainable manner. The EMP includes the
following sections:

    · Project description: Brief description of the scope of the AICP, geographical areas of
           coverage and proposed implementation arrangements.

    · Overview of applicable international and national agreements, policies and law:.
           Summary description of applicable international and national agreements, policies,
           laws, regulations, standards and guidelines concerning animal disease emergencies,
           including animal and human health, and information on the responsible institutions
           and their roles.

    · Potential environmental impacts: Summary description of potential direct and
           indirect environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures.

    · Monitoring and supervision: Arrangements related to monitoring and supervision to
           ensure timely detection and reporting of conditions requiring remedial measures in
           keeping with good practice, furnish information on the progress and results of
           mitigation measures and institutional strengthening measures, and assess compliance
           with national and World Bank safeguard policies and international agreements.

    · Legal agreements: In keeping with good practice, implementation of major
           environmental and social safeguard requirements is reflected in the legal agreement
           consistent with the project implementation plan or operations manual.

    · Bidding contracts: Translation of EMP requirements into bidding and contract
           documents to ensure that obligations are clearly communicated to contractors.

    · Implementation schedule: The timing, frequency and duration of mitigation measures
           and monitoring included in an implementation schedule consistent with procedures
           and schedules in the project implementation plan or operation manual.

    · Implementation arrangements: An assessment of potential conflicting or overlapping
           responsibilities or requirements between veterinary, public health and environmental
           authorities.

                                        Chapter 2.0: Project Description

2.1 General Description

The Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project
(AICP) is designed to support the efforts of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to
minimize the threat posed by H5N1 to humans and the poultry industry and prepare the
necessary control measures to respond to a possible influenza pandemic. The Project will also
assist in preventing further spread of the HPAI to other parts of Nigeria not yet infected by the
virus.

The main objectives of the AICP are:

           to minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans by HPAI infection
           and other zoonoses; and

           to prepare for, control and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious
           disease emergencies in humans.

Achieving these goals will contribute to diminish loss of productivity in Nigeria, limit
regional spread of AIHP, and enhance economic and social prospects at the national, regional,
and global levels.

2.2 Project Components

The Project consists of the following four components:
           Animal Health
           Human Health
           Social Mobilisation and Strategic Communication
           Project Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation

2.2.1      Component 1: Animal Health

This component will support national prevention and control strategies proposed to cover the
country's needs over the short, medium and long-term, based on detailed assessments of the
avian influenza epidemiological status, the capacity of national veterinary services (VS) to
cope with the HPAI epidemic, and the vulnerability of the poultry industry to new emerging
infectious diseases. HPAI outbreaks must be addressed at source (i.e. on the animal side), as
the threat to human health will persist as long as the problem persists in livestock and poultry
flocks. It is, therefore, important that the primary focus of attention in the prevention of the
introduction and perpetuation of the virus in the country is initiated from the animal health
perspective.

(a) Strengthening HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak Containment Plans

This sub-component will provide support for the implementation of HPAI control and
eradication measures. These measures included in HPAI Control Programs or Emergency
Outbreaks Containment Plans are intended as a rapid mobilization to respond quickly and
effectively to HPAI outbreaks during the project lifespan. The following activities are
planned:

(i) Targeting virus elimination at the source: HPAI control strategies and programs will
include the principle of targeting the disease at source of infection: (a) stamping out of
infected and at-risk poultry (stamping out); (b) compensation to farmers and producing
companies at a reasonable market-oriented price; (c) disposal of carcasses and potentially
infective materials in a bio-secure and environmentally acceptable manner; (d) enhanced bio-
security at poultry farms and associated premises, through bio-containment and bio-exclusion;
and (e) control of movement of birds and products that may be infected, including controls at
the interface of infected/non-infected areas and border controls.




                                                               - 6 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project          Environmental Management Plan



(ii) Vaccination campaigns: This activity will support the vaccination of poultry. Ring
vaccination will be employed around newly infected, depopulated hotspot areas, in parallel
with stamping out and targeted, strategic field surveillance and epidemiological studies to
identify virus sources, selection of priority hot spots, imposition of transport bans, and post-
vaccination monitoring. A DIVA vaccine, using a strain different from H5N1, will be used to
allow laboratory differentiation between vaccinated and infected poultry, especially during
post-vaccination serological monitoring. The use of non-vaccinated sentinel domestic ducks
and chickens is essential to monitor vaccinated domestic poultry flocks. The activity will also
provide capacity building in vaccine quality control at the national level to ensure that the
vaccines used conform with those of the World Organization for Animal Health (Office
International des Epizooties ­ OIE). The adoption of a poultry vaccination policy for HPAI is
still being considered by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), in the context of local
poultry production systems.

(iii) Bio-safety for at-risk stakeholders: Due to the highly pathogenic nature of the AI virus to
humans, particularly the Asian H5N1 strain, training of people in contact with the live virus
will be supported. Adequate resources will be allocated for training and equipment (bio-safety
hoods and appropriate personal protective clothing) for laboratory workers, poultry farm
workers, and poultry vaccinators.

(b) Strengthening Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity and Applied Research

As part of the control strategy for an HPAI infected country like Nigeria, the proposed sub-
component will support activities to strengthen national VS, including the private and related
sectors operating under its authority, enhance animal disease surveillance, diagnostic and
PAI-dedicated research capabilities. The sub-component will consist of the following
activities:

(i) Strengthening of veterinary services: Based on the evaluation of VS and related services,
support will be provided to strengthen national VS to bring them in line with OIE standards.
This would be a gradual process, and, under the aegis of project objectives, would prioritize
HPAI control-dedicated strengthening.

(ii) Strengthening animal disease surveillance and epidemiological analysis: The activity
will support: (a) shifting from passive to active, targeted surveillance, supported by sound
epidemiological principles; (b) improving animal health information flow among relevant
agencies; (c) early detection and timely reporting and follow-up of suspected or positive
cases; (d) public and community-based surveillance networks by establishing a community-
based early warning system, utilizing existing human infrastructures at the village level; and
(e) routine serological surveys and epidemio-surveillance.

(iii) Upgrading diagnostic capacity: The activity will support the upgrading of the
laboratories earmarked to carry out diagnostics for HPAI. The NVRI will be upgraded to
contain a BSL-3 facility and will be expected to carry out virus isolation and identification
and any other isolate characterization, while the VTHs at Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka, Sokoto,
and Zaria will be upgraded to conduct PCR and serological testing. An acceptable bio-safe
environment will be created in these laboratories.

(c) Strengthening of Veterinary Quarantine Services

This sub-component serves to upgrade the technical capacity of quarantine inspectors in
enforcing quarantine regulations, and improve inspection procedures. It contains the
following activities:

(i) Strengthening information transfer: This is to ensure that disease information generated
from quarantine inspections feeds rapidly to decision makers to allow for the timely banning
of infected poultry and poultry products from infected countries.




                                                               - 7 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project          Environmental Management Plan



(ii) Provide training in quarantine protocols, pre-entry inspections, reporting and in-transit
clearance of livestock and poultry shipments at all land, sea, and air-based ports of entry.

(d) Strengthening Applied Veterinary Research

While a range of methodologies and tools are available to control HPAI, there are aspects of
the disease that are not clearly understood. While some of these researchable issues are
beyond the scope of this program, it is proposed that funding be provided for applied research
into and field studies dedicated to HPAI disease dynamics.

(e) Enhancing Legal and Regulatory Frameworks for Trans-boundary Disease Prevention
and Preparedness Capability

This sub-component supports strengthening of the regulatory framework to address key
policy issues to ensure that the recommended disease control, prevention and eradication
measures are implemented in a uniform and effective way and in accordance with OIE
standards and guidelines. In addition, support will be provided to review existing regulations
and policies, will fund related policy studies and dissemination workshops and will include
workshops and will include a focus on trans-boundary animal diseases. Specifically, this sub-
component will support key institutional issues, including the following activities:

(i) Rapid assessment of national veterinary services: The ability of Nigeria to prevent, detect
and control an HPAI epidemic depends on the quality of its national VS. To be effective,
national VS should operate on scientific principles and, to be effective, be technically
independent from political pressures. In terms of the emergency response, this will be
medium-term activity.

(ii) Updating the National Emergency Contingency Plan for HPAI: Building on existing
preparedness and action plans to prevent and control HPAI epidemics in domestic poultry,
water fowl, and wild birds, a team of national and international consultants will assist the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) in updating the existing
Emergency Contingency Plan. The Plan will be accompanied by operations manuals,
outlining in detail the steps to be taken at all levels of VS.

(iii) Human capacity building: The activity will support participation of Veterinary and
Livestock Services officials and project staff in regional and international information
exchanges and dissemination of AI. Laboratory technicians will be trained in HPAI-dedicated
diagnostic techniques, and epidemiology staff will receive refresher training in the
epidemiological principles of active field surveillance and data analysis.

(f) Improving Bio-security in Poultry Production and Trade

Improved bio-security in poultry production and trade is not only an important longer-term
strategy to guard against the damaging effects of HPAI, but also a complicated intervention
that requires understanding of the entire market value chain. This component will support
improved public hygiene in poultry shops and live-bird markets, bio-security regulations for
commercial farms, and devising rural poultry sector restructuring strategies to stop rural
households from living in close proximity with poultry.

(g) Compensation and Economic Recovery

The following three areas highlight the compensation issue:

(i) Establishment of a national compensation policy and national compensation fund: Early
detection and reporting as well as rapid response depend critically on the incentives for
poultry owners to report sick and/or dead poultry to their veterinarians, and adequate
compensation arrangements are absolutely essential. The existing Animal Diseases Control
Act (1988) provides for compensation wherever mandatory stamping-out/ depopulation of
diseased animals/birds takes place. However, appropriate guidelines for implementation have
to be worked out, including financing, fiduciary aspects, eligibility criteria, payment
arrangements, flow of funds, and transparency.



                                                               - 8 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



(ii) Support to economically vulnerable groups: Smallholder poultry stakeholders have little
or no access to animal health services and are therefore highly exposes to the consequences of
an HPAI epidemic. This activity will provide support to low-income groups that are
particularly vulnerable through activities specifically designed to increase small farmers'
awareness, improving animal health services at the community level, and providing grants for
additional compensation. This includes the development of pro-poor exist strategies,
including livelihood diversification, to benefit economically vulnerable poultry stakeholders
who have been severely affected by HPAI.

(iii) Alternative livelihoods for affected stakeholders: This activity will support smallholder
poultry farmers in a bottom-up, demand driven and equitable manner to resume poultry
farming or undertake a different livelihood, based on demand-driven proposals made by
stakeholders. The Project will provide:

           a) advisory services that will support new investment or restocking activities in
                 project areas on request by thematic associations; and

           b) seed money, through a credit mechanism yet to be decided, to eligible
                 stakeholders, based on their own proposals to undertake an alternative livelihood,
                 to be approved by the Compensation Fund.

Beneficiaries of the Compensation Fund will receive technical and management assistance
from reputable service providers, to be engaged by the State Project Office in order to equip
them with the necessary skills to properly utilize the fund. The Project will: (i) support
training and learning, knowledge sharing on good and bad practices; (ii) create and maintain a
database of service providers which will be made accessible to all participating stakeholders;
(iii) encourage the participation of service providers in the learning and experience sharing
events that will be arranged by the State Project Desk Office (SPDO); and (iv) receive
training on environmentally friendly practices for selected service providers.

Under the umbrella of the Community Thematic Association (CTA), the eligible stakeholders
will present their proposals for alternative micro-enterprises to the service providers for
evaluation and approval before receiving credit from the Fund, utilizing a credit mechanism
similar to that of the FADAMA II Project. Suitably qualified service providers will include, in
addition to the public Agricultural Development Programs (ADPs), private enterprises,
NGOs, research and educational institutions, other public sector departments, and
international agencies. The CC at the SFDO, which coordinates the Project at the state level,
will provide technical assistance to user groups for the evaluation of proposals from service
providers.

2.2.2      Component 2: Human Health

The human health component will support the implementation of HPAI prevention,
preparedness, response, and containment activities in the human health sector as contained in
the AIRP. The project, designed by the Rapid Response Team of the Federal Ministry of
Health, in collaboration with WHO, CDC, and other bilateral partners, took into consideration
the government's health policy agenda. This is geared towards integration of the Avian
influenza prevention and control strategies into a wider framework of strengthening the
capacity of the health sector to effectively address infectious diseases control.

To forestall a third phase human-to-human outbreak, short-term emergency strategies will be
supported while planning for long-term interventions. Initial support will focus on prevention
and reporting of human cases through the protection of farm workers and others who are in
direct contact with sick birds, social mobilization, and raising public awareness and
strengthening of the surveillance and laboratory in the affected areas. The long-term strategy
will mitigate the chances of a circulating pandemic influenza virus strain through (i) year-
round surveillance; (ii) effective and accurate methods of diagnosis; and (iii) social distance
interventions; (iv) vaccines (once they become available); (v) anti-viral drugs; and (vi)
strengthened medical services.



                                                               - 9 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project         Environmental Management Plan



(a) Enhancing Public Health Program, Planning, Delivery and Coordination

Funding will be made available for: (i) coordination and management of response at the
federal, state, and local government authority (LGA) levels; (ii) adaptation and establishment
of appropriate Public Health legislation; (iii) identifying and addressing gaps in effective
communication structures among the levels; and (iv) strengthening the capacity for effective
planning and supervision of implementation of the response plans.

(b) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems

To assess risks to public health and establish early warning systems to guide protective
measures, information is needed on the extent of AI infection in animals and humans and on
circulating viruses. National as well as regional surveillance systems must be improved
urgently in potentially affected countries. When outbreaks in animals occur, active human
case detection should be done by a coordinated animal-public health team.

National surveillance will be strengthened through the following activities: (i) review and
assessment of the current Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system; (ii)
strengthening and harmonizing existing IDSR to include HPAI; (iii) supporting field
serological and epidemiological surveys to increase case detection and sensitivity of the
surveillance system; (iv) strengthening existing and establishing specific laboratories on
Influenza Like Illness (ILI) in a phased approach; (v) providing technical assistance to states
and LGAs; (vi) supporting capacity building and participation in scientific meetings; (vii)
supporting hospital mortality studies; and (viii) enhancing community-based surveillance.

Current surveillance systems should be enhanced prior to the possible start of a pandemic to
assure that the high demand for timely information that can be anticipated in a pandemic can
be met. It is also recommended to carry out active sero-surveillance of the population at risk
to complement the animal health surveillance strategy. To this end, the Project will support
the following activities:

    · Improvement of health information and telecommunication systems;
    · Improvement of public health laboratory networks;
    · Training
    · Studies and research in epidemiological surveillance; and
    · Technical assistance.

(c) Strengthening Health System Response Capacity

Social distancing measures: The most effective measure to prevent contracting HPAI will be
to limit contact of the virus with the public. Therefore, the Project will support the
implementation of immediate term responses, i.e. the classic "social distancing measures",
such as school closings, backed up by a well-designed communication strategy. For the longer
term, options with industry to improve anti-viral and vaccine capacity will need to be
explored and supported. The social distancing measures will probably be enforced on advice
from health institutions, but these will not be the enforcing agency. Financing will therefore
be made available to develop guidelines on social distancing measures (in phases) to
operationalize existing or new laws and regulations, support coordination among the Federal
Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Information and other agencies and personnel involved
in pandemic control activities.

Vaccination: Under this activity, support will be provided for seasonal influenza vaccination
among high risk workers as a vital step to prevent an outbreak among humans. In case of an
avian influenza pandemic, when a vaccine becomes available, funding will be made available
for implementing an influenza program that rapidly administers vaccine to priority groups and
monitors vaccine effectiveness and safety. To this end, support will be provided for the
rehabilitation, expansion, and equipment of cold chain facilities for vaccines and other
perishable medical products. In addition, National Advance Purchase Agreements (NAPAs)
of vaccines will be considered. This measure will help operationalize a public-private



                                                              - 10 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project          Environmental Management Plan



partnership on influenza pandemic vaccines and achieve equitable distribution by matching
capacity with total pandemic demand.

Procurement and distribution of drugs and other supplies: The use of anti-viral drugs, while
not a panacea, will be part of the strategy to contain an avian influenza pandemic and to
reduce morbidity and mortality. Project support will be provided for the purchase, stockpiling
and distribution of anti-viral drugs and antibiotics; to determine the susceptibility of the
pandemic strain to existing influenza anti-viral drugs, and target use of available supplies; and
the adoption of measures to limit the development of anti-viral resistance and ensure that this
limited resource is used effectively.

Medical services: Assistance will be provided to the health care system for preparedness
planning to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential community services.
Strengthened clinical care capacity could be achieved through financing plans for establishing
specialized units in selected hospitals, treatment guidelines, and hospital infection control
guidelines. Also, strategies will be developed to increase hospital bed availability. A
substantial burden will fall on inpatient and outpatient health care services, and Project
support will be provided to rehabilitate and equip selected health facilities for the delivery of
critical medical services to cope with increased demand for services, develop intra-hospital
infection control measures, mobilize additional health personnel, including local and
international medical non-governmental organizations; training of health personnel, provision
of drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs, diagnostic reagents, including kits, other
operational expenses such as those related to mobilization of health teams and salaries, and
technical assistance.

2.2.3      Component 3: Social Mobilization and Strategic Communication

This component is designed to promote public awareness, participation and improved
coordination in the execution of emergency contingency plans as outlined under the National
Avian Influenza Plan. The main challenges faced in fighting avian influenza relate to low risk
perception, lack of motivation and trust, and livelihood issues. These are compounded by the
lack of knowledge of avian influenza among the general public and a wide range of
stakeholders, especially the small-scale family poultry farmers. To address these constraints,
the Project will identify lines of communication, social beliefs, practices and perceptions
which affect behavior and stakeholder habits, by improving public awareness and
information. The component will support improved coordination of the execution of the
national HPAI response strategies and plans, and information and communication activities to
increase the commitment of government, the private sector, and civil society organizations,
and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the
risk and potential impact of the pandemic. Activities will include:

(a) Information and Communication Services

Communication preparedness: Activities will include developing and testing messages and
materials to be used in the event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak by
enhancing the dissemination of information from the national to state and local levels as well
as between the public and private sectors. Cost effective, sustainable communication activities
will be developed through multi-media channels, counselling, schools, etc. These messages
will be incorporated into avian flu-specific interventions, as well as outreach activities of
involved ministries, especially the Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, and
Transport. Community mobilization will take place by outreach to the general public,
especially in rural areas, the church, and local community leaders. Radio messaging will plan
an important role in outreach. Specifically, support will be provided for: (i) the development
and distribution of basic communication materials on influenza, influenza vaccine, anti-viral
agents, and other relevant topics; (ii) general preventive measures such as "dos" and "dont's"
for the general public; (iii) information and guidelines for health care providers; (iv) training
modules (web-based, printed, and video); (v) presentations, slide sets, videos, and
documentaries; and (vi) symposia on surveillance, treatment, and prophylaxis.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



Collaboration with stakeholders: The multi-dimensional problems associated with HPAI
infection necessitate collaboration by a wide range of stakeholders, to be supported by broad-
based communication and information campaigns to improve public awareness. The major
stakeholders include various ministries (notably the members of the Inter-Ministerial
Committee), traditional and religious leaders, NGOs, civil society, private sector companies
and associations (e.g. large poultry production companies, farmers' and market women's
associations, veterinarians and farmers at the grass roots level). The activity will support
activities designed to improve the effective coordination and collaboration among these
stakeholders.

Developing capacity building modules and rapid social and communication assessment: This
activity will support the development and implementation of training courses in
communications methodology for several cadres of information and national orientation
officers, extension and veterinary staff as well as health workers at the central and local
levels. It will include preparation of local programs, preparation and dissemination of
information materials, and the provision of communications and information equipment for
use at the local and central levels as well as representatives of non-governmental and
community-based organizations involved in social mobilization activities at the grass roots
level. A rapid social and communication assessment will be conducted to investigate
household and individual health-related behaviours within their complex matrix of personal,
organizational, and social realities. The assessment will explore opinions, attitudes, behaviour,
and motivations of affected communities, leading to an understanding of health, livelihood
and other social development issues relevant in designing an effective communication
strategy.

2.2.4      Component 4: Implementation Support and Monitoring & Evaluation

This component will support implementation costs associated with project management,
coordination and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). In terms of project management and
coordination, the Project will support the provision of technical assistance for procurement,
financial management, and technical assistance/training and coordination. The Project will
support training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all administrative levels,
monitoring and impact evaluation assessments.

(a) Project Management Subcomponent

This subcomponent will support strengthening the effectiveness and quality of project
operations. The Project Management subcomponent will support new or existing institutional
entities and mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels of government for overall project
coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and quality of
project operations. It will support, at the federal level, the Project Desk Office at the NFDO of
FMARD and the Project Desk Office at the HSDP II ­ which will be responsible for overall
project coordination. At the local government level, the Project will support a Local
Government Desk (LGD) and a multi-stakeholder committee which would be responsible for,
respectively, screening and approving project activities and compensation proposals
submitted by the Community Thematic Associations (CTAs). The LGD will comprise of
three officers including an Animal Health Officer, Human Heals Officer, and a
Community/Monitoring and Evaluation Officer.

Specific items and activities to be funded include equipment, vehicles, operations and
maintenance costs, and minor civil works for office rehabilitation at the national, state and
local government desks. It will finance specialized technical assistance and training at the
federal, state, and local government levels aimed at developing capacity for coordination of
implementation. Because this Project will be implemented at the grassroots level, the National
Project Desk Office will maintain regular liaison with the state level offices and through that
office with the LGD, to ensure effective reporting and backstopping.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project          Environmental Management Plan



The AICP organizational structure and the command chain should be seen as transitory,
pending the emergence of a more relevant, tested and sustainable institutional arrangement. In
the local context, the risk of rivalry between various specialists/ professionals in government
institutions must be avoided. As soon as is feasible, while the management structure of
FADAMA II is being used to jumpstart the animal health component of the Project, the
FDL&PCS of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture responsible for delivery of VS nationwide
should strengthen existing VS delivery structures so that it can take full charge of
implementing the animal health component.

In line with OIE's "Performance, Vision and Strategy (PVS) for National Veterinary
Services", the development of an appropriate framework and technical capacity strengthening
accompanied by human and financial capacity strengthening should lead to privatization of
VS and greater interaction of veterinary service providers with the private sector.

(b) Support to National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI)

Under this subcomponent, the Project will support the enhancement of the current database
and policy formulation capacity of the NTCAI. The Project will finance two main activities:
(a) the establishment and operation of Avian Flu Control and Prevention data bank, building
on past experience of the relevant research institutions and governmental agencies; and (b)
capacity building for policy and strategy formulation and implementation. The Project will
finance the investment costs (mainly equipment) for establishing the data bank, training and
international and national consultant services.

(c) Monitoring and Evaluation

This subcomponent will support the development of simple, but effective M&E systems in
both implementing ministries and for the Project as a whole. It will also support the
development of an action plan for M&E, training in participatory monitoring & evaluation at
national, regional and local levels, and a mid-term evaluation workshop.

The Project will support training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all
administrative levels, and measurement of performance at various project milestones,
including three main elements:

    · Management Information Systems (MIS) integrating existing project M&E structures
           of Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP II;
    · Impact evaluation and beneficiary assessments to enhance project implementation
           performance;
    · Monitoring the performance of project activities and
    · Environmental Management Plan.

                         Chapter 3.0: Policy, Regulatory and Legal Framework

A number of national and international environmental guidelines are applicable to the
transaction. In Nigeria, the power to enforce all activities that might impact the environment
is vested in the Federal Ministry of Environment and Housing (FMEH) (formerly Federal
Ministry of Environment). Internationally, agencies such as the World Bank, IFC and other
financial organizations usually set environmental criteria for projects, which must be met by
project proponents before the agencies invest in them.

3.1        National Policies

The National Health Policy (NHP) of 1988

The policy aims at providing comprehensive health care to every citizen in Nigeria through:

    · adequate health education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of
           preventing and controlling them
    · promotion of proper nutrition, family planning etc
    · immunization against the major infectious diseases
    · prevention and control of locally endemic and epidemic diseases; and
    · provision of essential drugs and supplies.

The National Policy on the Environment (NPE) of 1989

The objective of the policy is to achieve sustainable development in Nigeria and in particular
to:
    · secure a quality environment adequate for good health and well being
    · conserve the environment and natural resources for the benefit of present and future
           generations.
    · raise public awareness and promote understanding of the essential linkages between
           the environment resources and development and encourages individual and
           community participation in environmental improvement efforts
    · maintain and enhance the ecosystems and ecological processes essential for the
           functioning of the biosphere to preserve biological diversity;
    · co-operate with other countries, international organizations and agencies to achieve
           optimal use and effective prevention or abatement of trans-boundary environmental
           degradation.

National Food Hygiene and Safety Policy of 2000

This policy is an integral part of the National Health Policy which aims at:

    · attaining high level of food hygiene and safety practices which will promote health,
           control food-borne diseases, minimize the risk of food related diseases;
    · stimulating and promoting legislations concerning food production, storage, handling,
           processing, preservation, trade, transportation and marketing; and
    · improving healthcare by ensuring that all food consumed in Nigeria is wholesome
           and nutritious, and accessible to the consumers at an affordable price

3.2             Environmental Legislation

Environmental Protection Agency Decree No 58 (1988)

The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) was established by Decree No. 58 of
1988 and charged with the responsibility for environmental protection. Following the
upgrading of the agency to a Federal Ministry of Environment (FMEnv) in 1999, the Ministry
was mandated to coordinate environmental protection and natural resources conservation for
sustainable development.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project               Environmental Management Plan



FEPA (now FMEH) has put in place statutory documents to aid the monitoring, control and
abatement of industrial waste including the indiscriminate pollution of the environment. The
statutory documents currently in place include:

   · The National Effluent Limitations Regulations S.1.8 of 1991, which makes it
         mandatory for industrial facilities to install anti-pollution equipment, makes provision
         for effluent treatment and prescribes a maximum limit of effluent parameters allowed.
         It also provides that all industries in Nigeria should be operated on the basis of Best
         Available Technology (BAT).

   · The Pollution Abatement in Industries and Facilities Generating Wastes Regulations
         S.1.9 of 1991, which imposes restrictions on the release of toxic substances and
         stipulates requirements for monitoring of pollution. It also makes it mandatory for
         existing industries and facilities to conduct periodic environmental audits

   · The Solid and Hazardous Waste Management Regulations S.1.15 of 1991, which
         regulates the collections, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes from
         municipal and industrial sources

   · The Harmful Wastes Decree(Special Criminal Provisions) Act of 1990 which provides
         the legal framework for the effective control of the disposal of toxic and hazardous
         waste into any environment within the confines of Nigeria

These guidelines issued by FEPA stipulate standards for industrial effluent, gaseous emissions
and hazardous wastes with which managers and operators must comply to improve the
environment by limiting pollution and other environmental hazards.

Animal Disease (Control) Act of 1988

This act regulates the control and prevention of diseases, with the object of preventing the
introduction and spread of infectious and contagious diseases in animals in Nigeria.

Land Use Act of 1978

The legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement in Nigeria is the Land Use Act of 1978
that was modified in 1990. The following are selected relevant sections:

    · Section 1: subject to the provision of this Act, all land comprised in the territory of
           each state in the Federation are hereby vested in the Governorate of each state and
           such land shall be held in trust and administered for the use and common benefit of
           all Nigerians in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

    · Section 2: (a) all land in urban areas shall be under the control and management of the
           Governor of each State; and (d) all other land shall be under the control and
           management of the local government within the area of jurisdiction in which the land
           is situated.

The Governor of each State has the right to grant statutory rights of occupancy to any person
or any purpose; and the Local Government will have the right to grant customary rights of
occupancy to any person or organization for agricultural, residential and other purposes.

3.3           World Bank Policies

The World Bank safeguard policies are designed to help ensure that projects proposed for
Bank financing are environmentally and socially sustainable, and thus improve decision-
making. The Bank has ten safeguards policies and these are::
    · OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment;
    · OP 4.04 Natural Habitats ;
    · OP 4.09 Pest Management ;
    · OP 4.11 Cultural Heritage;
    · OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement;
    · OP 4.10 Indigenous People;
    · OP 4.36 Forests;
    · OP 4.37 Safety of Dams;
    · OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways ;
    · OP 7.60 Projects in Disputed Areas.

The potential impacts from the project are mainly environmental/public health risks and social
impacts due to involuntary land acquisition are unlikely. The Bank Policy OP 4.01 is
applicable to all AI projects, and the Bank Policy OP 4.12 is applicable only when the project
meets its land requirements through involuntary acquisition.




                                                              - 16 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project           Environmental Management Plan



Impacts related to use of chemicals for disinfection of facilities, for culling of infected birds
and disposal of dead birds should be assessed on a case by case and suitable mitigation
measures developed in accordance with the relevant policy on pesticide and chemical
management (OP 4.09 on Pest Management). Potential impacts related to the disposal of dead
birds and other wastes in ecologically sensitive sites should be carefully assessed and the
necessary mitigation measures developed according to the policy on natural habitats (OP 4.04
on Natural Habitats).

The Nigerian AI project has been categorized as B implying relatively moderate adverse
environmental and social impacts. The project triggered the Bank's Environmental
Assessment Policy OP/BP 4.01. Thus the appropriate instruments to prepare are the Medical
Waste Management Plan (MWMP) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

Environmental Assessment BP/OP 4.01

This policy is triggered by any project that is likely to have potential adverse environmental
impacts in its area of influence. The policy covers the natural environment; physical, cultural
resources and human health and safety. A project that triggers this policy is classified as
category A, B, or C according to the nature and magnitude of potential environmental
impacts.

Category B projects imply that environmental impacts are largely site-specific, that few if any
of the impacts are irreversible, and that mitigation measures can be designed relatively
readily. The environmental assessment for this category needs to:

    -      examine the project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts,
    -      recommend measures to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse
           impacts, and
    -      recommend environmental enhancement measures

3.4             International Environmental Agreements

International protocols signed by Nigeria, that are relevant to the project include:

Basel Convention on the control of hazardous wastes and their disposal

This agreement aims to address the problems and challenges posed by hazardous waste. The
key objectives of the Basel Convention are:

    · to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in terms of quantity and
           hazardousness; and

    · to reduce the movement of hazardous wastes by disposing off as close as possible to
           the source.

The convention aims to protect human health and the environment by minimizing hazardous
waste production whenever possible through "environmentally sound management" (ESM).
ESM address the issue through an "integrated life-cycle approach", which involves strong
controls from the generation of a hazardous waste to its storage, transport, treatment, reuse,
recycling, recovery and final disposal.

Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants

This treaty aims to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic
pollutants (POPs). POPs are chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods,
become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms
and are toxic to humans and wildlife.

Bonn Convention on conservation of migratory species

The Convention aims to conserve terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout
their range. Migratory species threatened with extinction are listed on Appendix I of the
Convention. Signatories strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or

restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other
factors that might endanger them.

Nigeria is also a signatory to the following relevant international conventions:

    - The African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, The
           African Convention, 1968;
    - The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural
           Heritage, The World Heritage Convention, 1972;
    - The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
           Flora, CITES, 1973;
    - The Framework Convention on Climate Change, Kyoto Protocol, 1995;
    - The Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992;
    - The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste,
           MARPOL, 1972;

3.5        Safeguard Principles

Safeguard principles seek to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse environmental impacts,
social costs to third parties, or marginalization. Some principles of international
environmental law developed to guide damage to the environment include:

    -      Precautionary Principle: there is need to take precautions when the risk involved in
           waste cannot be ascertained.

    -      Polluter Pays Principle: a polluter is liable to bear the cost of damage imposed on the
           environment by waste he generated

    -      Duty of Care Principle: a producer of waste is responsible for waste handling,
           transportation and disposal.

    -      Proximity Principle: Hazardous waste should be disposed off as close as possible to
           the source of generation to reduce risks involved in transportation.

Nigeria lies between latitudes 40 00' N and 140 00' N, and longitudes 20 50' E and 140 45' E. It
is bordered by Chad to the northeast, Cameroon to the east, Benin Republic to the west, Niger
to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The total area is 923,768 sq km, of
which 910,768 sq km is land and 13,000 sq km is water.

The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 recognizes six geopolitical zones.

             -      North-Central - Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau, and Abuja.

             -      North-Eastern - Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe.

             -      North-Western - Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara.

             -      South-Eastern - Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo.

             -      South-South - Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo and Rivers.

             -      South-Western - Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo.

This Study has been structured to cover these geo-political zones, their physical topology and
the current situational analysis with regard to the AI incidence.

4.2       Description of the Natural Environment

The following are the biological, physical and socio-economic characteristics of the Nigerian
environment.

4.2.1      Physical Environment

Climate

The climate is mainly influenced by the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and its wet wind and
also by the air masses from the Sahara desert. Marginal alterations have being recorded due to
landform characteristics, configuration of surrounding shoreline and the generally flat
topography of the country. Northern Nigeria is known for its arid climatic condition, a more
tropical climate is found towards the centre, and an equatorial climate is found in the south of
the country.

Rainfall

There are two dominant seasons: the wet and the dry seasons. Rainfall, which is the single
most important element for defining the climatic seasons in the tropics, depends on the
interaction of the tropical maritime air mass and the tropical continental mass in Nigeria. The
annual average rainfall around the country is between 2000mm and 3000mm

Temperature

The climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures throughout the year. The average
annual maximum varies from 35oC in the north to 31oC in the south; the average annual
minimum from 23oC in the south to 18oC in the north. On the Jos plateau and the eastern
highlands altitude makes for relatively lower temperatures, with the maximum no more than
28oC and the minimum sometimes as low as 14oC.

Wind

Two principal wind currents affect Nigeria: the south-westerly dominates the rainy season of
the year while north-easterly dominates the dry season. Depending on the shifts in the
pressure belts in the Gulf of Guinea, these winds are interspersed respectively by south-
easterlies and north-westerlies in different parts of the year. The wetter winds prevail for more
than 70% due to the strong influence of the breeze from the Atlantic Ocean

Mean annual wind speed varies between 2 to 6 m/s. Speeds in dry season (November -
March) are lower. In the wet season (April­October), daily average speed could rise to 15
m/s. Values of up to 25 m/s are sometimes experienced due to inducement by convective
rainfall activities and relative diffusion.

Surface and Ground Water Hydrology

Nigeria has two major rivers, the Niger and the Benue, which traverse the northwest and
northeast portion of the country, then merge at Lokoja before draining down to the Atlantic.
There are several other rivers and quite a number of minor streams and rivulets that crisscross
the entire Nigerian land mass. These include the Ogun, Oshun, Imo, Cross, Osse, Nun and the
Anambra rivers in the south and the Kaduna, the Gongola, Katsina-Ala and the Hadeija in the
North.

Generally the water quality in the rivers of Nigeria is very good. The average electrical
conductivity in the main rivers ranges between 48-65 Umhos/cm2 and the total dissolved
solids (TDS) concentration is about 100mg/l. The pH is less than 6.5, although higher values
were reported in swamps and floodplains with levels of 100-150 Umhos/cm2. These rivers are
also low in nutrients, with an average nitrogen content of 0.32mg/l and a total phosphorous
content of 0.1 mg/l. The data indicate water of high quality according to FEPA limits.

Geology

Nigeria lies on the southern portion of the West African Craton. The geological setting
comprises broadly crystalline basement complex rocks and sedimentary formations. They
occur in equal proportions around the country. The former are highly mineralized and give
rise to soils of high nutrient status, although variable from place to place. The latter are found
in the south-east, north-east and north-west of the country, and give rise to sandy and less
variable soils that are deficient in plant nutrient.

Topography

Nigeria has varying landforms and much of the country is dominated by plains, generally less
than 610m above sea level. The eastern border with the Republic of Cameroun is lined by an
almost continuous range of mountains which rise to about 2,419m at Chappal Waddi, the
highest known point in Nigeria.

Soils Characteristics

The broad pattern of soil distribution in the country reflects both the climatic conditions and
the geological structure; heavily leached, reddish-brown, sandy soils are found in the south,
and light or moderately leached, yellowish-brown, sandy soils in the north. The difference in
color relates to the extent of leaching the soil has undergone.

Nigeria soils are highly weathered and are characterized by light texture, low pH, low organic
matter, low potassium levels, variable phosphorous levels with clay contents ranging between
7%-43%.

4.2.2      Biological Environment

Fauna

Animals found in both forest and savannas include leopards, cats, monkeys, gorillas, and wild
pigs. Today these animals can be found only in protected places as the Yankari Park, Gashaka
Gumpti Park, and Cross River Park. Rodents such as the squirrel, porcupine, and cane rat
constitute the largest family of mammals. The northern savannah abounds in guinea fowl.
Other common birds include quail, vultures, kites, bustards, and gray parrots. The rivers
contain crocodiles and a great variety of marine life.

In the rain forest, few large animals notably gorillas, chimpanzees, baboons and monkeys are
present. Crocodiles, lizards, and snakes of many species are also present. Hippopotamuses,
elephants, giraffes, leopards, and lions now remain only in scattered localities and in
diminishing number. Wildcats, however, are more common and widely distributed. Wildlife
in the savanna includes antelope, lions, leopards, gazelles, and desert hyenas. Nigeria also
abounds in bird life with a great number of species being represented.

Flora

Vegetation varies dramatically in relation to climate, soil, elevation, and human impact on the
environment. In the low-lying coastal region, mangroves line the brackish lagoons and creeks,
while swamp forest grows where the water is fresh. Farther inland, this vegetation gives way
to tropical forest, with its many species of tropical hardwoods, including mahogany, iroko,
and obeche.

North of the forest is the Guinea Savanna, a region of tall grasses and trees. The southern
margin of the Guinea Savanna has been so altered by humans that it is also called the derived
savanna. Beyond the Guinea savanna lies the Sudan Savanna, a region of shorter grasses and
more scattered, drought-resistant trees such as the baobab, tamarind, and acacia. In the
northeastern corner of Nigeria, the very dry semi-desert Sahel Savanna persists.

4.2.3       Socio-Economics

Demographics

The provisional figures released for the 2006 census estimate the current population to be 140
million, with an average density of 151 persons per sq km. Table 4.1shows past and estimated
future population data.

Regional differences are significant; population is densest in the south and sparsest in the
north. According to the UN, the annual population growth rate for 2000­2005 is 2.53%, with
the projected population for the year 2015 at 170 million.

The UN Population Reference Bureau estimated that 44% of Nigerian population lived in
urban areas in 2001. The principal cities include Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Kaduna, and Port
Harcourt. The prevalence of AIDS/HIV has had a significant impact on Nigeria's population
growth. In 2001, the United Nations estimated that 5.8% of adults between the ages of 15­49
were living with HIV/AIDS.

Land Use Pattern

Land use varies based on location and the needs of the community. However, the different
uses of land revolve around agriculture, industry and social needs such as the provision of
infrastructure. Recent data shows that about 60% of the land area of Nigeria is under various
forms of food (crop and animal) production and forest plantation.

Economics

The Nigerian economy rests on two pillars: oil/gas and agriculture. Both sectors contributes
65% - 70% of GDP, while the secondary sector (manufacturing contributes about 7% and the
tertiary sector (transport, trade, housing etc) contributes about 25%.                      Nigeria's major
industries are located in Lagos, Sango Otta, Port Harcourt, Ibadan, Aba, Onitsha, Calabar,
Kano, Jos and Kaduna.

NISCAI is responsible for the coordination and implementation of the emergency action plan
and strategies for preventing and control potential AI outbreak.        Its membership comprises
the Ministers of Agriculture /Rural Development and Health as permanent co-chairs and the
World Bank as a member. In addition to human health agencies, NISCAI also include
members from veterinary agencies (Veterinary Council of Nigeria, National Institute of
Veterinary Research).

NISCAI has responsibility to review project progress and approves work plans and budget
and also ensures coordination among participating ministries and international partners. In AI
outbreak situations, the NISCAI is in charge of triggering emergency responses by FMARD
and FMOH, monitoring the actions taken, and coordinating public statements to the media.
NISCAI is supported by a Public Information and Communications Specialist from the
Federal Ministry of Information.

-   National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI)

NTCAI is chaired by the ministers of state for health and agriculture/rural development. The
committee has responsibility to ensure adequate budget and procurement of goods, works
and services for implementation and supervision of the EMP (mitigation and monitoring
measures). This includes coordinating the Veterinary Service, Ministries of Health,
Environment and Agriculture and Rural Development on matters connected with the
implementation of the EMP. It will convene every 3 months to review progress with
implementation and approve work plans and budget.

-   Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (FMA&WR)

The ministry is mandated to develop and supervise the agricultural sector in Nigeria. It has
responsibility for the management and conservation of natural resources, including forests,
range lands and grasslands. The livestock section of the ministry has overall responsibility for
managing animal health diseases and will manage the animal health component of the AICP.

-   Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH)

FMOH has responsibility to protect public health by preventing and controlling
environmental-related health problems and diseases through the development and
implementation of policies and programmes that will strengthen the national health system.
FMOH satellite offices are responsible for implementing federal health programmes,
identifying and managing environmental and health problems at sources (water, air and food);
studying the impacts of poor sanitation, water and air pollution, and food contamination, and
setting standards and regulations for environmental health education.

-   National Fadama II Development Office

Currently the AICP Animal Health component is housed at the Fadama II project office. This
transitional arrangement would cease as soon as the substantive project office under the
FMARD is established. NFDO is the implementing agency of the IDA-funded FADAMA II
and FADAMA II GEF Projects.

-   National Health Systems Development Project Office

The AICP Human Health component including the implementation of this plan is presently
operating under the National Health System Development Project (NHSDP) Project Office.

The national AICP Publicity Committee is chaired by the Minister for Information. This
committee has responsibility for providing the public with a regular update on the AI
situation.

-   Federal Ministry of the Environment and Housing (FMEH)

The ministry has a mandate to co-ordinate environmental protection and conservation of
natural resources for sustainable development in Nigeria. The specific responsibilities of the
ministry are to:
    · monitor and enforce environmental protection measures;
    · enforce national and international environmental laws, conventions and protocols;
    · prescribe standards and limits on air duality, water quality, pollution and effluent;
           limitations, the atmosphere and ozone protection, control of toxic and hazardous
           substances; and
    · promote cooperation and international environmental protection agencies .

The FMEnv is now called Federal Ministry of Environment and Housing (FMEH) and the
operational structures are evolving. For the implementation of the EMP, the FMEH
Environmental Pollution Control (ECP) and Environmental Assessment Units (EAU) in
collaboration with respective States Environmental Protection Agencies/Authorities will
verify that documents prepared on different projects activities complies with applicable
national regulations and state edicts.

5.3        State level

The preparation, implementation and coordination of the project at the state level will be
similar to the system at the federal level. State ministries and institutions are presently
working with their national counterparts to accomplish similar tasks at a smaller scale. The
ministries and institutions involved are:
    · State Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (STCAI)

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project               Environmental Management Plan



      Chapter 6.0: Impacts, Mitigation and Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

6.1        Potential Environmental Impacts

Most activities under AI projects are likely to have limited adverse environmental impacts as
they are focused largely on public sector capacity building and improved readiness for dealing
with outbreaks of AI in domestic poultry. These prevention-focused activities are expected to
have positive environmental impacts as project investments in facilities, equipment,
laboratories, and training will improve the effectiveness and safety of existing AI handling
and testing procedures by meeting international standards established by the OIE.

This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into the
procedures for culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks, decontamination of
production facilities, and laboratory bio-safety. However, adverse environmental health
impacts, mainly inadvertent spread of HPAI, could occur when an emergency operation
involves containment of HPAI outbreaks through quarantine, isolation and stamping out
actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not in place. Most of the key potential
impacts could be avoided or minimized by integrating environmental and public health safety
aspects in the preparation/design and implementation of project activities.

The potential adverse environmental effects for each GPAI activity are:

(a)        Animal Health Component:

           (i)        Improving HPAI prevention and control planning. There are no foreseen
                      potential adverse effects as emphasis is on country preparedness. Country's
                      Emergency Contingency Plan to include all institutional, financial and human
                      resources and arrangements to deal with adverse environmental impacts from
                      prevention and control activities;

           (ii)       Strengthening of veterinary services. Training of veterinary workers to
                      include: procedures for safe handling of AI materials and construction and
                      refurbishing of reference and regional diagnostic laboratories and veterinary
                      clinics, key environmental issues related to zoonotic disease containment, and
                      laboratory waste management practices; and investments in improved bio-
                      security;

           (iii)      Safe culling and transport of infected and at-risk birds: The current policy in
                      the management of AI outbreaks is stamping out by imposing a quarantine
                      area, slaughter of infected and potentially exposed birds, and decontamination
                      of poultry houses, sheds and contaminated areas. Improper transport of
                      contaminated birds, bird products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and
                      equipment (for example in open containers) may pose environmental and
                      public health risks; and

           (iv)       Safe disposal of carcasses. A practical and sanitary system for disposing of
                      dead birds will help prevent the spread of disease and protect air and water
                      quality. Within the limits set by the local regulatory agencies, each country
                      project may select the disposal method(s) that best fits its needs. Chapter 7
                      provides information to help in the decision making process.

(b)        Human Health Component: Construction, refurbishing of reference and regional
           diagnostic laboratories; construction, refurbishing of referral hospitals and health
           clinics; and training of staff to include key environmental issues related to zoonotic
           disease prevention and special waste management (laboratories, clinics and hospitals).

1.         The primary potential risks can be grouped into three categories:

           (a)        Inadvertent human exposure and spread of the virus due to: improper culling
                      and disposal6 of dead birds (wild birds,7 sick and dead birds from backyard
                      and commercial poultries); lack of, or improper use of personal protection
                      equipment (PPE); improper disposal of farm waste (i.e., bedding, manure,
                      washings, etc. during and/or after an outbreak); and inadequate lab biosafety
                                                                                  8

                      protocols.

           (b)        Inadvertent release of chemicals in the environment from unsatisfactory
                      decontamination procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport
                      vehicles, etc.).

           (c)        Release of chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from
                      inadequate laboratory and medical facility waste management.

Carcass disposal activities may adversely impact the environment. The specific impacts will
vary by carcass disposal method, site-specific properties, weather and volume of carcasses,
among other factors.

6The technologies and risks in culling and disposal are still evolving, as experience in the developed world appears
not to be easily applicable in developing countries. The websites listed in Annex 6 are regularly updated and may
provide the most recent tools and methods.

6.2        Mitigation Measures

   i.      Vector Attraction

Good housekeeping and short storage duration are the best ways to avoid vector attraction.
Access to disposal sites should be restricted to keep people from stealing carcasses.

  ii.      Dispersion of Disease Agent

Trucks and equipment used in disposal operations should be thoroughly decontaminated.The
disinfectants used should be the least toxic suitable disinfectants (soaps and detergents). The
disinfectants should be disposed of in a safe manner. Transport distances should be minimal
and loads must be covered to minimize the risk of virus spread.

 iii.      Soil Erosion

To minimize erosion, dug up areas should be promptly filled again and the areas should be re-
vegetated.

 iv.       Soil and Groundwater Contamination

Trucks incinerators must be in good repair and operated by qualified personnel to minimize
potential spillage of fuel, oil and fat during incineration.

  v.       Visual Intrusion

Public awareness and education of the disease and its consequences to both human and animal
health should continue throughout the project lifecycle. This would reduce the possible public
outcry at the culling and disposal of infected poultry. Disposal sites should be secured and
restricted.

6.3        Environmental Management Plan

Adverse environmental, social and health impacts could result from an emergency operation
involving the containment of an HPAI outbreak. Table 6.1 presents the EMP for all the
components of the AICP. The EMP considers the respective project activities, their potential
impacts, and proposed mitigation measures and monitoring requirements. It also identifies
ways to reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts and safety
considerations associated with various disposal measures to acceptable levels.

                                   Chapter 7.0: Carcass Disposal Options

The disposal of H5N1 infected bird carcasses is primarily determined by the volume of birds,
logistics of disposal as well as environmental and economic factors.

7.1        Available Technologies for Carcass Disposal

The following technologies were considered based on their reliability for pathogen
inactivation:

           · Rendering
           · Incineration
           · Composting
           · Burial
           · Landfilling
           · Alkaline Hydrolysis

7.1.1      Rendering

Rendering of animal mortalities involves conversion of carcasses into three end products-
namely, carcass meal (proteinaceous solids), melted fat, and water using mechanical
processes (grinding, mixing, pressing, decanting and separating), thermal processes (cooking,
evaporating, and drying), and sometimes chemical processes (e.g., solvent extraction). It
produces an effective inactivation of all pathogens with the exception of prions (an infectious
viral protein particle) where infectivity is only reduced. Typical medium sized rendering plant
could process 12 tonnes of birds per hour of operations. The plant can operate within
environmental standards.

The main processes involve size reduction followed by cooking and separation of fat, water,
and protein materials using techniques such as screening, pressing, sequential centrifugation,
solvent extraction, and drying. Resulting carcass meal can sometimes be used as an animal
feed ingredient. If prohibited for animal feed use, or if produced from keratin materials of
carcasses such as hooves and horns, the product will be classified as inedible and can be used
as a fertilizer. Tallow can be used in livestock feed, production of fatty acids, or can be
manufactured into soaps.

7.1.2      Incineration

Incineration thermally decomposes matter through oxidation, thereby reducing and
minimizing the wastes, and destroying their toxicity. When properly designed and operated it
offers reliability, safety and efficiency. There are three broad categories of incineration
techniques: open-air burning, fixed facility incineration, and air-curtain incineration.

    - Fixed Incineration

Fixed whole carcass incineration occurs in an established facility in which whole carcasses or
carcass portions can be completely burned and reduced to ash. Effective inactivation of
pathogens is attained. The exhaust emissions can be subjected to air scrubbing procedures to
meet environmental standards. A fixed facility incineration is wholly contained and usually
highly controlled. It is typically fuelled by diesel, natural gas, or propane. The exhausts may
be fitted with afterburner chambers to completely burn hydrocarbon gases and particulate
matter from the main combustion chamber.

Whole carcass disposal can be problematic given the batch-feed requirements of most
biological waste incineration plants. Many waste incineration facilities refuse whole animals
which have a water content of 70%, but prefer waste with a water content of about 25%.
Fixed-facility incinerators include (a) small on-farm incinerators, (b) small and large
incineration facilities, (c) crematoria, and (d) power plant incinerators.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



     - Mobile Incineration

This method is based on thermal destruction of infective pathogens, animal carcasses and
other wastes in an incinerator. It involves transporting the mobile incinerator to the culling
site and collecting residues (bottom ash/slag and fly ash) for disposal at the sanitary landfill.

     - Open Air Burning

This involves burning of carcasses either on-site (farm) or off-site (collective facility) fuelled
by additional materials of high energy content e.g. wood, charcoal etc. This procedure can be
conducted on-site with minimal logistics. However, it could adversely impact the
environment (air, water and soil). It takes an extended period of time to complete and has no
verified pathogen inactivation capacity. there is also a possibility of particulate transmission
from incomplete combustion.

     - Controlled Burning (Air Curtain)Incineration

Controlled Burning incineration involves a machine that fan-forces a mass of air through a
manifold, thereby creating a turbulent environment in which incineration is accelerated up to
six times faster than open-air burning. The equipment for this process can be made mobile
which can be taken on-site but the potential of fire hazard must be considered. Because it can
be used on site, there is no requirement for transportation of the animal material. It also
produces effective inactivation of pathogens and may actually achieve very high temperatures
(1000 C).
        0


Fuelled by diesel engines, high velocity air is blown into either a metal refractory box or burn
pit. The materials required are wood (in a wood: carcass ratio of from 1:1 to 2:1), diesel fuel
for both the fire and the air-curtain fan, and properly trained personnel. The final product is
ash. Since the procedure is not wholly contained, it is subject to variable factors such as
human operation, weather, and local community preferences. However, if placed far away
from residential centres and the general public, they are generally not nuisance.

7.1.3      Composting

Carcass composting is a natural biological decomposition process that takes place in the
presence of air (oxygen). The carcasses should be incorporated within 24 hours of death and
promptly covered with bulking material. In this phase, the temperature of the compost pile
increases, organic materials break down into relatively small compounds, soft tissue
decomposes, and bones soften partially. In the second phase, the remaining materials, mainly
bones, break down fully to dark brown or black humus containing primarily non-pathogenic
bacteria and plant nutrients.

Composting systems require a variety of ingredients including carbon sources e.g sawdust,
straw, wood, charcoal, bulking agents e.g. sludge cake, wood chips, peanut shells, and tree
trimmings and biofilter layers.

7.1.4      Burial

This method involves depositing carcasses below ground level and covered by soil, with no
additional inactivation of pathogens. It is an established procedure reported to be convenient,
logistically simple and relatively quick. If performed on site, it eliminates the need for
transportation of infectious materials. It does however require an environmental assessment
because of the potential contamination of groundwater aquifers if leachate is not controlled.
Two techniques are considered under this option.

     - Trench Burial

           Trench burial involves the excavation of soil, placing the dead carcasses in the ground
           and covering them with excavated material. It is an inexpensive procedure and
           requires little expertise. It is convenient, logistically simple and relatively quick




                                                              - 35 -

           especially for daily mortalities. Major disadvantages include risk of disease agent
           persisting in the environment and potential water quality contamination issues.

    - Mass Burial

           This is similar to trenching however, the length and depth of the excavated pit is
           dependent on the amount of dead birds. The most significant advantage of mass burial
           is the capacity to dispose of large volume of carcasses at one time. If appropriate
           containment systems are employed at the design state, mass burial sites pose little risk
           to the environment.

7.1.5      Landfill

Landfills are classified according to the type of waste material disposed of into them. Modern
landfills are engineered to contain liquid leachate and landfill gas produced by decomposing
organic waste. Engineered landfills generally require containment liner, e.g. clay,
impermeable membrane e.g. high-density polyethylene and final cover e.g. clay or topsoil,
depending on the type of wastes.

Landfilling process involves the deposition of carcasses in licensed commercial sites. Because
the sites have been previously licensed, all environmental variables such as leachate
management, gas management, engineered containment, flooding and aquifers have already
been considered. However, if the area is open and uncovered for extended periods of time,
there is potential emission, and there could be resistance from the public to such an approach.

7.1.6      Alkaline Hydrolysis

Alkaline hydrolysis uses sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to catalyse the hydrolysis
of biological material (proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids) into a sterile aqueous
solution consisting of small peptides, amino acids, sugars, and soaps. Heat is applied (150oC)
to accelerate the process. The only solid by-products are the mineral constituents of the bones
and teeth of animals. This residue (2% of the original weight of the carcass) is sterile and
easily crushed into a powder. The temperature and alkali conditions of the process destroy the
protein coats of viruses and the peptide bonds of prions. Both lipids and nucleic acids are
degraded.

The process is carried out in an insulated steam-jacketed, stainless steel pressure vessel with a
sealed lid. The vessel operates at 70psig to achieve 150oC. The process does not release any
emissions into the atmosphere and causes only minor odour production. The end product
solution can be released into the sanitary sewer with proper monitoring of pH and temperature
according to guidelines. The total process time for alkaline hydrolysis digestion of carcass
material is 3-8 hours depending on the disease agent e.g. bacterial and viral contaminated
waste (4 hours), transmissible spongiform encephalopathy waste (6 hours). The end product is
a sterile alkaline solution with soap-like odour.

7.2        Technology and Site Selection Guidelines

The major factors that may influence the choice of technique for carcass disposal includes:

    - Availability of capacity - where the number of carcasses to be disposed of is high, the
           capacity of the adopted technologies could be inadequate. An assessment of
           possibilities and capacities is very important to be able to take quick decisions in
           emergency situations.

    - Cost - technologies for carcass disposal and specially those using sophisticated
           equipment are very costly.

    - Environmental concerns - the different technologies for carcass disposal have
           different effects on the environment. For instance open burning will produce smoke
           and smells; burial might lead to gas production, risk of contamination of air, soil,
           surface and sub surface water.



                                                              - 36 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



    - Pathogen inactivation - the chosen disposal procedure must give optimal safety as
           regards to the inactivation of the pathogen.

    - Occupational health safety - carcasses in decomposition are potential health risk for
           the persons handling them during the disposal process. Workers should be sufficiently
           protected (protective clothing, gloves, face masks, spectacles, vaccination, anti viral
           medicines, regular health checks) against infection with a zoonotic pathogen such as
           avian influenza

The major determining factors in selecting a site for carcass disposal include the volume of birds,
bio-security concerns over the movement of infected animal and environmental conditions of the
proposed site. Other factors include the topography, proximity of human communities, soil
type, groundwater depth, and accessibility (condition of roads).

Table 7.1 presents site selection guidelines and compares the different management options
based on environmental and safety considerations. Table 7.2 compare the options based on
technical and economics basis.

7.3        Recommended Carcass Disposal Options

Based on the economics and technical analysis in Table 7.2, Open-Burning is the least capital
intensive method while the Landfill is the most capital intensive method. All the options have
potential impacts on the environment; although, the cumulative impacts of the different
options can not be quantified without a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However,
integrating the mitigation and monitoring measures detailed in Section 9 of this report, the
impacts would be significantly reduced.

Based on the economic implications, direct environmental impacts, regional physical and
cultural differences, the following three methods are recommended for Nigeria.

    - Compositing

           Composting is relatively inexpensive and environmentally safe when carried out
           properly. It also generates end product that could improve soil fertility. This option is
           particularly viable in the northern part of the country where the water table is low. It
           is also not against religious belief in the north and would be socially accepted.

    - Incineration (Controlled Burning)

           This is the most effective option for pathogen destruction although it is expensive.
           The resultant waste product (ash) has no significant environmental impacts and could
           be disposed of in a landfill. Controlled burning is highly recommended for the regions
           that have high water-table or can not meet the suitable site requirements for
           composting.

    - Open Burning

           Open air burning on stakes or in pit lines with combustible materials should always
           be employed far away from residential communities or sensitive areas. This is
           suitable for the southern part of the country. However, the mitigation and monitoring
           programme need be put in place to reduce the potential environmental concerns. The
           site must be decontaminated immediately after the burning process.

8.1        Institutional Roles and Responsibilities

The implementation of the EMP requires effective non-competing collaboration between the
Federal Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Environment. Other stakeholders whose active
involvements are required include private sectors, NGOS, funding agencies, regulatory bodies
and industry associations (e.g. Nigerian Poultry Association). To avoid competition and
duplication of effort, it is necessary to establish a partnership framework to determine the
roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder.

The institutional framework for implementing the policy and guidelines set forth in this
document is presented in Figure 8.1.

      -      Project Implementation Unit (PIU)

The PIUs within the STCAIs will coordinate and supervise all activities under this project in
the respective states. This EMP recommends that the PIU should recruit Environmental
Health and Social Specialists to be assigned the responsibility of implementing the EMP. The
environmental health and social specialists will:
             ensure that the PIU complies with all applicable state, national and international
             environmental guidelines;
             liaise with SEPA and prepare periodic EA documents for submission to STCAI; and
             monitor the LG Desk.

      -      Local Government Desk

The Community Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (CMEU) at LG level should assign an

8.3        Training Needs

Based on the assessment of the institutional capacities of the different agencies involved in
the implementation of the EMP, it is recommended that the Government of Nigeria through
NISCAI should contract technical assistance to provide training and operational support to the
PIU, LG Desk, FMEH, FMOH, SEPA and SMOH for the EMP implementation. The training
needs for the responsible institutions are identified in Table 8.1.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



                                          Chapter 9.0: Monitoring Plan

The environmental monitoring program for the implementation of the AICP EMP will serve
as an integral part of the project operational activities and is expected to generate the requisite
information for environmental management and environmental information dissemination. It
is expected that monitoring will be conducted during all activities of the project.

This plan will play a pivotal role in ensuring that the trends for specific parameters are tracked
and it will provide information on compliance with legislative norms, set guidelines and form
the basis for corrective actions and modification of activities if necessary. Table 9.1 presents
the monitoring plan including institutions responsible and indicative cost.                The total
estimated cost for monitoring is US$700,000.00.

9.1        Monitoring Objectives

The aim of the monitoring is to establish appropriate monitoring criteria to verify the
predicted impact of AI infected carcasses disposal and to ensure that any unforeseen impacts
are detected and the mitigation adjusted where needed at an early stage. This plan will also
ensure that relevant records are kept to verify compliance with the recommended
environmental procedures. Other specific objectives of the monitoring plan are to:

· check the effectiveness of suggested mitigative measures;
· demonstrate that the project activities are carried out in accordance with the prescribed
    mitigation measures and existing compliance regulatory procedures; and
· provide early warning signals whenever an impact indicator approaches a critical level.

Implementation of the EMP will allow FMEH to control and manage the timing, location and
level of impacts and provide the cause and effect data for validation of various predictive
models of action/impact relationships.

9.2        Monitoring Requirements

The monitoring plan requires the following components to ensure effective results:

· Relevant baseline data against which to monitor project results;
· Verifiably objective indicators for each project component;
· An independent body responsible for monitoring;
· Institutional capacity for monitoring;
· An effective reporting mechanism including feedback and commitment to action on
    monitoring results and recommendations.

9.3        Monitoring Procedure

The PIUs will monitor carcass disposal at various disposal sites in each state and provide
periodic report on carcass disposal activities to the national project component coordinator
(CC). Monthly and quarterly reports will also be submitted to FMEH and SEPAs.

All monitoring components will be subject to audit, internally by the PIU and externally by
SEPAs/FMEH. Each monitoring programme will follow the established schedule; monitoring
may be weekly or monthly, depending upon the resource, regulatory requirements, and the
project-specific requirements.

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project           Environmental Management Plan



                                        Chapter 10: Public Consultation

The implementation of the AICP Environmental Management Plan depends on the
meaningful participation of all stakeholders for success. Given the potential for
misunderstandings by the public on the risks associated with AI and the various mitigation
measures that may be included under the Nigerian AI project, it is crucial that consultations
be undertaken and safeguard documents disclosed in a well planned manner during the project
implementation process.

Consistent with standard Bank procedures, consultation and disclosure concerning safeguard
related documents will be undertaken for the AI projects. FGN through NISCAI and STCAI
has the responsibility to consult with project affected groups and local non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) about the project's environmental and social aspects and take their
views into account. The EMP should be made available in the three major local languages at
places easily accessible to project affected groups, local NGOs and other stakeholders.

10.1          Objectives

This plan provides a framework for achieving effective stakeholder involvement and
promoting greater awareness and understanding of issues so that the project is carried out
effectively within budget and on-time to the satisfaction of all concerned.

To ensure effective implementation of this plan, the NISCAI/NTCAI shall be committed to
the following principles:

·   promoting openness and communication;
·   ensuring effective stakeholder involvement in the development of the project;
·   increasing public knowledge and understanding of the project implementation process;
·   using all strategies and techniques which provide appropriate, timely and adequate
    opportunities for all concerned parties to participate; and
·   evaluating the effectiveness of the engagement plan in accordance with the expected
    outcomes.

10.2          Identifying Stakeholders

Stakeholders for the purpose of this project shall be defined as all those people and
institutions that have an interest in the successful planning and execution of the project. This
includes those likely to be positively and negatively affected by the project. Table 10.1
identifies the key stakeholders.

10.3          Consultation Strategies

The focus of this public involvement program/plan is to inform the public and invite input
relating to the plan and its implementation. As elements of the plan proceed from planning
into execution, the FMA&WR's objective will be to maintain the public awareness and
understanding of the plan. The implementing agencies (FMA&WR, PIU, NISCAI, STCAI,
FMOH, FMEH etc) shall execute a program comprising seven strategic elements to
accomplish the public awareness objective. A comprehensive public awareness program will
include the following:

    -      Develop and distribute a project newsletter
    -      Develop presentations and organise seminars and workshops
    -      Develop and maintain a project web site
    -      Develop radio and television adverts
    -      Establish and maintain a project telephone information line
    -      Prepare project press releases
    -      Prepare posters and erect billboards

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project           Environmental Management Plan



The objective of the public awareness program is to convey information to the public and
interested groups. By utilizing a multi-faceted approach to convey information, the success of
the effort is optimized. The Public Awareness Plan describes the general approach and
specific benefits of each element of the program.

-   Newsletters

Newsletters will be written in English and all major Nigerian languages to include project
progress and information, calendars of events, telephone numbers, and information about the
web site, location maps, and photographs of ongoing efforts. The newsletters will be printed
and distributed quarterly throughout the implementation period.

Newsletter will be distributed through local print-media houses. Each newsletter will include
question and answer columns, project office locations, website address, a calendar of events
and project office telephone numbers.

-   Seminars and Workshops

Seminars and workshops will offer the public an opportunity to listen to the experts on
different aspects of the plan. These meetings will be broadcasted on local television and radio

Appendix 2: Bidding Documents

2a: Environmental Management Guidelines for Civil and Carcass Disposal Contractors
etc

This Environmental Management Guideline aims to ensure that all rehabilitation and
construction work undertaken under the Avian Influenza Control Project (AICP) is
environmentally and socially sound, complies with Nigerian and international environmental
laws and satisfies the provisions of the Environmental Management Plan.

This guideline applies to all work to all work to be undertaken under the AICP. Its application
include, scoping, screening of all work proposals for potential environmental impact and to
influence the design and implementation of these to ensure they are environmentally sound.

Responsibility for Environmental Management

This guideline shall be included in all contracts as a major clause. The implementation of the
provisions of this guidelines shall be monitored by the PIU and respective SEPAs. The FMEH
has overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with the national environmental regulations
which are included this guideline.

The FMEH/SEPAs will monitor and enforce the environmental protection measures; and
enforce national and international environmental regulation and limits on air duality, water
quality, pollution and effluent; toxic and hazardous substances.

The PIU will have overall responsibility of implementation, management and monitoring of
project activities, while the M&E units of both the FMA&WR and the project in collaboration
with the NGOs and the World Bank will be responsible for supervision and monitoring.

During the project planning stages the Design and Supervision Consultant must ensure that all
designs and specifications of areas deemed to be environmentally friendly or sound.

General Conditions

The competence of all Contractors and subcontractors meet the environmental requirements
stated in the contract documents shall be verified. In particular, attention should be paid to the
need to:

     - Avoid excavating borrow pits and ditches on lands with insufficient runoff drainage,
            or located in the vicinity of populated areas;
     - Avoid dumping construction material in water courses;
     - Reduce damage to vegetation to the strict necessity imposed by sound construction
            practices;
     - Refrain from creating earthworks during the peak of rainy seasons, and implement
            engineering practices to avoid erosion;
     - Promote the re-use of removed materials or disposed of where possible;
     - Organize works and optimize transport of materials in order to minimize negative
            impacts on surrounding communities.

Contractor's plant and facilities deployed for the purpose of the rehabilitation and civil works
shall be assessed to ensure fulfilment of required environmental mitigation criteria. Particular
attention should be paid to:

     - Noise abatement devices on construction and support equipment present on the site
            with the objective of keeping the noise level within regulating limits;

     - Adequate facilities for collection and treatment of wastewater, storage and disposal of
            solid waste;

     - Drainage systems including sedimentation/silt traps;

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project                   Environmental Management Plan



    - Adequate location and protection of fuel and oil storage facilities;

    - Pump trucks equipped with devices to prevent material spillage;

    - Approval of borrow pits, disposal and dumping areas where applicable.

In addition to these conditions, the Contractor shall comply with any specific Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for the works he is responsible for.

The Contractor shall inform himself about such an EMP, and prepare his work strategy and
plan to fully take into account relevant provisions of that EMP. If the Contractor fails to
implement the approved EMP after written instruction by the Supervising Engineer to fulfil
his obligation within the requested time, the client reserves the right to arrange for execution
of the missing action by a third party on account of the Contractor.

Notwithstanding the Contractor's obligation under the above clause, the Contractor shall
implement all measures necessary to avoid undesirable adverse environmental and social
impacts wherever possible, restore work sites to acceptable standards, and abide by any
environmental requirements specified in an EMP. In general these measures shall include but
not be limited to:

              - Minimize the effect of dust on the surrounding environment resulting from
                    earth mixing sites, vibrating equipment, temporary access roads, etc. to ensure
                    safety, health and the protection of workers and surrounding communities.

              - Ensure that noise emanating from machinery, vehicles and noisy construction
                    activities (e.g. excavation) are kept at a minimum for the safety, health and
                    protection of workers and surrounding communities.

              - Ensure that existing water flow regimes in streams and irrigation channels is
                    maintained and/or re-established where they are disrupted due to works being
                    carried out.

              - Prevent oils, lubricants and waste water used or produced water from entering
                    into    rivers,      streams,       irrigation   channels and other   natural      water
                    bodies/reservoirs, and also ensure that stagnant water in uncovered borrow pits
                    is treated in the best way to avoid creating possible breeding grounds for
                    mosquitoes.

              - Prevent and minimize the impacts of earth burrowing, piling and building of
                    temporary construction camps and access roads on the biophysical
                    environment, local communities and their settlements. In as much as possible
                    restore/rehabilitate all sites to acceptable standards.

              - Discourage construction workers from engaging in any activity that might have
                    a negative impact on the social and economic welfare of the local communities.

              - Implement soil erosion control measures in order to avoid surface run off and
                    prevents siltation, etc.

              - Ensure that garbage, sanitation and drinking water facilities are provided in
                    construction workers camps.

              - Ensure public safety, and meet traffic safety requirements for the operation of
                    work to avoid accidents.

environmental conditions and any proposed mitigation measures. SEPA should carry out
similar inspection duties.

All vessels (drums, containers, bags, etc.) containing oil/fuel/surfacing materials and other
hazardous chemicals shall be bunded in order to contain spillage. Construction waste shall
not be left in stockpiles along the road, but removed and reused or disposed of on a daily
basis. All waste containers litter and any other waste generated during the construction shall
be collected and disposed off at designated disposal sites.

All drainage and effluent from storage areas, workshops and camp sites shall be captured and
treated before being discharged into the drainage system in line with applicable regulations.

Used oil from maintenance shall be collected and disposed off appropriately.

Entry of runoff to the site shall be restricted by constructing diversion channels or holding
structures. to reduce the potential of soil erosion and water pollution.

The location of burrow/disposal sites shall be subject to approval by relevant state and
national authorities, including traditional authorities if the land falls in traditional land.

Construction and disposal sites:

    - Shall not be located in the vicinity of settlement areas, cultural sites, wetlands or any
           other valued ecosystem component, or on high or steep ground or in areas of high
           scenic value, and shall not be located less than 500 m from such areas.

    - Shall not be located adjacent to stream channels to avoid siltation of river channels.
           Where they are located near water sources, burrow pits and perimeter drains shall
           surround the sites.

    - Shall not be located in archaeological areas. Excavations in the vicinity of such areas
           shall proceed with great care and shall be done in the presence of government
           authorities having a mandate for their protection.

    - Shall not be located in forest reserves.                        However, where there are no other
           alternatives, permission shall be obtained from the appropriate authorities and an
           environmental impact study shall be conducted.

    - Shall be easily rehabilitated, i.e. suitable for ready reinstatement. Areas with minimal
           vegetation cover such as flat and bare ground, or areas covered with grass only or
           covered with shrubs less than 1.5m in height, are preferred.

    - Shall have clearly demarcated and marked boundaries to minimize vegetation
           clearing.

The Contractor shall deposit any excess material in accordance with the guidelines laid out in
this document, and any applicable EMP, in areas approved by the regulatory agencies.

Areas for depositing hazardous materials such as contaminated liquid and solid materials shall
be approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities before the commencement of work.
Use of existing, approved sites shall be preferred over the establishment of new sites.

Soil Management

    - To the extent practicable, the Contractor shall rehabilitate the site progressively so
           that the rate of rehabilitation is similar to the rate of construction.




                                                              - 65 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



    - Always remove and retain topsoil for subsequent rehabilitation. Soils shall not be
           stripped when they are wet as this can lead to soil compaction and loss of structure.

    - Topsoil shall not be stored in large heaps. Low mounds of no more than 1 to 2m high
           are recommended.

    - To the extent practicable, reinstate natural drainage patterns where they have been
           altered or impaired.

    - Ensure reshaped land is formed so as to be inherently stable, adequately drained and
           suitable for the desired long-term land use, and allow natural regeneration of
           vegetation.

    - Minimize the long-term visual impact by creating landforms that are compatible with
           the adjacent landscape.

    - Minimize erosion by wind and water both during and after the process of
           reinstatement.

    - Compacted surfaces shall be deep ripped to relieve compaction unless subsurface
           conditions dictate otherwise.

Water Resources Management

    - The Contractor shall at all costs avoid conflicting with water demands of surrounding
           communities.

    - Abstraction of both surface and underground water shall only be done with the
           consultation of the local community and after obtaining a permit from the relevant
           agencies.

    - Abstraction of water from wetlands shall be avoided. Where necessary, authority has
           to be obtained from relevant authorities.

    - Temporary damming of streams and rivers shall be done in such a way avoids
           disrupting water supplies to communities down stream, and maintains the ecological
           balance of the river system.

    - No construction water containing spoils or site effluent, especially cement and oil,
           shall be allowed to flow into natural water drainage courses.

    - Wash water from washing out of equipment shall not be discharged into water
           courses or road drains.

    - Site spoils and temporary stockpiles shall be located away from the drainage system,
           and surface run off shall be directed away from stockpiles to prevent erosion.

Traffic Management

    - The Contractor's arrangements for managing construction traffic will be continually
           reviewed. The site inspection team will be alert to the possibility of construction
           traffic causing pavement and structure damage due to overloading, increase in
           congestion and increased road safety hazards.

    - Location of access roads/detours shall be done in consultation with the local
           community especially in important or sensitive environments. Access roads shall not
           traverse wetland areas.

    - Upon the completion of civil works, all access roads shall be ripped and the site
           reinstated.

    - Access roads shall be sprinkled with water as necessary to suppress dust emissions.




                                                              - 66 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project           Environmental Management Plan



    - In the event that the contractor does cause damage to any road, he will be required to
           repair this at his own expense as provided for in the Contract.

HSE Contractor's Health Safety, and Environment Management Plan (HSE-MP)

Within 2 weeks of signing any Contract, the Contractor shall prepare an HSE-MP to ensure
the adequate management of the health, safety, environmental and social aspects of the works,
including implementation of the requirements of these general conditions and any specific
requirements of an EMP for the works.

The Contractor's HSE-MP will serve two main purposes: (i) for internal purposes, to ensure
that all measures are in place for adequate HSE management, and as an operational manual
for Contractor staff. (ii) For the Client, supported where necessary to ensure that the
Contractor is fully prepared for the adequate management of the HSE aspects of the project,
and as a basis for monitoring of the Contractor's HSE performance.

The Contractor's HSE-MP shall provide at least:

    - a description of procedures and methods for complying with the general and any
           specific environmental management conditions specified in an EMP;
    - a description of specific mitigation measures that will be implemented in order to
           minimize adverse impacts;
    - a description of all planned monitoring activities (e.g. sediment discharges from
           borrow areas) and the reporting thereof; and
    - Internal organizational, management and reporting mechanisms put in place for such.

The Contractor's HSE-MP will be reviewed and approved by the client before start of the
works. This review should demonstrate if the Contractor's HSE-MP covers all identified
impacts, and has defined appropriate measures to mitigate any potential impacts.

EHS Reporting

The Contractor shall prepare monthly HSE progress reports in compliance with the general
conditions, the project EMP if any, and his own HSE-MP. It is expected that the reports will
include information on:
              - HSE management actions/measures taken, including approvals sought from
                    state or national authorities;
              - Problems encountered in relation to HSE aspects (incidents, including delays,
                    cost consequences, etc. as a result thereof);
              - Lack of compliance with contract requirements on the part of the Contractor;
              - Changes of assumptions, conditions, measures, designs and actual works in
                    relation to HSE aspects; and
              - Observations, concerns raised and/or decisions taken with regard to EHS
                    management during site meetings.

It is advisable that reporting of significant HSE incidents be done "as soon as practicable".
Such incident reporting shall therefore be done individually.

Also, the Contractor shall keep his own records on health, safety and welfare of persons, and
damage to property. Such records shall be attached as appendix to the HSE report. Details of
HSE performance will be reported to the Client through the inspection reports.

Training of Contractor's Personnel

The Contractor shall provide sufficient training to his own personnel to ensure that they are all
aware of the relevant aspects of these general conditions, any project EMP, and his own HSE-
MP, and are able to fulfil their expected roles and functions. Specific training should be
provided to those employees that have particular responsibilities associated with the
implementation of the HSE-MP. Training topics should be:



                                                              - 67 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project          Environmental Management Plan



        - HSE in general (working procedures);
        - Emergency procedures; and,
        - Social and cultural aspects (awareness campaign on social issues).

Cost of Compliance

It is expected that compliance with these conditions is already part of standard good working
practice as generally required under this Contract. The item "Compliance with Environmental
Management Conditions" in the Bill of Quantities covers these costs. No other payments will
be made to the Contractor for compliance with any request to avoid and/or mitigate an
avoidable HSE impact.

2b:Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan

Purpose

It is the purpose of this procedure to define the responsibility and obligations of the contractor
and sub-contractors under the Avian Influenza Control Project (AICP) EMP implementation
for the occupational health and safety of employees engaged on project activities including
rehabilitation, carcasses disposal, civil works etc in Nigeria and control occupational hazards
on the job site.

Terms

Contractor ­ civil engineering construction companies, waste management companies etc

Subcontractors - are all contractors or Vendors working under contract to contractors.

Occupational health and hazard - is defined as the management of occupational health of the
workers and the controlling of occupational illness and exposures in the work environment.
This is apart from and not related to routine health care and health maintenance which is the
normal and routine health care of the employees' health unrelated to the employees work on
the job.

Serious injury - is not defined in the Nigerian Law Code, but "serious injuries and death of
workers" are require to be reported. For the purpose of this plan a serious injury is defined as
an injury resulting in the loss of a body part or resulting in a permanent physical disability of
the employee which prevents the employee from attaining gainful employment.

Hazardous materials - are deemed to be any material that is defined as `hazardous' by the
Federal Ministry of Environment and Housing (FMEH). These are listed in the FMEH
publication titled "Guidelines and Standards for the Environmental Pollution Control in
Nigeria, 1991".

Medical emergencies - are defined as life threatening illness and injuries that require
evacuation off the site to an offsite hospital or clinic.

Minor first aid - is defined as an injury that does not result in one or more lost work days.
First aid treatment that results in only a few hours of lost work time where the employee is
back to work immediately after treatment, or the next day is a minor first aid case.

Responsibilities

Contractors and sub-contractors are responsible for the occupational health of their employees
and hazard control of their job site. Subcontractors shall report occupational health and safety
statistic to the Project Component Coordinator.

Appendix 3: Summary of the FAO and the OIE Global Strategy for the Progressive
Control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)


1.         Vision and goal. The long-term vision of the strategy is to minimize the global threat and
risk of HPAI in humans and domestic poultry, through progressive control and eradication of HPAI,
particularly that caused by H5B1 virus, from terrestrial domestic poultry in Asia. Achieving this
goal will diminish the global threat of a pandemic, stabilize poultry production, enhance a robust
regional and international trade in poultry and poultry products, increase human and food safety,
and improve the livelihoods of the rural poor.

2.         A phased approach. The global strategy will be implemented over three time frames:
immediate to short (1-3 years), short to medium (4-6 years) and medium to long term (7-10 years).
During this period the spread of HPAI, mainly of the H5N1 strain, will have been progressively
controlled in domestic poultry of all infected countries of Asia, and prevented from affecting those
Asian countries not currently infected, but at high risk.

3.         The immediate to short-term objective is to reduce the risk to humans by preventing further
spread of HPAI in those countries that are currently infected by H5N1.

4.         Over the medium to long-term (7-10 years), a more focused approach to HPAI will be
mounted to progressively eradicate the disease from the remaining compartments of infected
domestic terrestrial poultry in the region. The medium-to-long term strategy will consider all
control measures, including vaccination, zoning and compartmentalization as defined in the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Code. For the long-term success of this strategy, restructuring of the
poultry sectors in the region will need to be seriously considered.

5.         To prevent the threat of HPAI from spreading to avian influenza-free countries, the long-
term strategy supports the development of active surveillance programs and emergency
preparedness plans for non-infected, at risk countries. The application of OIE standards relating to
the international trade of poultry and poultry products will further assist in preventing the spread of
HPAI virus across continents.

6.         Capacity building. Inadequate capacity in many countries is the principal limiting factor
for effectively and quickly stamping out and controlling infectious diseases. Thus, the strategy
suggests building a strong and sustainable human and physical resource capacity in the countries, to
respond in a more effective and timely manner in stamping out not only HPAI outbreaks, but also
other newly emerging infectious zoonotic and trans-boundary animal diseases. Capacity building
will be wide ranging and include all aspects of disease control as well as policy development and
socio-economic impact analysis.

7.         Strategic research. The global strategy recognizes that the dynamics of the current rapid
spread and persistence of HPAI remain unclear. Therefore, the strategy will facilitate strategic
research to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza, evaluate the efficacy of vaccines in
domestic ducks to reduce the virus shedding in domestic duck reservoirs, and work in close
collaboration with regional and international advanced research institutions to promote the
development of improved vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests. Risk analysis of various poultry
production systems and along marketing chains will be carried out to better target effective disease
control.

8.         Implementation. Implementation will be at the national, regional and international levels.
At the national level, well-defined country specific projects will be formulated, which will be
underpinned by the formation of sub-regional HPAI support units. Through these units, sub-
regional disease diagnosis and surveillance and socio-economic and policy analysis networks will
be established.          These sub-regional networks will provide the lead in the development of



                                                              - 72 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project                      Environmental Management Plan



harmonized technical standards and regional policies related to the management of live animal
movement, compensation plans, capacity building, disease reporting requirements and long term
planning to restructure poultry sectors.

9.         At the international level, coordination of the national programs and sub-regional networks
will be under the umbrella of GF-TADs (global framework for the control of trans-boundary animal
diseases), a joint FAO/OIE initiative.                     The international coordination will provide technical
backstopping to the sub-regional networks and national programs, promote international
cooperation, and mobilize and coordinate resources for HPAI control.

10.        Partners. The main partners in implementation of the strategy will be infected and non-
infected at-risk countries, and regional organizations, all of which are committed to controlling
trans-boundary animal and zoonotic diseases. Given the zoonotic nature of the HPAI, and the
complex interface between farming systems, livestock trade, food safety and public health, a strong
international partnership among FAO, OIE and WHO will be continued. A number of other
partners will be involved, important among these would be the private sector, NGOs, and regional
national agriculture extensions systems (NARES).

11.        Resources. The implementation of the strategy will require funding to support the national,
regional and international HPAI control programs as outlined above.

Framework for Implementation

12.        A Framework for Implementation has been developed by FAO/OIE, promoting national,
regional, and international initiatives. It includes the following:

National initiatives:

· Development of a National Strategy for each country specific to its own conditions. It would
    address farming systems, presence/absence of ducks, presence of human cases or not, trade
    orientation, implementation capacity, and wildlife migration patterns;
· Preparation of contingency and emergency preparedness plans;
· Development of economic impact and policy frameworks;
· Prevention of avian influenza to non-infected at-risk countries through awareness, reporting,
    and early detection; and
· Improvement in epidemiological information on source of infection and transmission dynamics
    in farming system and marketplaces.

Regional initiatives:

· Standardization of diagnosis and reporting techniques among countries;
· Sharing of disease information between countries;
· Development of a regulatory framework for management of animal movements; and
· Promotion of adherence to OIE guidelines to facilitate regional trade.

Global initiatives:

· Strengthening of partnerships (FAO, OIE, WHO, UNDP, donors);
· Support for global networks (OIE Global Service Center supported by WB/DGF and donors);
· Support for sub-regional networks -- OIE/FAO epidemiology collaborating centers and Avian
    Influenza Network (OFFLU);
· Further development of control strategies for trans-boundary animal diseases (utilizing the GF-
    TADs mechanism);
· Development of a Global Early Warning System (FOA/OIE/WHO);

Appendix 4: Summary of the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategy


1.         The strategic plan lays out activities for individual countries, the international community
and WHO to prepare for a pandemic and mitigate its impact. The objectives of the plan correspond
to the opportunities to intervene and are structure in the following three phases:

Phase - Pre-Pandemic:

           (i) Reduce opportunities for human infection. An immediate priority is to halt spread in
poultry to reduce human exposure to the virus. More intensive collaboration is needed between the
animal and health sectors.               Communication activities targeting stakeholders, particularly rural
poultry holders, should be strengthened. Workers carrying out the culling of poultry must be
protected against infection by clothing and equipment.

           (ii) Strengthen the early warning system.                  To assess risks to public health and guide
protective measures, information is needed on the extent of influenza infection in animals and
humans and on circulating viruses. National surveillance systems must be improved urgently in
potentially affected countries. When outbreaks in animals occur, active human case detection
should be pursued by a coordinated animal-human health team.

Phase - Emergence of a Pandemic:

           (iii) Contain or delay spread at the source. Aggressive containment measures such as
isolation and prophylactic use of antiviral drugs may slow pandemic spread and allow time for
response measures. An international stockpile of antiviral drugs for an emergency response should
be established, starting with a stockpile for targeted early use.

Phase ­ Pandemic Declared and Spreading Internationally:

           (iv) Reduce morbidity, mortality, and social disruption. Although mass vaccination is the
preferred intervention, serious issues related to the time lag between emergence of the virus and
vaccine production as well as production capacity constraints must be addressed. Anti-viral supply
and production capacity are also limited. Therefore, the main responses in the immediate term
should be classic "social distancing measures" such as quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and
travel restrictions, backed up by a well-designed communication strategy. For the longer term,
options with industry to improve antiviral and vaccine capacity need to be explored.

           (v) Conduct research during pandemic. Research is needed for policy development and
adjustments for current and future epidemics.                        The main elements include: assessing the
epidemiologic characteristics; monitoring the effectiveness of the interventions; and evaluating the
medical and economic consequences.

Recommended Strategic Actions

2.         In view of the immediacy of the avian influenza threat, WHO recommends that all countries
undertake urgent action to prepare for a pandemic. Advice on doing so is contained in the recently
revised WHO global influenza preparedness plan (2005) and a new WHO checklist for influenza
pandemic preparedness planning (2005). Table 1 describes the phases of increasing public health
risk associated with the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype that may pose a pandemic
threat, and the overarching public health goals under each phase.

           a.      The distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is based on the risk of human infection or
disease resulting from circulating strains in animals. The distinction is based on various factors and
their relative importance according to current scientific knowledge. Factors may include
pathogenicity in animals and humans, occurrence in domesticated animals and livestock or only in
wildlife, whether the virus is enzootic or epizootic, geographically localized or widespread, and/or
other scientific parameters.




                                                              - 75 -

Avian Influenza Pandemic & Human Preparedness & Response Project            Environmental Management Plan



           b .    The distinction between phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 is based on an assessment of the
risk of a pandemic. Various factors and their relative importance according to current scientific
knowledge may be considered. Factors may include rate of transmission, geo-graphical location
and spread, severity of illness, presence of genes from human strain (if derived from an animal
strain), and/or other scientific parameters (Source: WHO 2005).

3.         In order to accomplish the public health goals described for each phase, WHO recommends
strategic actions that can be undertaken to capitalize on each opportunity to intervene. Given the
many uncertainties about the evolution of the pandemic threat, including the amount of time left to
prepare, a wise approach involves a mix of measures that immediately address critical problems
with longer-term measures that sustainably improve the world's capacity to protect itself against the
recurring pandemic threat.

4.         The strategic actions are:

Reduce opportunities for human infection, including:

    · Support to the FAO/OIE control strategy;
    · Intensify collaboration between the animal and public health sectors;
    · Strengthen risk communication to rural residents; and
    · Improve approaches to environmental detection of the virus

Strengthen the early warning systems, including:

    · Improve the detection of human cases;
    · Combine detection of new outbreaks in animals with active searches for human cases;
    · Support epidemiological investigation;
    · Coordinate clinical research;
    · Strengthen risk assessment;
    · Strengthen existing national influenza centers throughout the risk-prone regions; and
    · Give risk-prone countries an incentive to collaborate internationally.

Contain or delay spread at the source, including:

    · Establish an international stockpile of anti-viral drugs;
    · Develop mass delivery mechanisms for anti-viral drugs; and
    · Conduct surveillance of antiviral susceptibility.

Reduce morbidity, mortality and social disruption, including:

    · Monitor the pandemic in real time;
    · Introduce non-pharmaceutical interventions;
    · Use of antiviral drugs to protect priority groups;
    · Augment vaccine supplies;
    · Ensure equitable access to vaccines; and
    · Communicate risks to the public.

Conduct research to guide response measures, including:

    · Assess the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging pandemic;
    · Monitor the effectiveness of human interventions; and
    · Evaluate the medical and economic consequences.
