A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The primary development objective of the Project is to reduce air pollution from local coal-fired
space-heating boilers through increased utilization of clean energy resources such as geothermal heat and
natural gas in the Podhale region of Southern Poland. This objective will be achieved by developing a
geothermal district heating system with supplemental gas-fired peaking capacity to provide heat to seven
municipalities of the Podhale area. This will displace individual heating systems by connecting their users
to an efficient district heating system supplied by clean and renewable fuels.
Replacing polluting fuels will provide cleaner air and greater comfort for the inhabitants. Significant
reductions in respiratory disease are anticipated from the decreases in emnissions of particulates from coal
and coke combustion. The proposed improvements will also reduce the environmental damage to the biota
in the neighboring national parks and protected areas. The improved environmental quality of the Podhale
area is also expected to make it more attractive for tourism.
2. Global objective: (see Annex 1)
The associated global environmental objective is to reduce C02 emissions in order to help Poland meet its
international obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as C02 provides an additional motive for the
Government of Poland to pursue the Project. It is expected that, for the whole area to be covered by the
Project, C02 emissions will be reduced by 2.7 million tons over the period from 1995 to 2024.
3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The implementing company has prepared a set of monitoring indicators (physical/technical, operational,
financial and environmental), including the key indicators which will be monitored and reported upon on a
quarterly basis in the context of the Project Management Reports (PMRs). A list of monitoring indicators,
acceptable to the Bank, was submitted to the Bank by the Borrower at negotiations. The indicators (see
second column of Annex 1) include:
1. ambient concentrations of particulate matter and S02 in the project area (Zakopane and Nowy Targ);
2. calculated C02 emnission reductions and cost per ton of reductions on an annual basis;
3. the number of district heating customers;
4. annual and cumulative heat delivery to customners;
5. annual and cumulative heat production, gas and electric consumption of Geotermia Podhalanska;
6. heat tariffs charged by Geotermia Podhalanska.
The final commitment to the monitoring indicators selected (including numerical targets as appropriate)
will be made at the signing of the legal agreements by attaching an appropriate supplemental letter.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: R99-167              Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/16/99 (Progress Report)
Achieving environmental sustainability is a major development goal in the last full CAS of April 1997
(page 14) and in the CAS Progress Report of 09/16/99. Both documents mention reducing air pollution.
A geothermal energy project is also explicitly mentioned in both the full CAS (para 26) and in the Progress
Report (paras 3940). The sustainable energy sector development goals addressed by the Project are
closely linked to the EU accession standards, which are also set as an important development benchmark in
-3 -



the CAS. It is proposed that the Bank, in collaboration with EU-PHARE, assist Poland in planning
investments that will maximize progress toward the enviromnental goals (set by national laws, EU
directives and international agreements), and work on strengthening the capacity of municipalities to
finance investments needed to carry out their environmental responsibilities (para 48). This seminal Project
offers a rich blend of environmental and economic outputs and a co-financing structure that contributes
directly to the CAS goals for Poland.
The Project also has a link to the CAS objective of sustaining private sector growth in needed
infrastructure (para 26, 37, and Table 1, "Poland - Country Assistance Strategy Matrix, 1998 - 2000").
While the initial investments in the project have been dominated by public funding, Geotermia Podhalanska
intends to use its profit margins to repurchase the stock from the public owners - especially, the National
Fund.
Global Operational Strategy/Program objective addressed by the project:
The UNFCCC goal for Poland is to reduce C02 emissions 6.0% from 1988 levels by 2010. Poland ratified
the UNFCCC on July 28, 1994. The GEF grant to this project is a short-term response measure which
means that the carbon reductions achieved will be low cost and low risk and that the National Government
identifies the Project as a priority.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Government of Poland has made much progress in achieving environmental sustainability, especially
in establishing short- and medium-term priorities; in preparing for the requirements of the EU
environmental directives; in establishing environmental standards and a system of fining polluters; and in
funding environmental projects. In the energy sector, while much progress has been made at large point
sources in combating environmental pollution, the heating subsector in Poland, and in the Project area in
particular, is still dominated by use of small, inefficient coal and coke boilers for heating of individual
households. The resulting air pollution during the heating season has harmful effects on human health and
probably constrains tourism development, the mainstay of the region's commerce.
The Government's medium- to long-term energy policy and strategy call for energy security through
cost-effective supply, at socially acceptable prices, and in an environmentally sustainable manner. These
goals have been pursued consistently by the various Governments since the major economic reform of 1990
was launched in Poland. The energy policy and strategy is largely in line with the strategy of the EU for
the energy sector.
The Bank has supported the reorientation of the Polish energy sector toward a market structure through a
combination of policy support, technical assistance and lending operations. These were designed to assist
the Government and energy sector participants to:
(a)    phase out energy-related consumer subsidies as well as cross-subsidies between industrial and
household energy consumers;
(b)   lead toward decontrol of energy prices which should reach economic levels, and provide incentives
for energy efficiency imnprovements;
(c)   improve economic efficiency in the supply and use of energy;
(d)    mobilize additional domestic and foreign private capital for investment; and
(e)    address environmental issues.
As Poland enters the next phase of discussions on EU accession, these issues are becoming more urgent.
The Government established a program of sector reform with the help of the World Bank/ESMAP which
- 4 -



called for de-monopolization and restructuring the energy sector; commercialization and eventual
privatization; decontrol of prices; and establishment of a new regulatory framework The pricing and
sector reform process has consistently moved in the right direction although some components of the reform
program have been implemented faster than others.
In the network fuel subsectors (gas, electricity, district heat) average prices are increasingly reflective of
economic cost. Explicit subsidies for municipal district heating tariffs were eliminated by the Government
as of January 1, 1998. Cross-subsidies for small users of electricity and gas have been reduced.
The Energy Law of 1997 led to secondary legislation concerning heat, issued in 1998, and a deregulation of
heat prices. Governnent has no longer a price control function. Instead, the Voivodship approves an energy
mnaster plan. The Voivodship Office of the Energy Regulatory Authority (URE) has the following functions:
(i) give licenses to heat providers; (ii) review proposals of companies for tariff increases and either endorse
them or reject them if deemed unjustified; (iii) intervene on the tariffs in response to customer complaints.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The principal sector issues addressed by the Project are those of (i) environmental sustainability; (ii)
cost-covering tariff setting in the district heating subsector; and (iii) seeking substantial involvement of the
private sector.
Internalization of the environmental benefits of clean technologies is one of the key issues of energy pricing
policy currently on the agenda in Poland. This Project provides an example of how this can be achieved
when grant fmancing is available to cover both local and global environmental externatilites.
The project entity is comrmitted to full financial sustainability and will pursue a tariff level and structure
sufficient to cover economic costs. At the same time, the Project has to compete against suppliers of other
types of fuels including natural gas, fuel oil, and clean coal. The tariffs set for geothernal heat will reflect
economic costs once environmental benefits are credited. The Bank expects that the heat supply tariffs will
include a specified rate of return on investment.
The Project demonstrates the mobilization of resources, and acceptance of responsibilities, by local
jurisdictions for the promotion of clean energy. The Government encourages development and/or expansion
of district heating on the basis of clean fuels (gas, geothermal, biomass etc.) with assistance from the
National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, a rajor contributor to the Project
since 1995.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
Project Background
The initial phases of the Project aimed to exploit the geothernal reservoir in Podhale started in 1993. In
1993 - 1995, a pilot plant was constructed on the basis of the first geothermal doublet, which had been
constructed under an earlier Government-funded initiative by the Polish Academy of Sciences. The first
geothernal heat supply to the village of Banska Nizna started in 1995. The Bank's active involvement in
the project started in 1995, when the second phase of the Project began. Geothermal heat supply to the
village of Bialy Dunajec started in 1998.

Progress with customer connections to the geothermal heat network has been at the center of the Bank's
assessment of this Project since the very beginming of its involvement. The current estimate is that about
400 TJ or nearly 33% of the ultimate target load can be considered secure at the time of the Bank's
commitment to the Project (see Annex 2 for details).
The completed components of the second phase currently include: (i) second geothermal doublet, except the
additional reinjection well as shown in the diagram below; (ii) geothermal base-load plant in Banska Nizna,
currently at 15 MWt of heat-exchanger capacity and 28 - 32 MWt geothermal flow capacity based on the
existing geothermal flow of 670 m3/h; (iii) 3.5 km out of 14.0 km of DH transmission line between the
base-load plant and Zakopane; (iv) expansion of the DH distribution network of Bialy Dunajec and
conversion to heat-exchangers of 27 households there; (v) 22 MWt gas-fired peak-shaving plant in
Zakopane; (vi) conversion of ten coal-fired DH boilers in Zakopane to heat exchangers connected to the
new DH network; and (vii) connection of 16 commercial customers out of the planned 172 in Zakopane and
the villages, with 29 more to be connected by the end of 1999.
However, the available connections in Zakopane to the new DH network are currently receiving heat from
the gas-fired peaking plant instead of geothermal heat because funds have not been available to connect
Zakopane to the existing geothermal wells.
The geothermal wells completed and proposed:

Bank);
* - wells to be drilled under the proposed Project.
The Project in its complete form will provide district heat to a majority of potential customers in the
main Podhale Valley. The service area will extend about 14 km from the production wells to the City of
Zakopane and about 7 km in the opposite direction from the well field to Nowy Targ (see map in Annex
12). The transmission line between the geothermnal wells and Zakopane will be completed. In addition to the
villages of Banska Nizna and Bialy Dunajec already receiving geothermal heat, the villages Poronin and
Szaflary will be connected in 2000, and Koscielisko in 2002. Three district heating boiler houses in Nowy
Targ will be connected in 2002. The main components of the entire Project (including the completed
components as indicated above) are:
A. Production and Transmission of Heat, including:
-6 -



*   drilling seven geothermal wells (of which four wells are already completed) - three for production
and four for reinjection. The production wells will extract low-enthalpy (- 85 to 87.50 C
temperature) geothermal waters in the Podhale basin to cover the base-load heat demnand for the
entire project service area;
*   constructing a base-load geothermal district heating plant with a capacity of approximately 38 to
43 MWt (currently, at 15MWt heat exchanger capacity and 28 to 32 MWt geothermal resource
capacity) delivering 1,015 TJ/year of geothernal heat;
*  constructing an absorption heat pump plant with two associated gas-fired hot water boilers and a
gas network pressure reduction station; with a total capacity of 33 MW, the plant will deliver 355
TJ/year of heat - 60% produced by gas firing and 40% by extracting additional heat from
geothernal water;
*   constructing a 48 MWt peak-load natural gas plant in Zakopane (currently at 22 MWt) and a
similar plant in Nowy Targ (planned at 14 MWt) for a combined production of about 73 TJ/year
of heat;
*   expanding the existing district heating infrastructure in the Podhale area by building about 20 km
of new pipelines for the transmission of hot water, constructing two gas transmission pipelines,
electric connections, and pumping stations.
*   small-scale acquisition of land for new drilling sites, constructing new buildings and expanding
existing buildings for the production facilities.
B. Heat Distribution Network Development - constructing a new heat distribution network (about 80
krn) for the Podhale area and connecting customers to this network.
C. Installation of Heat Exchangers and Meters in individual households and other buildings; this
component also includes provision of miscellaneous tools and vehicles for the implementing company.
D. The Project Management component is aimed at institutional strengthening of PEC/GP, with an
emphasis on the provision of technical consultant services and specialized services such as financial
management and auditing.
E. The Monitoring and Evaluation component is aimed at monitoring and evaluating (M&E) the global
environmental benefits from the Project. This will be based on a monitoring and evaluation protocol for
carbon reduction projects developed with the assistance of the GEF. The objective is to make a credible
assessment of carbon reductions, which in turn would help establish the potential for a broader introduction
of geothermal district heating in Poland and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe.

Notes:
1) The template above does not allow for an entry of incremental working capital, which for the overall Project is
estimated at about US$ 9.0 million, bringing the total financing required to about US$ 96.7 million (see Financing
Plan on Page I and Annex 3).
2) The cost of US$ 5.8 under "Interest during construction" includes a guarantee fee charged by the Government of
Poland in the amount of 2% of the loan.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The Project would contribute to better policy formnulation in the following two areas:
First, the recognition of the role of local and global environmental benefits in justifying and financing the
Project is an important precedent of internalization of such externalities in project selection (see more on
this in Summary Analysis, Section E-1). The tie between grant funding and environmental accomplishment
is an important enabling element that could materially impact the planning process for other projects in
Poland and throughout Eastern Europe. This should be emphasized and considered by Polish policy makers
as a possible model for new planning guidelines.  The demonstration effect of commercial-scale
introduction of geothermal energy made possible through such internalization may have a tangible impact
on decisions made to support renewable energy development. The success of the Project should generate
confidence in similar renewable energy projects considered by local authorities in Poland and elsewhere in
Eastern Europe.
The second area relates to the demonstration effect from the gradual reduction of governmental
shareholding in Geotermia Podhalanska, as now represented by the National Fund. Both PEC/GP and the
National Fund favor repurchase of the shares by PEC/GP out of the company's operating income before
any dividends are paid. PEC/GP is expecting to operate on a commercial basis without need for any
subsidies as long as the heat tariffs cover the costs. Hence, the conpany will gradually transfer to private
ownership as National Fund shares are repurchased. This will make PEC/GP much more "private" than
most district heating companies in Poland, which will ensure greater autonomy for the company and
possibly attract additional private investment. In addition, at mid-term review of Project implementation,
the Bank and the Borrower will discuss the progress made regarding privatization, and the Borrower will
undertake a study to develop a privatization strategy as needed.

3. Benefits and target population:
Four major groups will benefit from the Project. More than 4,200 individual households are expected to
convert to geothermal energy for home heating. Their choices will reflect their desires for cleaner and more
comfortable heat that requires less labor than handling coal. They will also avoid any replacement
investments for new boilers for the next twenty years. Finally, they will avoid the use of high-cost
electricity for summer water heating when their coal or coke boilers are not operating.  Similarly, 172
larger loads are expected to convert for similar reasons. Most of the thirty-four boiler houses that were
previously operated by Tatry but are now part of the merged Geotermia Podhalanska company will be
converted to geothermal heat to improve efficiency, reduce labor requirements, and substantially reduce
emissions. Nowy Targ is expected to convert three boiler houses to geothermal heat for both environmental
and economic reasons.
Savings in fuel costs to each of the four groups reflect both the avoided purchase costs at the source and
the avoided transport costs. The coal and coke for this area are generally transported to Podhale by train
from sources about 200 km away. Local distribution is by truck.
The substitution of geothermal energy, distributed via district heating, for less benign fuels in households
and commercial establishments will significantly improve the local air quality in winter. This major benefit
will accrue to the residents of the Podhale area as well as to visitors to the area. The ski resort areas and
surrounding tourist facilities are likely to gain from the Project as well - in terms of increased revenues due
to the improved environmental conditions in the Podhale area.
Significant health benefits will accrue to the communities where large quantities of coal and coke are
currently used for space heating. The main target populations live in the municipalities of Zakopane, Nowy
Targ, Koscielisko, Szaflary, Banska, Bialy Dunajec and Poronin. It is expected that, over the course of the
project, the annual mean concentrations of particulates in Zakopane will drop from the present level of
about 65 ug/m3 to as little as 30 ug/m3 (see graph in Annex l1). The change will be especially dramatic
during the heating season, when the concentration of TSP will be reduced by more than 2/3 - from the
present level of almost 100 ug/m3 to about 30 ug/m3, close to the level currently observed in the summer
time.

project
Since the assessment of the Project is based on the comparison with a baseline scenario which also assumes
significant environmental improvement (largely based on the assumed conversion to gas), it is important to
estimate the environmental benefits of choosing the proposed Project in comparison with the baseline.
Based on this approach, the Project is expected to reduce annual average concentrations of particulate
matter in Zakopane by 7.8 - 14.3 ug/m3, which would result in local envirornental benefits (LEBs) of
about US$ 8.5 million (the net present value of the local environmental benefits achieved over the period
from 1995 to 2024 discounted at 12% per year). Combined with the environmental benefits to areas outside
Zakopane, the total LEBs from the Project are expected to be about US$ 14.5 million.
The substantial reduction in C02 emissions resulting from the Project represents a global benefit and
contributes to the climate change mitigation measures undertaken world-wide. Over the life of the
geothermal plant the Project will prevent 2.7 million tons of C02 from entering the atmosphere. The
positive externality accruing to the global environment, if estimated at US$10.00 per ton of carbon
(US$2.73 per ton of C02), would represent a global benefit of US$ 7.4 million.
The indirect benefit of demonstration of the commercial-scale and economically viable utilization of
geothermal energy accrues to the entire country and the region.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Project will be implemented by PEC Geotermia Podhalanska, S.A. (PEC/GP). PEC/GP was founded
in mid-1998 as a result of a merger between Geotermia Podhalanska (GP) and the Tatry district heating
company of Zakopane. Geotermia Podhalanska (GP) has been in operation as a corporation since 1994.
After the merger, it is still a small company with a simple organization, only about 70 employees and a
three-member Management Board. Existing departments within PEC/GP will carry out Project
management. There will be no formally established PIU or Project Management Group.
As of July 1, 1998, PEC/GP is governed by a supervisory board consisting of six representatives drawn
from the National Fund (3), the Municipality of Zakopane (2), and Hydrotrest (1). The Company is
managed by the Management Board, consisting of the President, and two Vice Presidents.
The company's majority owner is the Polish National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water
Management. The present ownership of PEC/GP is shown in the table below.

The major milestones in Project implementation are described in Section C-1 and in Annex 2. A detailed
Project Implementation Plan, developed jointly by the staff of PEC/GP and Bank staff, is available in the
Project File.
Financial Management
Disbursement and Funds Flow: The financial management review shows that PEC/GP's financial
management system is not yet ready for PMR-based disbursement. The Loan Agreernent therefore allows
for initial disbursement based on traditional disbursement methods with a timetable for moving to
PMR-based disbursement at the mutual agreement of the Borrower and the Bank. It was agreed that the
internal control procedures will be designed to cover both of these disbursement methods.
Accounting Procedures and Internal Control: For the most part, PEC/GP has sound accounting practices.
However, most of the accounting procedures and routines are not documented and it was therefore agreed
that an Operating Manual covering financial management, procurement and disbursement would be
prepared. The financial management and disbursement sections will be given the highest priority and will
be submitted for review by the Bank in early May 2000, prior to the presentation of the Project to the
Board (see Annex 6).
Accounting Systems: PEC/GP is currently using the accounting software Unisoft. This software does not
have multi-currency capability and cannot therefore be used for statements in foreign currencies. Further,
the reporting module has never been installed and it was therefore agreed that the LAN version of Fox Pro
would be used for reporting from the accounting system. Fox Pro is able to produce all PMR-based
reports (including reports in foreign currencies) in accordance with the Bank's format. Fox Pro's interface
must be adapted to existing financial, planning, and technical software. PEC/GP will use consultants for
this work. The deficiencies of the present version of Unisoft will be rectified in the new version, expected
in September 2000. It was agreed that PECIGP shall upgrade with this new version as soon as it is ready
for commercial use. It is anticipated that the company will be ready for PMR-based disbursement at the
beginning of 2001.
Staffing: PEC/GP's fnancial management organization system and procedures are simple. The financial
director, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Managing Board, heads the financial and economic division,
which has four accountants, including the chief accountant, and two part-timers for billing and economic
issues. Staffing is on the low side and there is little capacity to free staff for training. The Project will
- 11 -



further increase the workload, and it will be necessary to employ at least one project accountant. It was
agreed that this person would be in place in time to assist the financial management consultant.
Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements: PEC/GP's financial statements are to be prepared both
in accordance with International Accounting Standards and Polish Accounting Law. The Project Financial
Statements are to be prepared in accordance with the format provided by the Bank. Both the company and
project statements will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit report
will be submitted to the Bank within four months after the end of the fiscal year. The auditor for the period
2000 - 2004 will be financed from the Loan. The selection of this auditor shall be in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidelines, and to ensure continuity the appointment shall preferably be for the whole
project period. The auditor must be appointed before October 1, 2000.
Project Reporting Arrangements: The quarterly Project Management Reports (PMRs) are to be submitted
to the Bank within 45 days of the end of each quarter. When PMR-based disbursement is used, the PMR
forms the basis for the advancement of funds to the Special Account. The PMR includes the following: (a)
Financial Report (project sources and uses of funds, uses of funds by special activity, project balance sheet,
project cash withdrawals, Special Account statement, project cash forecast); (b) Project Progress Report
(output monitoring reports for contract management and unit of output by project activity); and (c)
Procurement Management Report (procurement process monitoring for goods and works and consultants'
services, contract expenditure reports for goods and works and consultants' services).
The operating and capital expenditure budgets for PEC/GP are to be included in the Progress Report for
the third quarter together with the Project Annual Budget submitted for Bank approval. Financial progress
reports on company performance are to be submitted on a semi-annual basis as part of the Progress
Reports for the second and fourth quarters, and actual results will be compared with Plans and Budgets.
Market penetration strategy
A detailed market penetration study, conducted both from the economic and financial perspectives, assumes
that 60% of the eligible households and 80% of the commercial large loads will convert to the district
heating system operated by PEC/GP by the end of the Project period. It is estimated that the total cost of
conversion to geothermal heat (consisting largely of the cost of in-house/on-site heat exchangers), to be
borne by 4,243 households and 172 commercial large loads, will amount to about $13.5 mnillion.
The original Project planning included a complicated tariff incentive scheme to stimulate conversions and to
assist with conversion investments. However, given the increasing availability of financing from other
sources, it has been decided to keep these expenditures outside the Bank Loan. Thus, the conversion costs
are not included in the Project financing plan or cost tables, except for selected connection and heat
exchanger costs of about $4.6 million (Section C-I and Annex 3). These represent the connection costs for
the district heating systems in Zakopane and Nowy Targ, as well as part of the costs of large load
connections, and the cost of heat meters. In the economic calculations (Section E-1 and Annex 4), the full
connection costs are accounted for.
For households and large loads, numerous sources are available to fmance conversions to clean fuels. The
Voivodship Fund for Environmental Protection offers loans and grants to loads larger than 50kW. For
public institutions, the fund offers 50% grant on total investment and the rest must be from the customer's
own sources; alternatively, a public customers can receive from the fund a soft loan at 7% for 7 years. For
private properties, soft loans are offered. The BOS Bank, which is 40% owned by the National Fund,
offers loans at 3 years for 12% or 4% above the inflation rate to any credit-worthy customer for heating
- 12 -



conversions. Those loan terms are quite attractive in Poland at this time since the inflation rate is about
8.0%.
Also, Geotermia Podhalanska has received some heat exchangers from a PHARE grant for both households
and large loads that they are providing under two programs to consumers. The consumer can purchase the
heat exchanger directly and pay a normal tariff. Alternatively, they can pay for the heat exchanger over ten
years through an add-on to the normnal tariff.
Finally, the EcoFund has offered Geoterrnia an additional 10 million PLN (about $2.5 million) as a grant to
be used for conversions. This is expected to be used as a contingent risk management tool to stimulate
conversions if market penetrations fall below targets.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The fundamental rationale for the choice of geothermal energy development in Podhale is the availability of
an economically exploitable geothermal reservoir, combined with an auspicious local geomorphology
facilitating the natural recharge of the reservoir and creating a sufficient positive pressure at the point of
extraction of geothermal water.
Alternative heat supply projects in the absence of the proposed Project would vary for different portions of
the proposed geothermal Project service area. The first competitive alternative to be considered for
Zakopane would be the development of a district heating system based on natural gas.
However, after consideration of gas versus geothermal district heating development, the City of Zakopane
has given an exclusive franchise to geothermal heating in the area served by the proposed Project in
Zakopane. For the most part, the areas selected for geothermal have the highest heat densities. Some of the
area has also been historically supplied with district heating from the Tatry boiler houses. The project does
include continued gas-firing of a few Tatry boiler houses that were recently converted from coal. In
addition, gas is used for peaking and for heat pumps used to extract additional heat from the geothermal
water.
In Nowy Targ, the district heating company has been tendering to see if gas conversion, continued coal use
or geothernal would provide them with the most economic and environmentally acceptable heat source.
After deliberations with the City of Nowy Targ, the comnpany recently canceled the tender and announced
that it is only negotiating with PEC/GP for supply to its three boiler houses. A decision by Nowy Targ is
anticipated prior to the Bank loan effectiveness.
In the areas lying between Zakopane and Nowy Targ, the linear development pattern has resulted in heat
densities that have been considered too low to support the development of district heating or natural gas
networks. Reasonable alternatives to geothermal heat there (apart from continued use of existing fuels)
would be conversion to expensive light fuel oil or LPG rather than natural gas network extensions.
However, with both Zakopane and Nowy Targ conmmitted to develop geothermal district heating systems,
these areas can be supplied with geothermal heat from the main geothermal transmission line connecting
Zakopane and Nowy Targ. The incremental cost of this option is much lower than that of any other
alternative.
Secondly, centralized gas-fired cogeneration has also been considered. However, cogeneration in Poland
- 13 -



(especially small cogeneration) is not currently attractive because the buy-back rates for electricity are not
specified, and it is difficult to get an adequate rate to support the incremental investment.
Within the scope of the geothermal solution, several alternatives have been considered to optimize the
proposed Project, including:
*   Various project scales to supply heat in alternative service areas;
*   Alternative combinations of base-load geothermal resources, gas-fired heat pumps, and gas-fired
peaking boilers to select the optimurn capacity mix;
*   Direct discharge of geothermal waters to area streams after heat extraction in lieu of reinjection;
*   Addition of cogeneration capability to the peaking plants to supply some of the electricity needed
for pumping.
Economic calculations have been the basis for selection of the preferred alternative in each of these cases
except for the direct discharge alternative. The proposed plan has been selected over the alternatives
because of superior economic results. Additional gas will be required for the heat pumps, but less
electricity will be needed for pumping (see section E-3 for details). The decision to incorporate the
absorption heat pumps in lieu of additional geothermal drilling not only reduces incremental costs but also
serves to reduce the risk of disappointing geothermal drilling results.
The extension of the peak-load plant capacity to cogenerate electricity could be considered after the
proposed Project is implemented. This relatively small project refinement could be added in the future if
and when grid electric supply becomes expensive enough to justify the investment and when Geotermia
Podhalanska begins to generate enough surplus to finance this addition from internal funds. It is less risky
at this time to avoid additional investment until the cash flow is established.
The direct discharge alternative was dismissed because the salinity of the geothermal water, while much
lower than for most geothermal projects, is above the standard allowed by Polish regulations for discharge
to area streams (see Section E-5 for salinity data).
Baseline Scenario (no Project)
Because of the specific geographic orientation of the existing heat supplies and the main loads to be served,
it is unlikely that integrated alternative projects covering the whole area would be considered in the absence
of the proposed Project. However, the local interest in environmental improvement reinforced by
increasingly stringent regulations on boiler replacement technologies suggests that the base case for
comparison with the proposed project will not be a simple continuation of existing fuel combustion.
Rather, a sizable shift to gas and fuel oil is anticipated if the geothermal project were not implemented.
Similarly to the project alternatives considered (see above), the baseline differs by geographic area. In the
existing district heating area of Zakopane, the baseline assumes conversion of all existing coal-fired boiler
houses to gas. In the other areas of Zakopane, the baseline for individual houses assumes conversions from
coal and coke to oil and gas. Given the absence of specific plans for expansion of the gas network and the
high costs of that option, oil has been selected as the most common new fuel. Some gas conversions are
likely as areas now served by the existing gas network add some customers. In rural areas, no gas will be
available because the load density is too low to support network expansion. In Nowy Targ, the key
consideration affecting the baseline assumptions is the choice of fuel for three district heating boilers. The
assumption currently adopted for the analysis is that the Nowy Targ boilers would remain on coal using
cleaner technology which complies with the more stringent environmental regulations.
- 14 -



The geothermal system does not preclude the other alternatives with the possible exception of natural gas.
Based on detailed cost comparisons and market survey results, the following assumptions have been used to
define the base case (see also Annex 4 on Incremental Cost Analysis):
1. In Zakopane, all of the former Tatry boiler houses would be converted to gas by the end of 2003.
2. In Zakopane, the fuel shares for the 2,094 households that are expected to convert to geothermal heat would
change as follows in the next decade:
Fuel                 1998 Share (%0)          2008 Share (%/6)
Coal                                 24.0                     8.0
Coke                                 64.0                    25.0
Oil                                   2.0                    55.0
Gas                                   1.0                    10.0
Other                                 9.0                     2.0
Total                               100.0                   100.0
3.    In Zakopane, the fuel shares for the 166 large loads that are expected to convert to geothermal
heat would change as follows if the geothermal option were not available:
Fuel                 1998 Share (%)         2008 Share (%)
Coal                                  5.0                      0.6
Coke                                 82.9                     22.9
Oil                                   7.9                     64.4
Gas                                   0.8                     10.6
Other (Electric)                      3.3                      1.7
Total                               100.0                    100.0
These fuel shares do not include efficiency adjustments for combustion of the different fuels.
4.     Outside Zakopane and Nowy Targ, the expected alternative to geothermal heat would be continued
use of existing fuels. Gas network expansion would not be economic in these sparsely occupied areas.
High costs of fuel oil and LPG, lower incomes in the smaller villages, and decreased exposure to severe air
pollution suggest that fuels would not change in these areas without geothermal energy.
5.     For Nowy Targ, definition of the base case depends on the assumptions regarding the outcome of
competition between the coal and gas interests. The investment required for fully compliant coal technology
(e.g., fluidized bed combustion) could be at least as high as for gas. It is anticipated that gas alternatives
could be competitive with compliant coal combustion. However, considering the past reliance in Nowy
Targ on coal and the power of the coal interests in the city, as well as the sense of uncertainty about the
price of imported gas, the economic analyses reported here assume that Nowy Targ district heating system
would remain coal-fired if geothermal was not chosen. A sensitivity analysis is presented in Annex 4 to
show the impact on unit abatement costs if gas were the baseline choice.

In addition, the Geothermal project in Lithuania is a noteworthy examnple of introduction of low-enthalpy
geothermnal energy in the region. The first conclusions as to the success of the project may become possible
by April 2000, when the geotherral plant is expected to start supplying heat to the city of Klaipeda.
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Geothermal projects are capital intensive with large investment costs up-front that are difficult to predict
accurately due to the uncertainties of drilling costs and reservoir yields. Thus, while the drilling costs and
well yields to date have been better than anticipated, the current plan for completion of the Project
envisages a reduced need for geothenral resources by incorporating gas-fired absorption heat pumps into
the project design.
Because of the large investment needs, financial viability depends critically on the tariff level and rate of
market penetration achieved. The merger with Tatry has assured conversion of 28 boiler houses serving
the Zakopane district heating system. Intensive market analyses have been used to tailor proposals to 172
large loads and to develop realistic estimates of the share of the household market that can be reasonably
expected to convert to geothermal energy. Incremental profitability studies have been used to select the
sequence and limnits to the service areas selected for geothermal service. These planning procedures merit
replication in other comparable Projects.
The key link between measurable environmental benefits both at the local and global levels was not
recognized in the early planning for this Project since finding was not tied to explicit achievement of this,
- 16 -



and GEF grants were not readily available at that time. The clear illustration of these linkages in
establishing the funding package for this project will provide useful guidance for formulation of future
projects to optimize the economic and environmental balance.
Some useful lessons can be drawn from the partially completed Pyrzyce project (not Bank-financed), where
the annual production of geothermal energy is behind targets. The Danish EPA reports that the emission
reductions are short of expectations accordingly, as those inhabitants not having access to the district
heating network continue to use fossil fuels. The project highlighted the importance of: (i) an up-to-date and
realistic marketing study to support the energy demand projections; (ii) a good marketing strategy that
includes various categories of customers; (iii) adequate supervision during construction - particularly, in
difficult natural conditions (the salinity of the geothermal waters in Pyrzyce is 14%, as opposed to less than
0.3% in Podhale). Nevertheless, the early problems have now been resolved, and, supported by the Danish
EPA, consultants are helping Pyrzyce to bring the plant to full operation.
4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitment and ownership:
The shareholders of PEC Geotermia Podhalanska (the National Fund and local municipalities) are
convinced of the beneficial impacts of pollution reduction. Therefore, they have strongly promoted the
Project in public fora as well as with decisions-makers in the central and local governments. The National
Fund has demonstrated its commitment as the majority shareholder in Geotermia Podhalanska and through
additional direct funding contributions. In earlier phases of the Project, significant amounts of Project
investment came from the National Fund and from the EcoFund Their role has been especially critical
because their contributions have been concentrated in the early part of the Project development when the
perceived Project risks were the highest. During the period from 1995 to 1999, the following contributions
of financial resources have been made:

The conversion from using combustible fuels to geothermal energy is supported by the municipalities, in
recognition of the economic value of attracting tourists and light commerce to the area, as well as of
- 17 -



reducing the costs of health and medical services and municipal maintenance (cleaning) of streets and
buildings.
The municipalities have become shareholders of Geotermia Podhalanska and increased its capitalization by
providing municipal assets including land, rights-of-way, and all facilities of the former Tatry District
Heating Company. The City of Zakopane approved the merger of Tatry into Geotermia Podhalanska in
1997. The merger was completed in July 1998.
5. Value added of Bank and Global support in this project:
The promotion of renewable energy resources and linkage of environmental benefits to project funding, as
well as leveraging of private sector participation are the areas in which the Bank can provide leadership.
The Bank has played a critical role in developing the Project concept and coordinating co-financing for
both Project preparation and implementation. The Bank's involvement also ensured careful assessment of
Project risks and systematic consideration of the geological, technical, environmental and marketing issues
involved. Moreover, the progress made towards privatization will be discussed with the Borrower at
mid-tem review and, if needed, a privatization strategy will be developed (see Sections C-2 and G-2).
In the area of GHG emissions abatement, the role of the Bank is particularly strong. It has a demonstrated
comparative advantage in mobilizing external co-financing for projects related to carbon abatement and
possesses the methodology, monitoring and risk mitigation techniques needed to secure such funding. This
has been demonstrated through the Bank's role as an implementing agency of the GEF and through
experience with over US$ 6 billion worth of non-GEF projects in the Bank pipeline which involve GHG
emission mitigation.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
o Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = 12.6 % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Incremental Cost
O Other (specify)
Economic analyses of this Project have been prepared under two project contexts which provide the limiting
cases of interest. The entire Project extends from the first investments in 1995 through a ten year
implementation period followed by 20 years of full-scale operation. An economic analysis on this basis is
of interest to those wishing to determine the replicability of the project which is a common focus of GEF.
The World Bank loan to the Project, however, will only be closed in 2000 with minor allowances for
retroactive fnancing. The economic analysis supporting that loan views only the incremental costs
beginning in 2000 as relevant. In recognition of the interest in both Project perspectives, economnic rates of
return have been calculated for both Project time lines. The two contexts are referred to as the "Complete
Project" and the "Incremental Project" in the discussion that follows.
The estimates of the economic rate of return for the Complete Project indicate that heat cost savings alone
would yield a rate of return of just 8.6 percent. Addition of estimated local environmental benefits would
increase the rate of return to 11.9 percent. It should be noted that the discounting of local environmental
benefits for this analysis includes a 3.0% risk premium to reflect the inherent uncertainties in the chain of
causation between emissions and health damages. The GEF grant of $5.0 million received in 2000 then
raises the EIRR to 12.6%. While GEF could theoretically pay the full incremental cost of $8.0 million this
- 18-



would raise the EIRR to 13.2% and does not appear necessary for the project economic justification. The
grant of $5.0 million and associated EIRR of 12.6% appears sufficient and allows for the irreducible risks
in long-term estimates of carbon reductions to be achieved. The reduction from full incremental costs of
$8.0 to a grant of $5.0 million is a buffer for uncertainty that is similar in principle to the discounting
premium applied to the local environmental benefits.
The EIRR for the Incremental Project based solely on heat cost savings is 15.9%. This return is much
higher than for the Complete Project because of the investments that were completed prior to 2000 that are
treated as sunk costs in this perspective. Adding carbon and local environmental benefits then increases the
EIRR to 26.6%. This provides strong justification for this specific World Bank loan even though it is not
indicative of return rates available for replicable geothermal projects.
Two forns of economic analysis are relevant to this Project. Conventional Bank loans are supported by
demonstrations that the Project has an adequate economic internal rate of return (EIRR) relative to the
other options considered for providing space and water heating to area residents and conmmercial
establishments. A more specialized analysis of carbon emission imnpacts focuses on the incremental cost
per ton of C02 reduction for the proposed project compared to a most probable baseline scenario. The
linkage between these two economic analyses is clarified below.
The basic cost-effectiveness analysis compares the Project investment and operation costs plus the needed
conversion investments to be paid by consumers valued at economic prices with the life-cycle costs of the
most probable alternative heating developments in each of the separable Project areas. For Zakopane, the
baseline is conversion of the district heat system and the majority of households and large loads to natural
gas or fuel oil during the next decade. The costs of conversion from present fuels and of gas or oil use
would be paid by consumers. For Nowy Targ, the most probable baseline scenario for the district heat
system is continued coal operation with modernization based on improved coal-fired technology in 2001. In
the sparsely populated villages between Nowy Targ and Zakopane, continued use of existing fuels is the
baseline alternative to geothermal. These cost comparisons provide a traditional economic analysis based
solely on heating costs. Since the heat outputs for both scenarios are identical, the challenge is to find the
most cost-effective method of satisfying unchanged demands.
As noted repeatedly in the discussion of project beneficiaries, improved local air quality and reduced
carbon emissions are strong Project motivations. To capture the economic value of such improvements,
changes in health costs have been estimated between the proposed and baseline Project scenarios. The
reductions in health costs are labeled local environmental benefits (LEBs). The proposed and baseline
scenarios also differ dramatically in terms of the carbon emissions over the life cycle of the project. The
economic value of carbon reductions would most accurately be determiined if a world market for carbon
were operational, and prices of verifiable reductions were established. That market does not exist at this
time. The clearest proxy is the payment available from GEF. The global environmental benefits (GEBs)
for this study are based on GEF willingness to pay. The cost-effectiveness analysis used to support the
World Bank loan is then based on cost differences between the baseline and the proposed Project net of
LEBs and GEBs. The comparisons are clarified in the following table:
Item                    Baseline                       Proposed
Heat Demands            Heat(B)                        Heat(P) = Heat (B)
- 19-



Health Damages          HD(B)                           HD(P) < HD(B)
Carbon Cost             Foregone GEF Payment           Zero
Heat Costs              Life Cycle (B)                  Life Cycle (P)>Life Cycle (B)
Annual differences between the last two columns  over the life of the project provide the basis for
calculation of the EIRR used to support the Bank loan.
Two additional econornic benefits have been identified but not quantified. Tourism is clearly the domninant
economic activity in and around Zakopane. The economic impacts of the Project on tourism are undeniably
positive but difficult to quantify in a rigorous way. Links between winter air quality and tourism in this
prime ski area and between tourism and economic value added are not easily established. Double-counting
of benefits is also a danger since the primary reason for conversion from cheaper coal to more expensive
geothermal energy may be because of the perceived tourism impacts. The imnpact on biota in the
neighboring national park is also positive but not easily expressed in dollars. The strategic approach to
Project justification has been to first quantify the heat and health cost savings as the measurable local
benefits. If the local plus the global benefits provide sufficient return, additional work on tourism and biota
should not be required to justify the Project.
The incremental cost analysis comnpares the life cycle heating costs for the base case scenario and the
geothermal Project which are alternative ways to provide the energy needed for heating and hot water
purposes for the Podhale region. The relevant incremental costs are the present values of the differences
between the costs shown in the bottom row of the table above. Carbon emissions for the base case scenario
reflect the alternatives described above for each of the project areas. For the proposed Project, the carbon
emissions come from the use of gas in the peaking plants, the heat pumps and the few converted district
heat boilers and from coal-based generation of the electricity used for pumping in the geothermal systern-
The impacts have been calculated for the Project ramp-up period of 1995 - 2004 and for twenty years of
full load operation thereafter. The difference between base case and Project emissions of C02 during that
period is estimated to be 2.7 million tons. The incremental costs are estimnated at $8.0 million or $2.99 per
ton of C02 reduction. These calculations are based on a discount rate of 11.0%.

2. Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = 14 % (see Annex 4)
Geotermia Podhalanska (GP) was founded as a joint stock company on December 30, 1993 with an initial
share capital of about PLN 1.62 million (US$ 0.7 million equivalent). The Company's share capital was
increased to PLN 10.7 million (US$ 4.4 million equivalent) in May 1995, and to a level of PLN 30.1
mlillion (US$10.2 million equivalent) in 1999. There is a strong interest among the shareholders to see the
first large geothermal Project in Poland succeed.
GP S.A. has operated since 1995, when the first demonstration connections of houses and public buildings
to the heating system of a geothermal test well were established in the Gmina of Bialy Dunajed. Since then
it has expanded its network and operations in that Gmina as well as in certain areas in Zakopane, which
will be supplied initially by the gas-fired peak-shaving plant and subsequently linked with the geothermal
system.
The income statements, fund flow statements, and balance sheets of GP S.A. for the period 1995 to 1997
(contained in the PIP) show that the company grew steadily to a level of assets of over PLN 42 million
(about US$ 13 million). In 1998 GP S.A. merged with PEC Tatry. The year end balance sheet for the new
PEC/GP shows assets amounting to PLN 82 million (US$24 million), mostly due to further investments
and some assets of PEC Tatry (see below). The majority of the investments has gone into the drilling of a
second doublet, the construction of the geothermal plant, the construction of the gas-fired peak-shaving
plant, and the laying of the main pipe from Bialy Dunajec to Zakopane, as well as network development in
these places. The income statements illustrate the results of operations from the small network in Bialy
Dunajec, and the resultant losses are not indicative of the company's future development. The first
"industry scale" heating season for GP S.A. was from autumn 1998 to spring 1999, after the merger with
Tatry. The merged company's assets as of end 1999 amounted to PLN 90.4 million (about US$27.5
million), covering investments under Phase 1 and to a large extent Phase 2, as described in project
description summary (see Section C). The funding of these investments until now has been made available
by equity (about 35%), grants (48%) from National Fund, EcoFund, EU PHARE, USAID and Denmark,
and local loans (17%).

Preliminary actual data for 1999 are the basis of operational and fi5ncial projections for the merged
company. The merger with the Tatry DH comipany of Zakopane brought into the new company a number
of important assets, including experienced personnel, the site of the peaking plant, the existing network of
.heat distribution as well as a substantial number of customers. A prelirniiary set of financial projections
covering the period 1999 - 2006 has been prepared. The results are shown in Annex 5. The table below
sunmrnrizes the results for the year 2005 (the first year of steady state operation):

The financial projections demonstrate the soundness of the proposed Project and its company PEC/GP, as
well as its proposed financing arrangements. As can be seen from Annex 5, the company's net losses
incurred in 1998 and 1999 and projected for 2000 are resulting from its merger with the district heat
company of Zakopane in 1998 and the new company's early operations with relatively few customers
connected to the incomplete system. The comnpany has obtained a bridge loan which will be repaid in the
year 2000, when the proposed loan and grant funding becomes available. The level of grant funding,
together with the existing equity base, give the Project a sound financial footing. PEC/GP would turn
already profitable from year 2001, assuming that the rate of network completion and heat sales can be
achieved as projected and the operating costs be kept as forecast. During the implementation period of the
Project (years 2000 - 2004), the front-end fee, and loan interest on the proposed World Bank loan will be
capitalized. Thereafter, the company would be able to service its debt gradually increasing its debt service
coverage ratio from 1.0 to 1.2 or above. PEC/GP will be able to generate increasing levels of cash to fund
growing portions of its own investments. The above table containing the financial parameters in the first
year of steady state operation (2005) serves to illustrate the healthy position of the company.
Financial performance covenants have been agreed during negotiations as follows: maintaining (i) an
adequate operating ratio (operating expenses over operating revenues): not higher than 90% for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2001, 85% for the FY2002, 80% for FY2003, and 75% after FY2004; (ii) a
debt-service coverage ratio (net revenues over estimated maxirnum debt-service requirements) of not less
than: 1.0 from 2001 to 2006, 1.1 in 2007, and 1.2 thereafter; (iii) a debt-equity ratio of not greater than
55% to 45% until December 31, 2004; (iv) a cash generation to capital expenditures ratio of not less than
- 23 -



5% for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001, not less than 10% for FY2002, and 35% thereafter, of
the annual average of the Borrower's capital expenditures to be incurred during the three-year period
commencing with the said fiscal year. As practically no investment would be needed after Project
completion in the years of operation of the projection period, part of the cash generated from 2005 could be
either distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, or stock could be repurchased from the National
Fund. During the Project implementation period the build-up of a substantial cushion of cash is to protect
against the risk of a dry well or a slower than expected revenue generation.
Fiscal Impact:
Apart from the contingent liability associated with guaranteeing the loan, there will be no negative fiscal
impact for the Government. PEC/GP is a commercial enterprise and will generate an adequate cash flow
from its operations to repay the loan. Furthermore, during the period 1999 to 2005, the company is
projected to contribute PLN 16.7 million (US$ 4.2 million) in income and property taxes. The total tax
contribution for property and income tax will be almost PLN 195 million (US$49 million) over the 2000 to
2025 period.
3. Technical:
The geology of the Project has been thoroughly evaluated by a group of independent international
consultants. The expectations for the geothermal resource productivity have been confirmed by the results
from the first two doublets (the second doublet exceeding expectations). The production from the wells
completed to date is already sufficient to provide 50-60% of the total geothermal requirements for the
Project. The minimum estimated period between the drilling of the wells and any impact of the
lower-temperature reinjection waters on the production wells has been estimated at well over 25 years. The
design of the low-enthalpy geothermal system, including all major components below, has been carried out
with the assistance of qualified consultants resulting in a state-of-the art complex. Some optimization will
continue as new districts are being added gradually to the system.
Drilling geothermal wells: In 1996 and 1997, two new geothermal wells were drilled with very
good results. During hydrodynamic testing, production well Banska PGP- 1 demonstrated a production rate
of 750 m3/h and a reservoir temperature of 91C. These results significantly reduced the previously
planned investment cost for the subsurface part of the Project. Reduction of investment costs is realized
because fewer well doublets will need to be drilled based on the very high production rate from well PGP-1.
To cover the heat demand for the entire Project including Nowy Targ and to have sufficient reserve
capacity, only three more wells are needed - one for production and two for reinjection. This will bring the
total number of geothermal wells to seven.
Geothermal base-load plant (approximately 38-43 MWt): At the production well site, a new
building to house the geothermal base-load plant has now been constructed, including geothermal
heat-exchangers, pumps, filters, and ancillary equipment. The base-load plant was commissioned in late
1998. The building also includes living quarters for a full-time plant superintendent as required by Polish
regulations for heating plant supervision. This base-load plant will be expanded to begin serving the Nowy
Targ load in 2002.
*     Absorption heat pumps (33 MWth). The results of technical and economic optimization done in
late 1999 have shown that an economic optimum can be reached using 3 doublets if a 33 MWth heat pump
capacity is added to the project design. The reduced electric pumping costs associated with 3 doublets are
almost offset by the additional gas needed to drive the heat pumps. Thus, capital costs rather than operating
costs are dominant in the economic assessment. The 3 doublet-33 MW heat pump solution reduces annual
costs by about 3.1 percent compared to four doublets with no heat pumps. The savings in capital costs is
about $1.7 million dollars while annual cost savings are approximately $133,000. Heat pumps with three
-24 -



doublets are preferred over the full range of possible heat pumnp investment costs examined.
*     While these cost savings are not dramatic relative to the total project costs, the reduced risk in
moving from 4 to 3 doublets is significant. The possibility of adding a fourth doublet in the future while
remaining within permit limits for total hot water extraction is also attractive. Geotermia Podhalanska has
now accepted the 3 doublet solution and Project preparation is proceeding on that basis.
*     Gas-fired peak-load plants: In Zakopane, a new building to house the 22 MWt peaking plant was
constructed. The plant includes two gas boilers (2xl I MWt) as well as pumps, heat exchangers, filters, and
ancillary equipment. The plant was tested in August, 1998 and is now supplying all of the Project heat to
Zakopane. This plant will be expanded gradually to 48 MWt as additional service area is connected to the
network. The 14 MWt Nowy Targ peaking plant is yet to be designed.
*     District heating network: In 1997, 3.5 km of transmission network was constructed. This line will
be extended to 14 km to link the geothermal base-load plant located in Banska Nizna with the Zakopane
peak-load plant. The network within Zakopane has been developed further during the 1998 and 1999
seasons.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
-  The main executing agency of the Project is PEC Geotermia Podhalanska, S.A. (see the description in
Section C-4).
-  A final choice of the responsible agency for the M&E Component has not been mnade yet. The agencies
currently being considered include the Polish EcoFund and the Krakow Office of the Polish Academy
of Science.
4.2 Project management:
PEC Geotermia Podhalanska, S.A. is a small company with about 70 employees. While the staff is
admittedly small in relation to the size of the Project, the management capacity is considered sufficient.
This reflects both the technology and the history of development of this project. The Managing Director of
Geotermia Podhalanska has been involved in this project since inception and has managed successfully to
bring it to its current stage without the key financing component yet in place. hnplementation of the Project
with adequate fmancing in place should be relatively easy compared to development under scarce and
insecure financing.
PEC/GP will receive continuing technical assistance from DEPA with regard to surface engineering design,
construction and implementation of the Project. The completed Project offers a relatively simple technology
to operate. The system is designed to a very high standard and maintenance expenses should be low. The
merger with Tatry brought district heating expertise into the company. The geothermal part of the Project
is largely automated and will not require large numbers of people to operate like coal plants.
In accordance with the Project's global objective, the Borrower is expected to employ a contractor
acceptable to the Bank to undertake the monitoring and evaluation of C02 reduction (by October 31,
2000). In monitoring the carbon reductions achieved, the responsible agency will be requested to follow the
recommendations of the monitoring protocol (to be developed with GEF support), which will outline the
necessary measures - including institutional and technical arrangements, incentives etc. - suitable
performance indicators, and analytical tools to adequately and efficiently monitor, evaluate and report
project benefits. The development of a standard monitoring procedure for carbon mitigation projects is
-25 -



expected to test, and contribute to, the replicability of the Podhale Project concept.
By the end of year 2001, a report will be prepared on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the
Project and integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation of global enviromnental benefits (C02
emission reduction). At that point, modifications may be proposed to the implementation plan as needed to
ensure the achievement of the Project's objectives.
The roles of the National Fund (the majority shareholder) and EcoFund (potential implementing agency for
the Monitoring and Evaluation component) in promoting, publicizing, monitoring and evaluating the
Project will need to be discussed with the Borrower. The long-term expectation is that the National Fund
will reduce their ownership share in the Project with their participation increasingly focused on promotional
roles. The EcoFund has the capacity to implement the monitoring and evaluation of the Project's
environmental benefits. The main focus of the M&E effort should be on tracking market penetration,
financial performance of PEC/GP and confirmation of the environmental objectives achieved.
5. Environmental:                Environmental Category: B
Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation
The primary, long-term environmental impacts of the Project are clearly positive both in terms of local and
global emissions of air pollutants. Negative impacts are limited and related mostly to the temporary
inconveniences associated with construction processes. No resettlement is required under the Project. There
will be only limited land acquisition, for which a Land Acquisition Plan was prepared by PEC/GP as a
condition of negotiation. Loan or GEF Grant proceeds will not finance land acquisition. In accordance with
OP/BP/GP 4.01, the Borrower has prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The EMP was
finalized and agreed upon during negotiations.
While generally not bad in comparison with some industrialized areas of Central and Eastern Europe, the
air quality in Zakopane, and especially Nowy Targ, is characterized by elevated levels of suspended
particulate matter due to coal combustion during the heating season.
Total suspended particulates (TSP) is the only kind of particulate matter for which measurements are
currently available in the Podhale area. In Nowy Targ, both daily (24-hour average) concentrations and
annual mean concentrations of TSP exceed the national standards (see Annex 11). In Zakopane, annual
mean concentrations of TSP are within the national standard of 75 ug/m3, but daily average
concentrations occasionally exceed the national standard of 150 ug/m3. The maximum daily average
concentration observed in 1997 was about 2.5 times the national standard in both Zakopane and Nowy
Targ. Concentrations of S02 are within the norm for both Zakopane and Nowy Targ.
Besides the Polish national standards, comparisons have been made for daily (24-hour) average
concentrations of TSP in Zakopane and Nowy Targ with other standards and reconmnended values,
including the EU limit value (300 ug/m3), the WHO guidelines for Europe (120 ug/m3), etc. - see the
-26 -



charts in technical addendum to Annex 11. It is obvious that both Zakopane and Nowy Targ will meet the
EU limit value rather easily but are out of compliance with the WHO guidelines for Europe because of the
heating season peaks. For black smoke (a rough proxy for PM1O), the EU guide value is 100-150 ug/m3
for 24-hour concentrations and 40-60 ug/m3 for annual mean concentration. No EU guide value appears to
exist for TSP, however the new EU Directive on Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management
(96/62/EC) sets the annual average concentration standard for PM10 at 30 ug/m3 effective January 1,
2005.
By suppressing the heating season episodes of high pollution, the Project can make it possible for the
Podhale area to meet the WHO guidelines for Europe, as well the Polish national standard for 24-hour
average concentration of PM10, which is envisaged to be tightened in 2005 from the current level of 125
ug/m3 to 50 ug/m3. It is quite unlikely that the Podhale area would be able to meet this latter standard with
anything less than a massive conversion to geothermal heat.
Besides the seasonal patterns (heating vs non-heating season), the other factor contributing to occasional
days of high pollution in the Podhale district is the atmospheric inversions, when pollutants tend to settle in
the valley in which Zakopane is located. Concerns about the state of air pollution affecting the population's
health have been of high priority to the municipalities, as once the area was known primarily for its clean
air and pulmonary sanatoriums.
The air pollution problem is generally more serious in Nowy Targ than in Zakopane. There, the annual
average ambient standard for particulates is substantially exceeded, and the daily average concentrations of
TSP exceed the standard for 15% of the days in a year.

As described in detail in Annex 11, the reduction in the emissions of particulate matter are expected to be
about 700 tons/year throughout the life of the Project. The total reduction in particulate emissions relative
to the baseline will be between 14.9 and 18.3 thousand tons over the Project life. The avoided emissions of
S02 are expected to be about 1,434 tons/year in 1999-2004, 1,291 tons/year in 2005-2024, and 29.9 -
34.5 thousand tons over the life of the Project.
- 27 -



The environmental benefits to the Project area (Zakopane, Nowy Targ, and the villages in the conversion
area), as well as to the outside recipients of air pollution from electricity generation, are estimated to be
about US$14.5 million if the Nowy Targ boilers' continued coal-fired operation is accepted as the baseline
scenario for Nowy Targ.
Because the peak-load plants and the heat pumps will be using natural gas, C02 emissions will occur in the
amount of 17,070 tons per year at steady state, as well as emissions of NOx. Electricity use for pumping
will also lead to Project-related C02 emissions of 22,860 tons per year from grid power plants, as well as
NOx and other pollutants related to the combustion of fuel needed to generate electricity. During the
environmental assessment of the Project, attention was given to NOx and other issues affecting the local
environment of Zakopane. Similar assessments will be conducted for the proposed Nowy Targ peaking
plant and for the gas-fired heat pumps. However, given the relatively small capacity of the gas-fired units
and the superior combustion technology (low-NOx burners), no major concern is expected to be caused by
the Project emissions.
The impact of the Project on other environmental media also needs consideration. lmproperly designed or
operated geothermal systems may pose some risk of contaminating drinking water. However, this Project
emrploys a closed-loop design, in which this risk is minimized. The water is supplied to heat exchangers and
then reinjected back into the reservoir without being in direct contact with the consumer or the environment.
The techniques involved in drilling wells, reclamation of land, well-head installations, connections, well
testing, and geothermal reservoir management have been tested out on-site during the past three years with
the assistance of technical experts from Denmark and the US. The Polish mining authority regulations for
geothermal resource exploration and development have now fully evolved and have been implemnented by
Geotermia Podhalanska. These include detailed procedures for EIA and licensing subject to environmental
compliance.
The mineralization of the geothermal waters used for the project is mostly in the range of 0.2 - 0.4 g/l, but
in some strata of the geothermal reservoir it may reach about 3.0 g/l. This level of salinity is still
remarkably low by comparison with other geothermal reservoirs currently under development in Poland and
elsewhere in Europe - e.g., in Pyrzyce (140 g/l) or in Klaipeda, Lithuania, where the Bank is implementing
a GEF-supported geothermal project. Nevertheless, the discharge of geothermal water into the mountain
streams in the vicinity of a National Park is considered undesirable. For this reason, it is important to
maintain the closed-loop system.

6. Social:
6.1 Sumnmnarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The tariff for geothermal heat is not going to be higher than for acceptable conventional alternatives
because the local environmental and global carbon benefits will be internalized through grants. The current
tariff is PLN29/GJ (in 1998 terms) for residential customers, and PLN32/GJ for large loads, whereas the
district heat customers of the coal-fired systern in Zakopane paid PLN40/GJ under the Tatry company, and
Nowy Targ was paying PLN34/GJ.
In the future, tariff increases will mostly serve to compensate for local inflation. As noted earlier (Section
B-2), according to the new secondary legislation, the Energy Regulatory Authority (URE) provides a
license for district heating operations. It would reject unfair tariff increases. PEC/GP has obtained its
operating license and an endorsement of its tariff structure by URE.
Connection to geothermal energy requires a considerable up-front investment estimnated at about $2,700 per
household. Since market penetration estimates are linited to 60% of households in the areas with proposed
access to the geothermal system, it is expected that many households would continue to use the existing
fuels. E.g., it is not anticipated that large numnbers of Polish highlander farmers would opt for geothermal
heat. Those that can most readily afford to discontinue the effort and discomfort of coal heat are most likely
to do so by taking an inexpensive loan from one of the local financial intermediaries (see section "Market
penetration strategy" in Section C4). Since free choice to continue present practices has been assumed, no
social hardships are anticipated as a result of this Project.
If significant demand develops for geothermal heat by those currently unable to afford the required initial
investment, the funds offered by the EcoFund to support conversions would be targeted to households with
incomes below a certain level to mitigate any negative social imnpacts from the Project.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
The local public at large: A series of public meetings in Zakopane, with the presence of press, TV, radio.
Municipalities of Zakopane, Poronin, Koscielisko, Banska Nizna, Bialy Dunajec, Szaflary and Nowy
Targ: Active involvement in Project development, permitting and shareholding in Geotermia Podhalanska;
construction permits. A list of public meetings is available in the project file and as an attachment to the

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Market Penetration: The market penetration of geothermal energy has been at the center of the Bank's
assessment of this Project since the very beginning of its involvernent. As mentioned in Section C-1 and
discussed in more detail in Annex 2, about 400 TJ (or 33% of the project target for geothermal heat supply)
is currently secure already. The sustainability of the progress with market penetration is an obvious key to
the success of the Project, and early experience with market penetration should be closely monitored to
improve the forecasts for future penetration rates.
PEC/GP's marketing database provides good data on the numbers of potential consumers. The existing
heating fuel mix is also available based on survey data. Part of the Project monitoring effort will be to
establish databases which show the percent of potential achieved within a two-year period after geothermal
energy becomes available, and which update the data on fuel displacement. It should be emphasized that
PEC/GP will not commit to construction of the supply system to specific areas until it has obtained
agreernent from a sufficient number of customers in that area to cover the costs of the extensions. This
limits the financial exposure. Monitoring will also allow PEC/GP to identify barriers to conversion for
certain types of consumers and to design incentive schemes to reduce those barriers if necessary.
Sustainability of the Project results will also depend on whether a customer that converts to geothermal
energy will continue to use this source of heat over the long term. Once converted, the customer may or
may not retain the option of reverting to the existing boiler system. For those who do, the continuing
economnic comparison would be between geothernal and fuel costs plus an allowance for. comfort and labor
differentials. It should be noted that those customers that obtain their heat exchangers from PEC/GP and
- 30 -



wish to pay through a tariff add-on will be required to continue on geothermal heat for 10 years or to pay
the full remaining balance of the heat exchanger cost when they exit the system.
Financial Sustainability: For the heating season of 2000/2001, a 15% tariff increase is considered for
approval by URE. This is higher than the local inflation but is justified based on real tariff declines in
1998 and 1999. The base case assumption in the financial model is for no tariff increases beyond local
inflation after the year 2000. As long as the heat tariffs are allowed to cover the base costs (see section E-2
and Annex 5), neither operating subsidies nor excessive tariff increases are needed. The conversion rate
projections are based on cost advantages to the customers that convert. The grant funding for local and
global environmental externalities will contribute further to PEC/GP's revenues without a tariff increase.
The financial analysis shows adequate rates of return based on heat prices that are below average for
similar places in Poland. Of course, expanding the customer base is essential (see above), and PEC/GP is
expending much effort in arranging long-term heat supply contracts.
Legal and Regulatory Environment. The Project is dependent on mining sector regulations under the
auspices of the Mining Law, which has now developed rules for geothermal energy with regard to the
geothermal plant, and dependent on the Energy Law with regard to the district heating system for the full
utilization of its benefits. Replication of projects of this kind would benefit significantly from a policy
which taxes the users of polluting fuels and/or establishes the basis of granting funds for clean and
renewable energy projects to cover measurable environmental benefits. In this regard, it is imnportant to
make sure that (i) the royalty for geothermal heat extraction, if applied to PEC/GP operations, is
reasonable and transparent, and (ii) that the GEF Grant proceeds are not diverted to pay domestic taxes.
On the latter subject, the position of the Ministry of Finance is that, being effectively an income stream for
PEC/GP, GEF Grant proceeds are not automatically exempt from income taxation by the Government. At
the same time, the Finance Ministry representatives have acknowledged the beneficial environmental
character of the Project and the significance of this fact in making a decision on the applicable tax rates.
Long-term Commitment of the Implementing Agency: PEC/GP and the National Fund are both
committed to the Project. The long-term expectation is that the National Fund will reduce its equity
ownership and increasingly focus on promotional roles. The National Fund's shares in the company are
expected to be gradually re-purchased by PEC/GP, which should further strengthen the company's stake in
the Project's success.
Technical Sustainability and Risks: All yield and sustainability indicators for the geothermal resource are
very positive to date. The minimum estimated period between the drilling of the wells and any impact of the
lower-temperature reinjection waters on the productivity of the production wells has been estimated at well
over 25 years. There are undoubtedly some remaining technical risks associated with a partially completed
geothermal project. However, as noted earlier (Section E-3), the geothermal reservoir has been extensively
studied, and production from the two completed doublets (out of three envisaged for the full project) is
already sufficient to provide 50-60% of the total geothermal heat requirement for the full Project. The risk
of insufficient geothermal flow rate has decreased dramatically with the completion of the second
geothermal doublet. This risk is further reduced by the decision of PEC/GP to limit the number of wells
drilled to only one more production well and two reinjection wells by introducing gas-fired absorption heat
pumps, which will cover intermediate heat demand.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The Bank has requested that details of the royalty scheme for geothermal resource utilization applicable to
PEC/GP operations are made available to the Bank. This has been done, but the subject requires further
- 34 -



discussion. The geological law of 1994 allows for a royalty on underground resources. Such a royalty
(extraction fee), may be imposed by the local Mining Authority for the extraction of geothermal water.
However, considering the renewable nature of the geothermal resource and the closed-loop design of the
geotherrnal heat utilization system, there is little justification for charching such a fee on this Project's
operations. The Project has been instrumental to stimulate a dialogue with the Ministry of Enviromnent on
this subject, but the outcome is uncertain.

Annex 2: Project Description
POLAND: PODHALE GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
Project Background and Progress to Date
This district heating Project began in 1995 when the initial doublet, drilled for demonstration purposes by
the Polish Academy of Sciences, was connected to about 200 households in Banska Nizna. The Bank first
got involved at this point. Since 1995, the following additional Project components have been completed:
* A second production well and one of two reinjection wells that will be used with it;
* Construction of the base-load geothermal plant including nearly 73% of the ultimate geothermal
capacity;
*   Completion of 3.5 km out of 14.0 km of district heat transmission line between the base-load plant
and Zakopane;
* Expansion of the distribution network in Bialy Dunajec and connection of 27 additional
households;
* Construction of the 22 MWt first phase of the gas-fired peaking plant in Zakopane;
* Conversion of ten coal-fired district heating boilers in Zakopane to heat exchangers connected to
the new network (see Table A2-2);
-   Connection of 45 (by the end of 1999) of the expected 172 large loads to the network.
Market penetration of geothermal energy has been at the center of the Bank's assessment of this Project
since the very beginning of its involvement. The following summary assessment of the market penetration
to date helps to clarify the current status of the Project in relation to the eventual targets.

The Zakopane DH loads are virtually certain. The decision to convert these boiler houses to geothermal
heat belongs to Geotermia Podhalanska since the merger with Tatry.

The Nowy Targ loads now also appear highly probable. A letter of intent by Nowy Targ to use geothermal
energy was a condition of the Board presentation, and it has been provided by the Borrower.
Forty five of the 172 large loads are already connected (or confirmed as being connected) to geotherrmal
energy by the end of 1999. Of these forty five, 16 customers were connected in 1998 and, in 1999, 29 more
large loads are under construction. The annual heat demand from these 45 loads is about 55 TJ. This
means that PEC/GP has connected 26 % of the large loads in terms of number and 11 % in terms of heat
load. The remaining large loads are substantially larger on average than the first 45.
Approximately 15.5 TJ of household load is expected to connect before the end of 1999. In sumn, this
suggests that about 400 TJ or nearly 33% of the target load can be considered secure at the time of the
Bank's commitmnent to the Project.
However, much of the network (most notably, in the city of Zakopane) is still being supplied by the
gas-fired Zakopane plant until the connection to the base-load geothermal plant is completed.
The Full Project: Components, Phases and Detailed Description
To complete the full project, the following major components will be added from 2000 through 2004:
The transmission line to Zakopane will be completed in 2000;
3 One additional reinjection well will be drilled in 2000;
3 One additional geothermal doublet (production well and reinjection well) will be drilled in 2001;
* An absorption heat pump plant (AHPP), a pressure reduction station and two gas pipelines will be
built in 2001;
3 Additional villages will be connected - including Poronin and Szaflary in 2000, and Koscielisko in
2002;
T The district heat boiler houses in Nowy Targ will be connected in 2002;
3 The distribution network will be comipleted by 2003.
i Heat exchangers and meters will be installed in remaining households and large loads by 2004.
The Project in its complete form will provide district heat to a majority of potential customers in the
main Podhale Valley. The service area will extend about 14 km from the production wells to the City of
Zakopane and about 7 km in the opposite direction from the well field to Nowy Targ (see map in Annex
12). The transmission line between the geothermal wells and Zakopane will be completed. In addition to the
villages of Banska Nizna and Bialy Dunajec already receiving geothermal heat, the villages Poronin and
Szaflary will be connected in 2000, Koscielisko in 2002. Three district heating boiler houses in Nowy Targ
will be connected in 2002. The main components of the full project (including the completed components as
indicated above) are:
(a)    drilling seven geothermal wells (of which four wells are already completed) including three for
production and four for reinjection. The production wells will extract low-enthalpy (- 85 to 87.5
C temperature) geothermal waters in the Podhale basin to cover the base-load heat demand for the
entire project service area including both Zakopane and Nowy Targ;
(b)    constructing a base-load district heating plant with a capacity of approximately 38 to 43 MWt
- 43 -



(currently, at 15MWt heat exchanger capacity and 28 to 32 MWt geotherral resource capacity),
capable of providing about 1,015 terajoules (TJ) of geothermal heat;
(c)   constructing an absorption heat pump plant (AHPP) with two associated gas-fired hot water
boilers at the site of the base-load geothermal plant, gas network pressure reductioin station, and
two gas pipelines - from the main gas transmission pipeline to the three AHPs at the base-load
plant site (2.5 km), and from the main gas transmission pipeline to the peak-load plant in Nowy
Targ (5-6 km); the total output of the AHPP will be 33 MW, of which 60% is gas-based and 40%
is based on the additional extraction of heat from geothermal water; the total output from the
AHPP will be 355 TJ.
(d)   constructing a 48 MWt peak-load natural gas plants in Zakopane (currently at 22 MWt) and a
similar plant in Nowy Targ (planned at 14 MWt) with total production of about 73 TJ of heat;
(e)    acquisition of land, expanding existing buildings and constructing new buildings for the production
facilities;
(f)   expanding the existing district heating systems by some 100 km of new pipeline network, including
the geothermal circuit, transmission and distribution pipelines, and connections to individual
households and other consumers;
(g)   installing heat exchangers and heat meters in individual households and other buildings;
(h)    monitoring and reporting the environmental benefits from the Project (with special emnphasis on
carbon ernission reduction), including the introduction of institutional and technical arrangements
to monitor their achievement according to suitable performance indicators.

The geothermal heat supply to the villages of Banska Nizna and Bialy Dunajec started in 1995 and 1998,
respectively, and the city of Zakopane was connected in 1999. Poronin and Szaflary will be connected in
2000, Koscielisko in 2002. Three district heating boiler houses in Nowy Targ would be connected in 2001.
These cities and villages are all in the central valley of the Podhale basin. The model developed here can
then be quickly adapted for use in other localities with geothermal resources, such as the towns of the
eastern and western valleys of Podhale. To complete the system in the Central Valley under the Project will
take till 2004.
By Component:
Project Component I - US$43.20 million
A. Production and Transmission of Heat. The production plant units, including the geothermal doublets,
the geothermal heat exchange plant, two peak-load natural gas plants (Zakopane and Nowy Targ), a
medium-pressure transrnission pipeline, related pumping stations and pressure reducing equipment, as well
as needed land and buildings.
Project Component 2 - US$24.30 million
B. Heat Distribution Network Development. The construction of distribution networks and conmection of
-45 -



custormers in Zakopane, Nowy Targ, and a number of villages in the main valley between these two cities.
Project Component 3 - USS 4.60 million
C. Provision of Heat Exchangers, Meters, and Other Goods. The component provides for supply and
installation of heat exchangers and heat meters. The customers will include district heating systems in
Zakopane and Nowy Targ, other large loads (on a cost sharing basis), but exclude individual households.
The cost covers heat exchangers, heat meters, and an installation fee. The component also includes
provision of miscellaneous tools, equipment, and vehicles for PEC/GP.
Project Component 4 - US$0.45 million
D. Project Management. Provision of technical assistance for the implementation of financial
management, including auditing.
Project Component 5 - US$0.40 million
E. Monitoring & Evaluation, through an independent agency, of the GHG reduction benefits from the
Project - based on a monitoring and evaluation protocol for carbon reduction projects, to be developed with
GEF assistance.
In addition to the above-mentioned base Project costs of US$ 72.1 million (for Components A, B, and C),
as well as US$ 0.85 million for the institutional development Components D and E, the total Project cost
estimates include:
(a)    Physical contingencies of US$6.0 million, averaging about 8.3% of total base costs, and
(b)    Price contingencies of US$2.6 million, averaging 3.7% of total base costs.
The total contingency allowance is thus US $8.6 million. No contingencies are included in the historic costs
pre-1999. Physical contingencies on drilling of wells and on geological works have been estimated at 30%,
whereas a 10% contingency has been allowed for all remaining items from 1999 onwards. Price
contingencies are based on estimated expenditures (base costs in 1998-terms plus physical contingency)
between 1999 and 2004 and take account of projected inflation in Poland, Germany and the USA.
The allowance for interest during construction, plus fees, amounts to US$ 6.2 million.
Finally, the incremental working capital is calculated at about US$ 9.0 million.

Annex 4
POLAND: PODHALE GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
INCREMENTAL COST ANALYSIS SUMMARY
Baseline
The region of Pohale is a well-known ski resort in the Tatra mountains in southern Poland. With over two
million visitations per year, tourism is the primary economic activity. The space and water heating needs in
the area are currently met primarily through the burning of coal, coke or wood in individual household or
commercial boilers or from the coal-fired district heating systems in the two dominant cities of Zakopane
and Nowy Targ. Some commercial facilities have converted from coal to oil or gas boilers for
environmental and convenience reasons. Most households use electric water heaters in the summer season
when the boilers are not operating.
Natural gas distribution networks are the typical comnpetitors for new district heating systems. Although
natural gas is available in Zakopane, the villages between Zakopane and Nowy Targ are exclusively heated
by atomistic household and commercial systems. Given the linear, low density development pattern in the
valley, future gas networks are not probable on a standard commercial basis. In Nowy Targ, the proposed
project would supply a portion of the district heating system now supplied by three coal boiler houses.
Proposals for replacement of these boilers have been taken from coal interests, gas interests and Geoternia
Podhalanska.
The current Zakopane gas supply is sufficient for peak-load operation with the geothermal heating system
and could provide about 70% of the total heat demand from anticipated geothermal heat customers in case
of emergencies (as in temporary failure of the geothermal system). LPG is not an established alternative
since storage and delivery capability are not developed and due to the relatively high price of this fuel.
Conversion of coal and coke systems to fuel oil provides another conversion option.
Local air quality standards will require expensive upgrades of most coal and coke systems at time of
replacement in the cities of Zakopane and Nowy Targ where pollutant concentrations exceed allowable
standards. EU accession will probably further stiffen compliance requirements. For these reasons, the
baseline for Zakopane assumes substantial migration from coal and coke to gas and oil during the next
decade. For households, the ten year conversion target is roughly equal to the number of anticipated
replacements of the existing home heating systems. For the Tatry boiler houses, conversion of all coke
boilers to gas is aggressively assumed to be complete by the end of 2001. In Nowy Targ, the baseline
evaluated here assumes replacement of the existing coal boilers with compliant coal technology by 2001.
For the villages between Zakopane and Nowy Targ, gas extensions are not likely because of low heating
densities. Continued use of existing coal and coke heating fuels would not be disadvantaged since the
concentrations of major air pollutants are not expected to exceed standards in these more rural areas.
To summarize, the baseline includes conversion to gas for the Tatry district heat system and a new
compliant coal district heat system in Nowy Targ by 2001. Individual households and large loads in
Zakopane are assumed to convert to oil or gas at the time of replacement of existing heating systems over
the next decade because compliance with emission regulations would make continued use of coal
prohibitively expensive. In the villages between Zakopane and Nowy Targ, continued use of existing fuels
is assumed because of cost advantages and since air quality regulations would not be limiting. The baseline
thus includes all costs of compliance with Polish air quality regulations but does not achieve the same

levels of reduction in emissions as the proposed project.
GEF Proposed Project
The proposed Podhale Geothernal District Heating Project would exploit a rich reservoir of hot water to
establish a new geothermal district heating system supplemented with gas-fired heat pumps and gas
peaking plants. This new system would supply the space and water heating needs of residential and
commercial consumers in an area that includes parts ofZakopane and Nowy Targ and the developed areas
between these limiting nodes. The service area would extend about 14 km from the production wells to the
City of Zakopane and about 7 km in the opposite direction from the well field to Nowy Targ.
The project has been under development since 1995, and feasibility work is practically completed. The
feasibility study yielded encouraging results from a technical-engineering point of view, but it raised
questions about the comnmercial viability of the project. Both economic and financial feasibility have now
been assessd in detail and the project can be shown to meet or exceed World Bank investment criteria when
environmental benefits are recognized. Economnic feasibility depends on explicit recognition of the
environmental costs of continued use of fossil fuels in termns of health-related costs. Financial viability
depends on environmental grants to qualify the project for World Bank loan consideration. Without
environmental grants, the heat price needed to achieve an adequate financial rate of return would
substantially dampen the conversion prospects and related carbon reductions.
The economic costs of the project are $90.3 million including $13.1 million for heating system conversions
paid for by the end users. These figures are expressed in constant 1999 USD and include 10 percent
contingencies on all future outlays except for well drilling. The drilling contingency is 30 percent.
Financial costs are presented in Annex 5.
Although the construction and investment periods extend from 1995 through 2004, the major investments
will be completed by 2003. Annual economic operating costs at full scale operation in 2005 are anticipated
to be about $3.5 million (in 1999 USD). The life cycle of the project has been chosen to extend through
2024 since this represents 20 years of full-scale operation and because of the long life of this technology
without major reinvestments. The 1995 (BOY/11%) present value of the life cycle costs from 1995
through 2024 of the proposal is $70.1 million. Undiscounted life-cycle costs total about $181.3 million.
After full irnplementation, the geothermal system will produce about 1,444 TJ of heat annually of which
1,203 TJ will be sold. The difference represents transmission and distribution losses of about 10%. In
addition, a few of the former coal-fired boiler houses in Zakopane that have recently been converted to gas-
firing will produce about 20 TJ per year of which 17 TJ will be sold.
Because of the capital intensity and relatively long ramp-up period, the economics of the project are very
sensitive to the pace and magnitude of the market penetrations achieved. Based on detailed market
penetration studies and discussions with the district heating companies, the following sales forecasts were
developed for 2005 when the system reaches full implementation:

Zakopane DH          28                 114       9.3%
Nowy Targ DH         3                 235       19.3%
Total             4 446               1 220     100.0%
Additionality
To qualify for GEF grants the economic and fnancial impact of such credits on project realization must be
demonstrated. This project relies centrally on a World Bank loan to cover a significant portion of the
remaining investment costs. To obtain a World Bank loan, the project will need a sufficient economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) and a sufficient financial internal rate of return (FIRR). At this point, it is
clear that both the EIRR and FIRR will require recognition of the value of carbon reductions to meet World
Bank investment criteria. The EIRR on the full project (1995 - 2024) is just 8.6% based solely on heating
cost savings. The EIRR on the incremental project (2000 - 2024) is 15.9% based solely on heating cost
savings but this ignores significant geothermal investments in prior years and is not then representative of a
replicable project based on this technology.
Emission Reductions
The project will provide a sizable reduction in C02 emissions as substantial volumes of coal, coke, gas and
fuel oil combustion are replaced by geothermal and gas as the prirary and peaking heating fuels. Based on
the assumptions outlined below, the carbon reductions achieved through the project are estimated at about
2.7 million tons of C02 (tCO2) over twenty years of full operation (2005 - 2024) and the ramp up period
(1995 - 2004). This is equivalent to about 730.9 thousand metric tons of carbon (tC).
Baseline Emissions
C02 ermissions from the production of energy in the baseline were calculated on the basis of the following
emission factors:
*   coal:            0.33 tCO2 / MWh;
*  coke:             0.37 tCO2 /MWh
*   oil:             0.28 tCO2 /MWh
*  gas:              0.20 tCO2 / MWh
*  electricity       1.11 tCO2 / MWh at residential end user
Electric production on the Polish grid is coal-based so the coal factor is applied to displaced electric
production. The average efficiency of the Polish electric production is 33% and transmission and
distribution losses might be 10%, resulting in an emission factor of 1.11 tCO2 / MWh for electricity
measured at the residential end-user.
Three types of consumers were distinguished:
- 51 -



*   small consumers (households)
*   large consumers using more than 300 GJ per year
* Zakopane and Nowy Targ district heating systems

households that are expected to convert to geothermal are shown in the following table.

The base case carbon emissions from converting households increase as shown above. The strong growth in
the early period is due to increased number of households converting to geothermal as the network is
extended. From 2004 to 2008, baseline emissions continue to decrease because additional households are
converting from coal or coke to gas or oil. In 2008, baseline residential C02 emissions stabilize at 50,834
tons per year. The total base case emissions from the converting households from 1995 through 2024 are
1,171,668 tons of C02.
Large consumers
There are 172 individual large loads, each using more than 300 GJ per year, that are expected to convert to
geothermal based on cost comparisons with gas and oil options. To comply with environmental regulations
at the time of boiler replacement, continued use of coal or coke would be rather expensive. These loads are
concentrated in Zakopane with only 6 located in the villages. The 172 expected loads represent a
penetration rate of about 80% of those that will have access to the geothermal network. Specific cost
comparisons were made for a sample of 38 of these loads. The results for 34 loads now using coal or coke
indicate that geothermal would cost less than 90% of continued use of the existing fuel for 81% of the GJ
used. Comparisons for 4 loads now using oil show geothermal is less costly in each case.
The fuels used by the 172 loads are characterized in the following table. Again, the assumed baseline
conversions to gas or oil within Zakopane are evident.

The total baseline emissions for 1995 -2024 for these 172 large loads are 1,331,256 tons of C02.
Zakopane District Heat: In 1997, the district heat boiler houses in Zakopane were fired by coal (85%) and
natural gas (15%). Prior to 1998, the Tatry boiler houses feeding the Zakopane district heating system
operated identically in the baseline and with the proposed project. It is assumed that all of the boiler houses
will switch to natural gas in the baseline by 2003. The following table shows the baseline heating fuel and
electric consumption for the Tatry boiler houses beginning with 1998. Heat sales from the Tatry boiler
houses remain constant from 1998 on but production declines based on the assumption that losses in the
system would be reduced significantly.

The baseline emissions for the Tatry boiler houses are 367,042 tons of C02 over the 1995 - 2024 period
of operation.
Nowy Targ District Heat: The 3 boiler houses to be connected are currently fired primarily by fme-grained
coal. By 2003, these boiler houses will be converted to gas or geothermnal or will be retrofitted with new
coal boilers based on the tenders that are now being requested. The baseline assumes coal will be chosen.

These results support the following conclusions:
I. The most critical factor examined here is the investment cost associated with the project.
Fortunately, some of that cost has already been incurred and is not subject to uncertainty. In
addition, contingencies of 30% on well drilling and 10% on all other items have been included.
Lower costs than the estimates including contingencies are quite possible and would have
significant beneficial impact.
2. Gas prices and the marginal costs of electricity are quite uncertain but have very limited impact
since they impact both the baseline and the proposed project to a similar extent.
3. Results are fairly sensitive to oil prices because many loads have been assumed to convert to
fuel oil in the baseline. Recent oil price developments suggest that prices are much more likely
to be higher rather than lower than the base forecast. That will have a beneficial impact on unit
abatement costs.
4. Discount rates have a significant impact but this is a predetermined investment criterion rather
than a speculative future parameter.
5. There is no absolute way to determine whether Nowy Targ would have chosen coal or gas firing
for the three boiler houses that will convert to georthermal had the baseline materialized. Had
gas been chosen rather than coal, it is reassuring that the increase in unit abatement costs is
limited to 17.0%.
6. Large loads are the dominant sector. This means that Geoternia Podhalanska can concentrate
their marketing efforts on 172 loads that are expected to convert. In fact, they have followed
exactly this strategy to date.
7. The most reasonable general expectation is that some parameters will be higher than expected
and others lower than expected. From the sensitivity cases examanined it does not appear that
the unit abatement costs will be likely to vary by more than 10 to 15% from the base estimates.

Annex 4.1
STAP Roster Technical Review
Summary
The project complies with the documentation requirements. The title page contains the required data on the
project, funding and the prospective debtor and guarantor. The goals of the project are described clearly
enough and presented in the required manner.
The main benefit is the reduction of C02 emissions and at the same time a reduction of air pollution from
particulates, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from local coal boilers by switching to geothermal heat and
also partially to natural gas.
The incremental costs are $7.42 per ton of C02 when a 12% discount rate is assumed (10% discount
generates a cost of only $5.63/t C02).
The project was reviewed after the initial pilot phase was cornpleted and first results support the project
expectations. The Podhale geothermnal project is recommend for implementation.
Project Objectives
e     A 70% reduction of C02 emissions in the area of Zakopane and Nowy Targ and thus an overall
reduction of C02 in Poland;
Improving environmental quality (with special reference to air pollution) through the reduction in the
use of energy generated from combustible fuels in the area; decisive reduction in the winter peak amnbient
concentrations of particulate matter and S02 in the geothermal conversion area making sure that the Polish
anmual average standard for ambient air quality is met in Zakopane by the year 2000.
*     Support sustainability by increasing geothermal energy use and replacing coal with this renewable
energy source;
*     Increase the use of renewables in Poland's energy balance;

At the present time the market is covered mainly by coal and coke, minor consumers use natural gas. The
baseline solution involves switching to natural gas in most sites and maintaining a consumption pattern of about
1/4 coal.
Proposed Alternative
The proposed Podhale Geothermal District Heating Project aims to exploit a rich reservoir of hot water to
establish a new geothermal district heating system with supplementary gas peaking plants. The service area
would extend about 14 km from the production wells to the City of Zakopane and about 7 km in the opposite
direction from the well field to Nowy Targ.
The main project components are:
*     drilling five geothermal wells including two for production and three for reinjection in addition to the
two doublets already in place
*     constructing a new base-load district heating plant with a capacity of approximately 60 to 70 megawatts
(MW), with about 1,075 terajoules (TJ) of heat provided from geothermal sources
*     constructing new peak load natural gas plants in Zakopane (42 MWt) and Nowy Targ (12 MWt) with
production of about 305 TJ of heat
*     developing the district heating network (about 100 km), including the geothermal circuit, transmission
and distribution pipelines, and connections to individual households and other consumers.

The incremental economic costs of the Project compared to the baseline expressed as 1994 present value depend
centrally on the real discount rate chosen. Normal World Bank discount rates are from 10.0 to 12.0 percent. The
incremental costs over this range of rates are sumnarized in the following table.

Risks and Issues Requiring Attention
The. project's major risks are connected with the future market:
-     Domestic market risk - lingering subsidies on coal and coke making geothermal energy less economic;
o     Market penetration of geothermnal heating is insufficient to ensure expected return for the investors in
the Project;
*     Insufficient heat tariff adjustment to ensure adequate long-term financial performance of Geotermia
Podhalanska;
The study shows that the project developer is aware of the risks and proposes a rational solution which could
diminish the risks:
*     Long-term contracts for heat supply with the customers; dialogue with the government on geothermal
tariffs.
*     Sufficient time and effort allocated to marketing the geothermal energy as an environmentally clean
source of heat; long-term contracts with large customers.
*     Dialogue with the municipalities on tariff adjustments with simultaneous effort to attract new customers
to spread the fixed costs and realize economies of scale.
*     Proactive marketing; long-term contracts with the large customers (see the same item earlier in the
table).

When the activities mentioned above are implemented in time the overall risk can be considered to be at an
acceptable level.
Borrower and Proposed Financing
The Borrower
The Project will be implemented by Geotermia Podhalanska, SA (GP). GP's majority owner is the Polish
National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management. The initial pilot phase of the project
began supplying 185 homes with geothermal heat in 1995. Full-scale implementation should now be
completed during a seven-year period from 1998 through 2004.
Geotermia Podhalanska (GP) has been in operation since 1994 as a corporation. In January of 1998, GP
merged with the Zakopane district heating company previously called Tatry. Total employment for the
merged companies is about 100. The Company has utilized technical assistance (TA) from Danish and US
experts in geological exploration, exploitation, environmental management, marketing and financial
planning. This TA is expected to continue during the next several years.

Consistency with GEF Program and Country Assistance Strategy
The Objective of the Project complies with GEF goals very well. It represents one of the best approaches
which can serve as a pilot project for other areas in CEE.
Achieving environmental sustainability is a major development goal in the current CAS, including the
issue of reducing emnissions from many small, dispersed sources such as domestic heating. This project
offers a rich blend of environmental and economic outputs and a co-financing structure that contributes
directly to the CAS goals for Poland.
The Podhale geothermal Project also supports the CAS objective of sustainingprivate sector growth.
Promotion of growth in needed infrastructure through expanded private sector investment is identified.

inflation)
In addition to heat sale revenues, there will be further revenues from heat exchanger sales financed during
the first two years by the European Union.
Heat prices for residential, large loads and historic DH customers in Zakopane and at the geothermal base
load plant averaged PLN 37.8 1/GJ in 1998, mostly due to high sales prices of the former Tatry company.
Average prices dropped to PLN 33.95/GJ in 1999 due to tariff alignment among customers in the context
of the merger between Tatry and Geotermia Podhalanska (GP). However, this average still reflects special
pricing offered to the initial customers connected to the pilot geothermal system in 1995. As the new
geothermal system is completed and large number of consumers are converted, average base prices,
expressed in 1998 terms will converge by 2001 on PLN 29.00/GJ for residential consumers and Nowy
Targ district heating, PLN 34.25/GJ for large contractual loads, and PLN 36.35/GJ for previous Zakopane
district heating companies. These base prices in 1998-terms have been established largely on competitive
considerations, and are in line with or even below the Poland-wide average heat price for small and medium
sized cities. Base prices for different customer groups have been projected to increase at the Polish rate of
inflation, after the completion of tariff alignment at the end of year 2001. The tariffs for the heating season
of 2000/2001 are  currently being reviewed by the URE. The average prices in nominal terms   are
expected to develop as shown in the table above. As the number of large loads and residential customers,
- 67 -



with relatively low tariffs, will build up to demand the highest heat loads, average prices for the system will
remain below inflation until the steady state operation is reached in 2004.
The current decree on heat tariff regulation allows price increases due to inflation of costs, and in particular
due to fuel price increases, so the projection assumptions are deemed realistic.
3.     Operating Costs
During steady state operations, nearly 60% of operating costs are resulting from use of gas (30% - for
AHP operations and the peak shaving plants) and electricity (29% - for operations of pumps and equipment
to handle the geothermal (primary) circuit at the geothermal base load plant and the secondary circuit
(transmission pipelines and distribution systems)). The remaining costs comprise maintenance (10%),
personnel, and administration (together 30%). Environmental fees are very small (essentially on the
emissions resulting from use of gas). The extraction fee, calculated at 10% on heat sales at the point of the
geothermal heat exchangers, would amount to almost a zloty per GJ and would account for over 5% of
total operating costs. This fee should not be charged, as the energy recovered from the geothermal water is
renewable (the geotherral water is reinjected). Total operating costs and their key components are shown
below for the period 1999 to 2005 (in thousand current PLN):

Gas use is projected to peak at about 8.13 million m3 per year. Its 1999 price is PLN 550 per 1000 m3
(US$138/1000 m3), based on the fixed annual payment and the tariff per m3. This price is projected to
increase by 0.5% per year in real terms.
Electricity use picks up sharply over the years until 2002 and then stabilizes at around 20.8 GWh per year.
Its 1998 price averaged PLN 186 per MWh and is currently sold at PLN 193 per MWh to the geothermal
plant (PLN 223 per MWh to the fossil-fired system). After a moderate yearly increase until the year 2001,
the electricity price is projected to rise with inflation (i.e. remain stable at the real price in 2001 terms of
PLN 186 per MWh). Electricity use at the fossil-fired system declines to insignificant amounts.
The maintenance costs for equipment and plant of the project is assumed to gradually rise to a steady state
level equivalent to about 0.9% of the actual investment costs for these items, and is assumed to be inflated
from the 1999 level at Polish national inflation applicable to investments.
Personmel cost in 1999 is based on a staff of about 60 full-time staff (expected to grow to 90 persons by
-68 -



2002). From year 2003 onwards, total personnel costs will increase in line with inflation. The estimates
beyond 2004 are conservative, as the nurnber of workers of PEC/GP are likely to decline after project
implementation, but no decrease has been accounted for.
General and administrative costs amount currently to about one-third of the total operating costs. They will
decrease to about 13% of total operating costs by 2005 and will stabilize from year 2002 in line with
inflation.
4.    Capital Costs and Total Financing Required
Total Project Costs and Financing Required for the overall Project (1995 to 2004) are shown in Annex 3.
The total investment cost for the overall Project (1995 to 2005) is estimated at about PLN 327.5 million
(US$ 80.7 million). The base cost estimnate (PLN 271.6 million or US$72.1 million) includes the historic
costs (pre-1999) as well as projections in 1999 terms. Estimates were based on actual experience to date,
taking account of country of origin and prevailing exchange rates. The base cost estimates in 1999 terms
are based on an exchange rate of PLN 4.0 to the US dollar. The base cost estimates distinguish three items:
a)    The production units (PLN 159.5 million), including geothermnal doublets (PLN 40.6 million),
geothenral base load plant and absorption heat pumps (PLN 29.6 million), a gas line (PLN 2.3 million);
two natural gas-fired peak-load plants (Zakopane, PLN 14.4 million and Nowy Targ, PLN 2.0 million), a
medium-pressure heat transmission pipeline (PLN 56.6 million), related pumnping stations and pressure
reducing equipment (PLN 2.9 million), as well as needed land, buildings, and miscellaneous items (PLN
11.1 million)
b)    The distribution networks (PLN 94.5 million) in Zakopane, Nowy Targ and a number of villages in
the main valley between these two cities, as well as
c)    The costs of connection of customers (enterprises and households), including boiler conversion,
heat exchangers and heat counters (PLN 17.7 million, not including all customer costs).
The total Project cost estimates include:
a)    Physical contingencies (PLN 24.6 million), averaging about 8.3% of total base costs, and
b)    Price contingencies (PLN 31.3 million), averaging 11.5% of total base costs or about 13% of
remaining expenditures in zloty terms.
No contingencies are included in the historic costs pre-2000. Physical contingencies on drilling of wells and
on geological works have been conservatively estimated at 30%, whereas a 10% contingency has been
allowed for all remaining items from 2000 onwards. Price contingencies are based on estimated
expenditures (PLN base costs in 1999-termns plus physical contingency) between 2000 and 2004 and take
account of projected inflation in Poland, Germany and the USA, as highlighted in the macro section above.
Total financing required for the overall Project from 1995 to 2004 will amount to PLN 394.0 million or
US$96.7 million.
Since 1995 until end 1999 a total of 79.7 PLN mnillion (US$ 24.1 million) have been spent, funded by
equity, and grant contributions from local institutions (National Fund, EcoFund), the EU, the US, and
Denmark. Increases in Working Capital have brought total fmnancing required until end 1999 to PLN 87.8
million or US$ 27.1 million.

The Bank is considering the partial Project between 2000 and 2004. For this slice of the investment, capital
costs including physical and price contingencies are estimated to amount to PLN247.9 million (US$56.7
million). Total financing required also calls for funding of capitalized interest during construction and
financial fees, as well as fuirther build-up of incremental working capital. The Bank will further require
financial management system improvements to allow for the new format of Project mnanagement Reports.
GEF requires monitoring of C02 emissions. Allowing for these items, total financing required will amount
to PLN 306.2 million, or US$ 69.6 million for the partial Project of 2000 to 2004.
5.    Financing Sources and Plan
Financing sources to date (US$ 27.1 million equivalent) have consisted of equity, grant contributions from
the National Fund, the EcoFund, EU Phare, USA and Denmark, as well as local loans (see Annex 3).
For the partial Project (2000 to 2004) (see table below), funding is envisaged to come from additional
equity (PLN 2.7 million in 2000 and PLN 4.6 mnillion in 2001), from grants from EU Phare (Euro 10.5
million equivalent), USAID (US$2.5 million), as well as from Denmark (US$0.6 million equivalent). A
GEF grant of US$5.4 million equivalent is provided to recognize the substantial contribution in C02
reduction of the Project. The World Bank is considering to provide a loan of US$38.2 million equivalent.

6.    The World Bank Loan
The financial model has projected the loan alternatively on the basis of an annuity type repayment or a level
principal repayment. The client has decided to favor the annuity type loan, which provides him with a
- 70 -



stable repayment pattern.
After thorough and detailed discussion with the appraisal mission the client has chosen a new Fixed Spread
Loan (FSL) with the following characteristics:
*   Repayment schedule fixed at commitment
*   Grace period 4.5 Years
*  9 years of annuity type of repayment (4.5% annual escalation rate for principal)
*   Final maturity 13.5 Years
*   Average maturity: 9.5 Years
*   EURO currency based
*  Lending Rate (LIBOR 3.47%@6 months + Fixed Spread @55 basis points, resulting in a rate of about
4.02% at present)). The model has used an interest rate of 4.5%.
*   Interest and loan charges (front-end fee, commitment fee of 0.35%) to be capitalized from loan
effectiveness until July 2004.
*   Possibility to convert to Fixed Interest Rate or to buy a cap or collar on the interest rate.
*   Loan closing date on December 31, 2004, six months after the Project Completion Date.
The model projects the required loan amount to be at US$ 38.2 million equivalent.
7.    Projected Income Statement
The projected income statements for the period 1998 to 2006 are attached in section (B) below. They
contain revenues and operating costs as projected under items (A) (2) and (3) above. In addition they
contain interest earnings on cash balances as calculated at the interest rate on deposits projected to prevail
in Polish commercial Banks, as well as projected interest charges on local loans and on the World Bank
loan (except for the capitalized period). They further contain projected foreign exchange losses estimated
on the basis of projected exchange rate changes between the Euro and the Polish Zloty. The foreign
exchange loss, expressed in Zlotys, is linked to the EURO Loan of the World Bank, and results from the
assumed gradual devaluation of the Zloty vis-a-vis the EURO.
The income statement also shows taxes calculated at prevailing rates of taxation and taking account of the
latest taxation law.
Finally, the income statement shows dividend payments at the rate of 25% of operating income after
deduction of depreciation, starting in year 2005, i.e. after completion of the Project in 2004. Shareholders
of PEC/GP are, of course, free, within the constraints of the energy law and the decree on heat, to weigh
payments of dividends against potential real term reductions of tariffs.
8.    Projected Funds Flow Statement
The sources of funds comprise the projected capital increase in 2000 and 2001, as well as the different
local and foreign loans and grants as spelled out above. In 1999 PEC/GP has taken on a bridge loan
amounting to a total of almost PLN 10 million to cover its investment requirements during the time until the
new financing will become available in year 2000. Through World Bank loan's and GEF grant's retroactive
financing of contracts procured under World Bank guidelines until mid-2000, the company will be able to
repay the local loan. Interest, commitment fees, and the front-end fee of 1% on the World Bank loan will be
- 71 -



capitalized during the construction period (4.5 years), so that PEC/GP's operations will only be burdened
with interest payments on the Bank loan, once steady-state operations have been reached in 2005.
Therefore, the sources side includes not only the World Bank loan's disbursements against the investment
expenditures but also funding of the financial charges until mid-2004. As a result of increasing operations,
the sources of funds resulting from internal cash-generation (operating profit plus depreciation) are
projected to rise rapidly already from 2001.
On the applications side, the most important impact during project implementation comes from the ongoing
investments under the Project and the repayment of the bridge loan. From 2005 the full impact of the
annuity payments (almost PLN 25 million per year until final maturity in 2013) will have to be faced by the
Comnpany. The shielding of the company from World Bank loan debt-service during the construction period
(through the grace on loan repayments, and through financing of capitalized financial charges until mid
2004), will allow the company to build up a cash-cushion (accumulated to PLN 24 million by end 2004), to
safeguard it when debt service starts its full irnpact in 2005. Based on the projections, the cash cushion
would remain well above PLN 22 rnillion troughout the life of the World Bank loan. The cushion would
reach PLN 50 million by 2014, after the World Bank loan has been fully repaid, despite annual dividend
payments growing from PLN 5 million in 2005 to almost PLN 8 million in 2013.
9.    Projected Balance Sheet
The balance sheets of PEC/GP are built on the results of the newly merged company in 1998 and planned
build-up of assets and liabilities in 1999 (preliminary data of mid-February 2000). From there, they have
been projected to show the effects for two years after completion of loan repayments. On the asset side, the
build-up of fixed assets assumes an average two year construction period ("started investments" or "work
in progress") for project components before they are transferred into the operational fixed assets. This is
considered realistic as the climatic conditions in the Podhale Valley only allow construction activities
between March and November. Under the heading of current assets there is a gradual reduction of
inventories to operational levels (1% of total fixed assets). At the same time current assets reflect the
growing cash cushion which remains at about PLN 22 million, until the World Bank loan has been repaid.
PEC/GP can influence its amount of retained cash by adjusting the rate of dividend pay-out, if need be
down to zero levels. Assuming the projected net profits and a 50% pay-out ratio, dividends would rise from
PLN 5 million in 2005 to almost PLN 8 million in 2013.
On the liability side, the projections take account of the growing contributions in the form of equity, local
and foreign grants, and local and foreign loans. Total equity consists of owners paid-up capital and retained
earnings. For the calculation of the debt-equity ratio, grants have been considered quasi-equity. The
substantial operational losses in the early years of project implementation are a result of the relatively small
number of customers initially connected. This will change as the first distribution networks are completed
and more customers start benefiting from the system. The high loss in 2000 (PLN 5 million) results from
the guarantee fee to the Polish Government on the World Bank loan which cannot be financed out of the
loan and is therefore expensed.
10.   Financial Ratios, Sensitivity Analysis and Conclusions
The financial projections demonstrate that PEC/GP has a sound and healthy future ahead of itself, provided
it can manage to implement the Project in the conservatively estimated time frame, can keep costs under
control, and obtains tariff levels which would safeguard an adequate revenue stream.

Financial ratios for the Project have been shown in the attachment. Most importantly, operating income
over total revenue is never expected to drop below 60% after project completion, debt builds up to a
maximum debt equity ratio of 50/50, and the debt service coverage ratio rises from an acceptable 1.0 in
2005 to above 1.2 from 2008 onwards. A cash generation ratio is not meaningful within the model after
Project completion, as the company is not forecast to undertake major investments beyond the Project.
Nevertheless, a cash generation ratio has been set conservatively at 35% of total investments considered.
Based on the models assumptions and a project life of 25 years, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR)
for the overall project from 1995 to 2025 is about 10% before consideration of financing arrangements.
The marginal rate of return after tax ( 8%) further illustrates the capital intensive nature of the project and
the slippage in execution over a number of years due to lack of financing.
The FIRR on the Project under consideration (2000 to 2004) is more attractive, if only because some of the
risky aspects of the overall Project have already been dealt with, and the investment until 1999 is not taken
into account. The resulting return on the reraining investment is 14% before tax and 12% after tax.
However, unlike the economic analysis, the financial analysis cannot rely on environmental benefits.
Instead, these substantial benefits have been monetized in the form of grants which make the project
attractive in financial terms also for private investors. Thus the FIRR on total equity is estimated to be
about 14%, and the FIRR on paid-in capital is even 28% as the capital base as such is relatively small
(high leverage).
Sensitivity analyses have been carried out with regard to changes in capital costs, -operating costs,
revenues, and implementation time (slippage of execution by a year). Individually the impact of increases of
10% of capital or operating costs, of increase in gas or electricity costs, or a reduction by 10% of revenues
would be tolerable ranging between one and three percentage point reductions. A comnbination of all of
these effects would be intolerable, leading to a return below 8%.
However, the full combination of all negative effects would be an unlikely event: operating costs would
typically increase when energy cost (gas and electricity) increase. In such a case a commensurate increase
of heat prices would be justified, and this is to some extent manageable by PEC/GP and its key
shareholders, and is allowed under the heat energy legislation. The project cost estimates have safe-guarded
against too steep project cost rises by allowing for substantial physical and price contingencies. Big capital
costs are embedded in the distribution network. If PEC/GP finds that it has difficulties to connect a
sufficiently large number of heat loads in a given area, it will only proceed with network construction if it
can improve the heat load curve in that area through promotion of the system. A delay of project execution
is possible, but in that case also the expenditures would be delayed. In any case the recently re-designed
time table of the Project (which took account of the concerns of the World Bank appraisal team and
prudent company management decisions) is conservative and has been incorporated into the financial
model. Nevertheless, PEC/GP should watch for a steady build-up of its heat load by getting a sufficient
number of customers conmected as soon as possible.
The sensitivity analysis also investigates the effect of setting the extraction fee (which the model assumes at
10%, the maximum possible amount) at zero. In that case the results improve on average by 30 to 40 basis
points on all FIRR's, and of course, the financial situation of the company would improve. Since it is
considered that the geothermal energy is renewable, there really is no justification for charging an
extraction fee which would further jeopardize the competitiveness of geothermal energy vis-a-vis alternative
fossil-fuel-based energies whose extraction is indeed depleting those resource over time.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
POLAND: PODHALE GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
Procurement
Goods and works will be procured in accordance with World Bank Guidelines: Procurement under the
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (as issued in January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September
1997, and January 1999). Consulting Services, technical assistance and training will be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers, January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999. The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents, Request for Proposals and Forms of Consultants' Contract will be used. Goods and technical
assistance to be financed by the co-financiers will be procured in accordance with the public procurement
regulations or the regulations and practices of each co-financier. A general procurement notice has been
submitted to be published in Development Business of the UN (No. 530 of 16 March 2000).
Retroactive financing. The project includes retroactive fimancing of up to 10% of the Loan amount and
20% of the Grant funds for the contracts for civil works, goods and consultant services procured in
accordance with the Bank procurement guidelines and for which payments were mnade no earlier than one
year before the date of the appraisal mission. This extends the retroactive horizon back to October 1998.
Such an extension is justified based on the peculiar history of the Project, which has proceeded rather far
along prior to the Bank's decision to support it fnancially (see section C-I and Annex 2 for an overview of
the completed phases of the Project). Indeed, the company has taken a bridge loan from a local commercial
bank to cover financing needs prior to availability of the Bank Loan and GEF Grant.

Procurement methods (Table A)
PEC/GP has invested considerable resources into the Project at the initial stages of its development.
According to the procurernent plan updated by PEC/GP during negotiations, the total financing requirement
for the remaining project components stands at about $US 68.2 million. Of the total amount of US$ 68.2
million, the Bank is proposed to finance $US 38.2 mnillion, and the GEF will provide an additional US$ 5.4
million. Table A-1 illustrates the procurement arrangements.

Procurement capacity assessment of the project entity was carried out in July 1999. The scope of the
assessment covered legal aspects, the procurement cycle ranagement, organization and functions related to
procurement, support and control aspect, and record keeping. From the procurernent point of view, the
project has been placed in the average risk category. The assessment includes, an Action Plan for
strengthening PEC/GP's capacity to conduct procurement. The main elements of the Action Plan are as
follows: (i) PEC/GP should nominate before loan signature, and arrange training for, one of its existing staff
as a procurement officer responsible for Bank-financed procurement; (ii) a project procurement launch
workshop will be held just after negotiations but in any case no later than effectiveness; (iii) PEC/GP should
put in place a computerized procurement monitoring system within three months of loan effectiveness; (iv)
during the first year of project implementation, two procurement supervision missions should be conducted;
thereafter, annual procurement supervision missions (v) a minimum of ten contracts representing different
procuremnent methods (not subject to prior review) should be reviewed on an ex-post basis.

anticipated completion date is June 30, 2004 and the closing date is December 31, 2004. Disbursements
will initially follow traditional Bank disbursement procedures and will be made against eligible
expenditures. PMR-based disbursements are planned to be introduced subsequently (see the Financial
Management section below). Table C- I below shows estimated disbursements during the life of the Project,
and Tables C-2a and C-2b show allocation of Loan and Grant proceeds. The Project includes retroactive
financing of US$ 4.74 million (within the limits of 10% of the IBRD Loan amount and 20% of the GEF
Grant) to finance the activities under the Project already completed by the Borrower, subject to acceptable
procurement procedures.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Statements of Expenditures (SOE) will be used for: (a) works contracts estimated to cost less than
US$3,000,000 each; (b) goods contracts and S&I contracts less than US$200,000; (c) consultant contracts
with firms leRs than US$100,000, (d) consultant contracts with individuals costing US$25,000 equivalent
or less eacl . The minimum application size for payments directly from the Grant account or for issuance of
Special Conmnitments is 20 percent of the special account authorization. Full documentation in support of
SOE will be retained by PEC/GP for at least two years after the closing date of the Loan1/GEF Grant. This
information will be made available for review by Bank missions during project supervision and by auditors.
Annual audits will be required to specifically comment on the propriety of SOE disbursements and the
quality of the associated record-keeping.
Special account:
To facilitate disbursements, the Borrower will open two Special Accounts, one for the Loan and another for
the Grant funds, before Loan/Grant effectiveness and maintain them until Project completion. The Special
Accounts will be drawn upon to meet payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants under the project.
The Special Accounts will be established in a comnrnercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank.
The initial allocations to the Special Accounts will be limited to US$1 million from the Loan and US$
100,000 from the GEF Grant. The initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$
2d million and US$400,000 from the Loan and the Grant, respectively, once the aggregate disbursements of
US$5 million and US$500,000 from the Loan and the Grant, respectively, are reached, by submitting the
relevant withdrawal applications. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three
months and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.
Project accounts will be operated for discrete activities and funded from the Special Accounts set up to
administer transactions in Euro, based on disbursement applications signed by the authorized officials.
Once the Bank and the Borrower have established that a PMR-based reporting system is fully operational
(expected not later than December 31, 2000), the replenishment of the Special Accounts would be based on
the quarterly forecasts of disbursements as projected in the PMRs. The authorized allocation for the
Special Accounts under PMR-based disbursement will have a limit of US$7 million from the Loan and
US$1 million from the GEF Grant.
Financial Management
Corporate Governance: PEC/GP's corporate governance has three tiers: (i) the Shareholders' Meeting, (ii)
the Supervisory Board, and (iii) the Management Board (the Board of Company Directors).
The Shareholders' Meeting is PEC/GP's highest decision-making body. The two main shareholders are the
National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (77.81% ) and the municipality of
Zakopane (13.09% ). The remaining shareholders include other participating municipalities and a number
of small investors.
The Supervisory Board has six members (3 from the National Fund, 2 from the municipality of Zakopane,
and 1 representing the other investors) who meet once a month. The representatives of the majority
shareholder, the National Fund, are the most active and place great emphasis on the financial control of the
- 88 -



company. The company's financial performance is a standing item on the agenda.
The Management Board consists of the comnpany's president and two vice-presidents, of which one is the
financial director. PEC/GP was created from a merger of two small companies in June, 1998 and the
corporate culture and procedures are still those of a small comipany. As a result, most of the power in the
company is concentrated to the Management Board and all important decisions are made by this group.
Thus all payments must be authorized by two board members, which is advantageous from a purely
internal control point of view.
Disbursement and Funds Flow: PEC/GP has requested the World Bank and the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) to support the project with a loan and grant respectively. PEC/GP has expressed a
preference for PMR-based disbursement. However, the financial management review shows that PEC/GP's
financial management systern would need to be enhanced in order to fulfill the Bank's requirements for
this type of disbursement. Thus the Loan Agreement allows for initial disbursement based on traditional
disbursement methods with the possibility of moving to PMR-based disbursement at the mutual agreement
of the Borrower and the Bank. It was agreed that the internal control procedures will be designed to cover
both of these disbursement methods.
Accounting Procedures and Internal Control: For the most part, PEC/GP has sound accounting practices.
These include limited access to computers, authorization rules, document flow, etc., but these routines are
usually not documented, and it is therefore difficult to obtain a full understanding of the nature and design
of the procedures and methods that together constitute the company's internal control structure. This
makes it more difficult for new staff, new auditors, as well as other interested parties, to quickly acquire a
clear picture of the accounting system, control procedures and other elements of the overall control
structure. A prerequisite for an adequate financial management system is documentation of current
routines and procedures. It was agreed that an Operating Manual covering financial management,
procurement and disbursement would be prepared. The financial management and disbursement sections of
the manual must cover all procedures for accounting (including docunent flow), budgeting, job
descriptions for financial and project staff, fund flow diagrams with details, and organization structure
showing areas of responsibility for  project implementation.  As they are a condition for Board
presentation, these sections of the manual must be given highest priority and be submitted for Bank's review
by early May 2000 and in any case prior to the presentation of the Project to the Board (see Action Plan
below).
Accounting Systems: PEC/GP is currently using the domestic accounting software Unisoft. This software
will be able to produce project financial statements in PLN, but it does not have multi-currency capability
and cannot therefore be used for statements in foreign currencies. Further, the accounting software has to
be strengthened to make direct automatic reporting possible, and the number of digits in the Chart of
Accounts must be extended to make it possible to include the new categories needed for project accounting.
It was agreed that the LAN version of Fox Pro would be used for reporting from the accounting system.
The advantage that this software has over Unisoft's reporting module is that it can produce all PMR-based
reports in accordance with the Bank's formnat. However, to make the PMR-reporting automatic, Fox Pro's
interface must be adapted to existing financial, planning, and technical software. PEC/GP will use
consultants for this work.
Unisoft will launch a completely new version of its accounting software in September 2000. This version
will have multi-currency capability, be multi-lingual, and have enhanced security. It was agreed that
PEC/GP shall upgrade with this new version as soon as it ready for commercial use. It is anticipated that
the company will be ready for PMR-based disbursemnent at the beginning of 2001. Proceeds from the loan
- 89 -



have been allocated for financing this upgrade.
Staffing: PEC/GP's financial management organization system and procedures are simple. There is only
one accounting unit and most transactions are standardized and fairly straightforward. The most common
categories are geothermal heat, coal for the Tatry plant, and gas and power delivery. The financial director
heads the financial and economic division, which has four accountants, including the chief accountant, and
two part-timers (50% each) for billing and economic issues. The staffing level is on the low side, and
vacations and other absences place a heavy burden on the remaining staff. Further, there is little capacity
to free staff for training. The project will further increase the workload, and it will be necessary to employ
at least one project accountant. It was agreed that this person would be in place in time to assist the
financial management consultant.
Evaluation of Current and Past Audit Reports: PEC/GP was established on June 30,1998 through a
merger between Tatry SA and Geothermia, Podhale. The only financial statements available for PEC/GP
are for the second semester of 1998, and were audited by the Polish audit company REW-BI. The opinion
was unqualified and there was no management letter. The same auditor audited the first semester for both
of the merging comnpanies prior to their fusion. Even in these instances the opinions were unqualified and
there were no management letters. Prior to 1998, Tatry SA had a series of self-employed sole auditors,
while Geothermia has used REW-BI since 1995. Audit reports for these earlier years are only available in
Polish and the opinions are unqualified. All financial statements up to the end of 1999 are in accordance
with Polish Accounting Law only. The short list for the selection of auditor for 1999 had been prepared
and the selection was to be made before the end of the year.
Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements: PEC/GP's financial statements (income statement,
balance sheet and cash flow statement) are to be prepared both in accordance with International Accounting
Standards and Polish Accounting Law. The Project Financial Statements are to be prepared in accordance
with the formnat provided by the Bank. Both the comnpany and project statements will be audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit report will be subrmitted to the Bank within four
months after the end of the fiscal year. The audit reports will contain the auditors' opinion on compliance
with financial and other covenants under the Loan. The audit report on the Project Financial Statements
shall also contain a separate opinion on the operation of the Special Account. The auditor for the period
2000 - 2004 will be financed from the Loan. The selection of this auditor shall be in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidelines, and to ensure continuity the appointment shall preferably be for the whole
project period. The auditor shall be appointed before October 1, 2000.
Project Reporting Arrangements: The quarterly Project Management Reports (PMRs), which should be
seen as a part of the Progress Reports, are to be submitted to the Bank within 45 days of the end of each
quarter. When PMR-based disbursement is used, the PMR forms the basis for the advancement of funds to
the Special Account. It is also used for project managernent purposes to track project progress,
procurement and disbursement. The PMR includes the following: (a) Financial Report (project sources and
uses of funds, uses of funds by special activity, project balance sheet, project cash withdrawals, Special
Account statement, project cash forecast); (b) Project Progress Report (output monitoring reports for
contract management and unit of output by project activity); and (c) Procurement Managernent Report
(procurement process monitoring for goods and works and consultants' services, contract expenditure
reports for goods and works and consultants' services).
The operating and capital expenditure budgets for PEC/GP are to be included in the Progress Report for
the third quarter together with the Project Annual Budget submnitted for Bank approval. Financial progress
reports on company performance are to be submitted on a semi-annual basis as part of the Progress
- 90 -



Reports for the second and fourth quarters, and actual results will be compared with Plans and Budgets.
PEC/GP has been given a presentation and documentation covering PMR requirements. The Bank will
create a set of PMR forms specifically tailored to the proposed Project.

Annex No.: 11
POLAND: PODHALE GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
Summary Analysis of Local Environmental Benefits
The analysis of local environmental benefits was carried out by Bank (ECSSD) staff during two
missions to Zakopane in August though October, 1998. The main purpose of the analysis done during these
visits was to estimate the magnitude of the local environmental benefits from the Project in order to
establish the additionally of the resources sought from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The funding
provided for climate change mitigation projects is not intended to cover local benefits. Only once the costs
to achieve these benefits are covered by the Borrower or by another donor agency (e.g., EU PHARE) can
supplemental funding be sought from GEF.

2.     According to the local environmental benefits model developed by ENV /I/ and applied by ECSSD
staff for this analysis, the Podhale Geothermal Project can generate local environmental benefits of about
US$ 11.0 - 14.5 million, depending on the assumptions made for the baseline fuel in Nowy Targ, where
two distinct options (switching- to gas and staying on coal) are available in addition to the geothernml
conversion of the three district heating boilers in the project area. Staying on coal is regarded as more
likely, and thus Case 2 should be the rnain case to consider.
3.     The project can reduce annual average concentrations of particulate rnatter in Zakopane by 7.8 -
14.3 ug/rn3, which would result in local environmental benefits of about US$ 8.5 miillion (the net present
-98 -



value of the local environmental benefits achieved over the period from 1995 to 2024 discounted at 12%
per year). Note: ug/m3 = microgram per cubic meter of ambient air.
4.     Most of the local environmental benefits from the project result from the reduction in particulate
emnissions, which will improve the health of the local population.
5.     Due to the absence of any significant industrial activity in the area, air quality in Zakopane is not
bad overall. Indeed it is quite good in the summer time. In 1997, the annual mean concentration of TSP and
S02 were 68 and 35 um/m3, respectively. This is within the national ambient standards for annual mean
concentrations, which are 75 ug/m3 for TSP and 40 ug/m3 for S02. However, air pollution by particulates
arising from burning fuel during the winter months is a legitimate concern for both Zakopane and Nowy
Targ (see Technical Addendum  I to this Annex). The seasonal differences in average ambient
concentrations in Zakopane reflect the contribution of heating sources. In 1997, the heating season average
concentrations of TSP (calculated as the average of the 24-hour concentrations for the season) was close to
100 ug/m3. During the non-heating season, the concentration of TSP was much lower, with the seasonal
average at about 30 ug/m3. The same pattern has been observed in earlier years, although comparisons are
complicated by the varying location of the measurements. The national standard in Poland for 24-hour
mean concentration of TSP is 150 ug/m3. This standard was exceeded for about 7.5% of monitored days
during 1997 12/. Fig. 1 in Technical Addendum 1 to this Annex shows the degree of exceedance. The
maximum daily average concentration observed was about 2.5 times the national standard.

Note: The graph shows concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) -- the only kind of particulate matter
for which direct measurements are available in Zakopane. However, the entire difference between the
concentrations of TSP for the base and project cases is assumed to be due to the reduction in particulate matter
originating from combustion of fuels, which consists predominantly of particles less than 10 microns in size (i.e.,
PM10). Therefore, for the reduction in ambient concentrations of particulate matter attributable to the project, no
difference is assumed between TSP and PM10 (i.e. the entire amount of particulates is assumed to be in the
category of PM 10).

The environmental health benefits model used for this analysis employs the dose-response functions
applied in a number of World Bank projects. Epidemiological evidence increasingly suggests that health
impacts due to exposure to PM1o occur at ambient levels well below current international standards and are
approximately linear with exposure levels. The evidence is less clear for sulfur dioxide. In the analysis, we
have assumed that no threshold levels exist for PMio, but there is a threshold for sulfur dioxide. For
simplicity, it was assumed that the threshold corresponds to the national standard in Poland for annual
average concentration of S02, which is 40 uglm3.
To value the expected reductions in mortality and morbidity, the analysis uses estimates developed in the
United States based on the costs of health care, wage rates, and the willingness to pay to reduce the risk of
death. These values are selected from the lower end of the U. S. range and adjusted to reflect differing
income levels between Poland and the United States. To reflect the growth of the willingness to pay for a
cleaner environment as income grows, a growth factor of 2.5% (in real terms) was included in the
calculation of health benefits. As the point of reference, the 1997 GDP per capita for in Poland was used
(US$ 3,51 0 per year - calculated on the basis of the exchange rate for the year).
In addition to the impact of the project on health, the reduction in air pollution will bring other benefits
such as lower costs of maintenance for buildings and equipment, improvements in the attractiveness of the
area for both visitors and local residents, and less damage to vulnerable ecosystems (amenity benefits).
While the calculation of the full range of these types of benefits was clearly beyond the scope of this
analysis, the calculation of visibility benefits was undertaken in an attempt to gauge some of these difficult-
to-quantify benefits based on conservative willingness to pay estimates,
6.     As illustrated by the above graph for Zakopane, the project will allow reduction of the annual mean
concentrations of particulates from the present level of about 65 ug/m3 to as little as about 35 ug/m3. The
impact will be especially dramatic during the heating season, when the concentration of TSP will be
reduced from the present level of almost 100 ug/m3 to about 40 ug/m3. The environmental benefits will be
significant - even by comparison with the rather optimistic baseline, which also assumes substantial
reduction in particulate emissions resulting from fuel switching (mainly, to gas and light fuel oil).
7.     The benefits from reducing the S02 ernissions are of less significance due to much lower damage
per ton emnitted and based on the understanding that the ambient concentrations of S02 in the project area
do not exceed the critical ("threshold") level. However, the role of S02 emissions as a contributor to the
fornation of particulate matter is substantial.

According to the information provided by the local district heating company, the heating season in
Zakopane starts between September I and October 1, and ends in late April - early May. The patterns of
monthly concentrations of particulate matter and S02 suggest that the self-heating households sharply
reduce burning fuel in April and do not tend to start heating their homes until late September. The heating
season can thus be defined as end-September through mid-April.
The agency responsible for monitoring the local air quality (Wojesodzka Stacja Sanitarno-
Epidemiologiczna, Nowy Sacz, ul. Pzemiesinicza 5) has provided 1997 data for Zakopane and Nowy Targ
for total suspended particulates (TSP - Pyl Zawieszony, Ogolem) and S02 concentrations. While an
ambient standard for fine particulates (Pyl Zawieszony, PMIO) also exists in Poland, PM1o is not monitored
in the project area. An earlier analysis for the Podhale area conducted by the Bank (ENVPE) staff was
based on 1994 data obtained from the same source. The comparison of 1997 and 1994 data gives the
impression of a substantial increase in the observed concentrations of particulate matter - especially, in the
case of Nowy Targ. However, the value of this comparison is diminished by the fact that the measurements
were taken at different locations both in Zakopane and Nowy Targ. In the case of Zakopane, the new
measurements were about 800-900 meters away from the old location in the residential area and closer to
the industrial zone (at ul. Chramcowki 19 as opposed to uL. Kosciuszki 9, which was the case in 1994).

8.     While the air quality in Zakopane is within the national standard for the mean annual concentration
of TSP and seldom exceeds the standards for the daily average concentrations, the air pollution problem is
more serious in Nowy Targ. There, the annual average ambient standard for particulates is substantially
exceeded, and the daily average concentrations of TSP exceeded the standard for 15% of days in 1997. Fig.
2 in Technical Addendum I to this Anmex shows the degree of exceedance. The maximnum daily average
concentration observed was about 2.5 times the national standard.
9.     If, in the baseline scenario, the Nowy Targ district heating boilers are expected to switch to gas by
the year 2001, then the high emissions of particulates from the boiler plants in the project area will not be
expected to persist in either baseline or the proposed project case. In that case, the expected environmental
benefits accruing to Nowy Targ due to the project will be negligible compared with those in Zakopane,
even though the current environmental situation in Nowy Targ is considerably worse. With Nowy Targ
staying on coal in the base case, the environmental benefits accruing to it will amount to approximately
US$ 3.5 million (the net present value of the local environmental benefits achieved over the period from
1995 to 2024 discounted at 12% per year) due to a reduction of annual average concentration of
- 101 -



particulates by about 4.7 ug/m3 as illustrated by the graph below. It is assumed that, even with the
coal-based district heating, Nowy Targ would find ways to comply with the Polish national standards for
particulates over the next few years.

10.   The district heating boilers in Nowy Targ and some of the larger ones in Zakopane are outfitted
with mechanical cyclone filters for particulate ermission control. In the baseline for Zakopane, it was
assumed that no new cyclones would be installed because the plants would be switching to gas relatively
soon. The efficiency of the existing cyclones is about 75%. The boiler plants outfitted with cyclones
currently generate about 40% of heat supplied by the heat boilers of the former Tatry district heating
company of Zakopane (now merged with Geoterrnia Podhalanska).
11.   The envirornental benefits from the project are augrnented by the prevalence of low-stack sources
which will be displaced once the project plants come on line. In Zakopane, small boilers used by the
households and small conmmercial entities constitute the bulk of the ernissions. The height of the
smoke-stacks rarely exceeds 15 meters and, as a rule, the boilers are not outfitted with any emission control
equipment. The number of emission sources can be estimated based on the number of loads targeted by
Geotermia Podhalanska for connection to geothermal energy and natural gas. In Zakopane and neighboring
villages, more than 4,200 households and over 172 conmmercial loads ("large loads") can be potentially
connected. In addition, there are 32 district heating boiler plants in Zakopane, 29 of which are proposed to
be replaced by heat exchangers cormected to the project geothermal and gas-fired plants.
12.   The bulk of the ernissions and associated health impacts is related to the buming of coal and coke.
Coke, with a heating value of 27.6 GJ/ton and ash content of 9 -10%, has a sulfur content of 0.6% and is
used mostly by households and commercial entities such as mini-hotels. Coal used by households has a
heating value of about 28 GJ/ton and an ash content sinmilar to that of coke. However, the district heating
plants in Nowy Targ and Zakopane also use low-quality coal dust (culm), which has a heating value of
about 20 GJ/ton, ash content of at least 21%, and a sulfur content of about 1%.

Note: the TSP emission factors are before/without particulate control; when particulate control is available, the
emission factor is multiplied by (I -e) where e is the efficiency of particulate control equipment; in the calculations
for this annex, the PM control equipment of district heating boilers was assumed to be 75%; for power plants, e =
95%.
13.    By comparison with the baseline scenario and the status quo, the only negative impact of the
proposed project on air quality is due to the emissions from the two gas-fired peaking plants in Zakopane
and Nowy Targ. In addition, both the geothennal and gas-fired plants would use electricity generated
elsewhere in Poland. However, when all the sources using electricity in the baseline are considered, the
project saves more electricity than it uses. The net effect of this saving generates domestic environmental
benefits of about US$ 0.6 million over the period through the year 2024. The impact of electricity
generation on the balance of environmental costs and benefits is greatly mitigated by the availability of
highly efficient particulate control equipment and high smoke stacks of the power plants. In this
calculation, the dispersion coefficient used for high-stack sources (power plants) was about 1/17 that of a
low-stack source. Thus this impact is much smaller than the environmental benefits achieved in Zakopane
and the neighboring villages by reduced emission from low and mostly uncontrolled sources.
14.    The physical amounts of emission reduction relative to the baseline scenario are summarized in the
table below. The reductions for Nowy Targ correspond to the case of continued use of coal in the baseline.

15.    With the Nowy Targ boilers switching to gas in the baseline scenario, the bottom-line emission
reductions are as follows:
16.    As shown in the Tables above, the reduction in the emissions of particulate matter are expected to
be about 701-702 tons/year throughout the life of the project (1999-2024). The total reduction in
particulate emissions relative to the baseline will be between 14.9 and 18.3 thousand tons over the project
life. The avoided emissions of S02 are expected to be about 1,434 tons/year in 1999-2004, 1,291 tons/year
in 2005-2024, and 29.9 - 34.5 thousand tons over the life of the project.
17.    The integration of the local environmental benefits analysis with the incremental cost analysis of
C02 emission reduction and with the overall economic analysis of the project has been discussed earlier.
Before accounting for the global benefit of C02, the inclusion of local environmental benefits into the
EIRR allows to bring the economic rate of return to 11.9%  percent. While this renders the project
marginally feasible on these grounds alone, the recognition of the willingness to pay for global
environmental benefits (carbon reductions) substantially strengthens project economics and allows the
project to achieve an EIRR of 12.6%. It is only with carbon benefits that the EIRR significantly exceeds
12.0% assumed to be the common hurdle rate of return for Bank-financed projects. Thus, the rationale for
GEF grants for C02 reduction rernains strong after accounting for the local environmental benefits.
