Description          The proposed Second Programmatic Development Policy Grant i s
                     the second ina programmatic sequence that support the
                     Government's reform program outlined inthe poverty reduction
                     strategy paper. The operation will support a strategc set ofpolicy
                     reforms inprivate sector development, public sector management
                     and social service delivery. Proposedpolicy actions o f this second
                     operation continue with the strong cross cutting emphasis on public
                     and private sector governance. This operation i s also very closely
                     aligned with investments and technical assistance programs o f the
                     Bank and other development partners inrelated areas.
                     The proposedprogram i s divided into two pillars with the following
                     components:
                     Pillar 1. PromotingPrivate Sector Development
                     0    Component 1:Maintain macroeconomic stability.
                     0    Component 2: Improve investment climate through reform o f
                          licensing and inspections, increasing transparency o fthe
                          privatization process and promoting market competition.
                     0    Component 3: Reformregulatory frameworks by separating
                          policy mahng from regulatory functions inkey strategic sectors
                          (aviation, cotton, and energy).
                    Pillar 2. Public Sector Reform and Improving Public Service

Benefits           The proposed operation would provide the Tajik government with
                   support to finance some o f the expenditures associated with the
                   implementation o f a medium-term reformprogram. Major benefits
                   o f the overall reform program would be:
                    0    Improved investment climate.
                    0    Improvedpublic sector performance.
                    0    Improved governance.
                    0    Improved delivery o f health and education services.
Risks              The implementationo fthe proposedreformprogram faces five
                   major risks relatedto: (a) weak government implementation
                   capacity, (b) poor governance and corruption, (c) additionalnon-
                   concessional borrowing by the government, (d) Tajilustan's complex
                   political economy, and (e) the vulnerability o f the economy to
                   external shocks. The program contains a number o f measures to
                   mitigate these risks.

                                    1.       COUNTRYCONTEXT

1.       Tajikistan is a small economy in Central Asia with 6.7 million inhn,,,ants and a per
capita income of US$360 in 2006.' The economy, which grew on average by 9 percent during
2001-06, depends heavily on exports o f cotton and hydroelectricity, and on growing remittances
o f migrants estimated at US$1010 million in 2006 (36 percent o f GDP).' Poverty although
declining steadily remains very high. In2004, 57 percent o f the population was living below the
purchasing power parity poverty line o f US$2.15 a day.3                 Social indicators (primary and
secondary school enrollment rates, infant mortality, maternal mortality ratio, incidence o f
tuberculosis, and child malnutrition) deteriorated following independence due to the civil conflict,
worsening public service delivery, and weak g~vernance.~They have only recently begun to
stabilize and reverse. Tajiktstan i s the only country in the Eastern Europe Central Asia Region
unlikely to achieve most o f its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).'

2.       While earlier efforts to accelerate structural reforms were hampered by the post-war
environment, the combination of sustained macroeconomicstability and economicgrowth and
the recent political consolidation have created the space for more fundamental reform.
Concerned about the vulnerability o f Tajikistan's economy to a change in external conditions, the
government has outlined a comprehensive program o f structural and institutional reform aimed at
sustaining growth and reducing poverty. This program, which i s being incorporated in the
upcoming second poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), centers on (a) reform o f public sector
management, (b) development o f the private sector and attracting investments, and (c)
development o f human potential.           A presidential election held in November 2006 returned
President Rakhmon, who has been in power since 1992, to office for another seven years. This
makes it likely that the policy and structural reform process that the country has embarked upon
will continue as planned.

3.       Theproposed operation is the second in a programmatic series that provides support
for reforms aimed at promoting private sector development and improving the delivery of
public services. Inthe private sector, the proposed reforms are improving the investment climate
through reforms o f the licensing, permitting, and inspections regime; strengthening the legal,
institutional and regulatory framework in key strategic sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy); and
enhancing transparency o f the privatizationprocess. Inthe public sector, the operation will focus

on improving the quality o f public administration, civil service management, public financial
management, and the efficiency and equity o f social service delivery. Policy actions in private
sector development and public administration are addressing the cross-cutting governance issues
that are critical for sustaining growth and reducing poverty in Tajikistan. Further details o f the
program are presented inchapter 3 and the policy matrix (annex 2).

Recent Macroeconomic Developments

4.       The government's pursuit of sound macroeconomic management has successfully
stabilized the economy since 2002. Through tight monetary policy and strong fiscal discipline,
Tajikistan has been able to reduce inflation from 3 0 4 0 percent during 1998-2001 to below 10
percent since 2004. However, inflation reached 12.5 percent in2006--well above the authorities'
target o f 7 percent4ue primarily to higher prices o f imported energy and a relatively passive
monetary stance. The overall fiscal balance (excluding externally-financed investment) was in
surplus 2003-06, achieved through improved revenue mobilization and a reduction in interest
payments on external public debt. Revenues including grants have increased from 14 percent o f
GDP in 2000 to 23.4 percent o f GDP in 2006, due to increased revenue from income and
consumption taxes arising from rapid economic growth, increased imports driven by remittances
and inputs required for large investment projects, as well as some improvements in tax and
customs administration.        In addition, Tajikistan benefited from several successful debt
restructuring and reduction agreements reached with key bilateral creditors, notably with the
Russian Federation, Pakistan, Iran, and the InternationalMonetary Fund through the Multilateral
Debt ReliefInitiative. In2006, increases in capital expenditures amounting to 4 percent o f GDP,
an increase in current expenditures o f 1 percent o f GDP, and lower tax revenues resulted in a
widening in 2006 o f the fiscal deficit, which was financed by substantially larger grant inflows
than originally budgeted (mainly Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative debt relief). The Government
plans to maintain an overall fiscal deficit o f 0.1 percent o f GDP during 2007-09, excluding the
externally-financed public investment program. To finance the deficit the government will need
to borrow an estimated average 0.9 percent o f GDP from the domestic market. External debt
stood at 41 percent o f GDP in2006, down from 124percent in2000.

5 .      Over the short to medium term, Tajikistan's macroeconomic prospects continue to be
positive, with growth expected to stabilize at around 8 percent. After growing at an average o f
10 percent since 2001, economic activity slowed somewhat to 6.7 percent in 2005 due to weak
export prices for cotton and aluminum and higher import prices for oil and gas.             Growth
accelerated to 7 percent in 2006, due to the start o f a large-scale Russian-financed hydroelectric
power project and o f the investments financed with Chinese funds, expansion in aluminum
processing capacity to meet continued high world demand, recovery in cotton production
following institutional reforms, and buoyant inflows o f remittances. These factors are expected
to continue to support growth o f 7-8 percent during the next few years, possibly towards the
higher end o f the range as a result o f the new investments envisaged in key infrastructure areas.
Although the somoni depreciated against the dollar by about 6 percent in 2006, the real effective
exchange rate has remained broadly stable. Inflation, although averaging an estimated 12.5
percent in 2006, i s expected to remain below 10 percent over the medium term with continued
tight monetary policy, although some pressures on consumer prices may result from planned
electricity tariff adjustments, higher world energy prices, and higher prices o f nontradable goods
and services due to remittance-related increases indemand.

6.      Expenditures are now expected to rise rapidly over the medium term as thegovernment
invests in infrastructure and social services, consistent with the PRSP.              Infrastructure
investments are now expected to be higher than those presented in the PDPG 1 program

document, as a result o f the government's recent decision to contract a US$604 million loan
(equivalent to 21 percent o f GDP) with China. The loan will finance (a) the Dushanbe-Chanak
road (US$28 1.2 million), (b) the south-north power transmission line (US$267.2 million), and (c)
the Lolazor-Khatlon power transmission line (USrS55.2 million). Disbursements started in the
second half o f 2006 and are expected to continue until 2009. In this new scenario, overall
expenditures are expected to increase from 23 percent of GDP in2005 to 32 percent in2007. The
increase i s not expected to result in inflation or an appreciation of the exchange rate, because
most of the funds will be used for imports. Inaddition to the boost to infrastructure investments,
spending on health, education, and social protection will rise from 9.0 percent in 2005 to 10.5
percent o f GDP in2007.

7.       While theprojectsfinanced with Chinesefunds appear to be economically sound, and
once completed should make a lasting contribution to growth, Tajikistan faces new
macroeconomic challenges as a result of their                                 The first i s the challenge o f
managing the macroeconomic effects o f the construction phase, which may be adding to
aggregate demand at a time when the economy i s nearing full capacity. Although most of the
funds will be used for imports, the pace o f implementation may still needto be managedto avoid
puttingunduepressure on prices o fnontradable goods and services (including labor) and to avoid
an excessive real appreciation o f the exchange rate, which could affect the competitiveness o f
exports. The second challenge i s the need to ensure that the projects have a highgrowth impact
that translates into greater tax collections required to service the additional debt in the longer
term. Charges for debt service are expected to double inten years, which could strain the public
budget unless revenuesrise accordingly.

8.       The deficit dynamics in 2006-08 will be driven in largepart by the decision to increase
public investment in projects jinanced by loans from the Chinese government. In 2006,
externally-funded disbursements for the public investment program are estimated to have reached
13.3 percent o f GDP, up from 3.1 percent in 2005. During 2007-09, such disbursements are
expected to average 11 percent o f GDP per year. Spending on the public investment program
expands the broad fiscal deficit, which i s estimated at 2.1 percent o f GDP for 2006.7 Excluding
grants, the overall budget deficit i s estimated to have reached 8 percent o f GDP in2006. In2007,
the overall fiscal deficit i s expected to average 11percent o f GDP.

9.       The external account is expected to remain stable over the medium term after the
temporary deterioration related to the new public investments. The current account deficit i s
projected to deteriorate from -2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to -11.8 percent o f GDP in 2007,
mainly as a result o f continued strong demand for imports associated with the investment projects
in infrastructure and hydroelectricity. After the implementation of the projects, the current
account deficit i s expected to stabilize at -4 percent o f GDP starting from 2010,. in line with the
situation prior to the disbursements from the Chinese loans.

10.      The risk of debt distress has increased since the Board approval of PDPG 1,but debt
remains sustainable. A March 2007 external debt sustainability analysis conducted jointly with
the IMF shows that Tajikistan's debt i s sustainable, but is at a high risk of debt distres8
Tajikistan has continued to meet its external public and publicly guaranteed debt obligations on a
timely basis and to seek relief from its creditors. Since a large share of loans has been provided
on a concessional basis, debt service obligations are currently manageable. However, in 2006
Tajilustan contracted debt from China of US$604 million to finance projects in infrastructure and
energy. While the debt was contracted on a concessional basis, with a 40 percent grant element,
its size (25 percent o f GDP) and uncertainty regarding the economic impact o f the projects
increases risks to debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, three o f Tajikistan's external
debt burden indicators (net present value o f debt-to-exports, net present value o f debt-to-GDP,

b   Note that the concessional nature o f the loan (2 percent annual interest rate, 5 years grace, and 20 years
maturity) i s within the framework allowed by the Bank's non-concessional borrowing policy laid out in a
paper to the Bank's Board in June 2006 proposing policies to discourage countries from contracting non-
concessional debt that will increase risks o f debt distress.
7    Excluding IMFMDRI (2006) o f 3.8 percent of GDP.
    This assumes average GDP growth of 8.0 percent, export growth o f 11.0 percent and an average
current account balance o f -1.5 percent o f GDP during 2007-11, and maintenance o f fiscal prudence and
tight monetary policy under a new IMFprogram.



                                                         4

and net present value o f debt-to-revenue) are projected to breach policy-dependent thresholds by
2009, following the rapid disbursement o f loans from China. By 2026, however, all ratios are
projected to be well below the thresholds. External debt service ratios, however, are expected to
stay below their thresholds over the entire period. During the projected period, debt service
payments continue to be manageable, with the assumption that all o f Tajikistan's external public
and publicly guaranteed debt has been contracted on concessional terms.

11.     Sensitivity analyses show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would have a negative
impact on Tajikistan's externalposition. Inthe event o f a combined shock (to real GDP growth,
exports growth, inflows o f foreign direct investment), all ratios would exceed the policy-
dependent thresholds by a significant margin. Additional accumulation o f new debt, a sharp
increase in the international price o f energy, and a sudden decline in remittances from Tajiks
workmg abroad would also increase the risk that Tajikistan could fall into debt distress.
Moreover, should the government under a worse case scenario assume cotton sector debt
estimated at US$300 million (estimates o f cotton sector debt range from US$90 and US$300
million) then the risks o f debt distress rise. (For details of the scenario analyses, see annex 7).
Over the medium term, Tajikistan's growth, exports, and revenue collections will need to grow
fast enough to service the growing debt.

12.      The Tajik authorities have not yet reached agreement on a program with the IMF,
although discussions on apossible Fundprogram are ongoing. After successfully completing a
Fund program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, the Tajik authorities have
requested a Fund program under its new Policy Support Instrument. A Fund program could
clearly be beneficial for a country that i s among the poorest o f the region. It would help to ensure
that the government maintains a sound macroeconomic framework and manages its external debt
prudently. However, the Fund has reservations about the appropriateness for Tajikistan at this
time o f a program under the Policy Support Instrument, which i s targeted primarily to mature
reformers.   The Fund i s therefore proposing that the authorities enter into a staff-monitored
program. Discussions are ongoing and agreement on the best approach i s expected by June 2007.
Untilagreement isreached, the Fundwill continue itsregular Article lV consultations. The Fund
has provided the Bank with its assessment o f Tajikistan's macroeconomic framework, and has no
major concerns about its adequacy. The Fundhas expressed its support for the proposed PDPG2.

13.     A structural transformation of the economy is still needed to broaden the sources of
economic growth and reduce the economy's vulnerabilities to external shocks. Despite some
recent diversification o f exports, Tajikistan's economy remains heavily dependent on a few key
commodities and trading partners. It i s therefore vulnerable to shifts in world demand for and
prices o f cotton and aluminum, or a slowdown in the economies o f Russia or other members o f
the Commonwealth o f Independent States (CIS). Any deterioration inthese could widen both the
external current account and fiscal deficits, and dampen growth. The new investments in roads
and in electricity transmission should help in diversifying the economy by providing key
infrastructural services to the private sector.    The government will also need to continue to
implement key reforms to attract significantly higher levels o f private sector investment.

14.      Thepresidential elections of November 2006 have led to a reorganization of the central
government. The incumbent president having won the election with nearly 80 percent o f the
vote, issued a decree in November 2006 reorganizing the central government. The reform i s
largely positive, as it clarifies roles and responsibilities, eliminates some duplications, and
separates agencies based on the proper hierarchy o f functions (policy development, policy
supervision and enforcement, and public service delivery).          However, abolition o f the State
Financial Control Committee, which was in charge o f external audit functions, and the



                                                  5

accountability framework of the n e w l y separate committee on taxes and customs are concerns.
T h e Bank with other development partners i s working closely with the government to ensure that
implementation of the reform i s as smooth as possible.                 They are also maintaining a close
dialogue with the government to ensure that an independent external audit function i s developed
inline withinternational goodpractice.

Box 1: GovernanceinTajikistan:Challengesand efforts to improve outcomes

Governance challenges

The legacy of the civil war in Tajikistan includes a complex political economy that has constrained public
sector performance, private sector investment, and social development. Inthe initial years, the main
priority o f the government was to consolidate peace, and to gain the support of various political groups.
Little progress was made to undertake the fundamental reforms to redefine the role o f the state from central
planner and operator o fproductive activities to that of policymaker, regulator, and facilitator o fprivate
sector investment. Moreover, few efforts were made to ensure that constitutionally independent institutions
o f accountability, such as the judiciary and the parliament, have the capacity to perform their accountability
functions. Civil society organizations, the media, and other nongovemmentalentities are also unable to
effectively act as institutions o f accountability, strengthening the checks and balances insociety and on
government performance. Governance inthe fiancial sector i s also weak and banking supervision falls
well below international standards. State involvement inproductive enterprises has resulted inwaste,
appropriation o fpublic funds for private gain, and inefficient and outmoded industries. Such involvement
also creates obstacles for private sector investment.

This has led to poor governance outcomes in Tajikistan. Tajikistan compares poorly with other countries
o f the region on accountability, control o f corruption, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality
according to the Governance Research Indicator Country Snapshot o f the World Bank Institute. Tajikistan
also scores poorly inother major surveys o f governance, including Transparency International's Corruption
Perceptions Index, the Global Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and the EBRD's
transition indicators dataset. Moreover, surveys undertaken by local firms show corruptionto be a
problem. For example, about 60 percent o fpeople surveyed inthe 2006 survey on corruption inTajikistan
undertakenby the government and UNDP, said that corruption was the main problem inTajkistan.

Government's efforts to improve governance

Thegovernment is taking action to strengthen governance both to attractprivate sector investmentfor
growth and to improve the delivery ofpublic services. Important reforms to streamline the licensing,
inspection, and permitting process are expected to improve the climate for business. Restructuring the
government administration and reforming pay and incentives is aimed at promoting a more professional
civil service. Strengthening o fpublic fiancial management-including         enactment o f a new public
procurement law, strengthening o f internal audit, reform o f the tax administration, and improvements inthe
budget process-should      increase public accountability and transparency, and, coupled with other reforms,
are expected to result inimproved service delivery. Separation o f the policymaking from regulatory
fimctions inthe aviation and energy sectors, and privatization o f state-owned enterprises are expected to
improve transparency and accountability inkey sectors o f the economy. A comprehensive assessment o f
the fiancial sector i s the first step indefining a program to address its weaknesses.

Reforms are already producing results. The Governance ResearchIndicator Country Snapshot indicators
indicate that the country made substantial progress inrule o f law, regulatory quality, control o f corruption,
and government effectiveness between 2000-05. Data from the Business Environment Enterprise
Performance Surveys (BEEPS) also shows that Tajikistanhas made significant improvements in
governance over time, and classifies Tajikistan as a "gradual improver" on governance issues. Tajikistan
has also achieved 8 o f the required 16HIPC indicators o fpublic financial management, putting Tajikistan
inthe top quintile o fHIPCcountries, according to the IMF. With continued implementation o freforms,




                                                         6

Tajikistan will be able to show continued improvements ingovernance.

Support of the Bank Group and of other developmentpartners for improvedgovernance

TheBank Group and other development are helping to improve governance in many ways. IFC's Private
Enterprise Partnershipprogram is helping to reform the licensing, inspections, and permitting regimes. The
Public Sector ReformProject (fiscal 2006) i s supporting government efforts to restructure the public
administration, improve incentives for civil servants, and reform the management o f the civil service. The
forthcoming Public FinancialManagement ReformProject will support reforms o f financial management,
procurement, budgeting, auditing, and debt management. The programmatic public expenditure review and
two public expenditure tracking surveys (one for healthand one for education)-all       to be completed in
2007-will    provide the basis for further dialogue onthe issues. The Cotton Sector Modernization Project
(fiscal 2007), Land Cadastre Project (fiscal 2005), and Energy Loss ReductionProject (fiscal 2005) Bank
are helping to improve the transparency and accountability o f major sectors o f the economy. Its aviation
sector study and cotton sector review have highlighted the problems o f governance inthese sectors and
recommendedreforms that are now being implemented. The Community and Basic Health Project (fiscal
2006), and its Education ModernizationProject (fiscal 2003) i s helpingto improve the efficiency and
effectiveness o f the delivery o f basic public services. A financial sector assessment program, being carried
outjointly by the Bank and the IMF, will informthe government o f what needs to be done to improve
governance o fbank andnon-bank financial institutions.

Other development partners are also working to improve governance in Tajikistan. Switzerland, the
European Commission, and EBRDare assisting with various aspects o f the privatizationprogram.
Switzerland and the U.S. are helping with the licensing, inspections, and permitting regimes. The
European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.K.are supportingthe implementationo f
aspects o f the government's public administration reform strategy and with public financial management.
The EBRDi s helping Tajik State Airlines develop and implement its restructuring plans. The Asian
Development Bank, the U.S. Switzerland, and the U.K.are assisting with improving governance incotton
sector operations. The Asian Development Bank, Sweden, Switzerland, the European Commission, the
U.K.,andthe U.S. are involvedwithimproving the managemento fhealth andeducation services.
Additional information on Bank operations and analytical work aimed at improving governance is
presented inannex 3.

Support of the PDPG2 for improvedgovernance

ThePDPG 2 supports governance reforms in a broad range of areas. Reforms o f the licensingand
inspectionregimes will reduce the demands for irregular payments. Actions to promote transparency in
privatizationand with encouraging greater competition among enterprises will reduce the opportunities for
well-connected elites to appropriate funds for personal benefit. Separationof policy making, regulatory,
and operational functions o f state-owned enterprises inthe energy and aviation sectors will increase the
transparency and performance o f the operations. Reforms o f the institutions governing cotton pricing and
grading will strengthenthe bargaining power o f farmers, which is expected to increase their share o f sales
proceeds. Reforms to restructure the public service and to improve the compensation policies for civil
servants and for health and education workers will reduce the opportunities and incentives for bribes.
Strengthening the budget process, procurement, and internal and external audit will help to ensure that
public resources are used as intended. Finally, reforms o f the policies determining how health and
education budgets are fornied and services delivered will reduce the misuse o fpublic funds and improve
the services.

             2.       TAJIKISTAN'S POVERTY REDUCTIONSTRATEGY

15.      Tajikistan was the first CIS country to prepare a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) in 2002, covering 2002-05. The PRSP aimed to increase real incomes, achieve a fair
distribution o f the benefits o f growth, and to ensure a rise inthe living standards o f the poorest. It
focused on four pillars: (a) encouraging equitable, labor-intensive economic growth, with an
emphasis on exports; (b) supporting the efficient and fair provision o f basic social services; (c)
targeting support to the poorest groups o f the population; and (d) improving governance and
security. The key weaknesses o f the PRSP were its lack o f prioritization and detailed costing o f
proposed actions.

16.      Over the last three years, the Government implemented key elements of thefirst PRSP,
namely, prudent macroeconomic management policy, increasing budget allocations to the
social sectors, and initiation of important reform in the delivery of social services. The
Government in 2006 continued to allocate a rising share o f GDP to health services from 1.3
percent in 2005 to 1.4 percent in2006. Still, public spending on health in Tajikistan remains the
lowest o f countries in the Eastern Europe Central Asia Region. The Government approved a
health financing reform strategy in 2005 that envisages increased allocations to primary health
care and the introduction o f per capita funding and fees for services. A basic benefits package
was introduced in 2005, although this was later suspended because of problems with pricing o f
paid services. It i s currently being revised for re-introduction under the PDPG 2 on a pilot basis.
The government also increased public spending on education from 3.6 percent o f GDP in2005 to
4.3 percent o f GDP in 2006. The use o f per capita-based, as opposed to input norm-based,
allocations inthe education sector i s being piloted in five districts as a first step toward increasing
efficiency and reducing inter-regionalinequities.

 17.     Tajikistan has developed new long-term and medium-term development strategies. In
2006 the government with support o f the donor community initiated the process o f developing a
long-term vision for the country's development: the National Development Strategy for 2006-1 5.
It also started to prepare its PRSP for 2007-09 to operationalize it. Both strategies address what
needs to be done to achieve the MDGs, while also paying attention to the country's specific
development objectives.

 18.     The PRSP 2007-09 provides for a comprehensive and prioritized medium-term
program. The PRSP objective i s to promote sustainable improvements in the living standard o f
the population, inparticular o f the socially vulnerable groups. This will be achieved through (a)
improvements o f public administration aimed at increasing transparency, accountability, and
efficiency o f public institutions and at establishing the macroeconomic, institutional, and legal
environment for development; (b) promotion o f private sector investment, especially in the
energy, transport, and cotton sectors; and (c) investments in health and education services,
empowering communities for development, and strengthening the social partnership. System
transformation, demographic challenges, environmental sustainability, and gender equality are the
cross-cutting themes o f the PRSP.

19.      Overall, PRSP proposed financing is situated within a sound macroeconomic and
fiscal framework.     Financing sources o f the PRSP include the state budget, external aid, and
foreign direct investment. Overall financing need are estimated to be about US$5 billion, out o f




                                                   8

which about US$2.3 billion i s confirmed.' The financing gap i s expected to be covered through
additional external financing for the public investment program and foreign direct investment.
Additional external financing for the public investment program i s estimated to be US$540
million, out o f which US$lOO million i s expected to be on concessional terms. This i s broadly in
line with the external debt sustainability benchmarks (given the current scenarios o f the
economy's growth and inflation). The PRSP envisages additional foreign direct investment to
total slightly more than US$2 billion during 2007-09, an annual average o f about US$502
million. Attracting this level o f foreign direct investment will be a challenge, given that inflows
have averaged about US$60 million per year during 2005-06, and will require significant
improvements inthe investment climate.

20.      I n general the PRSPfor 2007-09 meets the expectations of the donor community. The
Tajikistan Donor Coordination Council has been actively discussing the strategy with the
government's Coordination Committee on the National Development Strategy-PRSP. The PRSP
largely addresses the key expectations that the Donor Coordination Council has communicated to
the government. These expectations are that the strategy: (a) i s based on lessons learned fiom the
preparation and implementation o f the first PRSP; (b) i s prepared usinga participatory approach;
(c) i s embedded inthe government's policy, decision malung, and budgeting processes, with clear
institutional responsibilities for its preparation and execution; (d) reflects the sectoral and cross-
cutting priorities o f the government; (e) i s based on an assessment o f poverty; and (f) reflects the
public investment program and the central capital investment program. Allocation o f funds for
non-wage maintenance and operations costs associated with these two investment programs
should also follow the PRSP 2 priorities. The PRSP matrix o f measures i s expected to serve as
the basis for development partner support to Tajikistan.

                       3.      DEVELOPMENT POLICY PROGRAM

21.      Thegovernment ispursiiingpolicy and institutional reforms consistentwith the PRSP to
address weaknesses in the private sector environment and pubic sector performance.           Taken
together, these reforms are key to address the urgent need to diversify the economy, restructure
public sector institutions, and improve overall governance. The PDPG program consisting o f three
development policy operations i s designed to broadly support this medium-term agenda.

A.       Pillar 1:PromotingPrivateSectorDevelopment

22.      To sustain the recent high level of economicgrowth, Tajikistan will need to continue to
promote private sector development by maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving the
investment climate, and strengthening the regulatory framework in key strategic sectors
(aviation, cotton, and electricity) over the medium and long term. These will stimulate private
investment necessary to sustain a higher level o f economic growth and reduce poverty.

(i)      Maintaining macroeconomic stability

23.      The government has pursued sound macroeconomic management since the end of the
civil war in late 1997, as demonstrated by the stabilization of the economy and the achievement
of high rates of growth. Sound macro management has been underpinned by the successful
completion o f two IMF programs. The main challenge will be to maintain this stability in an
economy that i s vulnerable to external shocks due to the narrow export base. Inthe medium term,
however, the external prospects appear stable, with strong world demand projected for Tajikistan's
exports. Remittances are also expected to continue to grow as the Russian economy benefits from
highoil and gas prices. The December 2006 changes inRussianimmigration laws are not expected
to have a significant impact on the number o f Tajik migrants or remittances over the medium term.
Over the medium term, the government has targeted a fiscal deficit (excluding externally financed
public investment) o f 0.1 percent o f GDP, the maintenance o f single digit inflation through
conservative monetary policy, and a gradual accumulation o f international reserves. Additional
resources generated by ongoing tax reform (supported by the JMF), savings from debt service
relief, and public sector reforms will allow for an increase in social sector spending and a gradual
increase inpublic sector wage levels, inline with the projectedinflation targets. The government's
recent decision to contract a US$604 million loan from China will pose some macro management
challenges that the government i s aware o f and for which the Bank and the IMF are providing
advice.

(ii)   Improving the investment climate

24.      To sustain economic growth over the medium and long-term, Tajikistan will need to
further diversify the economy. Realizing the potential, however, will require significant
improvements to the private investment climate. Currently, the private sector in Tajikistan must
cope with an unclear and overly cumbersome regulatory and institutional framework that stifles
competition, increases the costs and risks o f doing business, and discourages innovation and risk
taking.

25.      To addressthese issues,the government has approvedthe private sector development
strategy developed with support of members of the Donor Coordination Council, and has
indicated its intention to start implementing the strategy with support of development
partners. It is anticipated that initial efforts will focus on the simplification o f the business




                                                   10

registration process, increasing the efficiency o f custom procedures, and streamlining and
simplifying the business license and inspections regime. Details follow.

         Reform of Business Licensing and Inspections

26.     Licenses. I n 2005 the government adopted a new licensing law that reduced the number
of activities subject to licensing from some 1,500 to about 113, updated application processing
requirements, and harmonized licensing fees.           It also adopted a regulatory framework to
implement and administer the law. Implementation o f this new legal and regulatory framework is
being supported by technical assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Private
Enterprise Partnership, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (IFC-FIAS), and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). However, some o f the 113 activities include several
subcategories that continue collectively to pose significant barriers to entry. With support o f PDPG
1, the parliament passed in July 2006 legislation amending the current licensing law to further
reduce the number o f activities subject to licensing to 65 and to streamline the procedures. Under
PDPG 2 the government has prepared amendments to other laws and codes to ensure compliance
with the new law on licensing; these are expected to be submitted to parliamentby mid-April2007.
The government has also adopted new regulations to ensure consistency with the new law on
licensing. USAID has partnered with the Bank in support o f this effort. Inaddition, incooperation
with the IFC Private Enterprise Partnership program, the government i s reviewing the
administrative violations code and drafting the necessary amendments to ensure that this code takes
into account the above amendments to the respective laws and regulations.

27.      The burden imposed by Tajikistan's licensing regime is now less than that of 28
comparator countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and more closely resembles that of
OECD countries. Data provided in the World Bank's Doing Business 2007 report also indicate
that Tajikistan's ranking has improved from 87 to 85 o f the 175 countries surveyed. A summary o f
the key indicators for dealingwith licenses i s providedbelow intable 2.

28.     Permits. I n addition to licenses, permits pose a significant cost of doing business in
Tajikistan. Experience in other countries shows that the elimination o f licenses often le-ads to a
proliferation o f permits. According to a survey carried out by the IFC in mid-2006, the direct and
indirect costs o f obtaining permits amounted to nearly 4 percent o f annual profits o f small and
medium enterprises. This news has encouraged the government to develop a reform program with
the support o f the IFC Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) aimed at reducingthe burden o f permits
on businesses. The first action towards permit reform-conducting an assessment o f the impact o f
permits in use on the cost o f doing business in Tajilustan-was       initiated in January 2007. The
assessment will provide the basis for preparation and implementation o f an action plan next year
toward reducingthe burden o f permits on business.

29.      The Government aims to reduce the frequency, duration, and arbitrariness of
inspections. The government under PDPG 1 established new rules and procedures for inspections
through a new law on inspections and amendments to the tax code regarding inspections (the

amendments were necessary because tax inspections constitute more than 50 percent o f total
inspection activities). Under PDPG 2, the government has adopted decrees to implement the law on
inspections. It has also submitted to the parliament draft amendments to other laws covering
inspections to ensure compliance with the new law.                   The administration has adopted new
regulations (at inspecting agency level),              distributed manuals and checklists (to provide
administrative guidance and instructions for inspectors) to two agencies (fire and sanitation),
trained staff, and publicized information through the media about the law, regulations, and new
procedures. Future reforms under PDPG 3 will seek to further reduce inspections by moving from
a system o f 100 percent coverage o f the remaining required inspections to a selective risk-based
system. Technical assistance for revising and publicizing the new regulations and procedures i s
being provided through the FC-Private Enterprise Partnership and the Bank-supported Public
Sector ReformProject.

30.      Under PDPG 2 the government is implementing a public communications strategy. To
ensure that the business community and investors are aware o f the new laws on licenses, permits,
and inspections and to ensure sound implementation o f these laws, the government is conducting a
communications strategy that comprises (a) a public awareness campaign, (b) training o f public
officials on the new requirements under the law, and (c) periodic surveys of businesses on impact o f
implementation.

         ImproveTransparencyinPrivatizationProcessandMarket Competition

3 1.     Privatization. While small enterprises were completelyprivatized in 2001, medium and
large enterprises are still beingprivatized based on the Strategic Privatization Planfor 2003-07.
This plan aims to (a) privatize 446 medium-to-large enterprises through auctions, (b) privatize 102
large enterprises through tenders, and (c) restructure, introduce private participation, or privatize the
remaining 37 strategic infrastructure and other enterprises. All those in the first and second groups
of enterprises are expected to be completed by end 2007. Over three-quarters o f medium and large
enterprises (about 421) were divested during 2004-06 through auctions and tenders. Another 79
privatizations are planned for 2007. This will complete the privatization o f all medium and large
enterprises. Restructuring plans have been prepared for the third group, and implementation will
start after the plans are approved in2007.

32.      To stimulate lagging demand, the government is committed to assuring potential
investorsand thepublic of thefairness of theprivatization process. Under the PDPG 1, a random
compliance audit o f the 2004 privatization transactions was carried out by an independent
international auditor to assess compliance with privatization regulations and identify measures to
address any weaknesses. The audit revealed a few deficiencies and proposed remedial measures to
address them."     The state committee for investment and state property management has taken steps
to remedy the deficiencies, and posted both the report and the remedial measures taken on its
website. A compliance review o f 2005 and 2006 transactions i s expected to be complete by mid-
2007, and its findings made publicly available. T o increase investor awareness and create greater
demand for assets being divested, the government under PDPG 1 committed to disclosing in


10       The firm performed a total o f 609 checks on 7 transactions. Deficiencies in three transactions were
reported. The fmt involves switching the years that specific enterprises would be privatized, an action that
was agreed by the World Bank under the Second Structural Adjustment Credit, as long as the total number o f
enterprises privatized each year remained the same. The second involves firms that did not produce financial
statements because they were no longer operating at the time o f privatization. The SPC has no control over
this matter. The third i s a failure to publish within ten days the results o f the tenders for fm. The SPC has
taken remedial measures to address this, and is currently publishingthe results o f tenders within ten days.

national newspapers details o f past privatization transactions and upcoming asset sales.               It
publishedthe results o fthe 2005 privatizationtransactions (sales price, bidders, and winners) inthe
Naroduaya Gazeta on April 26, 2006. It followed inFebruary 2007 with publication o f the results
o f 2006 transactions. To increase awareness o f and stimulate demand for the properties to be
privatized during 2007, the government is implementing a communications strategy with support
from the European Commission.

33.      Topromotefree andfair competition in the marketplace, theparliament enacted in July
2006 amendmentsto the competition law. I n addition, theparliament enacted in December 2006
amendments to the law on natural monopolies. Both are key policy reforms being supported
through the PDPG program. The government has also adopted the regulations needed to implement
the two amended laws.

34.      Government has transferred the enterprise supportfunction to the state committeefor
investment and stateproperty management, The anti-monopoly agency continues to be involved
inpricing issues for natural monopolies, but the government intends to remove this activity from
the agency as the infrastructure regulatory frameworks in the country develop.              This will be
addressed more fully when the regulations for the amended law onnatural monopolies are prepared.
Currently, the European Union i s providing technical assistance to strengthen institutional capacity
o f the anti-monopoly agency.

(iii) Regulatory reform in key strategic sectors

         a. Aviation

35.      Good progress has been made since June 2006 with aviation sector reforms.                   The
government recognizes the need to reform the aviation sector to reduce the cost and increase the
convenience o f air travel. Under PDPG 1 the government committed through a letter fi-om the
prime minister to the World Bank to separate the policy making function from technical regulation
and to separate the airport from the airline by 2008. Under the PDPG 2, the government issued
regulations on December 28, 2006 that effectively separates policy making from technical
regulation. The (omnibus) regulatory agency for transport, although affiliated with the Ministry of
Transport, i s independent, with its chairman appointed directly by the president and its budget
provided by the Ministry o f Finance, not the Ministry o f Transportation. The government has also
adopted a government resolution on restructuring Tajik State Airlines, which commits to a
separation o f airlines, airports, and air traffic control by the end o f 2008. A financial review o f the
separate accounts and a comprehensive analysis o f the cost structure o f the company's three
business entities (airline, airport, and air traffic control) has been undertaken. A realistic timetable
for separation o f actual operations has been developed together with recommendations to
strengthen capacity and the financial viability o f each separate entity. The latter includes revision
o f the structure o f fees and charges for airports and air traffic control and marketing strategies. A
detailed business development strategy will follow once the entities have been operationally,
financially, and legally separated. These actions together will ensure that the costs and profits o f
the various operations o f Tajik Airlines are transparent and create opportunities for other airlines to
enter the market. The EBRD i s coordinating its own support with that o fthe Bank to maximize the
effectiveness o f bothprograms inencouraging reform.

36.      To provide time for the Tajik State Air Company to modernize and improve its
competitiveposition, the Government will allocate in a phased manner new and additional route
rights over a period of threeyears. The Government in 2006 licensed two additional international
carriers to provide services to Dushanbe, a Russian airline (from Moscow) and in Turhsh Airlines


                                                     13

(from Istanbul). The government authorized in November 2006 Turkish Airlines to operate a
second weekly flight between Istanbul and Dushanbe. Air Arabia, the new airline o f Sharjah
(United Arab Emirates) has also expressed interest inoperating flights to Dushanbe."

         b. Cotton

37.      Tajikistan's agriculture is dominated by a cotton sector that suffers from substantial
domestic inefficiencies and inequities. Today, the Tajik cotton sector, traditionally, its most
important agricultural product, i s facing significant challenges. The cotton sector's crucial role in
the Tajik economy derives not only from its contribution to the value o f agricultural output (60
percent), export earnings (15 percent), and tax revenue (35 percent), but also its support to the
welfare o f rural population (75 percent) and uses o f irrigated and arable land (50 percent o f
irrigated arable land).    Inefficiencies in cotton production are impeding rather than enhancing
growth in agricultural production and rural poverty reduction. Rural poverty i s highest in cotton
growing areas. Growth and productivity, while increasing slowly, are low. Yields are currently
around half o f their pre-independence levels, and only 55 percent o f yield required for reasonable
profits. Some 250-350 person hours are required to produce 1 ton o f seed cotton in Tajihstan,
more than four times the internationally competitive level.

38.     Recognizing the challenges,thegovernmentfinalized a Cotton Sector Reform Strategy in
early 2005. The first part o f the strategy proposes immediate measures to resolve the current farm
debt overhang (estimated in a range o f 5-10 percent o f GDP). These efforts are being supported by
the World Bank under an ongoing cotton sector project, the Asian Development Bank, DFID, and
other donors. The strategy proposes to (a) revise the pricing and contracting systems, (b) encourage
alternative sources o f financing for agnculture, (c) abandon the practice o f local authorities o f
setting cotton production targets, and (d) create the necessary framework for increasing and
encouraging competition ininputmarkets.

39.     Implementation of the strategy, with support of the PDPG program and other donor-
supported initiatives, has been progressing satisfactorily. The Government and its development
partners have produced a roadmap and timetable for implementing the strategy that includes
responsibilities o f both the authorities and the partners. Actions o f the roadmap are generally being
implemented on schedule.        The Government, under the PDPG 2, issued an internal regulation
introducing a new cotton pricing method (methodica) for calculating the ex-gin price in Tajikistan
to replace all other pricing methods. The revised cotton pricing rules will allow farmers to register
contracts based on negotiated prices that are not based on production contracts with input creditors.
The reformed pricing framework will also allow farmers to register contracts with forward prices
(on the date o f the contract), rather than at delivery o f cotton, thus shiftingthe risks o f falling prices
from farmers to buyers (of course, buyers will benefit from rising prices, not farmers). The World
Bank will work closely with the Asian Development Bank and others to support the government in
implementing the new methodica pricing method.

40.      The government under PDPG 2 has also issued a resolution introducing the use of
universal cotton grading standards. To implement the new standards, the government has entered
into a joint venture with an internationally recognized U.K.-based cotton grading firm, Wakefield,
to grade cotton. Thejoint venture-which        i s 70 percent owned by Wakefield and 30 percent owned
by the government-has       submitted an application to Tajik Standard for accreditation o f both the
firm and its laboratory to grade cotton. The joint venture will initially grade cotton inaccordance
with existing standards.       It will grade cotton using universal cotton grading standards once

11Tajik Air now flies once a week from Dushanbe to Sharjah and once a week from Dushanbe to N e w Delhi.

legislation introducing these i s enacted in 2007 or 2008. The Asian Development Bank i s assisting
the government with technical assistance to amend current legslation and to procure laboratory
equipment and other supplies needed to introduce the new standards.

         c.  Electricity

41.      The government has madegoodprogress under the PDPGprogram in implementing the
energy strategy. It raised electricity tariffs in early 2007 and plans to continue doing so each year
through 2010 until tariffs reach cost recovery levels. The Government increased gas tariffs in
October 2006 and again in 2007 in line with increases in prices o f gas imported from Uzbekistan.
Budget allocations to compensate vulnerable groups for the increased tariffs were increased by 19
percent in the 2007 budget over what was spent in 2006. The dialogue to ensure that the measures
are effective i s being carried out by the Bank's energy and social protection specialists. Financial
and technical assistance has been mobilized with support from the Bank and the Swiss government
to reduce commercial losses in the electricity and gas sectors. The legal, financial, and physical
separation o f functions between B a r k Tajik and the Ministry o f Energy was initiated inApril 2006
in accordance with a presidential decree. Implementation is progressing well. Reforms will be
carried out through the Bank-supported Energy Loss ReductionProject.

B.       Pillar 2: Public Sector Reform and Improving Public Service Delivery

42.      The Government is committed to implementing public sector reforms to improve the
effectiveness of the administration. The government adopted on March 16, 2006 a comprehensive
public administrationreform strategy. The strategy covers restructuringo f government institutions,
civil service reform including wage reform, local public administration, and public financial
management. The strategy has a long-term timeframe and short and medium-term action plans.
The government has begun to implement the strategy's short-term measures, includingrestructuring
o f selected government institutions, and sectonvide reforms in health and education to improve the
access to and quality o f public services. The medium-term strategy and plans are described in
greater detail below.

43.      The Bank through the Public Sector Reform Project (approved in July 2006) is
supporting the implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the public administration
reform strategy.      The operation will support selected measures to rationalize core public
administration structures and reform the civil service management and wage system. In addition,
the proposed Public Financial Management Project, currently under preparation, is expected to
contribute to improved public financial management by supporting the implementation o f the
medium-term expenditure fkamework (MTEF), modernizing core treasury functions and operations,
and streamlining financial reporting.

(i) Public sector management reform

44.      The Government is reforming its system of public sector management.                      The
Government's 2006 public administration reform strategy provides the basis for the rationalizing
the government structure and increasing the effectiveness o f the public administration through
better delineation of authorities. Through reorganization of the public service over the medium
term, the government will (a) define the register o f functions, (b) develop the template for the new
organizational regulations o f the ministries and other types o f public bodies, and (c) draft the
regulations that will establish the linkages between the institutionsinthe structure.




                                                   15

        a. Rationalization of CorePublicAdministration Structures

45.      The authorities intend to complete the rationalization of the government structure over
the medium term. The Government completed the horizontal functional review o f the central
bodies o f the executive in January 2007. The review resulted in the compilation o f a catalogue o f
the central government functions, recommendations on refining the missions and functions of the
central bodies, and identification o f the functions that should be outsourced, terminated, or
reallocated. The functional review also presented a methodology for allocating functions and
competences. The Public Sector Reform Project will support implementation o f reforms based on
the review once the government has taken the key decisions.

46.      The government has initiated a restructuring of the central government administration.
The president's decree 6 (November 30, 2006) introduced a new government structure that was
implemented during December 2006-January 2007, thus changing the organizational set up o f the
central public administration.    The announced reorganization i s generally consistent with the
conclusions and recommendations o f the horizontal functional review. It adheres to the principles
o f separating the policy function from control and service delivery by introducing a two-tier central
government system o f public bodies. It also reduces the number o f ministries and state committees
directly subordinated to the government.

47.      The uniform implementation of thefunctional separation to improve the effectiveness of
the public administration will require a legal basis on the structure of public administration.
Legislation will establish the core principles and norms regulating the institutional system o f public
administration and define the principles o f organization, the types o f government entities, their
hierarchical status, and the accountability arrangements.        A working group reporting to the
executive office o f the president will be established through a decision o f the president to develop
the concept for the structure o f the public administration and measures for its realization.
Specifically, the working group will develop and submit for approval by the executive office o f the
president a time-based action plan that includes the stages o f (a) analysis o f the current situation, (b)
development o f proposals for the structure o f public administration as well as reporting and
accountability arrangements, (c) public awareness measures, and (d) development o f a concept and
measures for its realization.

48.     As anticipated, the recent reorganization of the central government has had some
problems. The State Financial Control Committee, which was developing its functions as the
Supreme Audit Institutionwith the support o f a grant from the Institutional Development Fund, has
been restructured and its functions have been given to the newly created State Financial Control and
Anti-Corruption Agency. This agency has also absorbed the functions of the tax police and the
functions o f the various law-enforcement agencies previously involved in the fight against
corruption.   Although Government's intention was to strengthen the role o f the state financial
control function, international good practice calls for establishing a tmly independent external audit
function that provides independent views on the quality o f public sector management.                 The
government has therefore decided to develop an independent audit function in line with
internationalgood practice. Abolishing the Ministryo f State Duties and Revenues and creating two
committees on taxes and customs is also problematic. The Bank is advising the government to
clarify the accountability framework o f the two agencies, and to bring the function o f tax
investigationunder the tax committee.

49.      The Government willface challenges in implementing the new organizational structure.
To achieve internal coherence, clear lines o f accountability, and good coordination across
organizations, the process o f reorganizing the executive branch must be carefully managed and



                                                  16

slowly phased in over 1-2 years. Effective and timely use o f technical assistance from the Public
Sector Reform Project duringthe implementationperiod will be crucial inmitigating risks.

         b. Civil Service Reform

50.       Civil service wage reform is being implemented asplanned. Inagreement with the Bank,
the Government is reforming public sector wage policy, aimed at linkingrewards to performance
and at creating improved career and earnings prospects for public officers. Under PDPG 1, it
introduced inNovember 2005 a new wage system on a pilot basis that (a) integrated all bonuses and
allowances, (b) decoupled the calculation o f the incremental wage for qualification ranks from the
minimum wage, (c) introduced ina phased manner decompression o f wages to better reward those
that hold positions of higher complexity and responsibility, and (d) changed the status o f technical
staff in the ministries to contract staff. The government rolled out the new wage system to all
central ministries on April 1, 2006. This i s a significant step toward building a professional civil
service, although full implementation is expected to take a total o f four or five years.

51.       The Government is committed to implementing additional wage reforms over the medium
term. Following the first step to differentiate pay increases undertaken under the PDPG 1, the
government will implement on April 1, 2007 the second stage o f reform that will increase the
decompression ratio to 1:4 between the salary o f deputy minister and that o f specialist. The
government plans to introduce on January 1,2008 a new central wage model (based on categories,
bands and steps, and integrating a years o f service component) and the third step in decompression,
which specifies a 1:4 decompression ratio between specialist and head of department. Finally, it
plans to incorporate on January 1,2009 most benefits and nonwage spending into base salaries.

52.       Theparliament enacted in March 2007 a new civil service law. The new law addresses
many of the weaknesses o f the 1998 law, including provisions to clearly separate political from
administrative appointments, introduction o f competitive, merit-based selection of administrative
officials, a simplified grading structure, incentives for performance, and a strengthened role for the
civil service department inthe management and supervision o f the civil service. However, the law
still does not comply with international best practice. The government plans to undertake several
activities under the Public Sector Reform Project to raise awareness o f the further changes required
to attain best practice.

53.       Upon approval of the draft law on state service, subsidiary regulations need to be
developed and the capacity of the civil service department to monitor the implementation of this
legal framework needs to be strengthened. Established in 2001, the civil service department i s
now almost fully staffed. However, the department still requires significant capacity building. A
restructuring plan prepared for the agency in2005, which aims to strengthen its power and capacity,
i s being considered by the government. The Public Sector Reform Project i s assisting with the
review o f its horizontal and vertical functions, and with other measures aimed at buildingcapacity.

54.       The Government is implementing the agreed PDPGpolicy actions related to competitive
recruitment and the introduction of a computerized civil service register.             The government
adopted in 2005 regulations on competitive recruitment and established the civil service register-a
key tool for merit-based management o f human resources. The civil service department has drafted
the government regulationon merit-based recruitmentandpromotion, which is generally acceptable
to the Bank.     Government approval o f the new regulation i s expected by early April. Once
approved, the civil service department through seminars and workshops will inform stakeholders on
how it will be implemented. The civil service department has also produced recommendations for
preparingthe job descriptions that will provide the basis for merit-based selection. Further training



                                                   17

of personnel managers i s planned to improve capacity to implement merit-based recruitment
throughout the civil service. The computerized civil service register will have to be designed on the
basis o f the newjob classification system and wage gnd for civil servants, and has been postponed
to 2008, the thirdyear o f the agreed program.

         c. PublicFinancialManagementReform

55.      The Government has enacted a modern procurement law. A grant from the Bank's
Institutional Development Fund i s supporting development o f a regulatory framework and helping
to build capacity o f the public procurement agency and other procuring entities to implement the
new decentralized public procurement system. In addition, the public procurement agency i s
developing standard bidding documents and an implementation manual, expected to be adopted in
February 2007.     Unfortunately, the law "on bidding" creates confusion that may lead to
misinterpretations in implementation o f the new law on public procurement. The Ministry o f
Economic Development and Trade has submitted a draft resolution to repeal the law to the internal
governmental coordinationprocess for review. It i s expected that the resolution will be adopted by
the end o f March 2007.

56.      The Government has adopted standard bidding documents in line with international
goodpractice. The Bank has provided initial comments on the Russian version. The Government
plans to submit the Englishversion to the Bank for review by the end o f March 2007 and to adopt
the standard biddingdocuments, once it incorporates comments o f the Bank.

57.      The Government is introducing an MTEF beginning with a pilot sector.                     The
Government formally endorsed the introduction o f the MTEF by issuing in September 2006 a
government resolution on the MTEF. The Ministry o f Finance issued MTEF instructions in
December 2006 that specify the changes to the budget process that will take place under the MTEF
reformprogram. The MTEFwill be introducedgradually, starting in2007 with a pilot covering the
education sector. Introducing the MTEF will require radical restructuring o f the budget processes
to give the line ministries-currently marginalized in the process o f determiningbudget allocations
intheir respective sectors-a   central role in the budget process, with responsibility for coordinating
and directing budget allocations for all budget organizations in their respective sectors consistent
with an aggregate sector ceiling determined by the Ministry o f Finance.             Due to capacity
constraints, the Ministry o f Finance will not prepare budget strategy papers during the next two
years, as originally foreseen under the program.       Instead it will prepare and publish budget
execution reports that also compreheusively analyze implementation o f the budgets o f the sectors
covered by the MTEF. Development partners (European Commission, DFID, World Bank, Asian
Development Bank, and IMF) intend to support strengthening o fbudget management and an MTEF
to improve predictability o f the budget and ensure pnority and efficiency o f public spending.

58.      Developing an education sector strategyfor the MTEF will require challenging changes
in the education budgetpreparation process. Currently, local government authorities submit their
education budget requests and negotiate budgetary allocations directly with the Ministry o f Finance.
The Ministry o f Education plays a limited role in the process. In the context o f the MTEF the
Ministry of Educationwill have the responsibility o freviewing budget requests submitted by local
governments. This will pose several challenges. First, the local government authorities may resist
the involvement o f the Ministry o f Education innegotiating with the Ministryo f Finance. Second,
the Ministry o f Education may lack capacity to reconciling education policy and budgeting. Given
these challenges, it i s proposed that the MTEF for education be introduced gradually over three
years (2008, 2009, and ZOlO), and that the process begin with the inclusion o f the Ministry o f
Education in the 2008 budget negotiations that commence in April 2007. Development partners,



                                                   18

including DFID, UNICEF, and the Fast Track Initiative will provide technical assistance and
training in the Ministry o f Education to enable it to fully implement the MTEF by 2011. The Fast
Track Initiative Catalytic Fund already supports strengthening o f fiduciary capacity o f the ministry
to manage external funds. These issues are covered under the programmatic public expenditure
review.

59.      The government is committed to strengthening internal financial control.                 The
government adopted through a resolution the public internal financial control strategy in March
2007.   T h i s strategy i s compliant with international standards, and includes the decentralized
internal audit approach and methodology, structural and institutional arrangements, and staffing and
skills requirements. The European Commission will assist the government to develop new and
amended legislationrelated to public finances and financial accountability and to strengthen audit
capacity at the central and the local government levels.

60.     An independent external audit function needs to be developed. The Bank and other
development partners have conveyed their concern to the government that the recent government
restructuring has weakened the country's independent external audit function. The government has
confirmed its intention to develop an independent external audit function through the Letter of the
Development Policy (annex 1). This will include developingthe legal framework to strengthen the
independent audit function and introducing the necessary amendments to the law on state financial
control to streamline its functions and those o f the State Financial Control and Anti-Corruption
Agency. Inparallel, the necessary changes will be introducedto the draft institutional development
plan to strengthen capacity to carry out the external audit function. The Bank will work with the
government to identify an appropriate model for developing an independent external audit function
based on the various models and experiences o f other countries. As an interim next step, the
President of Tajikistan has issued an internal order that establishes a task force responsible for
identifying the options for an independent external audit function. PDPG 3 will include as a trigger
a policy action developing an independent external audit function. The Bank will support the
reforms through the Public Sector Reform Project and the proposed Public Financial Management
ModernizationProject.

61.      The Government has launched under the Programmatic Public Expenditure Review,
public expenditure tracking surveys of spending in the education and health sectors, aimed at
ensuring resources are used as intended. The public expenditure tracking survey for health was
launched in November 2006, and the one for education started in April 2007. Dissemination o f
findings from the analyses will take place inthe thirdyear o fthe program.

(ii) Public servicedelivery

         a. Primary Health Care

62.      I n May 2005, the Government adopted a national healthfinancing strategy, based in part
on an earlier healthpolicy noteprepared by the World Bank. The strategy aims to improve fiscal
sustainability, transparency, and accountability in the health sector. The financing reform measures
agreed under the PDPG operations include (a) the allocation o f a greater share o f wage increases to
primary health care workers, (b) the reintroduction o f basic benefits package, (c) the introduction o f
a new job classification and wage grid system for primary health care workers, and (d) the
separation o f funding flows and accountability mechanisms between primary and secondary care.
Once these reforms are initiated, the government will introduce per capita allocations in primary
health care intwo phases on a pilot basis. The Ministry o f Health adopted in March 2007 a newly
designed per capita financing plan. Inthe first phase o f implementation, to be implemented during


                                                  19

2007, funds will be pooled at the rayon level in six pilot rayons (Nurek, Asht, Spitamen, Sarband,
Shurabad, and Kabodiyon). Inthe second phase, to be implemented during 2008, funds will be
pooledat the oblast level.

63.     Implementation of thepolicy actions to be supported under the PDPGprogram is largely
on track, with slippages in someplanned reforms. Sixty percent o f the increase inthe 2006 budget
for the health sector wage bill went to primary health care workers, and the remainder went to
hospital care in the first year o f the program. The government planned to allocate 80 percent o f
health wage bill increases to primary health workers in all rayons during the second year o f the
program.I2 However, due to political challenges, it will instead allocate 54 percent o f the increase
inthe wage billto primary health care workers, and 46 percent to others. This translates into a 30
percent increase in wages for primary health care providers and a 10 percent increase for others.
The wage increases became effective April 1, 2007. Introduction o f a new job classification and
wage grid system for primary health care workers has been delayed, and will now be supported
under the thirdphase o fthe PDPGrather than the second phase.

64.     The introduction of the basic benefit package, including free essential health services
and co-paymentsfor other services (including hospital care), will be implemented in pilot rayons
instead of in one oblast as originally planned The government lifted the suspension o f the basic
benefits package and tasked the ministries o f finance and health with ensuring its reintroduction in
2007. During the PDPG 1, it initiated the preparatory work necessary for the reintroduction o f the
basic benefits package and under the PDPG 2 it originally envisaged the reintroduction o f a fully-
funded basic benefits package in one oblast on a pilot basis and integration o f the basic benefits
package into hospital budget for that oblast by November 2006. It envisaged implementingin2008
the basic benefits package nationwide.                   However, due to weak capacity, the government
subsequently decided to implement per capita health financing into two phases beginning with the
rayon level. Therefore, the basic benefitspackage will be reintroduced on a pilot basis inthe same
six rayons as that o f the per capita financing in 2007. The basic benefits package will also be
integrated into the hospitalbudgets o f the pilot rayons.

65.     Nationwide rollout of the basic benefits package will be delayed until a thorough
assessment of thepilot can be conducted. The government recognizes that reintroducing the basic
benefits package, including formal copayments, will only succeed through deliberate, step-by-step
implementation linkingits reintroduction with other reforms o f health financing, including changes
in provider payment systems. It will therefore carry out an assessment o f experience in the pilot
rayons prior to reintroducing the basic benefits package more widely.

66.     The Government has established a timetable for phasing the implementation of co-
payment, clarified its structure, and agreed on the definition of co-payment. Inphase 1in 2007,
the government will introduce a single co-payment system that will apply for hospital care and
outpatient diagnostic tests. The system will be simple and clearly understood, and can be revised
and diversified over time by oblast or rayon. There will be no more than 10 co-payment categories.
The basic benefit package currently includes free outpatient consultative visits and free primary
health care visits. However, both will need to be reassessed in the future.                           The Government
recognizes that it will needto revise the structure o f privileged categories-a                   combination o f social
groups, age, and diseases covering about 40 percent of the population-to                                  ensure fiscal
sustainability, and plans to do so in 2007, prior to implementation o f phase 2. The World Bank-
supported Community and Basic Health Project will support the government in its effort to revise
the structure and categories o fprivileges.
*'An   increase in total public sector wage bill for the health sector for the 2007 budget is 15 percent.



                                                            20

67.      Challenges remain in addressing several key issues to ensure successful reintroduction
of the basic benefits package and subsequent implementation of the per capita budget. The
Ministryo fHealthneeds to take several actions. First,itneeds to issue an instructionregardingthe
reintroduction o f co-payments under the basic benefits package to the pilot rayons. Second, it
needs to separate nationwide the budgets for primary health care and hospital care. Third, it must
establish the director position o f the primary health care network in central rayon hospitals in pilot
rayons. Finally, it needs to finalize and approve the per capita methodology to be used inthe pilot
rayons, and approve the legislation on hospital autonomy by September 2007.

68.      The proposed operation complements other projects in the health sector. The World
Bank-financed Community and Basic Health Project (Board approval was December 2005), the
Public Sector Reform Project and projects supported by other donors (USAID-financed Zdrav++
Project, Swiss-financed Sin0 Project, Asian Development Bank-financed Health Sector Reform
Project) will provide the necessary support for capacity building, monitoring, and implementation
o f the reforms supported through the proposed operation.

         b. Education

69.      I n 2005 and 2006, a system of per capita allocations was implemented in the schools in
five pilot rayons. A review o f pilot 2005 implementation found three shortfalls: (a) the education
budget o f the pilot rayons was formed on an input-based principle, (b) the formula for allocation of
funds to schools was not appropriate, and (c) the flexibility to use resources at the school level was
limitedby the budget law. Inresponse, the government designed in2006 a new formula to allocate
funds to schools and decided to allocate in pilot rayons the full.package o f wage and nonwage
resources to schools them authority to break down allocated budget by individual line items and to
hire non-teaching staff on a contract basis. However, the overall general education budget of the
rayons was still formed on an input-based principle.

70.      I n December 2006, based on the results of the five pilots, the government adopted a
resolution to expand per capitafunding to seven new rayons. Resources allocated in the pilot
rayons will be based on a new per capita formula, while non-pilot rayons will continue to receive
funds based on the old norms.         Since the great majority o f school budgets consist of wages,
differences in allocation formulas may not be significant for the small pilot being implemented.
The resolution specifies that both budget distribution and general education budget formation will
be undertaken in schools in the pilot rayons on a per capita basis as o f 2007. This will ensure that
pilot schools that have begun to capture efficiency gains by reducing number o f classes will not be
allocated a reducedbudget as a result.

71.      The Ministry of Education developed in the summer 2006 a system to monitor
implementation of per capita financing, including Jinancial management, with assistance of
USAID and supportfrom the World Bank. It introducedthe system at the central level and inthe
five rayons piloting per capita financing. Its introduction inthe seven new rayons will be supported
by the grant from the Fast Track Initiative. This grant has also supported adaptation to Tajikistan
conditions of the training module developed under a USAID-supported project for rayon and school
financiers and bookkeepers. In addition, the grant has supported the actual training in the seven
new rayons.

72.      Other reforms of the education sector envisaged to be supported through the PDPG 2
operations areprogressing, but more slowly than expected. A recently commissioned study will
recommend reforms o f the wage and promotion system to improve incentives for education
workers. The 2007 budget includes wage increases for education workers averaging 15 percent


                                                   21

effective April 1, 2007. All supplements-except class leadership and textbook correction-have
been integrated into base pay starting in April 2007. This i s the first step indesigning and adopting
a new remuneration and promotion system that compensates education workers based on level of
responsibility and qualifications. As an integral element o f the wage reform inthe education sector,
the government i s committed to improve the stavka system to ensure efficient use o f human and
financial resources. A study (funded out o f the EducationModernization Project) that will analyze
the current situation and recommendreforms o fboth the wage and stavka system is expected to be
completed in July 2007. The Government plans to conduct in 2007 a school census for the whole
country in the context o f the education management information system, with financial assistance
from the Fast Track Initiative grant, the Asian Development Bank, and German Technical
Cooperation. This census will serve as a data and analytical base for a rationalization plan for
school infrastructure for further roll out of per capita financing and implementation o f the education
management information system.

                                 4.      PROPOSEDOPERATION

A.       Descriptionofthe Operation

73.      Programmatic Approach. This is the second of the three programmatic development
policy operations consistent with the Country Partnership Strategyfinalized in July 2005. The
full details o f the policy actions for the first two operations as well as the tentative policy actions
for PDPG 3 are specified in the government's Letter o f Development Policy (annex 1) and the
policy matrix (annex 2). The policy actions for PDPG 3 are as yet preliminary and will be more
firmly  articulated as preparation o f the follow-on program proceeds, reflecting the findings and
recommendations o f analytical work, developments in the policy dialogue, and changing country
circumstances.

B.       Objectives, Themes, andPolicyAreas

74.      Development objectives.       The development objectives o f the proposed PDPG are to
improve the environment for private sector development, and to improve overall functioning o f the
public sector and the delivery o f key public services. The proposed program i s aligned with the
first two pillars o f Tajikistan's PRSP.

75.      Themesof the operation. To achieve both objectives, the programrequires maintenance of
macroeconomic stability.        To promote private sector development, the program will support
measures to reduce the cost o f doing business, promote transparency o f the privatization process,
and assist with regulatory and institutional reforms in key strategic sectors (aviation, cotton, and
energy). To improve the overall functioning o f the public sector and improvements inthe delivery
o f public services, the program will support public sector reforms aimed at improving public sector
management, and the efficiency and effectiveness o f public spending.          The program will also
support reforms in education and health sector policies to improve access, quality, and equity o f
services. The table below lists the prior actions agreed with the government for PDPG 2 and
triggers for PDPG 3.

C.        Linkages to Country Partnership Strategy

76.       Theproposed three Programmatic Development Policy operationssupport the key policy
reforms intended to meet the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategyfor fiscal 200609.
The Country Partnership Strategy, discussed by the Board on July 26,2005, focuses on maintaining
growth in the short term and building a foundation for growth in the future. Developed in close
consultation with the government, it focuses on three strategic objectives: (a) improve business
opportunities inrural and urban areas, (b) enhance the quality o f health and education, (c) improve
the delivery o f energy services and exploit the country's hydropower potential. Due to limitedIDA
resources and taking into consideration the Bank's comparative advantages, the Bank's assistance
to Tajikistan will be highly selective.

77.       To achieve the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy, the proposed operation
will support a selective cross-cutting reform program. To improve business opportunities inrural



                                                       28

and urban areas, the operation will support reforms aimed at streamlining licensing and inspection
regimes, ensuring greater transparency o f the privatization process, promoting market competition,
and improving transport. The operation will contribute to enhancing quality o f education and
health services by supporting the reform o f the budget allocation mechanism (per capita allocation),
and the other reforms planned for these sectors. The operation will also support energy sector
reforms aimed at improving the delivery o f energy services and increasing the supply o f electricity
exports. These reforms will complement the Bank's ongoing and planned investment projects in
public administration, education, health, agriculture, and energy. The policy matrix presented in
annex 2 shows how each o f the proposed reform programs i s linkedto the objectives o f the Country
Partnership Strategy.

D.       Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

78.      The Programmatic Development Policy Grant and the IMF's support complement each
other. The Bank takes the lead and provides background to the IMF program in private sector
development and privatization, enterprise reforms, farm productivity, and regulatory reforms (see
details in annex 4). The Bank and the Fund share responsibility in public sector management,
budget planning and execution, financial sector reforms, and utilities' reform. The Fund and the
Bank cooperate on fiscal policies and reduction o f quasi-fiscal deficits, which requires close
cooperation with the Bank's programs for health, education, and infrastructure. The Fund also
leads intax reform, and inrevenue and expenditure management. Inthese areas the Bank takes into
account the Fund policy recommendations and ensures consistency between them and its own
measures. Inaddition, there i s close coordination between the Bank and the Fund concerning the
public sector reformagenda.

79.      The Bank is coordinating closely with other development partners in Tajikistan. The
development partners have recently established a donor coordination council, with a rotating chair
(currently held by the Swiss).      The members o f the council, which meets monthly, discuss
developments in Tajilustan, exchange experience, and share information on current and planned
interventions. The establishment o f this forum has greatly improved coordination o f development
partner support inthe country.

80.      The proposed operation complements the support of development partners in many
areas. For example, the Bank i s supporting the development o f a new competition policy and
communications strategy, which the European Commission will help to implement. The Asian
Development Bank will support the implementationo f the new cotton grading system. The Bank is
supporting the development o f policies to improve the management o f the transportation system;
the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Kuwaiti and Saudi Funds will
support the construction o f infrastructure. In addition, the proposed operation introduces policy
measures that would improve access to Tajikistan, while the EBRD (with restructured programs
based on discussions with the Bank) will finance and support their implementation. The Bank, the
EC, DFID, and USAID are working closely to support the government's reform program in the
areas o f public financial management. The Bank, USAID, Asian Development Bank, and Sweden
are all supporting reforms o f the health sector. All development partners supporting the education
sector have endorsed the government's national strategy for education development and are
aligning their support behind it. DFID and Japan are assisting with developing restructuring plans
for specific government entities in close coordination with the Public Sector Reform Project. The
EC, through its Civil Service Reform Project, is assisting with the development of a strategy for
civil service reformand ajob description system for civil servants. For details see annex 3.

81.      Stronger partnerships with non-OECD donors are planned. The Chinese have become
important financiers inTajihstan. They are keen to avoid duplication and waste intheir operations
and are interested in strengthening their collaboration with other development partners in areas o f
common concern. For example, the Bank and the IMF are discussing issues o f long-term debt
sustainability with their Chinese counterparts. The Bank and other development partners will
discuss specific areas o f mutual interest, such as infrastructure development and regional
integration.

E.       Relationshipwith Other Bank Operations

82.      The proposed reforms are based on extensive Bank analytic and advisory activities
carried out during the past two years. A public expenditure and institutional review, a country
procurement assessment report, a country financial accountability assessment, a public and civil
service wage note, and a remittances note have informed the public sector reform program. A trade
diagnostic, an investment climate assessment, an aviation sector note, an energy utility reform
review, the Central Asia regional electricity export potential study, and an agricultural development
strategy have highlighted key reforms required to attract private sector investment. A poverty
assessment update has deepened understanding o f poverty and its dynamics, and i s important for
the design of policy reforms that effectively reduce poverty. A programmatic public expenditure
review i s supporting Tajihstan's first public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA)
review, and analyzing the country's prospects for achieving the MDGs and long-term growth, and
providing support for the introduction o f the MTEF. Two public expenditure trackmg surveys, one
for health and one for education, will promote transparency and efficiency o f expenditure in these
sectors. Annex 3 shows the linkage between Bank's analytical and advisory work and the reform
actions o fthe proposed operation.

83.      The proposed operation supports policy reforms that are critical to the success of
ongoing and planned investment and technical assistance operations. The proposed operation
will support adoption o f policies critical for reform o f the public administration; capacity to
implement the reforms will be the focus o f a Bank-financed Public Sector Reform Technical
Assistance Project.    Similarly, the program supports policy reforms in the public financial
management, education, health, agriculture, and energy sectors-all     areas o f recent or forthcoming
Bank-supported projects. Reforms to improve the investment climate and to redefine the role of the
state in the economy will complement support o f the IFC and MIGA to promote private sector
development.     Annex 3 shows the links between PDPG policy actions and other investment
operations.

F.      LessonsLearned

84.      The design of theproposed operation reflects several lessonsfrom implementation of the
previous CAS in Tajikistan, other operations in Tajikistan, and policy-based loans in other
countries. Theseinclude:

0       Government ownership of the reform program is essential for success.                 Extensive
        experience demonstrates that government ownership o f the reform program i s the single
        most important criterion for success. The medium-term reform program o f the proposed
        series o f programmatic operation has been designed in close collaboration with key
        relevant ministries and the executive office o f the presidential administration.         The
        government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the reform agenda by
        continuingto implement the agreed reforms.



                                                 30

0  Focus on a limited set of key reforms. The proposed Grant supports deep reforms ina few
   selected areas. The program includes only the critical actions that the government believes
   that it can realistically implement in a three-year timeframe, backed by sector-specific
   projects, capacity-building, and communication campaigns. These are the reforms that the
   government i s already committed to and has been carrying out. The proposed operation
   contains ten core prior actions (see table 4) that are critical to the achievement o f
   development objectives o f the Grant.


0  Build capacity for implementation of the reform agenda. Passage o f legislation and
   adoption o f strategies have often had little impact in Tajikistan, because o f lack o f
   institutional capacity to implement reforms. The Public Sector ReformProject is helping to
   buildcapacity o fthe public administrationto implement reforms.

0  Build effective partnerships with the IMF and other donors in designing the proposed
    Grant.     Substantial progress i s being made with donor coordination, with the Bank
   regularly consulting with other development partners on a wide variety o f issues. This has
    led to a greater division of labor among partners and reduced duplication and waste. The
   IMF,the Asian Development Bank, the EC, andthe major bilateral donors inTajikistan are
   all informed o f the status o f the implementation o f the prior actions of the PDPGoperations
   to ensure that all are able to advance the reform agenda.


0   Offer a series of annual single tranche budget support operations, rather than multi-
   tranche operations.        Single-tranche operations, which are approved only after the
    government has implemented agreed reforms, requireboth the government and the Bank to
   be realistic about what i s possible, and then to agree on a program o f completed actions that
    i s acceptable to both sides.    The proposed program is a single tranche operation-the
    second o f a proposed series o f three annual operations-each o f which furthers the reforms
    supported by the previous operation. This approach allows the government and the Bank to
    adapt the medium-term program as new information becomes available and feasible options
    for realizing the intended development goals change. It also ensures that the flow o f funds
    i s predictable and that the technical assistance required to implement and sustain reforms i s
    available.

                        Box 2: Good practice principles on conditionality
Principle 1:Reinforce ownership
The proposed operation i s based on the Tajikistan National Development Strategy and the PRSP.
It also responds to several government sector strategies, including the national strategy for
education development, the public administration reform strategy, an investment climate
assessment, an aviation sector note, an energy utility reform review, and an agricultural
development strategy. All ministries and agencies undertaking policy reforms presented in the
matrix have participatedinperiodic workshops to discuss and agree on the objectives o f reforms,
current status, and next steps.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a
coordinated accountability framework
The PDPG program i s summarized in an agreed policy matrix in annex 2. The matrix contains
bothpolicy actions and indicators o f expected outcomes. The State Advisor for Economic Policy
in the Executive Office of the President is responsible for monitoring progress with the agreed
reform program and for coordinating the actions o f the other agencies and ministries involved.
The Bank consults regularly with other development partners inTajikistan to ensure that aid is as
effective as possible.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
country circumstances
The accountability framework is based on recent Bank analytical work, including a study of
macroeconomic management, a public expenditure and institutional review, a country
procurement assessment report, and a country financial accountability assessment. Two public
expenditure traclung surveys, one for healthand one for education, and several poverty and social
impact studies are also contributing to the accountability framework.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed PDPG 2 operation contains only ten core prior actions and 22 benchmarks. All are
part o f the agreed framework set out inthe policy matrix.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and
performance-based financial support
Progress reviews o f the policy actions in specific areasand o f the operation as a whole are held
regularly with government officials from ministries and agencies participating in the project.
These reviews allow the Bank to update the matrix on the basis o f actual and expected
performance and to communicate to the government what i s essential to enable the approval o f
the operation. Predictability i s further strengthened through the use o f a policy matrix containing
agreed reforms o f a series o f three annual operations-each o f which furthers the reforms
supported by the previous operation.


                           5.       OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A.        Poverty and Social Impact

85.       Poverty and social impact of this operation is likely to be positive. In the short term, the
proposed reforms in health and education are likely to result in improved access and quality o f
services to the poor.     Similarly the impact o f the revised energy tariffs will include special
provisions to avoid negative impacts on the poor with a subsidized rate for the vulnerable groups. n


                                                   32

addition, reforms in the aviation sector will improve access and reduce cost o f transport for
migrants, many o f whom earn low incomes. In the medium term, reforms proposed in public
administration reform strategy should yield benefits through more efficient and effective public
sector management. The planned reforms do not envisage further retrenchment o f personnel inthe
short-term; however, if implementation o f the medium-term measures were to result inthe need for
downsizing in the public service, a poverty and social impact analysis would be undertaken to
facilitate the adoption o fmitigation measures for civil servants to be made redundant.

86.       Poverty and social impact analyses have recently been carried out to ensure that the
government and the developmentpartners understand thepotential impact of policy reforms on
spec@ groups. The studies include an assessment o f the potential impact o f changes in energy
tariff policy, and a study investigatingthe impact o f changes in policies affecting the cotton sector.
These studies have informed the design o f the reform program in several ways. For example, the
study of energy tariff policy, completed in April 2005, recommended that the government adopt a
three-band tariff structure that will allow the poor to pay subsidized rates for energy, while ensuring
full-cost recovery for the energy sector through imposition o f higher tariffs on the better off.l3 The
government has now designed a new tariff structure consistent with this letter o f development
strategy for the energy sector that will be implemented gradually starting in 2007 and is expected to
be completed in2010.

87.       A poverty and social impact analysis for the cotton sector, completed in June 2004,

hectare, if all the necessary reforms were carried out. This would translate to almost US$lOO
estimated that cotton yields would increasefrom the current 1.9 tonsper hectare to 2.8 tonsper

million in additional revenue from cotton sales. The study proposed focusing in the medium term
on reforming contracting, pricing, and standards, which would benefit local farmers and farm
~ 0 r k e r s . lThis study also notes that such reforms will be easier to implement than resolving farm
                 ~
debt or pursuinglandreform.

88.       Additionalplannedpoverty and social impact analyses include:

          0      Impact o f adopting a new cotton pricing scheme and international cotton grading
                 standards onrural welfare.
          0      Impact o f the proposed introductiono f higher energy tariff, for 2007-10 on
                 employment opportunities and income level o f aluminum workers.
          0      Impact o f the introduction o f the basic benefits package for primary health care on the
                 poor.

89.       I n general, reforms supported by the proposed operation are expected to stimulate
economic growth and reduce poverty. For example, cotton farmers are expected to benefit from
the improvements introduced under the proposed program. Resource allocation within the energy
sector and across the economy i s expected to improve through cost recovery tariff reform. The
private sector will benefit from the aviation sector reforms as they will reduce the cost o f
transportation, stimulate investment and improve profitability o f enterprises.           In addition, the
reforms are expected to improve consumers' welfare and promote the free movement of labor. The
poor will be assured o f access to affordable and quality primary health care through the

implementation o f the basic benefits package. Similarly, the population will have better quality
education throughreformo f the per capita allocation.

90.     Improved governance is important to reducepoverty and access of public services by the
poor. Improved management and incentive systems in the state administration aim to reduce the
capture o f policy processes by special interests. This i s achieved by gradually improving civil
servants' earnings and the development o f improved internal accountability mechanisms in the
administration. It thus creates the conditions for the policy process to become more transparent and
accessible, which will benefit those who have limited access to decision-making processes.

91.      Consultations and outreach are being conducted on the proposed operation to ensure
that it reflects the views of a broad range of stakeholders. Discussions are held regularly in
Dushanbe with government officials across ministries and agencies, the private sector,
nongovernmental organizations, and other development partners on the overall reform program.
These have been critical in adjusting the program to reflect changing conditions and thinking in
Tajihstan. Workshops have also been held with stakeholders on specific aspects o f the reform
program, including on proposed reforms o f the licensing, inspection, and permits regime; cotton
pricing and grading; energy tariffs; the privatizationprocess; and the public sector. Inaddition, the
government, with support o f the Bank and other partners, i s implementing a communications
strategy to inform the public o f changes in the licensing and inspection regimes and o f past and
planned privatization transactions.        Measures have included broadcasting public service
announcements on the reforms o f licensing, and publishinginformation on privatizations.

B.       Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

92.      Amount and tranching. The proposed operation i s the second of three programmatic
single-tranche operations. The proposed operation would be provided in IDA grants inthe amount
equivalent to US$10 million. Funds would be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness,
expected in September 2007. Multilateral and bilateral donors are providing substantial technical
assistance and policy advice in support o f the government's reformprogram.

93.      Implementing agency. The Executive Office o f the President i s the implementing agency,
and the State Advisor for Economic Policy will be responsible for overall implementation o f the
reform program, for reporting progress, and for coordinating actions among the other agencies and
ministries involved. The department o f economic reforms and investments at the Executive Office
o f the President will be responsible for implementingthe public sector reforms. The National Bank
o f Tajikistan (NBT) will monitor the macro stability measures.          The Ministry o f Economic
Development and Trade, and the Ministry o f Finance will be responsible for reforms o f licensing,
regulation, and the privatization process. The state committee on investment and management o f
public property will be responsible for implementingthe privatization program. The line ministries
involved (energy,      education, health, agriculture, and transportation)     are accountable for
implementing the sectoral reforms specified in the reform program. The Borrower will open an
account at the NBT against submission by the Borrower o f a simplified withdrawal application.

94.      Monitoring and evaluation. Bank staff will continuously monitor implementation o f the
reforms specified in the program matrix o f the proposed operation to ensure that progress towards
outcomes is made during the three year program. The program document for the second and third
operation will report on progress with implementation. Country capacity for monitoring will be
strengthened through the ongoing Bank-supported Statistical Capacity Building Project.           For
instance, a living standards measurement survey is to be conducted in 2007-08 to be supported
through this project, will help in assessing the impact o f many o f the proposed reforms on the


                                                  34

population as a whole and on different socioeconomic groups. DFID, the European Commission,
and the Asian Development Bank are also providing support to strengthen capacity for statistics and
monitoring and evaluation. An implementation completion report will be issued within six month
following the closing date o f the three-year PDPGprogram.

C.       Fiduciary Aspects

95.      Country Financial Accountability Assessment. The June 2004 CFAA concluded that
the risk to public funds was high in Tajikistan, because of: (a) poor systems o f public
accountability   and weak mechanisms for public sector transparency; (b) weak internal control
systems and internal audit function; (c) weak institutional capacity to implement some o f the budget
reforms being undertaken; (d) fragmented budgets and poor cash management, (e) lack o f
transparency instate-owned enterprises; and (0weak capacity with the legislative bodies to provide
effective oversight over the working o f the government.

96.      Tajikistan has made substantial progress since then in various aspects of the public
jinancial management. For example, the organic budget system has been thoroughly revised, the
budget classification system has been changed, the treasury system has been modernized by
introducing automation, a treasury single account has been established, quarterly budget execution
reports are now routinely prepared, and external audits have become more timely. The government
had also taken steps to strengthen the capacity o f key accountability institutions inthe country. For
example, with a grant from the Bank's Institutional Development Fund, the State Financial Control
Committee (Tajikistan's supreme audit institution untilgovernment restructuring inearly 2007) had
entered into a twinning arrangement with the U.K.'sNational Audit Office to strengthen the skills
o f staff and to introduce modem auditing processes. In addition, through another grant o f the
Institutional Development Fund, Tajikistan has enacted a modem public procurement law. These
efforts have resultedinTajihstan achieving 8 o f the required 16HIPC indicators o f public financial
management. This puts Tajilustan in the top quintile o f HIPC countries as noted in the February
2006 IMF Staff Report and IMF assessment o f public expenditure management under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. However, the restructuringo f the government that took place in
following the elections o f November 2006 has undermined the independence o f the supreme audit
institution. The Bank and other development partners are now advising the Government on the
importance o f establishing a truly independent Supreme Audit Institute reporting directly to the
parliament. The presidential administration has expressed interest in moving forward with this
option.

97.      Capacity to implement good policies also needs to be developed. The adoption o f good
policies i s not enough to improve performance. Capacity i s also needed. The government i s
worhng with the Bank in preparing the Public Financial Management Modernization Project,
which, with the Public Sector Reform Project, are expected to strengthen capacity to implement
improved systems o f public financial management systems. A PEFA review, started in October
2006 and expected to be complete in March 2007, will provide a baseline for measuring progress
with reforms o f public financial management.        A three year programmatic public expenditure
review launched in 2006 by the Bank in close collaboration with key donors (European
Commission and DFID) i s assisting government in addressing institutional and capacity constraints
related to introducing the MTEF and improving budget efficiency. A Report on Observance o f
 Standards and Codes issued inJanuary 2007 will help the government to reformthe accounting and
auditing legislation and practices in the country. Strengthening o f the fiduciary aspects of the
education sector under the Fast Track Initiative will help in improving systems in education and,
ultimately, across the government. Fiduciary riskwill need to be monitored closely on a continuous
basis.

98.     IMF safeguards assessment. The IMF's most recent safeguards assessment, conducted in
June 2003, noted several weaknesses at the NBT, including a qualified audit opinion by an
international firm on the financial statements for fiscal 2002 that included audit observations with
respect to guarantees issued and loans made to co`mmercial banks, nonpublishing o f annual
financial statements, weak internal audit capacity at NBT, and infrequent and inaccurate periodic
financial statements. It recommended several measures to address the weaknesses, mainly in the
areas o f financial accounting and reporting and auditing. The latest available IMF Article IV
consultation report, completed in April 2005, concluded that the NBT was implementing the
recommendations made in the safeguards assessment. The external internal audit o f the NBT was
completed for 2003, 2004, and 2005. However, details on progress made in implementing various
recommendations, including results o f audits for the latest three years, are not yet publicly
available. Moreover, government abolished State Financial Control Committee under the reforms
undertaken after presidential elections held in November 2006 and additional assurance measures
are required in order to minimize the risks associated with current weaknesses o f the PFM
arrangements in the country. Accordingly, the team recommends opening a dedicated foreign
currency deposit account at the NBT, inthe name o f the Ministry o f Finance, to receive funds under
the proposed operation. The Government has agreed to utilize the foreign currency proceeds
deposited into the foreign currency deposit account for foreign currency debt servicing (already
included in the fiscal 2007 annual budget), thereby obviating the need to convert the foreign
currency into local currency. Conversion o fthe foreign currency proceeds into local currency i s not
recommended, as government budget execution reports cannot be audited by independent auditor
now that the State Financial Control Committee has been abolished. The Ministry o f Finance will
submit quarterly reports, providing details o futilization o f the proceeds o fthe grant, untilproceeds
have been fully utilized. The final statement on the utilization o f the proceeds o f the foreign
currency and local currency deposit accounts will be subject to an audit under terms o f reference
acceptable to the Bank and by an audit firmacceptable to the Bank.

D.       DisbursementandAuditing

99.      Disbursement. The Borrower is the Republic o f Tajihstan. The proceeds o f the Grant will
be disbursed upon effectiveness o f the Development Financing Agreement. The Borrower will
open and maintain a separate foreign currency deposit account in (US dollars) at the NBT, as part
o f the general foreign currency reserves o f the government. The proceeds o f the Grant will be
deposited by the Association into such dedicated foreign currency deposit account. The IDA
"negative list" restrictions, agreed duringnegotiations and specified in the Development Financing
Agreement, will apply to the use o f grant proceeds.        If after depositing funds in the deposit
accounts, the proceeds o f the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development
Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (a) return that amount to the
account for use for eligible purposes, or (b)refund the amount directly to the Bank.

100.     Reporting and auditing arrangements. Through the Ministry o f Finance, the Republic o f
Tajikistan will (a) report on a quarterly basis to IDA the amount received into the deposit accounts
at the NBT, (b) provide confirmation o f the amounts withdrawn andor transferred from the deposit
accounts, including bank account numbers, date and names o f beneficiaries, and (c) ensure that the
proceeds o f the Grant are not used for ineligible expenditures defined in the IDA "negative list" as
agreed during negotiations and specified in the Development Financing Agreement. The deposit
accounts and the transactions from this account to the ultimate beneficiaries' accounts will be
independently audited inaccordance with terms o freference to be agreed with IDA.

E.     EnvironmentalAspects

101.   The conclusion of an environmental screening of the proposed reforms, undertaken as
per the requirements of OP 8.60, is that the reforms are not likely to be significant from an
environmentalpoint of view. Details o fthe analysis for each reformarea follow.

0      Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic stability is necessary for economic
       growth and poverty reduction, which may indirectly generate environmental benefits by
       encouraging the adoption o f moderntechnologies which use resources more efficiently than
       those they replace.


0      Reforming licensing and inspections. Reform o f licensingingeneral will facilitate business
       entry and growth and reduce costs for businesses.              This will result in uncertain
       environmental impacts, depending on the sectors that attract new investment, and the
       availability and cost-effectiveness o f new technology. The reforms may be positive for the
       environment if they attract businesses into the formal sector, since formal businesses are
       more likely to comply with environmental policies. Reform of the inspection law will
       increase the accountability of inspectors and reduce the opportunity for rent seeking. This
       in turn will increase the effectiveness o f the inspection process to detect violations in
       health, safety, environmental, tax, and other laws.         In time, streamlining o f specific
       environmental inspection and licensing rules will be necessary to ensure positive
       environmental outcomes from the reformprocess.


0      Improving transparency of the privatization process and market competition. Increasing
       the transparency and accountability o f the privatization process will likely have a positive
       impact on the environment, because this transparency will include disclosure o f a firm's
       environmental liabilities for past contamination and current environmental performance.
       This, however, needs to be carefully monitored, as the country i s expected to privatize
       some pollution-intensive industries in the near future. International best-practice suggests
       that addressing environmental issues upfront significantly eases the time and costs o f
       privatization.    Amending the competition and natural monopolies laws to increase
       competition among enterprises will have uncertain impacts on the environment. The cross-
       country evidence suggests that over time, competition leads to more efficient resource use,
       and thus reduces environmental impact o f a unit of output. However, competition could
       also lead to negative environmental impacts if it encourages firms to use cheaper, but
       environmentally-damaging technologies. This again needs to be carefully monitored.


0      Aviation sector reform. The proposed operation seeks to improve efficiency and enhance
       competition inaviation. Although increased competition i s expected to raise the number o f
       flights between Tajikistan and other countries, this i s expected to lead to adoption o f more
       fuel-efficient, less noisy aircraft by the Tajik State Airline, with an overall benign impact
       on the environment. The operation does not support investment in airports, which i s being
       supported by other development partners with oversight o f the State Committee on
       Environment Protection and Forestry.


0      Cotton sector reform. The proposed operation aims to introduce a universal cotton grading
       system that will increase the confidence o f potential end users o f the quality o f Tajikistan
       cotton beingpurchased. This will maximize the sales price and stimulate demand from end
       users for premium cotton. This will have only indirect, if any, impacts on the environment.
       An increase in demand for premium cotton could stimulate new production, or it could



                                                 37

        encourage farmers to substitute higher-grade cotton for lower grade. An increase in cotton
        production with an efficient imgation and drainage infrastructure may prevent negative
        effects on the environment and soil fertility.       However, it could also lead to land
        degradation, primarily through waterlogging, salinization, and erosion. It could further lead
        to (a) a potential increase in use or overuse o f water; (b) an increase in use o f chemical
        fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals; (c) an increase in operation o f
        ginning factories and associated hazards; and (d) dumping o f excavated sediments and
        other materials from irrigation and other drainage canals. The task team i s aware o f the
        risks and i s coordinating actively with ongoing Bank projects, including the Rural
        Infrastructure Project, the Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project, the
        Land Cadastre Project, and the Ferghana Valley Development Project to closely monitor
        and mitigate the potential environmental impacts arising from cotton production.         The
        proposed Bank-supported Cotton Sector Recovery and Poverty Reduction Project and a
        project supported by the Asian Development Bank, will further strengthen capacity o f the
        government to address environmental issues arising from reforms o f the cotton sector.

e       Energy sector reform. Much o f the forest loss in Tajikistan i s due to lack o f access to
        energy supply in remote rural areas. In the long term a more efficient energy sector is
        expected to reduce these pressures. The proposed operation will support separation of
        policymaking from commercial operations and restructuring o f tariffs to promote cost
        recovery, while ensuring that the poor have access to a minimal level o f service at
        affordable rates. These measures are expected to promote efficiency and conserve energy,
        which will have a positive impact on the environment.         Without mitigating measures,
        reforming the tariff structure may have had a negative impact on the poor, according to the
        poverty and social impact analysis, which may have increased pressure on forests for
        fuelwood. However, this will be mitigated through provision o f subsidies to low-income
        electricity consumers. The proposed operation does not support any investment operation
        for constructing new dams.         Environmental impact assessments o f future energy
        investments will be carriedout under the projects that support them.

e       Reforming public sector management.          The operation will support implementation o f
        reforms o f public sector management aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness
        o f the public service and the delivery o f health and education services. These reforms are
        not expected to have any impact on the environment. Efforts will be made in the future
        through these reforms to improve the efficiency and accountability o f environmental
        agencies.

102.    As a newly independent country emerging from a civil war, neither awareness of
environmental issues nor institutional capacity to address them are well developed in Tajikistan.
This is now changing. Tajikistan's PRSP recognizes water pollution, soil degradation, water
pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity conservation as environmental priorities and proposes a
range o f measures to address them.       Tajikistan i s an active party to several United Nations
conventions and has prepared a National Strategy for Combating Desertification (2002), and a
National Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (2003).             The country has also adopted
environmental laws and regulations, including a requirement that environmental impact
assessments are conducted for all new economic activities. The borrower also imposes fees and
fines on all major polluters. The State Committee on Environment Protection and Forestry in
January 2004, merging the Ministry for Environment Protection and the Committee on Forestry
was recently merged with the Ministryo f Apculture. This has raised some concerns that this may
interfere with some o f the core functions of the state committee (now a department). The task team
would monitor developments in this area as things are stiIl evolving and continue its dialogue with


                                                  38

the government to focus its efforts in conducting further reforms in the environmental sector in
short term and to strengthen the capacity o f environmental authorities.

103.      Gaps in capacity is being strengthened through a number of Bank-supported projects.
The Government i s strengthening its the capacity to assess and mitigate environmental impacts o f
economic activities through training and hands-on experience. The Bank, through four ongoing
rural development projects, is strengthening the local line departments by supporting the upgrading
o f their national and local level analytical laboratories and training their staff with internationally-
recmited environmental and natural resource protection specialists. The Bank has also assisted the
government in holding conferences and workshops on natural resource and environmental
management and in disseminating their proceedings to the public.              Additional measures to
strengthen the government's institutional capacity for environmental management will be addressed
through the Bank's country program and programs o f other development partners. A country
environmental analysis that examines the institutional framework and capacity o f the country to
address its environmental challenges will be undertaken duringthe next phase o fthe program.

104.      Opportunities for mainstreaming environmental issues in government policies and
programs, and additional measures to strengthen capacityfor environmental management will
be identified through a country environmental analysis. With support o f a multidonor trust fund,
the government will undertake a country environmental analysis in 2007. This is aimed at
deepening the understanding o f the country's major environmental challenges, and assessing
capacity within the country (both public and nongovernment) for sound environmental
management. The findings o f the analysis are expected to guide support o f the Bank and other
development partners to strengthen capacity inTajikistan for sound environmentalmanagement.

F.       Risks and Risk Mitigation

105.     Successful implementation of the medium-term reform program faces risks, for which
mitigation measureshave been identified. Specific risks.include:

0         Weak implementation capacity inhibits implementation and coordination. Capacity in
         Tajilustan to implement a complex reform program is weak. Development partners are
         helping to strengthen capacity in several ways. A Japanese Policy and Human Resources
         Development Grant i s helping to build capacity through support for design and sequencing
         o f reforms, analytical work, and intergovernmental coordination. The Bank will help to
          strengthen capacity o f central government operations through the Public Sector Reform
         Technical Assistance Project.     It will strengthen capacity of the sector ministries and
         government agencies involved inthe program through ongoing and planned projects. Other
         development partners are working with the Bank to ensure that capacity buildinginitiatives
         are well coordinated and meet the needs o f the government.


0        Poor governance and corruption prevents effective use of resources and discourages
         private sector investment.        Tajikistan's public financial management system i s
         characterized by poor internal controls, lack o f transparency, high level o f corruption, low
         capacity, poor cash management and budget execution, all o f which undermine efforts to
         enforce fiscal discipline. During implementation, fiduciary risks will be mitigated by: (a)
         creating a dedicated foreign currency account into which Bank funds will be disbursed; (b)
         regular reporting on the use o f funds disbursed; and (c) requiring an independent audit on
         the use o f funds provided under the proposed operation. Inaddition, the following actions
         will be requiredinorder to realize longer term progress inpublic financial management: (a)
         commitment by the authorities to implement key recommendations o f the CFAA, the


                                                   39

   Country Procurement Assessment Report and other IMF reports; (b) satisfactory
   implementation o f the grants from the Bank's Institutional Development Fund supporting
   public sector reform program o f the government; (c) satisfactory implementation o f the
   Public Sector Reform Project, and the proposed Public Financial Management
   Modernization Project, currently under preparation. Progress in strengthening the public
   financial management will be assessed through the IMF fiscal transparency Reports on
   Observance o f Standards and Codes (completed inJanuary 2007), and a fiduciary update to
   be conducted by the Bank in fiscal 2008. A PEFA to be completed by March 2007 will
   provide baseline data against which to benchmark Tajilustan against other countries and to
   measure progress in the area o f public financial management. The fiduciary assessment o f
   the education sector being undertaken under the Fast Track Initiative i s another important
   step inimproving the management o f external and public funds. It has resultedinan action
   plan aiming at strengthening the procurement and management capacity o f the Ministry o f
   Education.     The Bank will support opportunities for candid dialogue between the
   government and other stakeholders on the issues, and will support civil society's efforts to
   be able to better track and monitor the use o f government funds. The Bank sees closer
   collaborationwith donor partners as key to moving this agenda forward.

e  The government contracts excessive non-concessional loans, which it cannot repay. The
   government has already contracted a US$604 million loan with the Chinese. This loan i s
   concessional and i s being used to construct roads and electricity transmission lines, it also
   raises risks o f future debt distress should the economy grow more slowly than expected or
   should the projects prove to generate fewer benefits than projected. Additional loans,
   especially those provided on commercial terms will add to the risk o f debt unsustainability.
   To mitigate this risk, the Bank in collaboration with the IMF i s maintaining an active
   dialogue on the issue. Should the country be found to be in violation o f the Bank's non-
   concessional loan policy inthe future, the grant element o f IDA credits will be reduced.
   A severe violation could leadto a cut inTajilustan's overall IDA allocation.

e  A complex political economy prevents positive reform, Tajikistan has been independent
   from the former Soviet Union for slightly over ten years and is still recovering from a
   devastating civil war. Its institutions are very weak and vulnerable to capture by special
   interests. Stakeholders who benefit from the current institutional arrangements are likely to
   resist reforms that will leave them worse off. The president's overwhelming majority inthe
   November 2006 polls, however, strengthens his mandate to implement the reformprogram.
   Nonetheless the Bank will continue to support reforms by improving and expanding its
   efforts at communications, emphasizing the costs o f continuing with the economic status
   quo, the long-term benefits o f reforms, and opportunities for accelerating growth through
   greater private sector involvement ininfrastructure. Better dissemination o f the findings o f
   Bank-supported analytical work will be an important vehicle o f this enhanced
   communications effort, but it will also involve proactive efforts, with assistance from the
   external affairs units in the country office and in headquarters. The Bank will regularly
   monitor progress and actively engage in dialogue to help government and with the
   opposition.    It will continue to coordinate closely with other development partners to
   monitor and respond to political developments.

e  Externalfactors present unknown risk. Tajikistan i s exceptionally vulnerable to shifts in
   the external environment, due to its small internal market, its landlocked position, and its
   dependency on a small number o f commodity exports, limited number o f transport routes,
   and workers' remittances for income and for foreign exchange. Deteriorating terms o f



                                              40

trade would negatively affect rural incomes and Tajihstan's balance o f trade. Political or
economic instability in neighboring countries also poses a significant risk to Tajilustan; as
such instability could lead to closures o f borders or trade disruption. A slowdown in the
Russian economy or tightening the implementation o f a new Russian immigration law
could result in a decline inremittances. Apart from pursuing suitable economic policies to
diversify its exports, as an active member of the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation, Tajikistan i s addressing some o f these trade and transportation issues through
regional cooperation efforts. It i s maintaining a close dialogue with Russia to ensure that
Tajik workers are able to continue having visa-free access to Russia's labor markets.

H.E.Mr.PaulWOLFOWITZ
President
The World Bank
1818HStreet,N.W.
Washington, DC 20433

Mr.President,

Please allow me to express my gratitude to you and the World Bank for the support that
is being provided to the government reformprogram inthe Republic o f Tajikistan.

The objective o f this Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) is to outline recent
developments inTajikistan's economic and social situation and the related prospects over
the next three years. It is based on National Development Strategy (NDS) for the period
to 2015 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for 2007-2009, which implementation
has been started by Government. The NDS reflects the country's vision o f it strategic
development, while PRS presents a medium-term program as implementation tool o f
N D S objectives in the medium-term. The LDP is also based on the sector strategies, for
example, the Public Administration Reform Strategy (PARS), and the National Strategy
for Education Development (NSED), which are being implemented with support o f the
donor community.

Inthe framework ofthe World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Tajikistan
covering FY 2006-2009, the Government has been working closely with the World Bank
inimplementing reforms inthe context of a Programmatic Developing Policy Financing
(PDPF). PDPF aimed at promoting growth, reform public sector and improve the quality
o f public services delivery. We are committed to the reform agenda agreed under the
PDPF as evidenced by successful implementation o f the agreed reform policy actions in
the first year.

With respect to the government's economic program, we would like to highlightsome o f
the results achieved inrecent years. According to experts, Tajikistan has been one o f the
fast-growing economies in ECA with an average five year growth rate o f 9 percent
(2001-05). This high growth rate reflects the progress achieved during initial stage o f
structural adjustment reforms, balanced macroeconomic policy, as well as economic
rebound after the civil war, favorable external factors, and strong inflows o fremittances.




                                            42

This growth achieved in recent years has supported to the poverty reduction in the
country. Thus the poverty rate (using a PPP o f US$2.15 per capita per day) significantly
fell by 25 percentage points (from 82 percent in 1999 to 57 percent in 2004). With that,
in2006 growth impairmentwas observed with 7 percent reflectingdecline intrade dueto
increase of world prices for energy and decrease o f cotton sales. At the same time, the
fiscal deficit has beenbrought under full control by improved revenue mobilization and a
reduction in interest payments on external public debt as a result o f successful debt
restructuring. The tight fiscal and monetary policies significantly reduced inflation: from
16.4 percent in 2003 to 7.1 percent in2005. However, it has risen to 12.5 percent due to
large increase in energy tariff and the inflows o f remittances. The national currency has
been stable through end-December 2006.

Despite those achievements, we fully understand that Tajikistan may face major
challenges ahead. Our country remains vulnerable to external shocks and is still the
poorest country in the CIS with an estimated per capita GDP o f US$402 in 2006. This
vulnerability i s due to the fact that about three-forth o f total export earnings remain
concentrated on aluminum, cotton and electricity. And the remittances from abroad are
the key trade deficit financing source and hence current account balance stabilization.
Besides, our economy heavily depends on oil imports whose prices tend to further
increase in recent years. These factors pose significant risk to maintain sustainability o f
high economic growth rate over the long-term. We recognize that lowered growth rate
could increase the risk o f debt distress because our external debt has recently increased.
With this infrastructure investment inthe transport and energy sectors needed to sustain
economic growth. To mitigate such risks, the government intends to deepen structural
reforms in all sectors to realize their full potential to sustain high economic growth rate
and accelerate poverty reduction.       We will also continue prudent management o f
macroeconomic policy, especially strengthening the management o f external debt. We
expect that implementation o f the Public Administration Reform Strategy will lead to the
gradual improvement incapacity inthe government to implement key reforms.

In 2006, the Government has successfully implemented important policy reform
measures that were agreed under the Programmatic Development Policy Financing
(PDPF). We are committed to continue deepening the reform under the agreed agenda
that will be implemented duringthe next few years.

                       I.SUSTAININGECONOMICGROWTH

The government attaches high importance to the growth agenda. Inrecent years growth
performance has been strong, while in 2005 it slowed down mostly due to both external
(world market prices for cotton, aluminum, and energy) and internal (inparticular due to
low cotton productivity, onerous regulatory environment for private sector development)
factors. We understand that key reforms in this area should focus on: (i)improving
investment climate; (ii)improving productivity of enterprises and agribusiness; (iii)
increasing the efficiency inenergy sector; and (iv) improving trade and air transport.




                                              43

Investment Climate

Improved investment climate i s considered to be an important agenda in private sector
development policy o f the government. Further actions in this area include streamlining
and minimizing government interventions into business operations and reducing barriers
to entry into the market. We acknowledge that those are major constraints for private
sector development. Therefore we have enacted a new Law on Inspections and amended
the existing Tax Code and also amended the licensing law. The measures are undertaken
to bring regulations in compliance with these laws and relevant draft laws have been
submitted to Parliament for approval.

We will pursue policy actions to enforce transparency and accountability in the
privatization process. To ensure transparency o f the privatization process and build
support for the privatization program, we adopted a communication strategy that, among
other things, mandates the publication o f future asset sales as well as past privatized
objects. The State Committee on Investments and State Property Management (SCISPM)
has been publishing information on asset sales for previous periods and future assets.
Further, we have completed a compliance review o f a set o f randomly selected privatized
objects for 2004. We intend to continue with the compliance review for the 2005 and
2006 privatization transactions.

Actions taken toward improving investment climate include:

Licensing and Inspections
    0  We adopted regulatory documents on inspections, as well as amended current
       regulations on licensing selected types o f activity. These regulations shall be
        clear and exclude any possibility for double-interpretation as well as facilitate the
       processes at the maximum. Besides, we will introduce administrative measures
        against those public officers that fail to observe new requirements for licensing
        and inspections. Inthe future, we will thoroughly monitor the implementation o f
       the newly adopted legislation that governs activities requiring inspection and
        licensingto ensure their compliance and efficient execution.

   Private sector development
    0   The government has recently developed a pledge law for movable property and
       we are settingup a registry for such pledged assets inthe Ministry o f Justice. This
       will facilitate secured lending where collateral is movable and thereby increase
        access o f business to credit. We are currently developing a policy on property
       rights including for intellectualproperty and developing a draft investment law to
       provide clarity to andfacilitate investors, inparticular foreign investors.

       Inorder to achieve sustainable development, we havedeveloped a comprehensive
       private sector development strategy. Actions for the first three years have been
       incorporated as a PSD strategy to be implemented under the PRS. The salient
       elements o f the strategy include reducing government related risk for businesses,
       barriers to entry, and the government related costs o f doing business inTajikistan.



                                            44

Privatization
        We have made good progress in privatization.          All small enterprises were
        completely privatized by 2001. Mediumand large scale enterprises are still being
        privatized based on the 2003/2007 Strategic Privatization Plan. Enterprises have
        been grouped into three categories: Category One covers medium and large scale
        enterprises to be privatized through auction; Category Two covers large
        enterprises to be privatized through tender procedures; and Category Three covers
        strategic infrastructure and other enterprises.    Those in the first and second
        categories are expected to be hlly privatized by end 2007. Restructuring plans
        have been prepared for the third group in order to attract private investments into
        these strategic enterprises.


   0    The Government shall continue the current course to improve transparency and
        accountability of the privatization process. We will continue with annual random
        compliance reviews o f privatized objects with an objective to disclose
        deficiencies in the privatization process. The specific steps in this area are as
        follows: (i) amendments to current regulations as needed to remedy deficiencies
        explored during the random compliance review o f privatized objects; (ii)
        continuing random compliance reviews o f privatized objects annually and
        adoption o f necessary remedial actions through year 2007; (iii)    continuing full
        disclosure and broad communications to the public on previous and future
        auctions and tenders; and (iv) adoption and implementation o f individual
        restructuring plans o f large state enterprises. We also plan a program on
        privatization o f unfinished legacy which will allow their completion and efficient
        utilization by the private sector and, thus creating employment and sustaining
        growth.

Enterprise Productivity and Agribusiness

Improved competition rules and increasing productivity in agribusiness are expected to
create a healthy competitive environment in local market and ensure sustainability o f
growth inmedium and longer term. The Government adopted a new version of Law "On
Competition and Limitation o f Monopolistic Activity at Commodity Markets" in 2006,
and issued a clear regulatory mechanism for execution o f the new Law in March 2007.
We also amended the Law "On Natural Monopolies" and are now preparing its
implementation mechanismincluding the implementing regulations.

On agribusiness, the Government has adopted a Farm Debt Resolution Strategy which
considers necessary actions to increase productivity and ensure fair distribution o f export
sales revenue in cotton sub-sector. The Ministry o f Economic Development and Trade,
and the Ministry o f Agriculture and Environmental Protection towards increased
flexibility and competition have prepared revised cotton pricing method (Methodica) for
calculating the ex-gin price in Tajikistan. This allows to farmers to register contracts
based on negotiated prices and to also register contracts with prices on the date o f the
contract. The government has also adopted a decree on moving to international cotton



                                             45

standards; a joint venture has been established with an internationally recognized cotton
grading company with compulsory grading and weight certification in next two years.
We will continue the practice o f plantingHighYielding Varieties o f seed cotton. These
actions are expected to contribute to increased productivity in cotton sub-sector through
greater competition inthe sale as well as fair income distribution inthe sub-sector.

Energy Sector Reform

Energy is one o f the important sources o f economic growth for the country. InJanuary
2006 the government has signed Memorandum of Understanding with international
financial institutions on future development strategy as well as new tariff policy and
social protection mechanism. We have taken key steps to reform the energy sector
including separation o fpolicy making and commercial operations, development o f a new
tariff policy, and revision o f the existing social protection mechanism to protect the
vulnerable groups from the tariff increases.

The Presidential Decree on separation o f Open Joint Stock Holding Company "Barqi
Tojik" from Ministry o f Energy has been signed in March 2006.                To enhance
transparency further, we will ensure that Barki Tajik and Tajik Gas adopt International
Financial Reporting Standards, implement the necessary accounting and financial
management systems in their organizations, and have their accounts audited by
internationally reputable auditors.

 Under a new tariff policy, the electricity tariffs are being increased gradually according
 to a specified schedule during 2006-2010 until they reach the cost recovery level (of 2.1
 cent per kWh for electricity at 2003 prices).     The government increased gas tariffs in
 October 2006 and again in 2007 in line with increases in prices o f gas imported from
 Uzbekistan.

 We have introduced a lifeline tariff; eliminated the privileged class o f consumers; and
 have been allocating since 2003 funds in the state budget earmarked to provide cash
 compensation to targeted consumers to meet their energy bills (electricity and gas).
 Budget allocations to compensate vulnerable groups for the increased tariffs were
 increased by 19 percent in the 2007 budget over what was spent in 2006. We will
 continue with the Energy Cash Compensation scheme until 2010, with refinements to
 improve its effectiveness. Furthermore, we will review the Social Protection mechanisms
 in 2009 with a revised Household Energy Survey to see if a revised social protection
 scheme i s warranted.

Trade and Air Transportation

To improve the air access to the country, we have taken initial steps to reform the
aviation sector. We will continue gradual move to open air policy. Since May 2005, a
China Southern Airlines started operating on Dushanbe-Urumchi-Beijingroute; Turkish
Airlines has been operating on Dushanbe-Istanbul route since end-January 2006 and have
now increased their frequencies to two flights a week.



                                             46

We have separated policy making and technical regulation responsibilities and put at
arms length by Government regulations.          Also, the Government has also adopted a
government resolution on restructuring plan o f the State Unitary Aviation Enterprise
"Tajik Air" for the legal, operational and financial separation o f the operations o f the
airport, airline and air traffic control by end 2008. Inthis context, we have undertaken a
financial review o f the separate accounts`and a comprehensive analysis o f the cost
structure o f the company's three business entities (airline, airport, and air traffic control)
and developed a realistic timetable for separation o f actual operation. We will implement
measures to strengthen capacity and the financial viability o f each separate entity. All
these actions together will ensure the more efficient operation o f the sector and
competition init.

To facilitate cross border movements o f peoples, the government has also begun to
simplify the visa regime. We eliminated the use o f Letter o f Invitation as a requirement
for obtaining a visa by citizens of OECD countries. We are adopting new rules for
issuing visas for citizens o f OECD countries upon arrival in Tajikistan. We have also
liberalized the internal visa regime to reduce transaction costs for business and to
increase flexibility in labor markets. We have also issued a decree to reduce internal
checkpoints o ftraffic police and thereby facilitating domestic trade.

We have made significant progress in actively pursuing a program o f reforms to enable
WTO accession. Inparticular, the government has reformed its custom administration
procedures and revised the customs code to make it consistent with international
standards.


   11.IMPROVINGPUBLICSECTORPERFORMANCE,PUBLIC FINANCIAL
         MANAGEMENT AND THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY

Tajikistan is country in transition to a market economy and needs to create adequate
public institutions to improve the quality o f public services, one o f our three strategic
priorities set out in the N D S and the PRS. Inthis regard, highpriority is attached to: (i)
the implementation o f the PARS; (ii)    improving resource allocation by strengthening the
link between mid-term and long-term government programs and budget planning; (iii)
improving the efficiency in budget resource allocation in the education sector; and (iv)
improving primary health care service by increasing transparency inbudget management
and increasing wages. We understand the importance o f immediate actions in Civil
Service Pay reform, strengtheninghorizontal civil service management and amending the
"Law on State Service".

Public Administration Reform

We have made good progress inimplementingthe Public Administration Reform (PAR)
strategy since its adoption on 15 March 2006. The Government has taken important
policy actions on selected key aspects of public administration and civil service reform




                                              47

that will form a basis for creating an efficient public sector, thus supporting private sector
development andimproving basic service delivery. These policy actions include:

    Introduction o f an improved civil service remuneration system in all ministries and
    agencies in 2006. This remuneration system integrates all benefits and supplements,
    except for qualification rank and seniority increment, into a single base pay with
    moderate decompression o f salaries. The Government o f Tajikistan has adopted a
    resolution, effective April 1,2007, to increase the decompression ratio to 1:4 between
    the salary o f the first deputy minister and that o f specialist. We are expecting to
    adopt a supplement budget in second half o f 2007 that will ensure that possible
    increases inwages will be consistent with decompression policies. The scope o f civil
    service is narrowed by revising the status o f auxiliary staff as that outside the civil
    service.

    Introduction o f Merit-Based Recruitment and Promotion. As o f April 2007, the
    filling o f vacant posts inthe civil service will take place in accordance with the new
    Regulation on competitive selection. We have begun developing job descriptions,
    essential for enabling merit-based selection, and initiated training o f personnel
    managers to implement this Regulation throughout the civil service.

    Creation o f a fully automated Civil Service Register, expected to be completed during
    the next few years;

    Enactment o f a new Law on State Service on March 13, 2007. The law includes
    separation of political and administrative positions, competitive selection o f
    administrative officials   -  civil servants, simplified grading structure, enhanced
    responsibilities for the civil service management by the Civil Service Department,
    andmechanisms for performance incentives;

    The capacity o f the Civil Service Department will be further enhanced through
    technical assistance available through the Public Sector Reform Project;

    Completion o f the horizontal functional review o f the central bodies o f the executive
    in January 2007 that catalogues the functions of the central government bodies;
    recommends on refining missions and the functions o f the central bodies; and
    identifies the functions to be outsourced, terminated or reallocated.        The review
    enabled the government to introduce a new government structure following the
    presidential inauguration inNovember 2006.

    Restructuring o f the central government administration through the president's decree
    6 (November 30,2006) was implementedduring December 2006-January 2007. The
    restructuring introduced a new government structure that separated the policy
    function from control and service delivery. It also reduces the number o f ministries
    and state committees directly subordinated to the government. .




                                              48

As anext step, we intendto develop a legal basis on the structure o fpublic administration
to ensure uniform implementation o f the functional separation to improve the
effectiveness o f the public administration. We recognized that legislation will establish
the core principles and norms regulating the institutional system o f public administration
and define the principles o f organization, the types o f government entities, their
hierarchical status, and the accountability arrangements.        In this context, we have
established a working group within the Executive Office o f the President to develop the
concept for the structure o f the public administration, measures for its realization, and a
time-based action plan.

Strengthening Public Financial System to Improve Governance

We have made progress inreforming the public financial management system during the
past several years. The reforms have improved functioning o f our budget and treasury
systems, thus increasing transparency and accountability o f the public sector. However,
we recognize that much remains to be done to further improve efficiency o f public
spending and thus the delivery o f public service. We are committed to strengthening
strategic budget planningby linking to sector policy priorities, modernizing budget and
treasury management, strengthening procurement and public financial internal control,
and increased independence o f external audit.

Interna1Control

    0   To improve public financial internal control systems, we adopted the Public
        Financial Internal Control Strategy adopted by the Government in March 2007.
        The strategy will support the development o f a legal and institutional framework
        and buildinggovernment audit capacity.

Public Procurement

        We have improved legislative and regulatory framework o f public procurement
        through adoption o f a law "On Public Procurement o f Goods, Works and
        Services" that is consistent with the international standards. We will gradually
        introduce the new law to decentralize public procurement agencies due to weak
        capacity o f the central and local governments. A special inter-agency committee
        will be formed to certify the capacity o f the procuring entities under the new law.
        Finally, we will introduce Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) and Implementation
        Regulations(E)to decentralized procurement unit inline ministries.

Fighting Corruption

        Recognizing the negative influence o f corruption on the quality o f public services
        and current business regulatory framework, the government is committed to
        taking serious steps to fighting corruption. A new Law on Fighting Corruption
        was adopted in 2005 and measures are being developed to fight corruption based
        on findings o f the recently completed national corruption survey conductedby the
        Strategic Research Center with the support o f UNDP. A State Financial Control



                                             49

       and Anti Corruption Agency reported directly to the President was created in
       November 2006.        It is the only government structure dealing with fighting
       corruption, which consolidated the anti-corruption functions conducted by
       numerous entities and significantly eliminated their personnel.        It will also
       increase efficiency and effectiveness inthe use o f scarce capacity in dealing with
       this very difficult task.

External Audit:

   0   The Agency on State Financial Control and Fighting Corruption, established
       based on relevant abolished agencies, aims also at providing external audit
        functions. We understand the necessity and are committed to the goal o f further
        developing external audit function based on the principles o f openness and
        independence. With this goal in view, we will study the advanced practices o f
        external audit based on which we will develop an action plan for institutional
        improvement o f the independent external audit function. Inthe nearest future we
       will create a task force to develop a vision for an independent external audit
        function and develop a legislation framework. The Government will adopt a
        strategy and action plan on establishment o f Independent External Audit Body by
        March2008 and will initiate the development o fregulatory framework o f external
        audit functions according to agreement with IDA. In this work, we will use the
        recommendations reflected in Institutional Development Plan prepared under
        Cooperation Partnership Project between the Tajikistan's state financial control
        body and the UK Supreme Audit Institution. We also hope to cooperate with the
        World Bank and other International Financial Organizations to learn more from
        the experience o f other countries inthis area.

Strategic Policies and Resource Allocation Framework

The Government has strengthened the alignment ofthe public expenditure with the policy
framework has improved. We ensured that the externally-financed Public Investment
Program (PIP) and the budget-financed Centralized Capital Investment Program (CCIP)
are aligned with the priorities and actions o f the PRS for 2007-2009 and consolidated the
PIP and CIP by creating a single Department o f Public Investments at the Ministry o f
Economic Development and Trade. We intend to further align the recurrent expenditures
with the policy framework and the PRS.

The adoption o f an MTEF will contribute to efficient resource allocation within and
across sectors. InSeptember 2006, we adopted a MTEF action planthat lays out role and
responsibilities o f ministries and agencies, activities and a timetable for preparing the
2008 budget. Due to weak capacity, we have decided to implement the MTEF on an
incremental basis beginningwith the education sector to align the education budget with
the National Strategy for Education Development (NSED).               We recognize that
implementation of the MTEF will require changes to the budget process and we are
beginning to initiate these changes in collaboration with the Ministry o f Education and
local governments. We intend to expand the MTEF to other sectors over the medium
term.


                                             50

Resource Allocation inthe Education Sector

The implementation o f an ESS that includes a specific strategy on Education Financing
(Per Capita Funding) is currently underway. Per capita funding o f general education
schools was introduced on a pilot basis in five rayons in 2005. Based on a positive
evaluation o f the original pilots, it has been expanded to seven new rayons in2007. We
have trained school and rayon administrators on financial management and to improve
the monitoring system introduced last year. This expansion will help prepare the basis
for scaling up at the national level.

We have recently commissioned a study on reforms o f the wage system. The 2007
budget includes wage increases for education workers averaging 15 percent effective
April 1, 2007. All supplements-except         class leadership and textbook correction-are
integrated into base pay effective in April 2007.          This i s a first step towards our
commitment to a remuneration and promotion system that compensates education
workers based on level o f responsibility, qualification, and performance. As an integral
element o f the wage reform in the education sector, we will improve the stavka (teacher
loads) system to ensure efficient use o f human and financial resources. The Ministryo f
Education i s expected to lunch a comprehensive study on stavka system with an objective
o f to bring them close to full-time occupation. We will also conduct a school census for
the whole country in2007 that will serve as a data and analytical base for improving the
ministry's capacity in formulation o f evidence based policy, development o f investment
plans, better resource allocation including a rationalization plan for school facilities and
for further roll out o f per capita financing.         The school census will support the
establishment o f a national education management information system (EMIS).

Health Care Reform

The government adopted the Health Financing strategy in 2004 that aims at (i)
establishment o f an institutional structure o f a single-payer for health care; (ii)
                                                                                   pooling o f
sources o fpublic funds for free health care; (iii)  development and implementation o f new
provider payment mechanisms; (iv) regulation o f informal payments inthe health system
and introduction o f formal co-payments; (iv) increasing health personnel salaries; (v)
reorganization o f the system o f health services delivery; (vi) improving equity o fresource
allocation. In order to meet the goals o f the strategy as well as guarantee access o f the
vulnerable population to basic health services, we will strengthen primary health care by
increasing resource to primary care, implementing per capita funding, reintroducing the
basic benefits package (BBP), introducing a new job classification and wage grid system
for primary health care workers, and separating funding flows and accountability
mechanisms betweenprimary and secondary care.

In an effort to retain skilled health personnel in primary care, we are committed to
allocate a greater share o f the wage bill increase for primary care workers. Effective
April 12007, we will use an asymmetric ratio o f 54:46 to allocate the health's wage bill
increase to primary and secondary care, respectively. This will result in an increase in
the wage bill for primaryhealth care by 30 percent and secondary care by 10percent. If
additional budget become available n October 2007, we intend to allocate fund to


                                              51

education, health, and culture. At that time, the allocation between PHC and non-PHC
will be decided on the basis o f the implementation o f the BBP re-introduction in4 pilot
rayons. This i s because we want to ensure that funds are available for the basic benefits
package. In the future, we hope to maximize the reallocation o f wage bill increase for
primary health care. We will initiate the reform o f a new job classification and wage
system inthe health sector.

The Government remains committed to the re-introduction o f BBP. It initiated the BBP
in summer 2005; however, the system was suspended in October 2005 due to design
flaws. To ensure fully-fundedpackage, the government will re-introduce the BBP inthe
same four pilot rayons where per capita funding i s being introduced. The BBP currently
includes free outpatient consultative visits and free primary health care visits.
Subsequently, the Government will implement the co-payments for other services including
hospital care based on the established timetable that phases the implementation o f co-
payments into two phases during 2007-08, after clarifying the structure and agreeing on
the definition o f co-payment. The Government recognizes that it will need to revise the
structure o f privileged categories-a   combination o f social groups, age, and diseases
covering about 40 percent o f the population-to      ensure fiscal sustainability. We are
conducting an evaluation o f the BBP implementation to learn from the experience prior
to implementingit oblast -wide and later nation-wide.

Finally, we will take further steps to implement financial management and accountability
measures on level o f medical facilities, both primary and secondary, improve criteria for
resource allocation (per capita funding in health) as well as complete rationalization o f
medical facilities.

Conclusion

As the above indicates, the government o f the Republic o f Tajikistan strongly committed
to undertaking necessary reforms actions to promote economic growth and improve
service delivery. Inthis context, the support o f the World Bank through approval o f the
Second Programmatic Development Policy Finance would be important to successful
implementation o f the government's reform agenda.

Mr. President, we are looking forward to cooperation with the World Bank in
implementing the above reform agenda.

Please, Excellency, accept assurances o f my highest consideration.

                    Annex 4: Relations with the InternationalMonetaryFund

The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy, endorsed by the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors on
July 26,2005, focuses on the following three priorities, which are inline with the country's PRSP:


0           T o improve business opportunities inrural and urban areas

a           To enhance and preserve the quality o f the human capital


0           To improve energy service delivery and increase electricity exports.

Inaddition, ineach ofthe above areas, the Bank Group and government agreedto work to improve
government capacity and efficiency, and reduce corruption by giving special emphasis to measures
that increase transparency o f resource use, reduce discretionary controls, and encourage the
participation o fusers inthe provision of services.

Macroeconomic management aims at establishing a stable economic environment through appropriate
fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and sustainable debt policies.      In support of these policies, the
authorities are tightening payment discipline, especially in the energy sector, hardening budget
constraints for state-owned enterprises, and pursuing enterprise and banking privatization and
restructuring.   Recent improvements in macroeconomic management have supported the current
economic recovery. However, to maintain strong growth the authorities will need to accelerate
structural reform to support private sector development and investment, and encourage foreign
investment.

The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikstan in enhancing macroeconomic stability. The
Fundhas encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation, maintain a restnctive
monetary policy, and restructure external debt to enhance debt sustainability.

   IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
                                    Republic of Tajikistan


On March 28,2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Tajikistan.'

Background

While the recent strong growth performance continued in 2006, inflation accelerated. Despite
considerable disruptions to energy supply late in the year, real GDP growth reached 7 percent,
fueled by a surge in construction activity and continuing strong remittance-financed demand for
retail services. However, CPI-inflation reached 12.7 percent, its highest level since 2003, mostly
because of failed harvests and higher gas prices, but also reflecting a relatively passive
monetary policy stance. High aluminum prices and strong growth in nontraditional exports and
workers' remittances did not translate into a commensurate improvement in the external
accounts, as higher energy prices and strong demand for consumer and capital goods led to a
surge in imports. Gross reserves remain relatively low, at the equivalent of two months of
imports.

Fiscal policy remained prudent. Reflecting strong revenue performance and cautious fiscal
management, the 2006 budget recorded a surplus, continuing the impressive fiscal performance
of the past four years. While Tajikistan's external debt profile has improved significantly-mostly
as a result of debt restructuring operations and relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

'UnderArticle IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement,the IMF holds bilateraldiscussionswith
members, usuallyevery year.A staff team visits the country,collectseconomic and financial
information,and discusseswith officialsthe country's economic developments and policies.On
returnto headquarters,the staff prepares a report,which forms the basisfor discussion by the
ExecutiveBoard. At the conclusionof the discussion,the Managing Director,as Chairman of the
Board, summarizesthe views of ExecutiveDirectors,and this summary is transmittedto the
country's authorities.

- o n current trends, total public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to increase
significantlyover the period of 2006-2009, mainly because of large project-related
disbursementsfrom China.

Progress in the structural reform area has been mixed. The authorities have been successfully
implementingtax administration and public financial management reforms. While further
headway has been made in strengtheningthe banking sector, it remains small and vulnerable,
and public disclosure requirements continue to be inadequate. In the energy sector, important
steps have been taken to align tariffs with costs; however, structural and regulatory weaknesses
continue to undermine its potential. Agricultural reforms are on going, although finding a solution
to the debt overhang in the cotton sector is still an outstanding policy issue. Enhancing growth
prospectswill also require improvingthe private investment climate. In this vein, the forthcoming
second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is expected to address some of these issues.

Executive BoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended the authoritiesfor their progress in stabilizing the economy and
their implementationof sound economic policies and structural reforms that have contributed to
high rates of economic growth. Together with debt relief and macroeconomic stability, strong
growth has led to significant progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals,
including poverty reduction. At the same time, Directorsobserved that major challenges remain.
Inflation pressures have resurfaced, debt sustainability could become a concern with rising
indebtedness,and poverty remains widespread.

Directors commended the authorities for their strong fiscal performance in 2006. They urged the
authorities to continue to implement a sound fiscal policy in 2007 and save any revenue
overperformance, particularly since inflation is on an upward trend and the debt dynamics are
worsening. Directors encouraged the authoritiesto refrain from adopting a supplementary
budget until the inflation picture improves. Directorswelcomed the significant progress achieved
in the areas of tax administration, civil service reform, and public financial management.
Nevertheless,the authorities need to address urgently remaining weaknesses in tax compliance
and the financial monitoringof state enterprises.

Directors underscoredthe importance of controlling inflation. The macroeconomic policy
framework should be buttressed not only by a strong fiscal position and a flexible exchange
rate, but also by a tighter monetary stance. In this context, the balance sheet of the central bank
needs to be placed on a firmer footing to give more flexibility and credibility to monetary policy.
Directors advised the central bank to refrainfrom providing directed credits to the agricultural
sector. Any financial resources directed to the private sector, particularly if subsidized, should
be channeled through the budget in a transparent manner.

Directors supported the current managed float exchange rate regime, which they considered
has served Tajikistan well. They encouraged the authorities to limit intervention in the foreign
exchange market to smoothing operationsand shoring up reserve coverage.

                                                    3


Directorsobserved that the authorities' development strategy, centered on financing essential
infrastructure investmentsthrough large and rapidly disbursing project loans at concessional
interest rates, could entail risks to debt sustainability in the longer term if the expected
concomitant acceleration in growth does not materialize. In addition, many Directors cautioned
that the rapid debt accumulation could place additional pressure on the budget, as significant
counterpart funds would be needed, which could reduce resources available for other priority
sectors and affect macroeconomicperformance. Against that background, Directors welcomed
the authorities' intention to put in place a debt management strategy that will prevent public debt
from exceeding 60 percent of GDP.

Directors considered that the authorities' medium-term growth objectives are ambitious but
achievable. Reaching these goals will require determination on the part of the government to
address long-standing policy issues in the agricultural and energy sectors, intensify efforts to
improve the private investment climate, promote the channeling of the large volume of private
remittances to the most productive uses, and enhance the governance framework for state-
owned enterprises. Directorswelcomed the authorities' intention to focus the second poverty
reduction strategy paper on efforts to improve the private investment climate and move forward
with the public sector reform program.

Directorswelcomed the authorities' commitmentto continue with the reforms of core
macroeconomic institutions. They looked forward to even closer cooperation and discussion
between the authorities and the staff in the period ahead, with a view to the design of a program
that could elicit Fund support.

             Annex 7: Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (Summary)
    Tajikistan: Joint Fund-World BankExternal Debt SustainabilityAnalysis(March 2007)

                                     DEBTSUSTAINABILITY          ANALYSIS

This DSA updates theprevious DSAprepared in early 2006 (see EBS/06/10). Since then, Tajikistan
has received debt relieffrom the IMF under MDRI(SDR69.3 million), and also contracted US$604
million of debtfrom China tofinance projects in infrastructure and energy sector. I n addition the
government of Tajikistan intends to contract US$400 million of debtfrom China to build a
hydroelectricpower station. Therefore, despite the MDRIrelieJ debt distress risk has increased
significantly and could be now classijied as high. Under the baseline scenario, the ratios of NPV of
debt to GDP, exports, and revenue breach theirpolicy-dependent thresholds in the medium term, but
improve over time. Theratio of NPV of debt to exports, however, isprojected to remain above the
threshold throughout theprojectedperiod. Thebreach of the thresholds is moresevere under stress
tests reflecting potential macroeconomic shocks, and signijicant additional borrowing. Theratiosfor
debt servicepayments to exports and revenue are expected to remain below the thresholds under the
baseline scenario. However, under stress tests and alternative scenarios, these ratios would also
breach the thresholds.

                                        DATA   AND METHODOLOGY'

1.       The DSA focuses mainly on externalpublic andpublicly guaranteed(PUBLICAND
PUBLICLY-GUARANTEED DEBT)debt. Government and government guaranteeddebt includes
debt directly contracted or guaranteedbythe government: and partially includes public sector
nonguaranteed debt.3 To the extent that the information on the stock o fprivate debt i s available from
the authorities (in2005 the NBT started compiling inventory o f external private sector debt not
guaranteed by the government), it i s incorporated into the DSA. As for domestic debt, domestic
securitized public debt stands at $53 million and consists of government securities inthe amount o f
$47 million heldby the NBT and government guarantees to finance cotton sector inthe amount of
$7 milli~n.~present, given its small size, incorporatingdomestic debt into the analysis will not
              At

1 This D S A was conducted jointly by Fund and World Bank staff and in collaboration with the authorities,
using the debt sustainability framework for low income countries. It has benefited from Fund and Bank staff
consultations with the ministry o f finance during missions to Dushanbe in October-November 2006 and
January 2007, and included a full reconciliation o f debt data. The Low-Income Countries (LICs) D S A uses (a)
the current year exports as denominators for estimating debt-to-exports ratio; (b) the WE0 exchange rate
projections for estimating debt stocks and debt service; and (c) a 5 percent discount rate.
2Tajikistan has some "disputed" government guaranteed debt from the period prior to 1998, when guarantees
were issuedinad hoc manner; the estimated amount o f guarantees is about $50 million. In 1999, the issuance o f
guarantees was centralized at the MoF. The disputed guarantees were not included inthe D S A given that exact
terms, conditions, and government repayment obligations were not known at the time o f this analysis. However,
even if these guarantees were recognized as valid, given the small amount involved (about 6 percent of total
public and publicly guaranteed debt at end-2006), including them in the D S A would not change the main
results.
3Coverage o f public sector nonguaranteed debt is limited to debt on which debt service is likely to be assumed
bythe government.

  However, given the large size o f government deposits at the NBT, the NBT remains a net debtor the
government.

materially affect the results o f the DSA. However, inthe future the evolution o fpublic domestic debt
will needto be monitored closely with the view to incorporating it into the DSA.

                               11.       Tajikistan's External Debt Situation

  2.       Tajikistan hascontinuedto meet its externalpublic and publicly guaranteed debt
  obligationson a timely basis andto seek relieffromits creditors. Since a large share o floanshas
  been provided on a consessional basis, debt service obligations remain manageable. In2006,
  Tajikistan obtained rescheduling o f debt from Iran-no         debt service payments are expected until
  2008 on US$25 million loan, and maturity i s extended by two years to 9 years-and            Uzbekistan-
  US$8 million o f debt service payment in2006 and 2007 are rescheduled to 2008.

  3.       Debt relief under MDRIand contractingof loansfrom China were two major
  developments in2006 that affectedthe external debt situationinTajikistan. InJanuary 2006,
  Tajikistan qualified for debt relieffrom the IMFunder MDRIand was granted debt reliefamounting
  to SDR 69.3 million (US$lOO milli~n).~       Following debt relief, however, Tajikistan contracted debt
  from China inthe amount o f US$604 million to finance projects ininfrastructure and energy sector.6
  While the debt was granted on concessional terms with 40 percent grant element, its size (25 percent
  o f 2006 GDP) and uncertainty regarding economic impact o fthe projects increased risks to debt
  ~ustainability~.However, with no disbursement on loans from China in 2006 nominal public and
  publicly-guaranteed debt debt-to-GDP ratio continuedto decline, reaching 31percent at the end o f
  the year mainly on account o f strong GDP growth.

  4.       In2007, the contractingof an additionalUS$400 million of debt from China is
  expected to increase the risk of debt problemsinthe medium-term. The authorities have
  indicatedthat they are pursuingadditional financing from China for construction of new
  hydropower plants. While concessional terms are expected, the exact details o f the financing
  agreement have not been worked out yet. Regardless o f the terms, the rapid accumulation o f debt
  will further increase risks to debt sustainability (see the baseline scenario). It i s estimatedthat
  following the disbursement o f loans from China, nominal PUBLIC AND PUBLICLY-
  GUARANTEEDDEBTdebt-to-GDP ratio will increase to 57 percent o fGDPby2009, or by 26
  percent inthree years, remaining, however, below its 2000 level o f 96 percent.

  5.       Potentialbail out of cottonsector by the governmentposes additionalriskto debt
  sustainability.Political pressure has beenbuildingup to provide financing to agriculture (cotton
  sector), as reflectedinthe recent decision by the NBT to contract US$lO million debt for on-lending
  to agriculture. By various estimates the debt accumulated by the cotton sector ranges between
  U S 9 0 and US$300 million. While the resolution o fthe debt issue has been on the agenda o f the
  government, no clear cut solutionhas yet emerged. Given that the Government assigns highsocial
  importanceto the cotton sector, there i s a probability that the Government will assume the debt, at

5 Debt relief was granted on the basis that Tajikistan's income per capita was below US$380 in 2004. Under
MDRI,Tajikistan was provideddebtrelief onstock o foutstanding debt as ofend-2004.
6 $281.2 million loan was contracted by the government to finance the construction of the road connecting
Dushanbe and the northern part o f Tajikistan. Two loans-US$267.2      million for construction o f a North-South
electricity transmission line and US$58.1 million for construction of Lolazor-Khatlon electricity transmission
lines-were    contracted for on-lending to BarkiTajik, which is expected to service the debt.
7 While preliminary indications are that the projects will increase Tajikistan's export potential, a thorough
analysis to assess the economic impact o f the projects has not been undertaken yet.

  least partially, or will subsidize future lending to the sector. This D S A tests the worst case scenario
 under which the government assumes 100percent o f cotton sector debt under the assumption that
  the total amount o f debt will be equal to $300 million.'

                                           111.      Baseline Scenario

  6.       The baseline scenario, developed on a cautious set of assumptions about economic
  policies and outcomes (Box l), that Tajikistan's debt i s sustainable, but is at a high risk
                                       shows
  of debt distress. According to the latest three-year average World Bank's CPIA rating, Tajilustan's
  policies and institutionsare assessedas those corresponding to a "poor performer."' The debt-
  burdenthresholds for countries inthis category are: (a) NPV o f debt-to-exports o f goods and
  services o f 100percent; (b)NPV o f debt-to-GDP o f 30 percent; and (c) NPV o f debt-to-fiscal
  revenue o f 200 percent. The relevant debt service thresholds are: (a) 15 percent o f exports o f goods
  and services; and (b) 25 percent o frevenues.


                                   Box 1. Tajikistan: Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP i s projected to grow at about 8 percent per year until2011, and at 6.5 percent between 2012 and 2026.
This figure is slightly above its ten-year historicalaverage o f 6.1 percent, but well below its latest five-year (post-
Russian crisis) average o f 9.4 percent. Growth i s driven by exports, FDI, and expanding nontraditional sectors
(services, textile, and non-cotton agriculture), as well as continued inflows o f remittances.
Export of goods and services i s projected to grow at a rate o f 10percent through 2012, reflecting expansion in
nontraditional sectors and strong external demand, and at 7 percent thereafter as economy will be expanding
following investment inthe energy sector and inresponse to stable macroeconomic environment andprogress with
structural reforms.

The current account i s expected to sharply deteriorate in2007-2009 (to -15.3 percent o f GDP in2008) due to an
increase inimports financed by loans from China, but will improve in2010 following the completion o f the projects.
Thereafter, the current account deficit, excluding loans from China is expected to remain at about 4 percent as
imports and exports are expected to grow at the same pace and financing will be constrained to official financing on
consessional terms and stable FDIinflows. The net foreign transfer inflows (driven by remittances), assumed to
remain strong, will decline from 36 to 20 percent o f GDP from 2006 to 2026 as the economy picks up. The reserve
coverage o f imports is projected to buildup gradually to 3 months o f imports by 2026.
The fiscal stance continues to be prudent. During2006-2010, revenues excluding grants will increase from 19.3 to
19.5 percent o f GDP, and further to 21 percent by 2026. Expenditure, excluding foreign financed PIP, will increase at
the same pace leaving fiscal deficit, excluding foreign-financed PIP and MDFUrelated spending, broadly unchanged.

Official external loan financing (on consessional terms) i s projected to peak at 15.4 percent o f GDP in2008 and
then decline to 4 percent by 2010 and remain at that level thereafter. fter 2012, the D S A assumes that no new grants
will be disbursed duringthe projected period.



  Although this is an unlikely scenario, this could also be a proxy for a stress test for additional consessional
lending. There are indications that the authorities could continue to pursue additional significant project
financing from China and other donors.
  Three-year average o f CPIA ratings is used according to recently issuedguidelines on D S A for LIC
(SMi061364). These guidelines aim at a more conservative and less volatile assessment o f risk than that based
on a single latest CPIA rating. For Tajikistan, however, the use o f the latest CPIA ratings would not change the
assessment o f risk inthis DSA. Indeed, according to the latest 2005 CPIA rating, Tajikistan i s placed into a
"medium performer" category implyinghigher policy dependent thresholds. However, even these thresholds are
breached inthe medium term--albeit by a smaller margin--pointing to increased risk to debt sustainability.



                                                         90

 7.        Under the baseline scenario, three of Tajikistan's external debt burden indicatorsare
 projectedto breach policy-dependent thresholds following the rapid disbursement of loans
 from China (Table 1and Figure 1). Inparticular, by 2009 the NPV of debt-to-exports of goods
 and services ratio will reach 186 percent, exceeding the threshold o f 100percent by a significant
 margin. The NPV of debt-to-GDP will be at 44 percent, also significantly exceeding the 30 percent
 threshold, and NPV o f debt-to-revenue will reach 227 percent exceeding the 200 percent threshold
 as well. By 2026, however, these ratios are expected to decline to 136,23, and 107 percent,
 respectively. The NPV o fdebt-to-export ratio, however, while on a declining path, will remain
 above its threshold over the years, underscoring the importance o f implementingthe relevant
 structural reforms targeted at increasing the GDP and export potential o f Tajilustan.''

 8.        External debt service ratios are expectedto stay below their thresholds over the entire
 period. Duringthe projectedperiod, debt service payments continue to be manageable, with the
 assumption that all o fTajikistan's external public and publicly guaranteed debt has been contracted
 on consessional terms, albeit spikingduring the years when principal payments on loans from China
 fall due. Inparticular, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would remain comfortably below 25
 percent, peaking in2014 at 17 percent and declining thereafter to 11percent. The debt service-to-
 export ratio will peak at 14percent, slightly below the 15 percent threshold, but then decline to 6
 percent.

                              IV.      Alternative Scenarios and Bound Tests

 9.        The historicalscenario is based on averages from 1998 to 2005, and thus reflects a
 period of macroeconomic consolidation, some progresswith structuralreforms, and debt
 reduction." During 1998-2005, the current account deficit was relatively small as financing was
 limited, and growthwas highas the economy was growing from a low level. Therefore, under this
 scenario, not only do all debt burdenratios remain well below the threshold indicators, they also
 follow a downward trend throughout the projectionperiod. While the scenario illustrates the
 importance o f preservingmacroeconomic stability, progress with structural reforms and continued
 prudent debt management, the scenario i s not very useful as a benchmark against which the current
 debt situation can be assessedbecause both the conditions o fthe economy and its external
 environmenthave changed dramatically.

  10.      A scenario incorporatingadditionalUS$300million borrowing on consessional terms
 in2007 to bail out the cotton sector shows increasedriskof debt distress compared to the
 baseline scenario. Inparticular, all ratios, except debt service-to-revenue will breach their
 respective thresholds. The ratios o f NPV o f debt to GDP, exports, and revenue follow the baseline
 pattern, but exceed the thresholds sooner and by a higher margin compared to the baseline scenario.
 The ratio o f debt service-to-exports breaches its 15 percent threshold in2012-13, but then declines
 bythe end o fthe projectionperiod (Table 2 andFigure 1).




10 Substantially lower than projected net foreign transfer inflows in the outer years (for example, due to a
deteriorating regional economic situation) would likely lower imports, exports, and real GDP growth, with a
possibility o f the NPV o f debt-to-export ratio marginally exceeding its policy-relevant threshold inthose years.
11The 1995-97 period has been excluded from historical average scenario due to disruptions from civil war.
The average values for the 1998-2005 period are caiculated for current account deficit, real GDP growth, GDP
deflator in$ terms, export growth, net transfers and FDIto GDP ratios.

 11.      A high-investment low-growth scenario underscores the riskto debt sustainabilityof
 the current debt-based development strategy. Rapid accumulation o f debt together with
 uncertainty regardingthe impact o f investments financed by China on growth tests the robustness o f
 the conclusions of the baseline scenario. This alternative scenario shows that if growth were to
 come at halfthe rate forecast by the authorities, all ratios, except for debt service-to-revenue, will
 breach andremain above or very close to their respective thresholds. Moreover, the ratio o f NPV o f
 debt-to-export increases and becomes unsustainable (Table 3 and Figure1).

 12.      A relaxationof the authorities' current prudent approach to contracting external debt
 only on consessionalterms would lead to a deterioration of Tajikistan's external debt
 indicators compared to the baseline scenario. Ifall new borrowing were to be contracted on less
 than consessional terms duringthe projectionperiod, Tajikistan's NPV debt-to-GDP ratio would rise
 substantially. Specifically, with the increase inthe average interest rate on new disbursements by 2
 percentagepoints, the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 50 percent by 2009 and slowly
 decline afterwards to 34 percent by 2026 remaining above 30 percent threshold throughout the
 projectedperiod. The ratios o fNPV o f debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports would also rise
 to 215 and 19percent, respectively, and remain above their thresholds at a roughly steady level
 duringthe projected period. The NPV of debt-to revenue ratio will peak at 261 percent in2009, but
 then decline to 162 percent at the end o fthe projectedperiod (Table 4 and Figure 1).

  13.     Bound tests show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would also have a profound
 negative impact on Tajikistan's external position. Inthe event o f a combined shock (to real GDP
 growth, exports growth, FDIinflows), all ratios would exceed the policy-dependent thresholds by a
 significant margin. Inparticular, Tajilustan's NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 109 percent
 by 2009, falling below the policy-dependent threshold o f 30 percent only by 2026. The same shock
 would also significantly worsen the NF'V o f debt-to-revenues ratio, which would jump to 565
 percent in2009 and stay above the threshold o f200 percent until2022.         l2 The ratios of the NPV of
 debt-to exports and debt service-to-exports would increase to 531and 44 percent, respectively, and
 while on a declining path, would remain above the thresholds throughout the projectedperiod. Debt
 service-to-revenue ratio would also exceed the threshold between 2013 and 2022, but would decline
 below the threshold after 2022.

                                             V.     Conclusions

  14.     Tajikistan's risk of debt distress hasincreased significantly and hasbecome high. The
 results o fthe alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that the debt sustainability situation could
 further deteriorate with negative macroeconomic shocks, borrowing on nonconsessional terms or
 incurring extra debt-even on concessional terms-in          an attempt to bail out the agricultural sector,
 and could become unsustainable if growth associated with large prospective investment does not
 materialize. The D S A results thus underscore the need for the authorities to exercise extreme
 caution inincurring extra debt and vetting projects, malung sure that external resources are used
 productively. Sound macroeconomic policies and the acceleration o f structural reforms, especially
 inthe agriculturalandelectricity sectors, would alsobe essential for maintainingdebt sustainability.
 Bycontributingto higher export and output growth, these measures would reduce Tajikistan's
 vulnerability to exogenous shocks.



l2 Since Tajikistan i s a small open economy with a high share of exports-to-GDP, the debt-to-revenue indicator
is an important measure of debt vulnerabilities.
