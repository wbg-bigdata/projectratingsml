INTERNATIONAL. BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$2.0 million to
Jamaica for a population project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the first made by the Bank Group in
the field of population planning. A Bank economic mission, which visited
Jamaica in mid-1968, noted that the Government was firmly committed to a
policy of slowing down the growth of population and was looking for ways
and means of making the national family planning program more effective.
Towards the end of 1968, the Government requested the Bank to organize a
mission that would review the existing family planning program and consider
the possibility of Bank assistance for its improvement. A Bank review
mission, which visited Jamaica in January/February 1969, identified a
project which might be suitable for Bank financing. After further discus-
sions, the project was defined more precisely, and the Bank assisted the
Government in preparing a detailed proposal which was submitted to the Bank
in November 1969 for appraisal. A Bank appraisal mission visited Jamaica
in December 1969.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held from Nby 5 to 9,
1970. The Government of Jamaica representatives at these negotiations
were headed by Mr. Horace Barber, Deputy Financial Secretary, Ministry
of Finance and Planning, and included IMr. Albert Mowatt, Principal
Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Health, Dr. Leslie Williams, Senior
Medical Officer, itnistry of Health and iYr. D. Marsh, Senior Counsel,
Attorney-General's Office.
4.        The proposed loan, the sixth to Jaa ca,   would increase the
Bank's total lending (net of cancellationsW) to US$44 million.   No IDA
credits have been made to Jamaica. The following is a summary of Bank
IJ A telecommunication loan (No. 481-JM) made in 1967 to the
Jamaica Telephone Company was cancelled by the Borrower in 1967, follow-
ing a change in the ownership of the majority equity holding in the
Company. About $13,000 withdrawn under the loan was prepaid in full.

Total undisbursed                                 16.2
5.        The highway project was set back by over two years because of
an initial delay in the selection of consultants and a significant increase
in the estimated costs, on the basis of which a reduction in the scope
of the project was agreed to with the approval of the Executive Directors
in August 1968.  Contracts for the reduced project, based on new bids, were
awarded in July 1969. Since then, construction work has been proceeding
satisfactorily. Although the education project is expected to be completed
on schedule by mid-1971, the Government has not been submitting withdrawal
applications promptly, and this explains the rather large undisbursed loan
amount. The matter has recently been discussed in Jamaica and no further
delays are anticipated. On the water supply project, same major bids have
been received recently, and with the placement of orders in the near future,
disbursements are expected to commence later this year.
6.        A number of new projects are in various stages of preparation
and consideration. The field appraisal of a second education project has
just been completed, and an appraisal report is being prepared. An
agricultural credit project, prepared under the FAO-IBIiD Cooperative
Program, will be appraised in mid-June. Proposals for a sewerage
project, and for financing industry and tourism through a Government-



-3-
owned development bank, are both under preparation. The Government has
also expressed interest in obtaining Bank financing for urban develop-
ment, and a reconnaissance/identification mission is visiting Jamaica
in early June to discuss plans for the further development of the city
of Kingston which contains one of the worst slum areas in the Caribbean.
The Government has approached the Bank also for future assistance toward
financing additional highways and possibly airports.
7.        IFC has so far made two investments totalling US$3.14 million
in a hotel (Pegasus Hotel) and a cement manufacturing project.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.        Borrower:                  Jamaica
Amount:                    US$2.0 million
Purpose:                   To finance the foreign exchange
component of facilities related
to the family planning program,
consultancy services, technical
assistance and interest and other
charges during constraction.
Amortization:              20 years, including a 5-year
period of grace; amortization
in semi-annual installments
beginning July 1, 1975 and
ending January 1, 1990.
Interest Rate:             7 percent per annum
Commitment Charge:         3/4 of 1 percent per annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Population
Project, Jamaica" (PP-2a) is attached.
10.       The purpose of the proposed project is to help women who might
wish to limit the size of their famnilies by avoiding unwanted births.
The project is designed to strengthen one of the basic planks of Jamaica's



program of reducing its population growth rate, namely, to incline
child-bearing women towards family planning during the post-partum
period. After mothers have delivered, or undergone surgery for mater-
nity purposes, they are especially receptive to information about family
planning programs, which can be given in groups or individually, and
relatively inexpensively, in the delivery hospitals themselves, So long
as they have confidence in the hospital personnel, the time is ideal to
expose them to family planning. The fact that in Jamaica close to one-
fourth of all births take place in one single hospital in Kingston, the
Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH), makes the post-partum approach particu-
larly attractive. The same approach, through the creation of adequate
maternity centers, is also proposed for rural areas. Besides expanding
the maternity facilities for post-partum information purposes, the project
aims at strengthening the organization and management components of the
country's national family planning program and for periodically evaluating
its effectiveness by groups of qualified specialists.
11.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) construction and equipment at the VJH of a new 150-bed
wing, including delivery suite with 33 labor and delivery
units and space for midwifery training, and remodelling
of the present structure;
(b) construction and equipment of ten rural maternity centers
(R1lCs ), each with an initial capacity of four to eight
beds;
(c) consultancy services for the design and supervision of
construction, for designing training programs for family
planning personnel and for an annual evaluation of the
national program's effectiveness; and
(d) studies for determining arrangements for an optimum use
of health clinics in the Kingston Rhetropolitan Area for
family planning purposes and for the most economic
utilization of medical, para-medical and non-medical
personnel in family planning clinics.
12.       The cost of the project, excluding interest and other charges
during construction, is estimated at approximately US$3.0 million.
W4ith the minor exceptions noted in the following paragraph, the pro-
posed loan of US$2.0 million would cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost of civil works, equipment and furniture, consultaney services and
technical assistance, as well as interest and other charges during
construction on the proposed Bank loan.



13.       Contracts for civil works and equipment and furniture would
be let on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bids would
be invited in packages likely to encourage both international and local
bids, particularly for civil works. The small civil works contracts
for PRqCs are expected to be awarded to local contractors, while the civil
works contract for the VJH is likely to arouse wide-spread international
interest. Should the civil works contract for the VJH, nevertheless, be
awarded to a local contractor, the foreign exchange component would be
slightly reduced and the loan, as a result, would cover a nominal amount
of local costs not exceeding US$120,000. At the Government's request, a
preference of up to 15 percent (or the existing import duties, if lower)
is proposed for evaluating bids from local manufacturers of furniture and
equipment.  The total value of this project component is roughly US$320,000,
and a small amount of local costs might be financed under the loan if
Jamaican manufacturers should succeed in winning some of the orders. This
amount is unlikely to exceed US$25,000 even if as much as one-third of
orders are placed on local manufacturers, as the import component of such
manufacture is very high. About US$50,000 has been provided in the pro-
posed loan for the studies and for a consultant as a Training Adviser of
the NFPB. Should the Government succeed in obtaining funds for the
studies on a grant basis from USAID and in engaging a Jamaican consultant
as the Training Adviser, the Bank financing would not be utilized.
14.       The Government has been concerned that rapid population growth
has been impeding other aspects of social and economic development,
combined lith the fact that this growth is taking place in a densely
populated economy with a high level of unemployment, considerable rural
under-employment and limited possibilities of creating new jobs in
industry or agriculture at any foreseeable time in the future. The
availability of land suitable for intensive agricultural development is
extremely limited, and the exploitation of other natural resources (notably
bauxite and tourist attractions) offers no more than moderate scope for
additional employment, requiring, moreover, large inputs of capital.
Furthermore, the general level of education and training amongst the
present population is still far short of what would be needed to offer
Jamaica much of a comparative advantage in manufacturing. These factors
gave a strong impetus to the Government of Jamaica's decision to support
a voluntary national family planning program.
15.       The project would be carried out as part of the Government's
family planning program for the whole country. This would be implemented
by a statutory authority, the National Family Planning Board (NFPB),
which would be reconstituted for the purpose,, The Government has dis-
cussed in detail with the Bank the draft of the statute establishing
the new NFPB with adequate powers and responsibilities. The Chief



- 6 -
Executive Officer of the NFPB, who will be a person of proven adminis-
trative and organizational ability, and preferably with suitable back-
ground and experience in health administration and family planning,
will be responsible for the execution of the policy and programs of
NFPB. He will be a member (director) of the Board and might also be
its chairman. The establishment of NFPB on these lines and the appoint-
ment of a suitable individual as its Chief Executive Officer are condi-
tions of making the proposed loan effective. The Government has cove-
nanted to provide not only local funds and any cost overruns for the
proposed project, but also adequate financing from the annual budget
towards NFPB's recurrent expenditures. By 1975,the annual recurrent
expenditure on the national program is likely to be in the region of
US$1.5 million, as against a figure of about US$0.5 million at the
present time.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIDJTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       The following provisions of the draft Loan Agreement are of
special interest:
(a) Section 5.02 contains the Borrower's undertakings
to establish a National Family Planning Board
meeting the criteria set forth in Schedule 5 and
to provide adequate funds and other resources for
the programs developed by the NFPB and approved
by the Borrower;
(b) Section 5.04 provides that the Borrower will cause
the NFPB, as part of its efforts to seek family
planning acceptors, to undertake programs of post-
partum motivation at the VJH and the RMCs and a
program of personal encouragement visits to other
potential acceptors in Jamaica.
PART V - THE ECONOI4Y
18.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Jamaica", (No. WH-187a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 26, 1968.  The report concluded that, on the whole,
the performance of the economy had been satisfactory and that the outlook



- 7 -
for further growth was quite favorable. With the expected continu-
ance of sound economic and fiscal policies and a more active govern-
ment role in fostering agriculture and dealing with the high rate of
population growth, Jamacia should be considered creditworthy for further
external borrowing on conventional terms.
19.       The economy has continued to demonstrate a high degree of
vitality in the last two years. Following a slowdown in 1967, a vigor-
ous recovery began in mid-1968 mainly as a result of substantial invest-
ments in bauxite, manufacturing and tourism. GDP in real terms in 1968
and 1969 expanded at probably close to 6 percent a year, while gross
investments rose to 28 percent of GDP. Public investments accounted
for about one-fifth of the total. However, despite these investments,
prospects for reducing the rather high level of unemployment and the
absorption of underemployed agricultural labor are very limited, par-
ticularly in view of the large numbers in the younger age groups who
will enter the labor market during the next ten to fifteen years.
20.       The economic report drew special attention to the virtual
stagnation of the agricultural sector in recent years. A severe drought
affected agriculture from 1967 through early 1969. By 1968, agriculture's
share in GDP had declined to about 9 percent from 13 percent in 1963/64.
By the end of the 1960's, the output of sugar, Jamaica's leading agricul-
tural crop and agricultural export commodity, was the lowest in almost
a decade. Apart from the effects of the drought, this industry was
affected by a controversy with sugar producers on the type and schedule
of mechanization which should be introduced to increase efficiency. A
recent agreement between the Government, the producers and labor should
now contribute to some revival of the industry. While Jamaica has been
making efforts to raise the quality and productivity of its second major
agricultural commodity, bananas, the export marketing arrangement was
terminated towards the end of 1969 by the sole exporter of Jamaican
bananas. Temporary marketing measures were instituted recently. The
Government has now taken an increased interest in strengthening agricul-
ture outside of traditional sugar and bananas. It has asked both the
Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank to assist in providing
credit to commercially viable farmers, and credit projects prepared for
this purpose are likely to be appraised shortly.
21.       Fiscal performance on the whole has been good, with public
savings continuing at a relatively high level. Current revenues have
risen at an average annual rate of over 10 percent since the mid-1960's
and are now equal to about 20 percent of GDP, while current expenditure
increases have been relatively restrained. However, in good part because
of low salary levels, capable administrators and technicians have been
moving from the public to the rapidly growing private sectors, creating
problems for effective public administration.



- 8 -
22.       The balance of payments has remained strong. Exports of
bauxite and increasingly of alumina, as well as tourism, have more
than offset the sluggish performance of agricultural exports. Rising
export earnings, jointly with large private capital inflows associated
with investments in bauxite and tourism, have made it possible to main-
tain high levels of imports, and to build international reserves to the
record high of US$171 million by the end of March 1970. Debt service
payments on Jamaica's presently outstanding external public debt are
scheduled to increase from about US$15 million a year at the end of
the 1960's to around US$20 million a year by the mid-1970's, and to
decline thereafter. Even after allowing for the effects of likely new
borrowings, they are not expected to amount to more than 6-7 percent
of the projected current account earnings in the foreseeable future.
PART VI - COPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOIMENDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
