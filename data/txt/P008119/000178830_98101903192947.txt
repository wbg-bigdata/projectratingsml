APPRAISAL OF FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        The proposed loan (two stages) of US$25.6 million would support a
Fourth Livestock Development Project financed by the Bank and would continue
technical and financial assistance for Uruguay's national program of live-
stock development for a two-year period. The first :.oan of US$7.0 million
was made in 1959 (245-UR). Subsequent loans were made of US$12.7 million
(1965 -- 407-UR), and US$6.3 million (1970 -- 698-UR), the latter being
supplemented by US$4.0 million in June 1971 (773-UR).
ii.       A new technology of pasture improvement was introduced through
the first two loans. Despite good technical progresE, 'however, a broad
sector impact was not realized because of adverse government policies
affecting pricing, credit, processing, and marketing.
iii.      Since June 1969, the Bank and the Governmert of Uruguay have
pursued a dialogue on livestock sector policy improvements and reorganiza-
tion of Project on-lending arrangements. During this period, the Govern-
ment took a series of difficult policy decisions which, supported by a
rise in export prices, brought a record demand for credit in 1971. These
decisions led to more efficient operation of packing plants, improved
meat inspection and hygiene control, tax and pricing measures to encourage
exports and restrain domestic consumption, and a broadening of the banking
base for channelling development credit to the livestock sector.
{v.       The results have been impressive.  Meat exports in 1970 reached
145,000 m tons worth a record US$88 million, compared to exports of
69,000 m tons valued at US$27 million in 1961. Meat processors invested
some US$8 million in modernizing 15 plants in 1969 and 1970. Since the
livestock sector contributes approximately 85% of Uruguay's exports and
30% to GNP, maintenance of sound sector policies and provision of adequate
investment incentives should contribute greatly to continued real growth
in the economy.
v.        The proposed Project would continue Bank su:3port for on-farm
development, pasture seed production and processing, as well as technical
services to ranchers and meat and dairy processors. A new feature would
be to support pig (for local consumption) and dairy beef (for export)
producers and also provision for financing heifer purchase and retention
on ranches. Project funds woulad continue to be channc2ll1d to farmers
through participating banks from the Livestock Fund administered by the
Central Bank.
vi.       All development loans to Project ranchérs would be based
on technically sound and financially viable ranch devclonment plans. About
3,600 farmers would receive loans each year averaging about U'S$3,600 per



- ii -
loan. All Uivestock farmers would be eligible to bcrrow under the Project
and participating farms would range in size from. 30 ha for pigs, to 4,000 ha
for beef catt:Le and sheep production. The average borrower would have a
holding of approximately 670 ha. As in Loan 698-UR subloans would be indexel!
tc cover possible future inflation. Overall Project administration would
continue to be handled by the Plan Agropecuario whose competent technicians
would assist ranchers ir. preparing their plans. The Bank's loan disburse-
ments amounted to US$9.2 million for calendar year 1971.
vii.      International competitive bidding would be used for the bulk
procurement of pasture seeds, fertilizer and machinery for seed producers.
Normal coimercial channels would be used for the purchase of other inputs
such as fencing, water point materials, and building supplies.  These
procedures would be the same as under the previous two loans.
viii.     The econonic rate of return on the investment in this Project
is estimated to be 37%2, while the financial rate of return to participating
farmers varies from 13% to 30%, depending on the type of farm.  At full
development, after seven years, the investments are likely to result in
an incremental beef production of 49,000 m tons, valued at US$34 million
annually on the export market.
ix.       Total Project cost is estimated at US$56 million, of which 46%
would be met by the Bank, 7% by Government, 13% by the Central Bank, 18% by
participating banks, and 16% oy farmers. The Project is suitable for a loan
of US$25.6 million, the estimated foreign exchange component. For country
reasons, Barnk finance would be provided in two stages: a first loan of
US$11.2 million would be made in FY 72 to cover the first year program; a
second loan of US$14.4 million would be made ir. FY 73. Both loans would be
based on thi4s appraisal report. However, there would be an updating of
information contained in this report prior to submitting the second loan to
the Board.  The bor-ower would be the Governuient of Uruguay, which would bear
the foreign exchange risk. The loan term would be 14 years, including a
4-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Uruguay has applied for a Bank loan to assist in financing the
Fourth Project of its livestock development program with which the Bank
has been closely associated for more than 20 years. In 1950 a joint FAO-Bank
mission advised the Government on a pilot scheme _o test new pasture
improvement techniques. These experiments, carried out on about 120,000
ha belonging to various commercial ranches, proved successful and laid the
foundation for the subsequent Bank livestock lending program. In 1959,
the First Loan of US$7 million (245-UR) was grantad; six years later, in
1965, a Second Loan of US$12.7 million (407-UR) was approved. In 1970, a
Third Loan for US$6.3 million (698-UR) was signed and was supplemented in June
1971 by US$4 million (773-UR).
1.02      A Bank appraisal mission to Uruguay in June 1969 reviewed in
depth the impact of previous lending and concluded that an excellent tech.nical
base had been established. It found, however, that a number of sector policy
improvements (marketing, processing, pricing, tax, meat hygiene and credit)
would be required if this base was to be broadened into a national livestock
development program. Many of the changes recommeended by the mission were
carried out and the stimulus given to the Livestock sector contributed much
to the growth of the economy in 1969 and 1970.
1.03      Since mid-1970, Uruguay's livestock industrv has been making
rapid progress. Subloans under the Plan Agropecuatrio (PLAN) program in
1971 have been nearly triple (US$11 million) the average rate of lending
in recent years of about US$4 million. The raeat processing industry
invested 3S$8 million in 1969 and 1970 for modern:zazion and intends to
keep up the pace with the assistance of an Inter-t.merican Development Bank
loan of US$13.7 million, signed in March 197i. 1, A high rate of invest-
ment in t'he vital livestock sector must be sustained if it is to develop
and contribute effectively to the country's economic growth.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a June 1971 appraisal
mission, comprising Messrs. A. Schumacher and E.P. Schertz (Bank), and
E.A. Clarke and J. Romero (Consultants).
1/   Other international and bilateral aid ag;encies continue to be active
in support of Uruguav's agricultural developrent. By 1971 these
operations had amounted to a total of USS71.9 million. A breakdowrn
of the principal aid agencies and operations is given in Annex 1,
Table 6.

II. BAC(IGROUND
A. Agriculture and Livestock in the Economy
2.01      Agriculture contributes, directly and indirectly, about 30% to
Uruguay's GNP and employs 19% (191,000) of the total labor force. Exports
of livestock products (US$191 million in 1970) account for about 85% of
export earnings.  Crop production contributes only 25% as much as livestock
to GNP and most crops - wheat, rice, sorghum, fruits, and vegetables - are
growa to supply local needs only. Livestock production from grass is the
mainstay of the agriculture sector.  Uruguay has a marked comparative
advantage in the production of beef cattle, sheep and milk.  Expansion of
wool production and dairying is difficult due to limited international
prospects for these two products. Government has therefore concentrated on
measures to increase beef production for export. The possibilities for
producing alternative agriculture products for export are limited. There
are some 58,000 farms in the country. Since 1948, when 38 farmers were
settled on 9,000 ha, the Institute of National Colonization (INC) has
settled more than 1,000 farmers on 250,000 ha. Uruguayan law provides that
any farm or ranch up for sale must first be offered to INC which has first
right to purchase at the going market rate. Overall, there has been
relatively little pressure for land, especially as soils and climate are
better suited to pastoral than crop production. Further details on the
agricultural and livestock sectors are provided in Annex 1.
Livestock Production Patterns
2.02      Uruguay, with an agricultural area of 16.5 million ha, of which
about 15 million ha are used for livestock, has a gently undulating topogra-
phy with virtually no wasteland. Pastures support 8.5 million beef cattle,
mainly Hereford; 600,000 dairy cattle, mainly Friesian; a sheep flock of
19.8 million, mainly Corriedale; and 380,000 Landrace and Duroc pigs. As
the country can no longer bring large areas of new land into production,
increased livestock output must come principally from increased production
per hectare.
2.03      Uruguay continues to be a major international supplier of live-
stock products, exporting US$191 million worth in 1970: US$79 million of
beef, US$9 million of mutton and lamb, US$79 million of wool, and US$24 mil-
lion of hides and skins.  Cattle production, stagnating since the early
1950's, began to increase in the late 1960's. Wool and dairy production
have remained virtually at a standstill.
2.04      Beef exports have exceeded 100,000 m tons for three successive
years -- 112,000 m tons in 1968, 124,000 m tons in 1969, and 145,000 m tons
in 1970. This was accomplished despite import bans imposed by the United
Kingdom in 1969 and later by the United States because of packing plant
sanitary deficiencies. The USA ban has since been lifted and the UK ban

is currently under review. Most of the Additional beef has been exported to
Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries. Preliminary results from
the 1970 census indicate that the national beef herd has increased about
4% in numbers since 1966. This expansion, particularly in breediag stock,
ust be accelerated if recent exports are to be sustained.
B. Agricultural Services
2.05      The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock is responsible for the
technical development of the livestock subsector. Under its auspices,
the Honorary Commission of the PLAN, organized in 1959, is charged with
providing technical services to cattle and sheep ranchers as well as to
dairy and pig producers (Annex 2 provides further details).
Research
2.06      Agricultural research, at the National Agricultural Research
Center (La Estanzuela), has been assisted by several UNDP/FA0 specialists
for many years. Research has been conducted on crops, pastures, soil
fertility, animal production, and agricultural economics. The Research
Center also has organized a seed certification program to upgrade produc-
tion of legumes, grasses, and forages.  Veterinarry research is conducted
at the Rubino Laboratories near Montevideo. Because of the importance of
livestock to the UruguAyan economy, more research and diagnostic facilities
have been planned.  The Inter-American Development- Bank (IDB) has loaned
US$1.3 million to the Government to help control foot and mouth disease
(FHD), which has been endemic in Uruguay for many years. Commercial FMN
vaccine was first produced locally in 1955 and the vaccination of all
cattle has recently become a legal requirement. :ct is hoped that this
program will help the retention of markets in many European countries.
The Rubino Laboratories have also developed and marketed the strains of
rhizobium inoculum used in Uruguay.
2.07      Inadequate management and nutrition, rather than disease, are
the main obstacles to higher levels of production. in spring and autumn
feed supplies are plentiful, but in sumer and winter their qcuantity and
quality are wuch less. Because ranchers do little to overcome these
seasonal shortages, calving and lambing percentages tend to be :ow and
mortality rates high. Given the high genetic quality of stock (para 2.02),
production on non PLAN ranches is below potential. For example, weaning
rates for Hereford and Angus cattle in Europe and the U.S. commonly average
above 80Z, whereas in Uruguay the same breeds rarely exceed 55% on unim-
proved ranches. The PLAN has fostered better pasture management and
nutritional levels, both by improving pastures anc. forage conservation.
Pasture growth is thereby transferred fram the surplus spring and fall
to the deficit summer and winter periods.



-4-
Agricultural Credit
2.08      The ava:ilbility of short-term credit to ranchers and farmers has
beean uncertain. In 1967 and 1968 a strong credit squeeze was imposed to
help contain a runaway unflation which, for a tine in 1967, reached an
annual rate of 120%. Short-term credit, in real terms, to agriculture was
reduced by 50Z, and this was partially responsible for a fall in demand for
PLAN development credit. Restoration of short-term (6-18 months) agricultural
credit availability, though atill insufficient, has been partly responsible
for the increase in PLAN long-term loan demand. As additional pasture is
improved, the provision of short-term credit and permanent capital on a
regular and increasing basis to participating ranchers and farmers vlli be
required.
2.09      The Government-owned Bank of the Republic (BOR) has provided
virtually all of the long-term development credit and much of the short
term credit to the agricultural sector, with comrercial banks (32 in
Uruguay) also providiug short-term credit. The BOR, with 71 branches in
the agricultural regions, accounts for over 50% of all agricultural credit
outstanding, both seasonal and developmental. About half of the agricultural
portfolio of government and private banks has been discounted with the
Central Bank.
2.10      Interest rates vary greatly on agricultural and industrial
loans. Commercial rates to agriculture and to industry on short-term loans
are fixed at 24% per annum but can range up to 40% when various commissions
and charges have bean added. The official short- and medium-term agricultural
credit by the BOR Costs borrowers about 13%. With inflation averaging 20-25%
in recent years, this rate offers a substantial subsidy.
C. Livestock Development 2olicies and Programs
2.11      During the early 1960's, a series of fiscal policies were
formulated tlAt heavixly penalized livestock production, processing and
exports and led to stagnation in the industry up to 1968. These policies
included: (a) heavy export taxes on beef and wool; (b) high sales taxes
on all cattle and wool sold; (c) heavy import duties on agricultural
machinery; and (d) credit restrictions that bore especially hard on
agriculture.
2.12      The positive technical achievements in pasture improvement and
increased carrying capacity under Loans 245-UR and 407-UR were offset by
these policies. Without their modification, further financial support
for investments in primary production would have been largely pointless.
Moreover, development needed to extend beyond production and include

processing and marketing. Remedial Government action was required in two
areas before the Bank could continue financial support of the livestock
development program. Fiscal measures had to be modified to restore investment
incentives to livestock producers; and the marketing and meat packing
industry had to be modernized to improve its cost structure, and the meat
inspection service had to be upgraded to international standards.
2.13      Since mid-1969, the Bank and Government have pursued a dialogue
directed at improving policies and the overall investment climate in the
livestock sector. The results of the policy changes outlined below have
exceeded expectations -- both for the rancher and for the economy. These
policies enabled full advantage to be taken of the substantial increases in
world prices which followed in 1970.
2.14      Prior to this sharp increase in world market prices Government had
taken the following steps aimed at improving producers' investment incentives:
(a) Beef export taxes were changed from an ad valorem tax of 15% to a flat
rate of US$40 1/ per ton of beef exported (equivalent to 8o% ad valorem), in-
ducing meat packers to export higher quality, more processed cuts of beef,
(b) wool export taxes were reduced from 29% to 5%; (c) import duties and
surcharges on farm machinery were abolished; and (d) ranch-gate price cor.-
trols on beef cattle were abolished. These measures resulted in a 40% ir.-
crease in the consumer price of beef, helping reduce domestic consumption
in favor of exports.
2.15      To stimulate the meat packing industry, the following measures
were taken:
(a) the 40-year old Frigonal (Government-owned packing
house) monopoly over the Montevideo market was
eliminated. All meat packing plants caa now supply
this domestic market (the monopoly was primarily
responsible for the excessive slaughtering charges
in the meat packing industry);
(b) the inefficiencies of the publicly controlled packing
houses were reduced;
(c) the meat inspection service was considerably restruc-
tured, expanded, and improved; anc
(d) a modernization program, supported. by aa !DB Loan of
US$13.7 million, was prepared and is now being
executed.
1/   This has since been raised to US$80 per ton but, because international
prices have increased markedly, the overall effect has been that the
tax levied is equivalent to about 10% ad valorem.

IrI. IMPACT OP BANIC LENDING
A. New Technology
3.01      Under the Bank lending program, new technologies of legume/phos-
phate pasture izaprovement were succeasfully introduced. Initially, much
reliance was placed on the slow, erpensive but essentially reliable method
that in lved conventional soving of mixed grasses and legumes on a
prepared seed bed. This method, preferred on the deep fertile soils,
has been supplemnted by an inexpensive technique, especially on the shallow
soils, involving the extensive use of the Australian sodseeder, and also by
dropping pelleted seed and fertilizer from special airplanes. 1/
3.02      By 1965, these and other techniques had been evaluated and the
PLAN knew, more or lesis, which one was preferable under the varied ecolo-
gical conditions around the country. The inexpensive pasture improvement
techniques became a demanstrated success, particularly in ensuring
pasture availability iln the winter and more persistent growth into the
hot suer dry spells.
B. Experimentation
3.03      Phosphate deficiency was shown early to be a key limiting factor
in the establishment of improved legume-based pastures, as was the lack
of suitable strains of rnizobia inoculum. Under the guidance of an
FAO-supported program, specific rhizobia strains were prepared and widely
used with outstanding success.
3.04      While experimentation had been successful, farmers were slow to
appreciate ;he profitability of improved pastures. Recently, however, as
a result of clear demonstration and intensive extension activities,
together with a rationalization of economic policies (para 2.14), farmers
have become more convinced of the benefits of the PLAN introduced technology.
The average annual Tate of grass lanc  improvement has increased from
46,000 ha during the first five years of the program to 230,000 ha for
the years 1969 through 1971.
1/  Nine topdressirig and oversowing planes and four bulk handling trucks
have been imported through the PLAN. In 1970, over 30,000 ha were
sown by pianes.



C. On-Rmch Production Impact
3.05      During the early 1960's, the PLAN moved slowly as experience
was gained with the introduction of new technology. Since 196f;, the annual
volume of lending has almost tripled -- from US$4 million equivalent to
an estimated US$11 million in 1971. Further acceleration of PLAN
lending and technical activities is expected over the next five years
for the improvement of an additional 20% (currently 7%) of Uruguay's
pasture area.
3.06      A sample survey of 50 representative properties indicates that
output can be raised from the equivalent of about 70 kg (beef liveweight)
per ha on the unimproved natural pastures to an average of some 220 kglha --
a threefold increase. The best pastures, in the more favored ecological
zones and under good management, have greatly exceeded this output and
their permanence has been clearly established. A wider sample survey of
250 farms is currently under way to establish further details, particularly
the numbers of breeding cattle on PLAN supported farms.
3.07      Pasture improvement plans have now been executed on about 6,100
supervised farms throughout the country, and by the end of 1971 an
estimated 830,000 ha will have been improved. Ranchers outside the Project,
who were supplied seed and fertilizer and techr.ical assistance on a cash
basis, have developed another 200,000 ha. Under the First Project, farm
size averaged 600 ha, compared to the 1 ,000 ha units envisaged. During
the Second Project, ranch size dropped to about 500 ha, due to the strict
interpretation by BOR of ceiling regulations or. capital resources of
eligible Project ranchers. The average area of participating project
ranches is now about 700 ha, with about 100 ha of improved pasture per
ranch.
D. Loan Repayments
3.08      The repayment record of Project 'borrowers under prevSIous Bank
sponsored projects in 1969, 1970 and 1971 hax baen good. .n 1969, interest
payment3 to BOR on adjusted outstanding principal  were good. In 1970,
about 5% of amounts due for both indexed and uninrexed loans were 3 month&
overdue. Ag of June 1971, about 3% of the indeAed portfolio was overdue up
to 6 mths and 2% overdue beyond one year.
E. Other Benefits
3.09      The Bank's livestock lending program has had a nuber of important
further benefits, such as:



(a)  Limt kic ect . 3ldcy. For t' e first time, Government
policynakers ail- treating the livestock industry, rancher,
and processor, as an integrated sector.  The PLAN has
played arn important coordinating role in this new approach.
Details of sector policy improvements are provided in
paras 2.14 and 2.15, and Annex 1.
(b)  Export Policy.  The approach has helped ensure that the
extra beef production is channelled into export markets,
resulting in adcIt ional foreign exchange earnings of
approximately .S$50 miflion from an additional 84,000
m tons in 1970 compared to 1959.
(c)  Rural DevelopmivnQ aad Land Refora.  The PLAN program has
directly assisted the land reform efforts of the National
Institute of Colonization (INC). Of the more than 1.,0
farmers and ranchers settled by the INC, 178 have received
PLAIN credit support.
(d)  isecolo.  The  LAN projects, by introducing soil
improving leguie-baaed pasture, have begun to reverse
the decline in soil fertility, the result of years of
continuous cropping and grazing. Erosion control measures
have a-so been intensified with PLAN technical support.
Project funds have been used to finance consultant
specialists who made a series of recomendations, many
of which have been adopted, to improve both the hygiene
conditions in meat planta and their processing of
wastes which had been previously disposed of as raw
effluent.
(e)  EMPoymnta.  Some 11,000 individuals are currently employed
on the Project ranches, and another 4,000 are employed in
the rural meat packing works.  Although the proposed Project
would have limited impact on increasing this figure, it
should ensure them steady employment and income.
(f) Marketing. UJnder the Third Project efforts were intensified
to improve the interritiornal marketing of beef. A major
study of Uruguay's external beef markets is being conducted
by a Swiss firn- which was selected after international
bidding. The sane group would, fo'lowing this market study,
suggest improvements in the flow o£ forei6,n market informa-
tion to the 18 exporting packing houses.  In acdition, the
Project financed a group of six Uruguayan officials to make
a detailed study of hygiene and plant efficiencies in
competitor nations such as New Zealand, Australia, Yugoslavia,
Denmark, and Ireland.
3.10      The impact,of bank lending is described in further detail in
Annex 4.

IV. THE FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A. Definition
4.01      The proposed Project would continue to assist Uruguayis livestock
development program by providing technical and financial support to beef
cattle, sheep, pig and dairy beef producers for calendar years 1972 and
1973. In previous loans beef cattle and sheep production was supported.
This project includes provision for dairy beef and pig production subcompo-
nents. It would embrace all livestock areas in the country. Expansion of
the pasture seed production and processing facilities would be included, as
well as support for Project-related intensified pasture and livestock re-
search programs.  Technical services to ranchers, to the meat and dairy
processing sector, and to Uruguay's meat inspection and hygiene control service
would also be provided.
B. Detailed Features
4.02      Beef Cattla and Sheep.  The Project woulc. finance on-ranch
development plans for about 3,100 ranches in each of zwo years. The objec-
tive would be to continue the improvement of cattle and sheep breeding per-
formance, to achieve earlier slaughter ages, and tc shift the emphasis
from wool production to mutton and lamb. Investments would be mainly in
pasture improvement; breeding stock; fencing; machinery; water supplies;
and other ranch infrastructure. The average '.nvestment per ranch would be
around US$6,000 equivalent, and the average ranch size 770 ha.
4.03      The ProJect would include financing for both the purchase of
additional breeding heifers and retention of breeding heifers from the
rancher's own herd. Provision for financing heifer purchase would be
included in the development loans to ranchers, which would finance 80% of
the investment costs stated in the approved ranch plans. The development
loans would range from 7 to 10 years. To enable ranchers to retain heifers
from their own herd, loans would be made to provide them with incremental
working capital with the loan term ranging from 3 to 7 years. This term is
governed by the time required to generate offtaie and the need to retain
additional heifers for breeding for a number of years to insure pasture
utilization. The interest rate would be 11% on boti the development loans
and the loans for incremental working capital. Under previous Bank loans
heifer purchases were excluded because the additional forage provided by
an estimated 10% improved pasture could be utilized well within the biolo-
gical growth of a well managed breeding herd, Now, however, many ranchers
are investing in pasture improvement on areas well in excess of 10% of
their land. This requires more investment frao the ranchers' own
resources as well as additional working capital and necessitates the
purchase of breeding stock as the retention of indigernous stock is insuffi-
cient to utilize the extra improved grassland.



- 10 -
4.04      The Project? would accelerate the growth of ranchers' breeding
herds by providing funds for heifer purchases and retentions. Careful
but different criteria would be established for purchase of additional
heifers and for heifer retention. Loans for heifer purchase would only
be made if t^ae ranch or farm has more than 20% of the pasture area improved
and the rancher is practicing good herd and pasture management. Loans for
incremental workiing capital to enable heifer retention would also be subject
to these criteria but in addition, would be based on the need for such
working capital as demonstrated in the analysis of the farm budgets approved
by the PLAN. A further requirement would be that all retained heifers be
identified bJ the PLAN. All heifer loans would be approved by the Technical
Director. Assurances on this and the enforcement of these criteria were
obtained during negotiations. Terms and conditions of the loans for the
purchase and retention of heifers are further discussed in Aex  3, Appendix
2. Details of three types of beef and sheep ranches which would be financed
under the Project are given in Annex 5, Tables 1-24.
4.05      Dairy Beef.  Ivestments in dairy beef production are expected
mostly in the south and southwest areas (Map 1).  Some 900 farmers, averaging
about 100 ha each, are expected to receive financial and technical support
over a two-year period, 450 in each year. The objective is to raise
20,000 male calves, currently killed at birth, to 14 to 18 months of age
for slaughte:: and export as baby beef. Average investment per farm would
be around US$3,000 equivalent, for pasture improvement, pens, fencing,
machinery, and ranch infrastructure. Further details are provided in Annex 6.
4.06      Pork Product±on.  The Project would support  the establishment of
200 units of about 25 breeding sows each, probably in the south-central
area of Uruguay (Map 1).  Average investments per 30 ha farm are estimated
at around US$14,000 equivalent, of which US$2,800 would be for the
important start-up feed costs.  The large initial investment is necessary
due to the capital costs of farrowing and finishing pens. Other invest-
ments would include breeding pens, feed mixing machinery, boars and sows.,
fencing, and pasture improvement. Annex 7 provides further details.
40 * O '  Contractor Machineiy. Limited funds (US$242,000) would be
provided under the Project for making loans to contractors for the purchase
of miachinery to construct on-ranch water supplies and to lay down the
different types of pasture. About 100 loans are expected to be made for
tractors, harrows, bulk fertillzer distributors , sodseeders, and farm
dam construction equipment. Such loans would be made on the basis of.
investment p.ans approved by the PLAN.  Annex 3, Appendix 2 gives further
details.
4.08      Seed Production and Processing.  The Project would include funds
for loans to farmers and seed processors for the importation of special
types of pasture seed producing, harvesting, cleaning, processing, and
certification machinery and equipment. Any financial. support to seed
processors would be based on a detailed technical and financial plan.  As-
surances were obtained that no such plans would be financed without PLAN
and Bank approval. Further details are given in Annex 4.



- 11 -
4.09      Technical Services and Training.  The Project would support
technical services for the continued introduction of new technology in
livestock production, pasture production and management, demonstration of
related pasture and forage conservation techniques, meat and dairy
processing and related marketing problems, and up-to-date hygiene
techniques. Related goods and equipment to ensure the effective utiliza-
tion of these services would also be provided. Additionally, the Project
would finance local and overseas training of livestock, meat processing,
and banking and credit technicians. Local training is being undertaken
by the Technical Director recruited from New Zealand and a Senior Agricul-
tural Economist from the Federal Republic of Germany, both positions subject
to Bank approval as in previous loans and costs would continue to be met by
the Project (para 4.21, Annex 2, Table 1). Finally, the Project would give
additional emphasis to the extension of appropriate new technologies of hay
and forage conservation, and provide a small amount for financing preinvest-
ment studies. Annex 2 gives further background on the Project's Technical
Services.
C. Cost Estimates
4.10      The total investments proposed under the Project, shown for the
first and second stage separately, equivalent to US$55.6 million, are
detailed in Annex 8. The total investments are summarized by major
categories in the table below. Cost estimates are based on prices
prevailing in Uruguay in 1971. A 15% provision for contingencies for
both price rises and unforeseen expenditures has been added to local and
foreign costs. The proposed Bank financing of US$25.6 million, representing
the full foreign exchange cost (46% of the total cost) would consist of
US$11.2 million for the first stage and US$14.4 million for the second stage
as shown in Annex 8, and would cover the foreign exchange component as
estimated in the table below.

4.11      The foreign exchange component for physical investments was
computed by adding to CIF costs the additional. foreign expenditure incurred
in processing, transporting inputs to farms, and sowing or constructing
the financed investments (for example, pasture improvement and dams). Breed-
ing heifers eligible for financing under the proposed modification would be
withheld from slaughter. To the extent that such heifers would not enter the
export trade but would be retainedJ the foreign exchange earnings foregone
would represent foreigxi exchange investments in the expansion of the national
herd. Currently 40% of Uruguay's beef production is exported. For purposes
of determining the Bank's contribution to such financing it has been assumed
that the same proportion of heifers purchased and/or retained under the
Project would be withheld from exports, even though, it could be argued that
most of the future increiental production would be marketed abroad. Tech-
nical, consultant and training services and related equipment were computed
on a CIF basis.

/2   Loans for heifer retention and start-up pig feed costs.
While the Project itself provides incremental working capital for heifer
retention and start-up pig feed, additional short-term credit would be
required by beneficiaries.  Assurances were obtained that adequate short-tern
credit (seasonal financing) would be made avai:able from participating banks.
The financial implications for participating institutions are set out in
Annex 9.
4.13      The Bank would pay foreign suppliers directly, as in previous
loans, for imported pasture seeds and fertilizers. The peso equivalenu of
the value of imported pasture seeds and fertilizer would be credited to the
Livestock Fund of the Central Bank (US$6 million, Table para 4.14). The
Central Bank would provide short-term financing, to fertilizer importers on
terms to be determined in agreement with the Bank; these terms would not



-14 -
exceed 180 days at ar. annual interest rate of 1V.75%.  Assurances on these
terms were obtained during negotiations.  Importers would sell the s-ed and
fertilizer to ranchers and farmers through normal trading channels.
4.14       On the basis of approved ranch development plans, participating
banks would lend 80% of the total on-ranch investment. These banks would
be then reimbursed on a graduated percentage scale from the Livestock
Development Fund established in the Central Bank (para 4.17, Annex 3,
Appendix 2, para 2 (b)). The average reimbursement by the Central Bank
and the Bank combined is estimated to be 85% of subloans made; the annual
rate of interest charged to the participating banks would be 7.5%. This
compares to an average reimbursement of 75% of subloans under previous
loans with rate of interest at 7.5%. This high rate of reimbursement is
expected to encourage commercial baak participation (para 4.23). The
folloving table illustrates the financing of subloans to farmers:

4.15       Government's policy since the early 3960's has been to subsidize
phosphate fertiiizer costs from the earmarked proceeds of beef and wool
export taxes. This subsidy has effectively reduced farmgate costs from
US$60 to US$40 per m ton, or to about the levels of its major competitors
in New Zealand and Australia.  Compfred to New Zealard's consumption of
t,100,000 tons Jn 1970, Uruguay's consumption was only 210,000 m tons.
To encourage a wider aad more regular use of phosphate fertilizer, continued
subsidies would be approprItate until at least 20% of Uruguay's pasture area
is improved.  This level of pasture improvement should generate sufficient
farm income to allow pasture development to continue without subsidizing
phosphate. In addition at this level of usage, the value of routine applica-
tion of phosphate in maintaining pasture production will have been amply
demonstrated.  Furthermore, although subsidizing fertilizer can be justified
at low levels of usage, the cost of the subsidy becomes very burdensome to
the Government budget when fertilizer use becomes wic:espread. During



- 15 -
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the borrower would submit a plan
to the Bank by June 1, 1973 for phasing out fertilizer subsidies once 20%
of the total pasture area has been approved.
E. Procurement
4.16      International competitive bidding procedures would be used for the
bulk procurement of pasture seeds (US$2.0 million), fertilizer (US$4.0 mil-
lion), and machinery for seed producers and contractors (US$0.47 milliorn),
except for contracts valued at less than US$25,000. International bidding
for rock phosphate for local grinding and direct application would be restricte-
to those sources agronomically tested under Uruguayan conditions at the time
of bidding. To date, sources in Tunisia and Israel have been successfully
tested and a source in the U.S. is currently under test.  The PLAN is inviting
other potential suppliers to submit samples for zesting by the Estenzuela Re-
search Station. Bidding for all other types of rock phosphate would be open
to all suppliers.  Bank approval of terms of reference and draft contracts
would be required for any technical services and training programs valued at
more than US$25,000. Related equipment and goods to support technical ser-
vices (about US$200,000 for vehicles and spare parts equipment, office
machinery and supplies) would be subject to international competitive bid-
ding, except for contracts below US$25,000. Purchases of fencing and hand-
ling yard materials, farm machinery, water pumps and piping and building
materials would be made through normal commercial channels. An adequate
selection of international suppliers is represented in the local market.
These procedures are the same as were followed under Loans 698-UR and 773-UR.
Assurances on these procurement procedures were obtained during negotia-
tions.
F. Disbursement
4.17      Since the Bank would disburse directly to suppliers for importe.d
seeds and fertilizers (para 4.13), an equivalent amount of local currency
would be deposited with the Livestock Fund of the Central Bank for making
on-farm development loans under the Project. Since these funds would not
cover'the full foreign exchange cost of on-farm development loans, the Bank
would also disburse to the Livestock Fund the equ:.?valent of. 46% of on-farm
development loans made by participating banks.  The 3ank would also disburse
the full foreign exchange cost of contractor mach:.nery; seed processing equip-
ment; technical services and related equipment; ard 37% of incremental
working capital loans. Disbursements would be made against appropriate docu-
mentation submitted by the Central Bank to the Bank. Certification by the
participating banks, the Central Bank and the PLAN Technical Director wouid be
required for reimbursemenrt of on-farm development and incremental working
capital subloans. Disbursement of the loan (both stages) is expected with-in
three years (Annex 10). Appropriate assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations.

G. Audit n
4.1S       As under 698-UR and 773-UR, auditing of the Livestock Fund in the
Central Bank and the Pro-ect Loan account in AOR would be conducted annually
by the Tribunal de Cuetltas of Urjguay or by independent auditors.  Auditing
to date has been satisf'actory.  Project loan accounts in participating com-
nercial banks and those of the PLAN would be audited by firms acceptable to
the Bank. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the financial
statements of the Livestock Fund (balance sheet and related statement of
earnings and expenses), Project accounts in participating banks, and PLAN
accounts would be audited annually by the Tribunal de Cuentas of the borrower,
or acceptable firms, and sent to the Bank not later than four months after
the close of the fiscail year.
H, G    tnd Manae
4.19       The Livestock Fund in the Central Bank, established under Loan
698-UR, would continue to be used as a channel for Pro4-ect funds.  On-ranch
investment and technical services would be kept in separate accounts, and
each participating bankl would establish a separate account to handle Project
loans. That these accounts would be established in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank was assured dturing negotiations.
4.20       The PLAN would continue to coordinate and supervise the livestock
credit program (Annex 2). The Government would provide the necessary funds
for the administrative costs of the PLAN (US$380,000 annually) and assurances
were obtained during negotiations that these would be made available as
and when required.  The basic law establishing the PLAN specified that it
has technical autonomy with regard to directing and supervising the livestock
development program.  About 80 university graduates are now employed as
technicians to appraise rancher loan applications, supervise the disbursement
of approved loans and provice technical advice on techniques of pasture im-
provement.
4.21       The PLAN has made fruitful use of four experienced Technical Di-
rectors over the past 10 years. Due to the importance of this position, any
new appointment would require the approval of the Bank, as would the conditions
of his employment and the authorities, duties, and responsibilities assigned
(see Annex 2). Assurances that such approvals as under previots Projects
were obtained during negotiations. The Technical Director would be assisted
by a Deputy, Regional Supervisors and a Senior Agricultural Economist. The
principal deficiency In the planning work to date has been a lack of famil-
iarity with farm management and budgeting techniques. To rectify this, the
Senior Agricultural Economist has organized a special group to introduce
these techniques (Annex 2). Assurances were obtained that intensified on-
,arm record keeping would boe undertaken under the direction of the Senior
Agricultural Econo=,st, His foreign exchange costs would continue to be
financed bY the Loan and a-n  new appointment would be subject to Bank approval.

I. Lending Operations
4.22       The Government would be the borrower a-nd bear the foreign exchange
risk. A substantial portion of this risk would be covered by the indexed
subloans repaid by Project ranchers (para 4.24).  The Bank loan term would
be for 14 years, including a 4-year grace period. Lending operations and
policies are suimarized briefly below; details are given in Annex 3, page 5.
4.23       Additional Lending Channels.  In Decemoer 1970, to help create
healthy competition for on-lending, the Central Bank notified the banking
system that all banks were eligible to be considered for PLAN participation.
Eligibility criteria are given in Annex 3. Additional banking participation
would be encouraged by the higher (85% average) reimbursement rate (para 4.14)i
the graduated scale of reimbursement and discount rates (Annex 3), the provi-
sion for discounting incremental working capital loans and the detailed farm
budgeting required under the Project. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that all subsidiary loan agreements between the Central Bank
and participating banks, including BOR, would be subject to approval by
the Bank.  A condition of loan effectiveness would be Bank approval of at
least one subsidiary loan agreement.
4.24       Subloan Indexing (see Annex 3, Section E, for details).  The
principal of all subloans made to Project ranches would continue to be
adjusted as under Loan 698-UR and Loan 773-UTR, by a weighted index based
on ranch-gate prices of beef and wool. If changes in this index exceed
changes in the cost of living index, however, the latter would be applied
to subloans. The current indexing mechanism fully indexes the principal of
subloans on farms of more than 400 ha, and a 50% ad4ustment is applied to
loans for farms of less than 400 ha. It is estimated that these smaller
farms will receive approximately 10% of the total value of loans extended
uader the Project.  No change in this system is proposed.  Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that losses incurred by participating 'anks due
to partial-indexing only would be borne by Government and that no change in
the current indexing mechanism would be made without prior Bank approval.
4.25       Interest Rate.  The rate of 11%, established under 698-UR and
773-UR, would continue to be applied to all Project subloans, including
incremental working capital loans, contractor and seed processing loans.
Assuming an annual inflation rate of 20% and with sub-loan indexing as
described above the average real rate of interest would be approximately 93.
The partial indexing would have a differentiating effect on farms of varying
sizes, namely, for farmers above 400 ha the effective rate of interest or
adjusted principal would be 11% and for farmers below 400 ha the rate would
be about 4%.

V. PRICES, PRODUCTION, MARKETS, FARMER BENEFITS
AND REVENUE GENERATION
A. Prices
5.01       Continued increases in ranchgate prices since 1969 have provided
ranchers with sufficient incentives to invest in ranch improvements. As a
result of the recent Government policy changes described earlier (para 2.14),
Project average ranchgate prices for live cattle have risen from US$0.13/kg
in May 1969 to US$0.27/kg in May 1971. During the same period, international
prices for frozen beef quarters have increased from US$460 to US$700 per ton;
October 1971 prices per m ton (quarters US$900, cooked frozen US$1,800,
special cuts US$1,500, canned beef US$1,350) continued to show increases
over these for the first five months of 1971. World beef market projections
indicate that prices will remain strong throughout the seventies. (see Annex
12 for further details). Wool prices, to the farmer, after declining
substantially, bave stabilized at US$0.42/kg. Pork prices at US$0.49/kg
are in line with EEC and US prices of US$0.61 and US$0.44/kg respectively.
B. Production and Markets
5.02       Beef.  The i.nternational demand for beef continues strong and,
according to FAD projections, it will exceed supply by 530,000 m tons by
1985. Given the substitution of pork, mutton and lamb for domestic beef
consumption, additional beef and beef products generated by the Project will
be exported. ?Measures recently adopted by the Government (para 2.14) have
provided beef processors with greater incentives to export higher quality
processed beef than to sell it on the local market.
5.03       The important US market reopened during 1970 after a year's ban on
Uruguayan beef. The United Kingdom's ban on Uruguayan carcass beef in 1969
forced the country to expand its beef export product mix and to diversify its
markets. In 1970, some 30 meat products were exported to over 50 countries.
A major meat and dairy study on further market diversification and consoli-
dation is currently being financed (partially) with proceeds from Loan 698-UR.
5.04       Mutton and Lamb.  With low wool export prices, Government has pro-
vided incentives to increase lamb production both for export and internal
consumption. Increased lamb exports should provide additional foreign ex-
change to offset lower returns from wool.
5.05       Pork.  Increased pig production generated by this Project would
be channelled mainly to the domestic market; recent studies indicate that
Uruguayans demand a lean type of fresh pork.



- 19 -
C. Processing
5.06       The slaughter capacity of existing packing houses is adequate
(Annex 1). Several newer, mediun-sized, privately-owned slaughter houses
designed to cater for the export market have begur. operations in the cattle
production areas (Map 2). Although 30 applicationis for additional plants
to be located in the production areas are pending, Government is likely to
approve only three or four over the next four years in order to prevent
possible over-capacity.
5.07       Continued Government assistance is required to maintain and improve
the meat inspection, hygiene and disease control services necessary to comply
with standards imposed by the importing countries.. Continued Government
guidance is also required in the area of meac plant modernization and expan-
sion.
D. Farmer Benefits and Revenue Gereration
5.08       Income to ranchers and financial returrs on incremental investments
have been estimated on the basis of ranch budgets (Annexes 5, 6 and 7). The
tax structure existing in May 1971 is reflected in these financial projec-
tions.   Estimated financial rates of return on ircremental investments aver-
age about 25% for beef and sheep ranches, 18% for pig producers, and 29% for
dairy beef farmers.  As under Loans 698-UR and 77--URl, assurances were ob-
tained during negotiations, that Government would maintain policies and
measures to afford efficient livestock procucers a reasonable opportunity of
obtaining a financial rate of return of at least ;5% per annum, on their new
productive livestock investments, under normal conditions of production. The
budget summary of a representative 5GG ha.  ProJecz ranch (Annex 5, Table 7)
indicates that a rancher's net income after debt service is about US$1,700
at present ana would rise to aDout US$4,300 in year 7, anc US$4,900 in year
12, and this indicates that farm incomes are adequate to encourage further
investment by farmers. Tais compares to an urban skilled worker's annual
income of about US$2,500 at present.
5.09       Public Revenue Gen.-ration.  The Projecr t5 likely to generate
a significant incremental revenue to the publac se,: .or bud-et. Using the
tax estimates made in May 1971 (Annex 1, Table 4) of US$187 per metric
:on of beef exported, the additional 49,000 m tons produced undez the Pro;--
ect at full development should generate an addit4oaal US$9., miilion annual-
ly of public revenues, equivalenc to aDout 3% of the 1971 Government budget.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUTXFIK'ATION
6.01       The economic rate of return of the ProjicL is estimated to be about
31% assuming a world beef price of US$700 per m toiv (paras 5.61 and  .G2)
and Annex 12).  Should actual incremental production be valued at 10% less,



- 20 -
due either to drop in all -utDut prices or a chort fall in physical
production, the economic rate cf -eturn would %-e about 19%. This
calculation was based cn the aggregation of tn'e incremiental cash flows adjusted
for net transfer payments (taxes and subsidies) and the cost of the imported
technical services (see 4"'ex 11 for det-i!ls ef these assumptions).
6.02      At full development, after 7 years, the investments made under this
Project are likely to result in an incremental beef production of 49,000 m
tons, valued at US$34.3 million equivalent. With the new pricing policies,
and export incentives, virtuallv all of this beef should be exported, an in-
creasing portion of which ±s expected to be shipped in boneless, cooked/frozen
and special cut form. An incremental 8,000 m tons of mutton and lamb, plus
6,000 m tons of pork, are also expected to be produced from the Project,
worth US$5.6 million equivalent.
6.03      The economic rate of return specified above does not take full ac-
count of the nonquantifiable benefits cited in paragraph 3.09. The Project
would continue to introduce proven techniques of pasture improvement and
livestock production, both directly through participating producers, and
indirectly by its demonstration effect. It would also continue to emphasize
in-service training of technicians in the preparation of ranch development
plans, including detailed financial projections. Additionally, the Project
would ensure the continuation of the major tax and marketing policy reforms
introduced in 1969.
VII.  AGREMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following princi-
pal points:
(a) Government would:
(i) provide the necessary funds for the annual local
currency administrative costs of the PLAN as and when
required (para 4.20); and
(ii) ensure that no change in the agreed indexing mechanism
would be made without prior Bank approval and any loss
resulting from the fact that some loans would not be
fully indexed would be borne by the Government (para 4.24);
(b) The Central Bank would:
(i) ensure that the peso equivalent of the value of
imported fertilizer and pasture seeds would be
credited to the Livestock Fund in the Central Bank
immediately upon payment of the foreign supplier by
the Bank, and used to help finance ranch development
loans made by participating banks (para 4.13);



- 21 -
(ii) ensure that withdrawal requests for development loans
made to ranchers and farmers, heifer and start-up pig
feed loans would be certified by the participating
banks, the Central Bank and the PLAN (para 4.17);
(iii) ensure that financial statements of the Project account
in participating commercial banks and those of the PLAN
would be audited by firms acceptable to the Bank. The
Project account in the Central Bank would be audited
annually by the Tribunal de Cuentas of the Borrower or
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para 4.18);
(iv)  ensure that the Central Bank's Livestock Fund would
continue to be used for channelling Project funds; and
separate accounts would be kept for each category of
loans as well as technical services. Participating
banks would also establish separate accournts for
Project loan funds (para 4.19); and
(v) submit subsidiary loan agreements between Central
Bank and participating banks (including BOR) to the
Bank for approval (para 4.23).
(c) The Plan Agropecuario would:
(i) ensure that procurement of rock phosphate, fertilizer,
pasture seeds, seed production and processing
equipment and related technical service equipment
and vehicles would be carried out yv international
competitive bidding except for singie contracts whose
value would be equivalent to less than US$25,000
(para 4.16); and
(ii) ensure that any new appointment to the position of
the Technical Director or the Senior Agricultural
Economist as well as their duties, authorities and
responsibilities would be subject :o Bank approval
(para 4.21).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan is the execution of at
least one subsidiary loan agreement with a partic--pating bank (para 4.23).
7.03      With the indicated assurances, the proposed Project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$25.6 million for a term. of 14 years
including a 4-year grace period. Bank finance would be made available
in two stages, US$11.2 million at this time -o finance the first year of
operations under the Project and US$14.4 million :.r. fiscal year 1973 as
soon as further commitment is required. Financing of the second stage
would be conditional upon the general creditworth&r.ess of the Borrower
at that time and on a review of the performance ur,der t'ie first stage
and an updating of this appraisal for the second.  The Borrower would be
the Government of Uruguay which would assume the K oreign exchange risk.

URUGUAY
FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Development of the Livestock Industry
Policies and Programs
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The livestock industry is the backbone of Uruguay's economy.
Exports of beef and wool and their by-products account for approximately
85X of Uruguay's export earnings and 12% of GNP. If ancillary industries,
transport and services are taken into account the livestock sector contri-
butes 25% to 30X of GNP and employs about 19% of the total labor force.
The population of about three millions has a per capita income of about
US$600.
1.02      During tne disbursement period (1960-68) of the first two livestock
loans, a series of disincentives, inflation, discriminatory fiscal policies
and Government disregard for international hygiene requirements seriously
affected the key livestock sector.  These factors irihibited investment to
improve herd and pasture productivity and, iz. 1969, ied to a ban by the
United Kingdom and by the United States of all imLports of Uruguayan beef
products.
1.03      Since mid-1969, the Bank and the Goverment have pursued a dialogue
directed at improving the policy management and the overall investment
climate in this sector.  Improved investment incentives resulted from con-
tinually rising ranch-gate prices (Ur$33/kg liveweight in May 1969 to
Ur$67/kg in May, 1971) following internal policy reforin as well as rising
export prices for beef (US$460 per ton in May 1969 to US$700 per ton in
May 1971, and US$804 per ton in January 1972).
1.04      Mainly as a result of Uruguay livestock lo&ns 245-UR, 407-UR and
698-UR, improved pastures have increased over eO times during the past ter.
years, reaching 1,221,000 hectares.  However, nhis still only accouuts for
over 7% of the total area used for .ivestock produciLon. According to
preliminary data, the 1970 General Agricultaral CeasLs shows a 4.4% increase
in cattle population, since the 1966 census, even though beef exports have
increased 112X during the same period to 145,000 tons during 1970.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
II.  B.< CGR0UYD AND CURREN  SKTUAATTIO
Production Patterns, L:and Use and Farm Size
2.01      Uruguay has a gently undulating topography with virtually no
wasteland. Rainfall is variable, averaging 1,000 rn per annum but severe
droughts occur at about 5 year intervals. In addition, sumners are frequently
very dry and hot.
2.02      Of Uruguay's 19 million ha total area, about 16.5 million
ha are engaged for the agriculture sector and 14.9 million are used
for livestock production. This pasture land supports about 8.5 million
cattle, mainly Hereford, 600,000 dairy herd, primarily Holstein and 19.8
million head of sheep. While the cattle population increased over 4% since
the 1966 census, the sheep flock decreased 14.2% due to declining wool prices
during the period. Carrying capacity averages about one beef animal and
three sheep per ha. Since Uruguay has no more large areas of new land to
bring into use, additional livestock production must come from increased
productivity per hectare. The possibilities are great, particularly since
the larger producers (some 3,900 farmers with holdings of more than 1,000
ha (Table 1) occupy about 60% of the livestock area and manage about 60%
of Uruguay's cattle herd and sheep flock.

Production, Consumption and Exports
2.03      The increase in the international beef prices from US$460 to US$700
per ton since 1968 provided the basis for substantial farm gate rises in
live cattle prices per kg from US$0.13 to US$0.27 during the same period.
These increases ,aave Drovided the necessary incentives for improving pastures
for expanded livestock production.
2.04      The percentage of Uruguay's beef output used for domestic consump-
tion has been decreasing since the mid-1960's (Table 2). About 60% of
beef production is consumed domestically (74.5 kg/capita). Uruguay is one
of the highest beef constmers in the world (80.4 kg in Argentina and 25 kg
in Western Europe). Beef consumption has declined somewhat because of a
change in the price relationships between beef, chicken and poultry (Broiler
chicken consumption increased 150% in the past year).



ANNEX 
Page 3
2.05      With domestic wool conlsumption fairly constant at some 8,000 tons
or about 102 of production, wool with beef continues to represent the major
portion of Uruguay's exports. Its importance is diminishing and, for the
first time in 1970, export receipts from wool exports were lower than meat
and meat products.
2.06      Since the international wool market is unlikely to revive, sheep
production in Uruguay is being reoriented toward meat production (lamb and
mutton), particularly with the improved market for these products in
international markets. For the first time in a decade, in 1970 (Table 3),
Uruguay exported over 20,000 tons liveweight equivalent of iamb and mutton,
generating about US$8.5 million. Continued strong international demand and
increasing prices will provide incentives for dual purpose sheep production.
The sheep flock, which numbered 26.3 million in 1968, now stands at some
19 million. The Government has stimulated lamb production by establishing
a period between July 15 and September 30, 1971, where quality lambs,
slaughtered to satisfy domestic and external markets, will receive an
additional 10 pesos per kg on a liveweight basis.
III. POLICIES AND PR0GRA?S
3.01      During the 1960's, a series of policies penalized livestock
production, processing and exports. These policies were.
(a) Heavy export taxes on beef and wool;
(b) Sales taxes on all cattle and wool sold;
(c) Irregular fertilizer subsidies;
(d) An inefficient government dominated meat oacking industry;
(e) A deteriorating meat inspection and hygieae control
service; and
(f) Heavy import duties on agricultural machinery.
3.02      The positive technical achievements in pasture improvement and
increased carrying capacity under Loans 245-UR and 407-UR were offset by
these adverse Government policies. Without their modification, further
financial support for investments in primary p:oduc_ioa would have been
largely meaningless. Moreover, livestock devel-opmeait objectives needed to
move beyond the production phases and inciade :he processing and marketing
industry. Remedial Government action was required before the Bank could
continue financial support of the livestock development program.
3.03      Since mid-1969, the Bank and Government pursued a dialogue directed
at improving policy management and the overalI inves.tment climate in the
Livestock sector. The results of these policy changes outlined in quantitative
terms in Tables 4 and 5, introduced through Loa-.n 69r,-nR, exceeded expectations
-- both for the rancher and for the economy. Beef exports are increasing,
as are also the local production and consumption of such substitutes as pork,
mutton and chicken; improvements have been made ir the structure and staffing
of the meat inspection services; ana private meat packinghouses have invested
in plant modernization, including the upgrading of vital hygiene standards.



ANNEX 1
Page  L
3.04      The following steps were aimed mainly at improving producers'
investment incentives:
(a)  internal consumer prices for beef were raised 15% on
the average, helping to reduce domestic consumption
and made additional beef available for export
(para 2.04);
(b)  beef export taxes were changed from an ad valorem tax of
15% to a flat rate of US$80 per ton of beef exported, an
average equivalent to 10% ad valorem, to induce meat packers
to export higher quality, more processed cuts of beef;
(c)  wool export taxes were reduced in stages from 29% to 5%
to maintain wool exports;
(d)  import duties and surcharges on farm machinery were
removed; and
(e)  ranch-gate price controls on beef cattle were abolished.
The relation between rising international prices of beef and consumer prices
are readjusted regularly. Accordingly, beef price increases to the consumer
have been 40% since 1969, which has encouraged consumption of other meats
such as mutton, pork and poultry.
IV. PROCESSING AND MARKETING OF
LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS
4.01      A major political effort has been made since 1969 to restructure
the beef processing industry. Issues still remaining are both political and
technical, and if squarely met with sound technical and marketing advice,
continued improvements are likely over the next few years. The importance
of the 4 large old plants in the city has diminished and some 13 smaller
and more efficient privately owned plants, outside of Montevideo, now account
for a major portion of Uruguay's beef exports. These smaller plants have
invested over US$8 million in installing modern processing capacity and
improving facilities to meet hygiene standards. Part of this investment
plus additional funds for further plant modernization is to be supported by
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan of US$13.7 million (Table 6).
4.02      Processing costs in Uruguay were US$107 per ton in May 1969, as
compared to US$30 in Argentina. Policy changes (para 3.02 and 3.04) initiated
by the Government since 1969 have begun to show beneficial effects and in
May 1971, the beef processing costs were US$83 per ton.

Structure and Status of the Processing Industry
4.03      The structure of Uruguay's meat industry has changed significantly
in the past decade. The international meat packing compapies no longer
operate in Uruguay. Of the old and largely inefficient plants, three are
located in Montevideo. One is owned and operated by Government and the
others by a worker's cooperative. The fourth is located on Uruguay River
and has dock facilities. The remaining 13 plants located outside Montevideo
are medium-sized and export oriented.
4.04      Most of the commercial livestock slaughter excluding the non-
inspected slaughterhouses and farm slaughters, is handled by 18 meat plants -
11 of these 18 plants are situated within 65 km of Montevideo and account
for most of the export meat and meat products. Seven medium-sized plants
contribute 70% of the country's beef exports. The slaughter capacity is
considerably in excess of current or medium term rec,uirements. However, the
effective chilling and freezing capacity, is only slightly above the current
slaughter capacity.
4.05      The operating and sanitary conditions of the meat plants varied
widely in 19690from barely acceptable to totally unacceptable. The lack
of a satisfactory meat inspection service and enforcible regulations led to
the United Kingdom and the United States placing an embargo on all imports
of meat and meat products from Uruguay. As a result, the Government initiated
action to establish an adequate and recognized meat inspection service and
a plan of action to modernize the meat packing industry.
4.06      As a result of Government sponsored action, the modernization of
the meat industry began slowly during early 1970. Duriag 1969 and 1970, over
US$8 million was put primarily into the private sector to improve facilities.
4.07      All of Uruguay's meat plants produce for export, chilled and
frozen beef carcasses, and edible offals. All but one export special cuts
and boneless beef. Three plants have facilities for producing canned beef
and extract.  Three other plants plan on adding canning facilities to their
operation within the next five years. Most plan to add cooked frozen pro-
cessing during the next five years also.  Tallow, blood meal and bonemeal
are produced for export by the larger plants and one or twq smaller ones.
4.08      During the past 18 months, significant improvement was made in
the sanitary conditions of the newer medium-sized plants. Effective meat
inspection service has resulted in marked changes in operating procedures.
More efficient processing facilities, flow patterns and processes have been
introduced primarily in the private sector. On the rail dressirng, continuous
boning systems and new special cut techniques have bean successfully
introduced. Additional chill and freezer storage is urgently needed.
4.09      Labor productivity differs greatly from the large older plants
where excess employment exists to the smaller new plants where the ratio of
production workers to office staff is about 6 to 1. Smaller private owned
plants, operating away from Montevideo do not suffer to the same extent from
strikes and labor difficulties.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
4.10      As a result of the dialogue between the IDB and the Government an
organization, Unidad Profrigos, under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
has been established by Government decree. This orfice has the responsibility
for coordination between agencies, the reorganization and modernization of
the meat processing industry and for implementation of the IDB loan. A
commission, consisting of representatives from the Central Bank, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and the Profrigos Unit, is responsible
for the necessary coordination between these agencies to assure that hygiene
standards, sanitary engineering, economic considerations, industry planning
and construction standards meet international requirements and the goals of
Uruguay. The Profrigos Unlit makes technical and economic evaluations of
the meat processing industry requests for building new facilities, modernizing
existing plants and increasing capacities. Emphasis is placed on sanitary
engineering, efficient process flow, product mix, facilities design, adequacy
of storage and services and location.
4.11      Recent ?o±icy Changes.  In an effort to solve industrial problems,
Government took a series of important policy steps between M4y and November
1969. In this period, Government:
(a) substituted a cash payment for that portion of the
Frigounl's worker's wage received in beef;
(b) abolished Frigonal's monopoly of cattle slaughter 8nd
beef supply to the Montevideo market. All meat packing
plants are now able to supply the domestic market under
a flexible quota system;
(c) designated funds in the 1970 budget that permitted the
transfer or retirement of 450 of Frigonal's administrative
personnel;
(d) estab'.ished a 3Z sales tax on all meat sold by the
privately and cooperatively owned packing plants in
the dcmestic ma-.ket.  The proceeds of this tax, to
be held in a special fund, are to be used for
(1) restructuring the industry, (2) improving the
marketing of beef, and (3) compensating blue collar
workers laid off; and
(e) abolished all import duties and surcharges on the
equipment imported for the modernization program of
the packing indu.3try. The average level of import
duties, sales tax, port charges, and the like on such
equipment varied from 50Z to 100% of the CIF values.
4.12      Substantial action and investment, however, is still needed to
prepare the meat packing industry for the rapidly changing international
demand pattern emerging for the 1970's. Determinations must be made by
Government as to:



ANNEX 1
Page 7
(a) basic structure and ownership of the industry. Currently,
the packing industry, in terms of slaughter capacity, is
divided roughly into thirds: private ownership, public
ownership and worker's cooperatives;
(b) slaughtering capacity, freezing and cold storage
facilities and the location of new processing plants; and
(c) patterns for investment to upgrade hygienic standards and
to modernize slaughterhouse facilities.
Modernizing the Processing Industry
4.13      There is general recognition throughout the industry that
facilities and equipment must be upgraded to permit more efficient slaughter-
ing and processing operations and that hygienic facilities must be improved.
The industry is realistic in recognizing the urgent need to set up an
approved inspection system and to ensure acceptance of its products in the
export market.
4.14      Since 1969, the private sector has invested over US$8 million to
upgrade existing slaughtering and processing facilities to meet international
sanitary and hygiene requirements, for the production of value added products
and to improve operating efficiency. Additional investments are required to
replace the large old plants at EFCSA, Frigonal and Fray Bentos, conversion
of existing facilities for processing canned meats, cooked frozen, boneless
cuts, vacuum packaged and frozen meats, and increasing chilling and freezing
storage and blast freezing capabilities. With the availability of larger
supplies of lamb and pigs being projected, additional slaughtering and
processing facilities will be required. The limiting factor in meat pro-
duction for expqrt is the refrigerated holding capacity. An expansion in
export volume can be achieved only by upgrading and expanding the processing
and cooler freezer facilities.
Meat Inspection and Hygiene Control
4.15      Government has initiated a number of measures to improve its
meat inspection and hygiene control services. Major changes are:
(a) Payment of meat inspectors by Government;
(b) Rotation and training of meat inspectors;
(c) Training of three engineers in facilities design
for hygiene control;
(d) Reorganization of the administration structure of
the meat inspection service;



ANNEX I
?age S
(e)  Start of construction on a national system of
truck and railcar washing, and disinfectant
points to control possible spread of foot and
mouth disease; and
(f)  Large increase in the number of meat inspection
personnei and better in-service training.
4.16      These measures are beginning to have results.  The United States
have cleared one plant and Western Germany has approved several plants.
Uruguay is exporting to over 40 countries presently.
4.17      Since the Government started reorganizing the meat inspection
service, by issuing a decree (May 14, 1969) that established a basis for an
independent, well directed, well paid, full time Government service, the
above listed changes have resulted in many improvements within the plants
and in the quality of the beef being exported.
Marketing
4.18      Meat plant offcials depend almost entirely on private sources
for market information and none of the private plants obtainl market inform-
ation from the GovernmenL.  There is a serious deficiency in curnt foreign
market information available.  Such an important area should be given much
more consideration and attention by both the meat plants and the Government.
In any pragram to maintain and increase export outlets, market information
is critical; therefore, steps hae been initiated to establish a Meat Board,
which will have broad responsibilities in marketing.
4.19      The Government has recognized the urgent need for a comprehensive
international marketing study to provide the meat processing industry, the
producer and the Government with market information for future planning as
well as for the 44av to Aav functionIng of this key industry.  A major
studv of TTruquav' s external meat and dairy markets is being conducted
by an international consulting firm. The study will provide projections on
demand for meat and meat products by product mix, promotional requirements,
product presentation, information on factors affecting demand changes,
Government policies on meat imports and hygiene standards and changing patterns
of consumption. The study will' review other exporting countries policies
and projected exports in their affect on Uruguay's future exports.
4.20      Although data is skimpy on what the future international beef
product mix wiLl be, Uruguay's beef exports are shifting from chilled and
frozen carcass beef to frozen special cuts, boneless products, cooked
frozen, chilled vacuum packaged meat and other value added products. Addi-
tional beef produced under the ?lan target have b!en included in thie proj-
ected beef export product miix for the next four years.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Services
A. Consultant and Technical Services
1.        The important technical services provided under the Bank supported
program would be continued (Table 1). In addition to the Plan Agropecuario
extension services, consultant and technical services would be provided to
support Government's effort to:
(a)  improve pasture research related to fertilizer
and grazing management trials, assist in Estenzuela's
pasture seed certification and processing program; and
(b) reorganize the meat and dairy processing industry
in Uruguay, including:
(1) modernization, expansion and improvement of
meat and dairy processing plants; and
(ii) improvement of the meat processing industry
regulation and of the meat inspection and marketing
system.
Related goods and equipment to carry out the above technical services would
also be supported under the Project.
B. Plan Agropecuario
Back round
2.        The Plan Agropecuario (PLAN) was established in 1959 to provide
technical services to participating Project ranchers. It helps farmers
prepare suitable ranch plans, recommends subloans to the Bank of the Republic
(BOR) and provides technical advice during the disbursement period. The
PLAN also provides some extension services and supports applied research
in pasture development and pasture seed production.
Performance
3.        Since 1959 the PLAN' has successfully demonstrated and promoted
the advantages of establishing improved pasture. It has maintained a



ANNEX 2
Page 2
constant lending volume during the very difficult period from 1965 to mid-
1969 when loan size was reduced by factors mainly beyond the control of
the PLAN. Overall, the PLAN has done its work well. It has a competent
staff and, with organizational changes now in progress, its performance
should improve further.
Management
4.        The PLAN is d-.rected by an Honorary Comission of seven members:
a Chairman, four delegares from the various farmer organizations, one from
the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and one from the BOR (Figure 1,
Annex 2).
Technical Staff
5.        The Technical Staff comprises a Technical Director, about 60
technicians and 11 office staff. The three Technical Directors that have
served since commencement of the PLAN have been internationally recruited.
The present Technical Director was a New Zealand professor in Farm
Management.
6.        The techniciars, all university graduates, have a good reputation
for technical competence. They are recruited following a rigorous entry,
written and oral, examination which takes three days. They are each
equipped with a vehicle and live in rural centers for better contact with
the ranchers.
C. Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of the Technical
Director <.nd the Senior A&ricultural Economist

(c) Design, organize and maintain careful indexes of the on-farm
prices of major inputs (fertilizer, seed, machines, etc.) and
outputs (cattle, sheep, wool, crops) used by PLAN borrowers;
(d)  Assess periodically the economics (using the internal rate of
return) of different systems of pasture improvement and
ranch management in the various ecological zones of Uruguay.
He will work d:;rectl'y under the Technical Director in this
matter; and
(e) Work closely wi.th the economists of the Estanzuela research
station in assessing the costs and benefits of their many
practical and successful on-farm grass/legume fertilizer
trials carried out largely on commerclal farms throughout
Uruguay.
D. Research Prolects and Seed Certification
Research
9.        Eight specific research sub-projects are being carried out at
Estanzuela Research Station In support of Plan Agropecuario Project activities.
Project funds (US$200,000) would be used in support of these activities to
purchase necessary equiment and machines.
10.       The main research areas include:
(a) studies on Agroclimatology for different regions and
hydrological characteristics of main soil types;
(b) soil fertility studies covering the main regions with
special emphasis on requirements for pasture;
(c) studies on crop and pasture rotations in rice growing
areas and on soils with erosion problems;
(d) evaluation of production possible from introduced
grasses and legumes on a regional basis under different
systems of management;
(e)  studies on pasture utilization and management including
the use of annual seasonal pastures;
(f) studies on seed production including fertilizer require-
ments and methods of establishment and management for
various grasses and legumes;



ANNEX 2
Page 5
(g)  research aimed at developing high producing beef
farming systems on Improved pasture, with special
emphasis on stock management techniques;
(h)  studies on genetic Improvement of beef cattle by
performance and progeny testing and evaluation of main
beef breeds and crosses; and
(i)  studies on sheep production and management with particular
emphasis on reproduction.
Seed Certification
11.       The goal of this Program is the supply to farmers of adequate
volumes of seeds of high yielding varieties that have been previously eva-
luated by the Centro and have been multiplied, processed and distributed
under technical control. The certification system is adapted to the
standards established by specialized international organizations. The last
step in this system is the production of certified seed which is carried
out by specialized producers generally grouped in cooperatives strategically
distributed In the different regions of the country. This program is being
developed satisfactorily and is highly supported by farmers and credit
organizations. Progress in the respective research projects has permitted
the number of crop and forage plant varietles accepted for certification
to increase gradually. The Seed Certification Program supplies the farmers
with permanent technical assistance.

URUGUAY
FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Credit, Services and Facilities
A. Background
1.        Two types of credit institutions lend to the agricultural subsec-
tor: official and private. Official banks include the monolithic Bank of
the Republic, with 52% of the total banking rural systems loan portfolio;
the National Mortgage Bank; the State Savings Bank; and the State Insurance
Bank 1/. There are also 32 private banks -- down from 48 in 1969.
2.        Inflation 2/, overstaffing and restrictive credit po'licies have
put the banking system under considerable pressure in recent years. Thus,
the private banking system is now undergoing a severe restructuring and
consolidation. Since early 1970, 16 commercial banks, including the
second largest Uruguayan-owned bank, Banco Mercantil, have declared bank-
ruptcy and a number of other private banks are, in muid-1971, considering
merger to stave off insolvency. Parliament has further added to the banking
uncertainty by passing, in preliminary form, legislation that would nation-
alize the banking system. Committees of Parliament were organized in mid-1971
to study various measures of resolving the banking crises, measures which
did not exclude nationalization. While 32 private commercial banks are
clearly excessive for a population of less than 3 million and a GDP of
US$1.7 billion per annum, the shakeout of these 32 co six or seven viable
commercial banks is likely to take some time and result in considerable
uncertainty in the interim.
3.        This annex describes the changing level o:- agricultural credit,
the Plan Agropecuario program, the results of index-ing Project subloans
after three years and the possible organization of a second lending channel,
additional to the Bank of the Republic (BOR).
1/   Credit is also provided by a parallel crediz market, though the activi-
ties of this sector have been restricted to some extent since mid-1971.
2/   To overcome the effects of inflation and a progressive increase in over-
heads, the banks have generally adopted the following policies: (a)
increased loan interest to 4% per month; (b) reduced loan terms to 6
months; (c) switched lending avenues, where possible, to those of little
risk, quick return and high profitability (speculative ventures) and in
the case of the BOR indexes had to be applied to loans7 made under Plan
Agropecuario (from January 1969).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
B. Central Bank and Monetary Policy
4.        The Central Bank (CB) was established in 1967 when BOR relinquished
its central banking functions, particularly management of the money supply.
It now has legal control over the supply of money and credit and is empow-
ered to invoke normal stabilization measures such as (a) discount rate con-
trol; (b) changes in the legal reserve ratio requirements of the banks;
(c) establishment of credit ceilings on portfolio structure; and (d) interest
rates.
Organization
5.        The policy of the Central Bank is set by a five-member Board of
Directors, all appointed by the Government. The Department of Credit has
two divisions dealing with credit operations with commercial banks: the
Discount Sector and the Plarn Agropecuario Fund (Figure 1). The Discount
Sector is important in the operation of discount lines both with Government
and banks, and is responsible for influencing the level of credit, the rates
of discount, and rates of interest on deposits and loans. The Plan
Agropecuario division, formed in early 1971, deals solely with Project
lending arrangements.
6.        In early 1968, severe credit restrictions were imposed on the
commercial banks, both on their local currency and foreign currency opera-
tions. In addition to ceilings on the portfolio structure, high reserve
requirements were also established, 40% on demand deposits, 20% on time
deposits and 16% on foreign currency deposits 1/. This policy, together with
the measures taken by the commercial banks (footnote 2, para 2), resulted
in a period of relative monetary stability but created significant short-
term credit problems in the livestock industry, which was nearly cut off
from all short-term funds for 12 months in 1968/69.  Loans to agriculture
during this period declined over 30% when adjusted for inflation. This
restriction of funds has now been lifted and the short-term credit needs of
the livestock sector are being met partially by BOR and to some extent by
commercial banks.
7.        In 1970, the ceilings on the portfolio structure of commercial
banks were removed except that the CB still requires commercial banks
to use their time deposits (more than 12 months) mainly (75%) for development
purposes, such as loans to livestock, agriculture and industrial activities.
0 these loans, at least 50% have to be made for terms of not less than 12
months.

ANNEX 3
Page 3
8.        The CB has established limits on interest rates paid out by
commercial and official banks on fixed-term deposits (30 days or more)
as follows:
More than
Amount Ur$                3 Months    6 Months       12 Months
50,000 to 250,000                  13%          14%           17%
250,000 to 1,000,000               14%          15%           18%
1,000,000 to 5,000,000             15%          16%          19%
More than 5,000,000                16%          17%           20%
However, on actual lending operations, the CB has established that the
deposit banks (official or commercial) shall not charge more than 24% interest
per annum, including all types of charges, except a 6% once-and-for-all tax
on the original loan charged to the borrower. Despite these controls, com-
mercial banks have added various commissions, surcharges and compensating
balance requirements, which have increased the effective interest rate from
24% to over 40%.
Indexing
9.        The CB has in two cases permitted indexing of loans.  The Mortgage
Bank (MB) is allowed to issue adjustable mortgage bonds. Also, medium- and
long-term loans to livestock producers borrowing funds partially provided
by Rank are adjusted according to an index based on the farm-gate price of
wool and beef. Section E provides details on the latter system.
Discount Operations
10.       In addition to economic regulation activities, the.C  has an
important role in the financing of productive activities through its discount
operations. From 1969, more than Ur$ 8,500 million (US$34 million) have been
channeled to specified activities through the commercial banks by means of
the discount lines granted by the CB. Comparing outstanding lines of dis-
count between 1969 and 1970, the CB had the following figures:

Bank of the Republic
11.       The BOR has been for many years the country's largest bank.  It
has been banker to the Government and to the rural, industrial and civil
service sectors. Its operations are especially important in agriculture,
exceeding slightly in portfolio all other commercial banks combined, as the
Table below indicates.

appointed by the Government (rigure I for nrganizational Structure).
BOR is well distributed throughout the country, withl 71 rural branches, two
rural agencies, six city agencies and a main office in Montevideo.
13.       BOR's Credit and External Business Departments are the most
impnortant in the lending activities. The Credit Department itself has six
Divisions.  In 1971, the group dealing with Plan Agropecuarlo lending was
raised to division level within the Credit Department and p'aced under a
full-time single manager.  This has improved BOR's PLending activities.
i4.       Financial Operations.  A large part of BOR assets and liabilities
arc ei ,her Government or Government-related (see tPables 7 to 3
f<,r details).  Until 1967, when the Cenrtral Bank was established, all official
ante semiofficial accounts were kept in the BOR.  Most of these accounts still
remain.  Nevertheless, its private sector lending activities are important,
especially in agriculture.
15.       Plan iAropecuarLo.  Up to mid-1971, the BOR was the only partici-
pating bank for the relending of Rank loan funds to Plan Agropecuario
ranchers. BOR, in addition, has been the relending agency for several
USAID loans for cereal growing, machinery anU for genera, purpose agriculture.
It is also "he channel for a number of IDB loans for industrial clevelopment.

16.       Through the Plan Agropecuario program, BOR has lent more than
Ur$ 2,500 million to ranchers since 1963, assisted by funds from Rank, ITSATT)
and its own resources.

17.       From 1966 to 1970, there was a six-fold increase in rural lending
through BOR, but in real terms, this increase was only 80% because the
value of the peso changed in 1968 when a new devaluation took place. Most
of the loans granted by BOR to the rural sector were for working capital
and the long-term loans were always relited to the programs of Plan Agro-
pecuario and AID.

18.       From the above, the decrease in the agricultural short-term
lending by the BOR is clearly evident in 1967 and 1968.
19.       Plan Lending.  All individual loans under the TILAN have been
made through the BOR. These loans are controlled by the Plan Agropecuario
Division, the Manager of which is responsible for practice and policy
regulations regarding the processing of all plans and applications. Until
1967, all PTAN loans were made by the central office division directly.
However, for the last three years, the bulk of the lending decisions has



ANNEX 3
Page 6
been made by branch managers after discussion with the local .PLAN technician,
which has speeded up the process considerably. Loan decisions depend upon
both the technical program of development drawn up by PLAN technicians and
on the borrower's credit-worthiness and tax payment status.
20.       Recent Legal Changes.  Under Law 12394, Art. 11 (1957), the proceeds
of the first two Bank loans were channeled exclusively through the Plan
Agropecuario Fund in the BOR. Rancher subloan amortization was paid by the
BOR into Uruguay's General Revenue to service the Bank loans. Government
absorbed both the bad debt and the exchange risks (Law 12394, Article 14)
because the Government-owned BOR was both a first floor bank and a central
bank. However, with the creation of the CB, the arrangements were changed
and now the CB is responsible for servicing the Bank loan and also for
carrying the exchange risks; the bad debt risk is taken care of by BOR.
In the event that any commercial bank becomes a lending channel for Rank
loans, similar contractual arrangements would be made, under which bad debt
risks would likewise be borne.
21.       Accounting and Auditing.  The systems followed by BOR for the
handling, storage and retrieval of accounting data are being improved by the
use of electronic processing equipment. However, credit statistics are still
handled slowly, especially in regard to the proper linkage of the operations
in the branches and their recording, processing and interpretation at the
central office. Internal auditing is done by the General Inspection Depart-
ment of BOR.
Banco Nacional Hipotecario (State Mortgage Bank - MB)
22.      The MB is a Government bank that had been operating mainly as an
urban mortgage institution but it also handles certain types of loans for
the rural sector. Before 1948, the MB had two types of operations: supplying
regular mortgage credit to assist private owners to sell or buy land and
nouses under a mortgage security system, and assisting small farmers to
obtain land under the agrarian reform and colonization laws. In 1948, and
based on a section of the MB, Instituto Nacional de Colonization (INC) was
created. It took the responsibility of lending money for redistribution of
land. Recent MB operations in the rural sector have gone from 8% of its
1961 portfolio to 17% in 1970 1/.
instituto Nacional de Colonizacion (INC)
23.       The INC is legally able to serve as intermediary on all land
transactions as well as to finance land sales. It was established as an
entity under the MB, with distinct legal and economic personality; its
capital was formed by all land holdings of the Section of Rural Development
and Colonization of the MB as well as the funds from a 'ont4 Issue of
Ur$ 20 million in 1948.
tt In 1970, the MB accumulated large deposits from an earmarked tax.
These funds were to be lent for housing construction which has lagged
behind schedule.

D. Commercial Banks
24.       Twenty-eight Uruguayan and four foreign banks, plus an unknown
number of exchange companies that perform specific exchange activities,
make up the private banking system (Table 4).  Among the Uruguayan
banks, only two remain of reasonable size: the Banco Commercial and the
Banco La Caja Obrera. Of the foreign banks, only the Bank of London and
South America and the First National Bank are of importance. Both of these
latter are considering an increase in the number of their rural offices.
Role of Commercial Banks in Agricultural Credit
25.       The volume of deposits in BOR and the comm.ercial banks amour.tcu
to more than Ur$ 78,000 m in 1971 (US$3'2 million), only 5.4,. of which was
kept in BOR; the rest went into the 32 commercial baniks. From the total
outstandlng balances on discounts granted bv Ce of [.rS 37,540 million, onlv
AS were granted to the 32 commercial banks. During the 1970 fiscal year,
commercial banks received a total TTrS 3,462 million (USS13.S million) from
CB discounts (Table 5). Most of the discounts were handled by the
official banks (Table 6).
26.       On the other hand, the total volume of credit provided by officia1
and private banks during 1970 was Ur$ 248.669 million, of which only 19% was
handled by commercial banks. The rural sector got only 9.4%, participated
in equally by BOR and commercial banks.
Additional Lending Channels
27.       As the Bank-supported lending program is covering over 4,500
ranchers, additional lending channels will be required if the full develop-
ment loan demand is to be adequately met. In December 1970, the CB notified
the banking system that all banks were considered eligible as relending
agencies for the indexed Plan loans. As a result, three showed interest,
presenting at the same time two caveats concerning participation in the
program: (a) the low interest spread, and (b) the difficulty the commercial
banks have had in obtaining adequate mortgage security.
28.       To encourage participation, the Government agreed to:  (a) provide
a more suitable combination of interest spread and percentage of discount
(3.5% on 902 reimbursement); (b) pass legislation easing the complications
of mortgage registering as security; (c) ensure that 'PLkV technicians under-
take full farm budgeting procedures where necessary; and (d) ensure provision
of training courses for personnel in the private banks in medium- and long-
term lending activities in livestock.



ANEX 3

E. Indexing
29.       Under the Fourth Project, subloans to farmers will be on the same
basis as for Loans 698-UR and 773-UR. All borrowers with 400 ha or more
will be subject to full indexing, and those with less than 400 ha will have
their loans adjusted by only 50%. Although loans for farms under 400 ha
are expected to be numerous, the major portion of funds lent will be subject
to full monetary correction.
30.       The indexing system devised by Government and now accepted by the
BOR and participating farmers was carefully worked out by the Plan with the
CB and discussed at great length during the Third Project appraisal in
June 1969. It appears that all the parties accept the system -- now legally
in force. The confidence that the farmers have in the Government's ability
to ensure them a satisfactory price for beef and wool and maintain that
price at acceptable levels in the light of changes in economic conditions
over the next decade will likely be directly related to the confidence they
will have in the system of indexing loans.
Choice of Index
31.       While acknowledging that indexing is a second-best solution, it
is nevertheless important to select the type of index that best maintains
rancher and lender confidence. Thus the problem is not the acceptability
of indexing in principle, but the acceptability to the lenders and borrowers
concerned in this particular Project of the index selected. For this rea-
son, it would be unrealistic and fruitless to search for an ideal index
that would cover all types of development lending in Uruguay. Though an
arbitrary one could be devised by Government to apply throughout the economy
on all loans, the result would probably be that borrowers and lenders in
areas out of line with the average would stop using it and rely on some other
method of compensating lenders for inflation. They might even regress to
a point of not entering into financial contracts at all.
Indexing Subloans to Beef and Wool Prices
32.       To encourage the vital livestock industry and the livestock devel-
opment program supported by this Project, Government is now using an index
on subloans, made under Plan auspices, which is based on the ranch-gate price
of beef and wool. The system, which has been accepted by over 4,000 ranchers
since 3anuary 1969, uses as a base the value of 41.6 kg of beef and 5.2 kg
of wool, calculated as the average during the period of one year between
November 1 and October 31. These index components are based on the national
average of beef and wool per ha.
33.       The CB is charged with calculating the adjustments for the period
November I to October 31 each year. It assembles data from the national
stockyard, from the national meat packing plants, from the chamber of com-
merce or from such other agencies as it may consider appropriate. Before



ANNEX 3
Page 9
March 31 of each year, the CB forwards to the BOR and any coimnercial partic-
ipating bank the adjustment factor necessary for each loan in the Project.
A translation of the legal document that borrowers now sign to obtain an
indexed loan is presented as Appendix 1 to t;his annex. In February 1970,
loans were indexed 8.7% and, in February 1971, a furtner 18.6% 1/.
1/ As world beef prices have increased by miore chan 50% between 1969 anti
1971 (US$460 to US$700 per ton), Government ?roposed in late 1970 that
the cost of living index be used as an upper limit whenever the meat
and wool index rise exceeds the cost of livi:ng rise. This was accepzed
by the Bank and this revised index is now effective.

CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES
The loan which this declaration is referred to will be adjustable according
to the following clauses:
a)   The Base Index - which will be equivalent to 100 - for determining
the adjustmnt factor, will be calculated or. the average value of
41.6 (forty-one kilogram 600 grams) of beef (fattened steer on the
hoof) and of 5.2 (five kilograms 200 grams) of wool (fleeces from
selected breeds of superior quality and above) during the period
of ome year betveen Noeer 1,          and October 31, _.
b) The adjustment will be made by taking as base the index of positive
increase in value of 41.6 kilogram of beef (fattened steer on the
hoof) and of 5.2 kilogram of wool (fleeces from selected breeds of
superior quality and above) provided by the National Stockyard in
6ccordaace with data from the National Meat Packing Plant and the
Qiamber of Comoerce, or obtained from such agencies as nay substitute
for them in the judgent of the Central Bank of Uruguay.
c) The adjustment index will be forwarded to the Bank by the Central
Bank of Uruguay before March 31 of each year.
d)   In determining the adjustment index the Central. Bank of Uruguay
will take the average prices fetched by the products indicated
in subclause b), for the year between November 1 and October 31
of the following year.
e)   Whem the value of the adjustment index is equaL to or less than
100, no revaluation of the loans will be made for that year.
f)   If, on April 30 of each year, the Bank does not have ava'lable
tho information needed to apply the corresponcAng adjustment
index, the payment made by the debtor will be accepted as a
paymut on account.
8)   The adjustment shall be applied, in accordance with the base
index established in subclause a) above, to the corresponding
fmortization installment, in such a manner that the debtor shall
repay on each occasion the amortization instaLlment due, together
with the aiount of the reevaluation in accordance with the
adjustment factor applying at the time calculated on the base
index.
h)   During the period between November 1 and April 20 of the
following year, no advanced payments shall be collected.



ANNEX 3
Appendiz 1
Page 4
Nevertheless, if the debtor should wish to make a deposit,
, the Bank shall receive the deposit
but it shall be charged to amrtization of the debt after the
corresponding revaluation has been made, the foregoing being
entirely without prejudice to the provisions of clause J) below.
i) If it is desired to make amortization payments prior to November 1
no adjustment shall be collected in respect of these. For
the following years, if amortitation payments are made prior to
Novmber t, they shall be subject to the adjustment in respect
of the t ediately preceding April 30.
j)   In the case of payments on account, priority should be given
first to the payment of the adjustment, then to the payment of
interest and finally to amortisation payments. Interest on the
loam, at the rate of % yearly, shall be calculated on the total
capital sum or outstanding balances plus the adjustments on
these balances.
k) A-Drtimtion payments that are more than six months overdue,

LeadizA Policies and Procedures
A. Participating Banks
1.        Under the Project, eligible participating banks would lend to
ranchers and borrowrs based on the criteria outlined below:
(a)  Ugtbility - Participating banks would determine the finan-
cial creditworthiness of borrowers as the basis for lending.
They would not alter the ranch or farm plan as approved by
the PLAN.
(b)  Terms and Conditions -
(i)  Development loans to ranchers and farmers would be
made for 80X of the investment costs stated in the
approved ranch plan. Working capital loans (heifer
retention and start-up pig feed costs) would be made
for 100X of the approved amounts, such amounts being
established solely from the farm budget approved by
the PLAN. Loans to contractor's would be made for
7OS of the congcactor's PLAN approved investments.
(ii) The indexing mechanism used under Loan 698-UR which
was established by law in January 1970 would be
applied to the principal of all subloans made under
the Project (see Annex 3 for details).
(iii) The term of development loans to ranchers and borrowers
would be recommended to participating banks by the PLAN
on the basis of the farm budget and zhe ability of the
borrower to service his debt from additional income
generated from the Project supported investments. The
minimum term would be seven years and maximum 10 years
with a maximum grace period of 2 and 4 years respectively.
Contractor loans would be made for a minimum of five and
maximum of seven years with a grace period of one year.
The term of the working capital loans would be based on
the budget considerations arising out of the cash analysis
of the farm budget with a minimum and maximum term of
3 to 7 years respectively and including a minimum and
maximum grace period of 1 to 3 years.
(iv)  The interest rate would be 11% on al. loans, inclusive
of all charges, fees and commissions. Any changes in
this rate would be subject to Bank approval.
(c) Approvals - All ranch, farm and contractor proposed invest-
ment plans would be approved by the PLAN and any proposed



AJn   3
Appendix 2
Page 2
iuetmuent over lM     .,00 in val.uae would be ubject to
B1k approval.
(d)  Disbursments sd  1T    - Participating banks would keep
a separate acecout of Project supported lending activities,
have such accounts audited by external auditors each year,
and submit the ompleted audits through the Central B1k to
the Bank not later than few montbs after the close of the
financial year. The status of each borrower's loan account
(interest, outstanding balance, peymets) would be sent to
itis pariodcally.
(.)  S sion - PLAN  staff womld undertake periodic upervision
iits  to   oject ranches to ensure that the investments as
outlined in the ranch plan are being ade as agr*sd.
(tI)  Lo s for S&ifer Puu   e and Retention - Nuds fog heifer
puciias  would be isciuded as part of the development loan
on the terus established in para I (b). Separate loans for
heifer retention wold be _me on shorter terms -(ee also
per 1 b)).- Both ty    of loaw  would only be ade if the
rEch or farm l- more than 202 of the pasture are improved,
the rancher practiees good herd and pasture mmagment, the
Fe eed heifers are specifically maTked by the  No, and
t-e rancher is retaining the maxiuim number of breeding
heifs from the biologic increase in his mm herd.
B. Central Bank
2.       I%* Central Bank vwld establish relending criteria as follows:
(a) The Central Bank would establish eligibility criteria for
bak partteipation baeed on pat experience and performance
in agricultural lendlag,  aagerial capacity, ember of
branches in rural aras and their financial condition. All
loan agreements with participating banks would be subject
to prior Bank approaal and their sut,dLssion to the lank must
be acoampeied by the ltest detailed financial data (bal-
sume sheet and profit and los statement).
(b) teiabursement percentage to the participating banks would
be 38% for increnestal working capital loans and 100% for
contractor loans. For on-fam development loans, a
gradutted scale would be establishec to encourage fu;ler
subloan contributiors by the participating banks. The
scale would be as follows:

20             5%          6
For coutractor and working capital loans, a fixed interest
rate of 7.5Z would be charged. Any changes in these reim-
bursement percentages and interest rates would be subject
to Rank approval.
(c) A separate account in the Livestock Fund would be established
for this Project and audited annually by the Tribunal de
Cuentas. The audit would be completed and the accounts and
audit report submitted to the Bank not later than 4 months
after the close of the financial year.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Impact of Bank Lending Program (1959-1971)
A. Pasture Improvements and Ranch Management Practices
1.        Before the Plan Agropecuario (PLAN) commenced its development
program in 1961, Uruguay had improved some 128,000 ha of pasture land 1/.
However, most pastures were poorly established and reverted back to dominant
native grass after several years because ranchers did not practice modern
grassland management methods or use sufficient phosphate fertilizer.
2.        With this limited experience, the first ranch development plans
were made in 1960, with considerable caution and "educated guessing" but
with full appreciation of the role of phosphate fertilizer, legumes and
rhizobia. The first Technical Director recruited a core of about 10 to 12
able technicians, all University graduates in Agriculture and some with a
farming background or practising farmers. Intensive in-service training in
all phases of plan preparation and supervision, including economic aspects,
equipped these men to prepare and supervise the first plans made under
Loan 245-UR. Their ranks included specialists in irrigation and machinery.
Some 76 plans were put into operation by 1961.
3.        From a modest beginning, the technical corps of the Plan Agrope-
cuario, now under a fourth foreign Technical Director, has grown to 67,
including three specialists in water and irrigation, three specialists in
farm economics and production records, a specialist extension supervisor,
a specialist machinery adviser, and an experienced seed production officer.
Included are a Deputy Technical Director, five program chiefs, and eight
area chiefs to supervise and coordinate the work of the Regional Technicians.
The majority of the original technicians appointed are still with the PLAN
in senior positions, testifying to the care exercised in their selection and
the esprit de corps that exists in the organization. The output of technical
ranch plans today has reached a figure of about 4,000 per annum.
4.        In addition, technical assistance in all aspects of pasture and
animal production is provided to all financially-assisted farmers as well
as to others requesting this service. The PLAN, in fact, provides the
1/   1961 census.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
only organized extension service in this field in Uruguay, providing a
nucleus for extension activities that are now being developed in dairy
beef and pigs and may, in future, cater for mixed cropping with livestock.
5.        Complex pasture seed mixtures were used in early ranch plans to
obtain information on ecotypes adapted to the varied pasture environments. By
June 1965, Loan 245-UR, for US$7 million, had been disbursed, providing
technical and financial assistance to 1,446 farmers to improve 130,000 ha and
making available seed and fertilizer (and considerable technical assistance)
for the improvement of 100,000 ha by large farmers who were not permitted to
borrow under the Program. The experience gained under the first loan, along
with the extensive experimentation carried out, and the collaborative trials,
particularly with La Estanzuela Research Center, resulted in the solution
of the main technical problems. By the end of 1964, tae role and economy
of conventional sowing, sodseeding, special purpose pastures, mixed sowing
(with cereals), topdressing and oversowing, including aerial sowing, refer-
tilization, pelleting of legume seed, and the prime importance of adequate
and specific strains of rhizobia, were fully understood. Modern machinery
and equipment had been imported and put to efficient use.
laoculum
6.        Many early pasture failures were traced to nonviable or inef-
ficient inoculum. Under the guidance and work of an expert seconded to
the Plan by FAO, these problems were solved and the selection of suitable
specific strains of rhizobia and the local manufacture of inoculum were
initiated. Today, Uruguay is a leader in this important field in South
America and exports inoculum to neighboring countries.
Silage and gaymakinB
7.        Conservation of surplus pasture in spring and early summer
for winter use was ar. early recommendation but adoption by farmers has been
slow. Silage making is not popular, largely because of labor involved in
"feeding-out", and seii-feeding has noc been adequately demonstrated.  Hay-
making is preferred for pasture conservation. The greater use of hay and/or
silage is being encouraged by the Technical Director. A new type of hay
baler, now available in Argentina, which makes and transports 1-ton bales that
can be placed and covered in a cornier of the hay paddock, is of special
interest to Uruguay.
rtilizer_Us.ige
The early recommendations on fertilizer use have been justified by
subsequent research. Extensive field trials, in progress (by La Estanquela,
tine Plan and other agencies), will enable refinements to be made in recom-
mendations on pasture establishment, management, fertilizer requirements,
pasture utilization, and mineral deficiencies for the various ecological
zones.

9.        Phosphate (P20 ) usage increased from about 11,000 tons in 1960 to
about 49,000 tons in 1978, stimulated by the provision of credit and sub-
sidies (valued at US$2.4 million). Nine special airplanes for aerial sowing
and four modern bulk trucks have been imported through the PLAN and, in 1970,
some 30,000 ha were oversown by plane.
Animal Production
10.       All avenues of animal production (except poultry) in Uruguay
are sponsored by financial and/or technical assistance through the PLAN.
Improved techniques, especially modern efficient beef breeding and
production methods, are being widely and successfully promulgated by PLAN
technicians. Animal health is good under improved nutritional levels and
diagnostic services are being organized.
Pasture Production
11.       Only a small percentage (15%) of pasture and land improvement
has been directed toward dairy production. The main effort has been to
increase beef production and improve breeding efficiency in both sheep and
cattle. Before improvement, production from natural pasture is estimated
at 70 to 75 kg of beef (liveweight)/ha. Although exceptional yields of
1,000 kg/ha (beef liveweight) are reported, the fertilization of natural
grasslands is estimated to produce about 180 kg/ha; oversowing and sodseeding,
about 220 kg/ha; and conventional pastures, about 400 kg/ha.
12.       While conventional pastures have a high initial production, this
cannot be maintained without good grassland management. The typical pattern
shows decline after two or three years due to invasion by native species
resulting after a few years, in a stable level of production, about 3 to 3-1/2
times that of natural pasture. Sodseeded, oversown, and topdressed natural
pastures with refertilization and good management improve gradually to a
similar level. 220 to 230 kg (liveweight)/ha is a conservative estimate of
average production from improved pastures. This is the estimate used in
deriving the representative models used in the appraisal report for the
Fourth Project.
13.       Certification.  Under the guidance of an FAO expert in seed produc-
tion and processing a seed certification scheme is in operation in Uruguay.
The scheme sponsored by the Plan is administered by La Estanzuela Research
Center.
14.       Processing.  There are two official seed processing plants, the
plant at La Estanzuela with a capacity of 4 tons/8 hrs (financed under
Loan UR-245) and that at the Abastecimientos Agropecuario with a capacity
of 12 rons/8 hrs. Smaller plants are operated by various Cooperatives, and
these smaller plants are of importance to local seed producers and the PLAN
proposes to assist in modernizing these plants where necessary. With the



ANNEX 4
Page 4
existing modern plants available and modest plans for updating and expanding
facilities as required, Uruguay's plans to become self-sufficient in pasture
seed requirements would seem to be a realistic goal.
B. Beef Production and Processing for Export
15.       The effect of the introduction of new technology has begun to
have an impact on beef production for export. During the past three
years, Uruguay has consistently exported more than 100,000 m tons of
beef, reaching 151,000 m tons in 1970.
16.       Since the initiation of the PLAN, some 1.2 million ha of pasture
(about 7% of total area) have been sown with and without PLAN assistance.
17.       In the 10-year period, 1951 to 1960, beef production averaged about
263,000 tons/year.  Following two bad drought years in 1966 and 1967, produc-
tion recovered to 339,000 tons in 1968 and increased to 360,000 tons in
1970. The increase in production during the operation of the PLAN to 1970
is some 90,000 tons/year. If this increase can be attributed to the improvea
production from the 1.2 million ha of improved pastures, it is calculated at
75 kg of meat per ha or 150 kg liveweight per ha. The output from unimproved
natural pasture is estimated at about 70 kg (liveweight)/ha, so that the
total annual output of the improved pastures would be about 220 kg
(liveweight)/ha. This is remarkably close to the average estimated output
of improved pastures, which is about three times that of natural camp, or
some 220 to 230 kg (liveweight)/ha.
18.       If present rates of annual pasture improvement continue (300,000
ha per annum), Government export targets of 220,000 m tons by 1975, worth
nearly US$150 million, could be realized.
C. Income Distribution and Social Effects
19.       The main banefit of the program has been economic -- more beef
for export, thereby substantially aiding the balance of payments. The
Government, however, has been acutely aware of the social implication and
the results of its program within agriculture and, more widely, on income
distribution within Uruguay.
Income Redistribution: Agriculture to Urban
20.       Uruguay, after the Second World War, developed the most advanced
income redistribution policy in the Western Hemisphere. Early retirement,
minimum wage laws, free medical services, free education up to and beyond



ANNEX 4
Page 5
university levels, inexpensive subsidized transport, paid compulsory
vacations and related benefits, effectively redistributed wealth from
the agricultural sector to the urban sector. Uruguay's social security
sector, for example, in the early 1960's took receipts and paid benefits
equal to about 12% of GDP--one of the highest ratios in the world. (U.S.
paid 6% of its GDP in such benefits in 1970). Eroded by inflation,
benefits dropped to 6% of GDP in the mid-1960's but by 1969 had begun to
rise again, achieving 7.5% of GDP. By 1969, agricultural income was taxed
over 30% while urban incomes were taxed at about 12%. Although agriculture
is still being taxed as heavily, the structure of the system has changed
so that it stimulates rather than discourages extra production. This has
not only assisted Government in its important stabilization program, but has
also enabled it to raise minimum wages substantially, and begin to restore
the arrears in social security payments, whose benefits were badly eroded
during the severe mid-1960 inflation. Since partial taxation of the extra
production and income arising from increased livestock production contributes
substantially to public revenues, continued production stimulation is vital if
social stability is to be reestablished in Uruguay.
Consistency with Production Goals
21.       To make the redistribution of income objective consistent with
the objective of increased production, a land productivity tax (Spanish
initials IMPROME) is now being introduced. Its effectiveness is largely
untested, however, because it was approved by Parliament only three years
ago (October 1968).
22.       On the basis of farm size alone, IMPROME has the following
general effects:
(a) No tax will be paid by farmers whose gross production
is less than the equivalent of 200 ha of national
average production, and producers holding up to
2,500 ha can daduct the first 200 ha, valued at
national average production levels;
(b) Producers with farms between 200 and 1,000 ha will
pay less through I3PROME than they did under the
old system, which was mainly concerned with export
duties (detracciones);
(c) Fiscal pressure will be approximately equivalent under
the two systems in the 1,000- to 2,500-ha bracket;
(d)  Producers whose ranch sizes are be-ween 2,500 and
5,000 ha will pay more through IMPROME than they
did under the old system; and
(e) Fiscal pressure will reach almost confiscatory levels
for ranches over 5,000 ha.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
23.       Tt is evident that IMPROME was designed to have a land redistribu-
tion effect, giving the new tax social and economic as well as fiscal pur-
noses. It also encourages efficient producers because production per hectare
al,ove the assumed figure Roes untaxed--the greater the production over the
assumed figure, the greater the untaxed margin. Purthermore, since the land
nroductivitv tax must be naid by all farmers under the assumption that they
all  ro4ouce wool, beef and mutton (wbm), the system encourages more intensive
farming, such as crons, dairy, nork and poultry. No matter what a farmer
really oroduces, he pays on a wbm basis, which allows his production in other
areas to go largely untaxed. Since of the country's 16.5 million ha of ag-
ricultural land, hetween 14 and 15 million ha are used for livestock grazing,
this benefit is realized bv a sector of small farmers that occupy between
1.5 and 2 million ha.
Tncome Redistribution: Within the Agricultural Sector
24.       Aside from encouraging the small farmer through this IMPROME tax
svstem, (Zovernment has been pursuing a series of measures under the Bank
lending program that directly affect the incomes of small producers. In
1070, 72% of the 3,600 loans made under the Plan went to farmers holding less
than 5n0 ha, with 34% going to farmers with less than 100 ha. These small
loans (averaging about US'4600 each) are costly in technical services, but
Government considered this an important function of the 'PLAN and provided
funds from the general budget to cover it. In the plan law, Government has
stated that such technical service costs can go up to 10% of loans made.
2-5.      Also, the incomes of smaller farms are subsidized through the
indexing mechanism. Loans to farmers holding less than 200 ha are adjusted
onlv to 507 of the index charge. With inflation at 15 to 20% per year,
this is a significant subsidy.
3uthsidies
'6.       Farmers investing under PATAN auspices receive substantial
sjbsidies (15T) on phosphate fertilizer, paid from earmarked export tax
nroceeds on beef and wool. In this way, part of the export tax receipts
£oes back to the agricultural sector, partly compensating efficient
farmers and nenalizing those who do not invest.
nairv Reef and Pigs
57.       Peginning in 1Q71, the >1TAN has given particular emphasis to
dairv beef and pig production, carried out on farms of less than 100 ha.
This involves intensive livestock production systems by tJruguayan standards.
Bank loan funds should support overseas training programs for the two
snecial ists recentlv hired bv the PLAN to deal with these programs.



ANNEX 4

Indirect Benefits
28.       The successful operations of the Plan Agropecuario in the
livestock sector have generated widespread interest in replicating the
PLAN extension system.  For example, a PLAN GRANJERO (small farms program
for fruits and horticulture) has been organized on the PLAN model. Parlia-
ment approved the bill late in-1968, but chairman selection problems did
not allow the program to start functioning until 1970.
29.       Land Reforms.  Emphasis has also been given to the colonization
program and operations of the National Colonization Institute (INC) have
increased in recent years. This Institute is mainly concerned with settlement
projects for landless farmers, but the area colonized has still not reached
significant proportions (255,500 ha settled from 1948 to 1970). The func-
tioning of the Institute, however, has been improved recently and Government
expects it to operate more effectively in future. The PLAN has actively
cooperated with the Institute, and 178 farmers settled under INC sponsorship
received PLAN credit in 1970.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Beef Production on Dairy Farms
Introduction
1.        Uruguay, in its drive towards increased beef production for export,
has proposed a sub-project directed at the development of 900 small (450 each
year for 2 years) mixed dairy farms of about 100 ha each for dairy beef
production. This subproject would produce beef worth US$900,000 on the
export market. The same output of milk from each farm would be maintained
by fewer cows producing at a higher level. The improved pastures would
remove the need for concentrate feeds, which now constitute nearly
25% of the cost of milk production.
Background
2.        Economic Importance and Production Patterns.  Dairying is an
important sector of Uruguayan agriculture, contributing about 16% of the
country's total agricultural output, which is equivalent to the contribution
from wool. On the 79,193 farms of over 1 ha in Uruguay, over 8,000 are com-
mercial dairy farms; 60% are under 100 ha.  The average dairy farm is 103 ha.
3.        In 1970, milk production was 740 million liters, of which 450
million were consumed as fresh milk; 280 million were processed into such
products as butters, butter oil, cheese, ice cream, duice de leche, yogurt,
casein, and dry milk powder; and 10 million were used on the farm for calf
and pig feeding. About 70% of the milk is produced in the spring and fall
of the year.
4.        The main milk production area is concentrated around Montevideo
in the Departments of Canelones, San Jose, Florida and Colonia (Map 3).
Herd size is about 50 to 60 animals except in Florida where the average herd
is about 100 animals. Smaller quantities of milk are produced in the De-
partments of Maldonado, Durazno, Soriano and Paysandu.
5.        The national dairy herd is comprised of some half million animals,
of whic'c about 60% are dairy cows and in calf heifers. About 60% of dairy
cattle are Friesians 1/ of good dairy merit. Reasonable levels of production
are attained under good feeding and management (4,000 l/annum compared to
low production level (1,500 1/annum) on the average dairy farm).
I/   The remainder are Normandy, 7.7%; Shorthorn, 4.5%; crossbreeds and
others, 29.6% (source: O.P.Y.A., 1966).



ANNEX 6
Page 2
6.        A comparison between 10 dairy farms with 30Z of pastures improved
under the Plan Agropecuario and 10 typical unimproved dairy farms in the San
Jose district shows an increase in yield from 1,568 1 to 2,314 1/cow and a
decrease in expenditure on concentrate feeds from US$9 to US$3/cow.
7.        Productivity.  Inadequate nutrition is the main reason for low pro-
duction due to overstocking to meet an over-ambitious quota. Concentrate
ration is consequently used in excessive amounts to make up deficiencies
in both the quantity and quality of feed available. Conaprole, the main sup-
plier of concentrate, indicates that it is used by about 97Z of suppliers,
who purchase about 470/kg/cow/annum. Concentrate is used throughout the
year, starting at about 3 kg/cow/day in the spring and increasing througb
summer and autumn to about 4.6 kg/cow/day in the winter. Improved pastures,
as recommended in the Project, greatly reduce this requirement, consequently
resulting in more efficient production.
8.        Forage crops occupy about 28X of the farm area, and are low yield-
ing due to poor cultural techniques and insufficient fertilizer (only about
10Z of crops fertilized). Improved pastures occupy a small part of the farm
(about 8Z), the grazing area being unimproved pastures or, commonly, tumble
down pasture following cropping. Hay and silage-making equipment is rarely
owned, with less than 50% of the dairy farmers making hay and about 12%,
silage.
Husbandry
9.        Dairy farms are labor intensive, 2.6 labor units are employed per
farm, and about 22,000 persons for dairy production. About 97% of the herds
are milked by hand, although there are a few modern milking parlors (herring
bones). There is no set calving pattern; cows calve down all year
round, with a preponderance in autumn. Many cows are milked over an unduly
long lactation and may produce less than two 1/day during winter. Poor man-
agement and nutrition results in lowered calving percentage, a low calving
interval and a high percentage of dry-stock in the herd. On only about 12%
of the dairy farms are the heifers sufficiently developed to calve down be-
fore three years of age, and an average of five lactations per cow is
achieved by only about 50% of dairy farms. Calf rearing is costly since milk
is sometimes fed for six to eight months (about 550 1/calf). As a conse-
quence of the high cost of rearing, only a minimum of calves are home reared,
the rest being sold (for rearing elsewhere but mainly for slaughter as manu-
facturing meat) during their first week.
10.       Marketing and Processing.  The main dairy processor is Conaprole
(National Milk Producers' Cooperative). Each year, Conaprole receives and
processes 250 million liters of milk from 3,150 producers (140 million 1 for
liquid consumption and 110 million 1 for manuf&cturing). Milk produced in
excess of the assigned quota is purchased as manufacturing milk at a lower
price. Farmgate price for quota and manufacturing milk is 31 pesos/1 and
21 pesos/l respectively. Eighteen private dairies process pasteurized fluid
milk for inland cities. However, the major portion of their supply goes to
dairy products for internal consumption and export markets. Over 54% of the



ANNEX 6
Page 3
fluid milk in the country is consumed as raw milk and only 25% (187 million
1) of total milk supply is vasteurtzed.  LarRe ouantiltes of cheese are
still made in small lots on individual farm dairies, particularly when
country roads are impassable.
11.       At present, potential internal demand is considered negligible
in view of Uruguay's current high consumption of dairy products (250 1 of
fluid milk equivalent per capita). Except for slight increases in domestic
consumption due to population growth, additional milk must be processed for
export.
12.       Dairy Product Exports.  The potential for international markets
is uncertain at the moment although the possibilities for exporting dairy
products to other Latin American countries appear to be good. This forecast
is based on recent exports of cheese, butter, butter oil and cream to
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Export prices of dairy
products have increased significantly since 1968, with the largest increases
occurring during the past five months of 1971. At the beginning of 1969,
surpluses existed that could not be marketed. But, during 1969, Uruguay was
able to find export markets for all surpluses. Value of dairy products ex-
ported was about US$0.9, US$1.5 and US$3.5 million for years 1968, 1969 and
1970 respectively. Since export markets are recent and little information is
available on projected demand for dairy products, a market study is being
organized (para 14).
13.       Pricing Policies.  Until July 1971, Uruguay subsidized the export
of dairy products by giving a reimbursement from the Government budget to the
processor for an additional 20 to 30% of the FOB export value. In July 1971,
Gover ment removed this subsidy and devalued the peso from 248 to 365 per
dollar for such non-traditional exports as dairy products. At the new ex-
change rate, the farm-gate blended milk price (average price for fluid milk
and industrial milk) in Uruguay compares favorably with most other countries.
14.       Market Studies.  Two studies are currently under consideration
by the Uruguayan GoverDment. The first is a short review of the dairy product
export markets in Latin America. Consultant proposals have been invited
and results should be available by October 1971. If the results are positive,
Government intends to commission a detailed review of the dairy processing
industry (public and private) and to develop a Plan of Action for future
investment in the industry.
The Dairy Beef Pilot Sub-Project
15.       The Project would require an investment of about US$2 million,
of which it is estimated the foreign exchange component would be a little over
US$1 million. The benefits accruing would not only be the small but
significant increase in beef production but the introduction of new techno-
logies and the demonstration of efficient milk production, along with
profitable utilization of surplus dairy calves. Dairy farm incomes (for
the typical farm) would rise sharply from US$3,000 before development
to about US$4,500 in the fifth year.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Pig Sub-sector and the Hog ProJect Sub-Component
A. The Pig Sub-Sector
1.        The Government is stressing pig production so that pork can be used
as a substitute for beef on the internal market. The plan target was set to
increase production by some 3,800 tons (carcass weight), which it is estimated
would allow an equivalent increase in beef exports. Such an increase would
be valued at some US$2 million in extra foreign exchange. The Project sub-
component is estimated to cost about US$2.3 million with a foreign exchange
cost of about US$1 million.
Production
2.        Pig production has been stable for some years at about 28,000 tons
(liveweight) from a national herd of about 383,000 animals , which contributes
about 4% to the output of the livestock sector. The animals are slaughtered
mainly at heavy weight (120 to 130 kg), over one year old, to supply a local
demand for manufacturing pork, for sausages of various kinds and for a small
output of bacon. A small proportion are killed as "suckling pigs" at a
liveweight under 20 kg. Production is carried out mainly on small farms
under 50 ha located close to the centers of population.
Husbandry
3.        An extensive system of husbandry is commonly employed and pigs are
born and reared in the field, with access to simple shelters. A minimum
of grain is fed to supplement grazing, which is extremely variable in both
quantity and quality. As a consequence of poor husbandry and nutrition,
only one litter of three to five pigs is generally produced and reared per
annum. Under the best extensive conditions, two litters of up to five pigs
each may be achieved, but these are seldom marketed much under one year of
age. The heavy-weight, overfat pigs marketed do not have consumer appeal
as fresh pork. In Uruguay, fresh pork is more expensive than beef, whereas
in developed countries, pork usually costs only 70% of fresh beef price.
Disease and Hygiene
4.        Swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease can cause serious loss
although, under good management conditions, both have been contained and
eradicated by vaccination and hygiene control. Likewise, internal and
external parasites, pulmonary diseases, arthritis, excessive piglet motality,

are efficiently controlled in those piggeries where modern husbandry tech-
niques are practiced and adequate up-to-date facilities are provided.
B. The 1971 Pilot Program
5.        Modern pig production techniques are known in Uruguay and high
outputs of good quality porkers have been achieved. In 1971, the Plan
Agropecuario financed a pilot program of five units of 50 breeding sows and
10 units of 25, which it estimates will achieve an annual output of some
8,000 quality porkers of 60 to 65 kg liveweight.
6.        Detailed records are being kept for each unit to provide data that
will enable possible refinements to the hog production sub-projects proposed
for the years 1972 and 1973 under the Fourth Livestock Development Project.
Additionally, investigations are being carried out to determine, under
Uruguayan conditions, the extent to which grazing can be used as a substi-
tute for concentrates by the breeding sow.
C. Local Market and Processing Facilities
The Market
7.        During the 1940's, Uruguay exported an average of 3,000 m tons of
pork annually but, following a pronounced downward trend that started in
1950, such exports ceased altogether in 1954. The present per capita level
of donestic consumption is estimated at about 8 kg per annum, almost
entirely as processed pork, compared with 30 kg of pork and pork products
in the U.S.
8.        In 1969, the University of the Republic carried out a survey of
retail butchers to assess the demand for fresh pork on the retail market in
Montevideo. The main conclusions reached were that an extra 22,360 pigs of
the type and weight presently marketed (over 100 kg liveweight) could be ab-
sorbed per annum. An important conclusion reached was that the consumer
clearly prefers pork of lower fat content than is generally available.
Processinu
9.        Four major meat packers slaughtered pigs during 1970 but, due to
lack of domestic demand, only one slaughtered a large number (20,533 head).
Since all pork is consumed locally, small slaughterhouses, which usually do
not have meat inspection services, kill the balance of the pigs processed.
Since little pork is consumed fresh, pork sides are usually sent to small
sausage makers, who cool, bone and process the meat. The present pig pro-
cessing techniques are designed to utilize the whole pig carcasss for
sausage products and the demand for this type of pork meat wlll continue.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
1.        The economic rate of return of the Project was calculated on the
baels of data shown in Table 1. Key assumptions and adjustments made were:
(a) that the prices of investment and operating cost items would
remain at current price levels except farm workers wages
which are assumed to increase by about 18% over the Project
period in recompense for productivity gains;
(b)  the prices of all outputs would remain at current price
levels;
(c) incremental herd values were credited to the Project at
the end of the life of the investments after 12 years;
(d) all PLAN administrative and technical services provided to
the Project were charged to the Project;
(e) taxes, which would be transfer payments, were not charged to
the Project but fertilizer subsidy is charged.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of returr would
be about 30%. Should actual incremental producteon be valued dt 10% less,
due either to a drop in all output prices or a shortfall in physical
production, the economic rate of return would be about 19Z.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Beef Commodity Review
Major Developments in Beef and Veal Production and Consumption in
Principal Consuming and Producing Regions, 1960-1969
1.        Production of beef and veal in North America and Western Europe,
the world's two leading consumers of these meats, increased 48 percent and
36 percent respectively from 1956-60 to 1970. Expansion of output was par--
particularly rapid in North America during 1963-67 and in the European
Community (EEC) during 1965-68 (Table 1). Per capita consumption of beef
and veal in both regions increased significantly during the 1960's, too:
25 percent in the United States, 20 percent in the EEC, and between 200-400
percent in several Southern European Countries (Table 1). Effective consumer
demand was particularly strong in the EEC, where per capita consumption held
near record levels during the last half of the decade, in spite of sizable
increases in beef prices. 1/ Equivalent gains in cattle prices in England
and Wales during the 1960's undoubtedly contributed to the drop in per
capita consumption of beef and veal which occurred in the United Kingdom
since 1962.
2.        Beef and veal production in the world's three major net exporting
regions (South America, Oceania, and Eastern Europe) increased between 30-70
percent from 1956-60 to 1969 (Table 1). Trends were highly irregular in both
South America and Oceania, however, where output declined significantly for
several years during the middle of the decade before resuming its expansion
during 1968 and 1969. Per capita consumption declined sharply in leading
exporting countries in both regions. This pattern did not apply to Eastern
Europe, where large increases in production yielded supplies sufficient to
double per capita consumption in the leading exporting country, Yugoslavia,
as well as doubling exports from the whole region.
Principal Changes in Volume, Value, ald Directions of Tnternational
Trade in Beef and Veal, 1960-69
3.        Exports of beef and veal meat from 46 selected countries 2/ increasee
96 percent between 1960-69, and in 1969 totalled slightly more than 6 billion
1/   In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, wholesale prices for
fat cattle during 1967-69 averaged 20 percent higher than in 1962.
2/   Countries in North and South America, Europe, and Oceania, plus the ten
countries in Asia and Africa indicated in Table 2.

pounds (2.75 million metric tons) on a carcass weight equivalent (CWE)
basis 1/ (Table 2). The growth of this trade during the 1960's was highly
irregular:  exports declined 15 percent during 1964 and 1965 and were only
about 14 percent higher in 1969 than in 1963 (Table 2). Changes in volumes
shipped from South America, the major supplier of imported beef to Europe,
explained nearly all the yearly variations in exports. South American
exporters supplied 40 percent of the net increase in exports which occurred
during the decade, Australia and New Zealand, 18 percent, and Eastern Europe,
11 percent; all the rest was explained by bigger intra-regional trade between
North American and Western European countries.
4.        Most indicators of international prices for beef declined from
1960-63, (concurrently with the fairly rapid expansion in exports which
occurred during these four years) and then rose rapidly from 1963-65
(Table 3), as exports from South America dropped sharply. During 1966-69,
three of these indicators showed divergent trends: Import valuations in
the United Kingdom stabilized following the devaluation.of the pound sterling
in 1967; prices, c.i.f. German ports, declined sharply in 1967 and 1968,
reflecting the combined effects of the implementation of the Common Agricul-
tural Policy in the EEC, the diversion of exports of South American bone-in
beef to the Continent because of temporary bans on such imports by the
United Kingdom, and the sharp increase in beef production in the EEC during
1967 and 1968. Finally, average prices of beef shipped to the United States
continued to rise steadily during the last half of the decade (Table 3).
Comparisons of volumes and values of beef exports during the 1960's indicate
that exportable supplies were fully sufficient to meet current levels of
effective import demand in Europe and the United States during 1961-63, and
also during 1966-68. Supplies were not large enough to meet importers'
requirements in 1964-, 1965, and 1969.
5.        All the net decline in international trade in beef and veal during
1964 and 1965 can be explained by smaller exports fron South America and
smaller imports by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain. 2/ The
decline in exports from South America was closely related to the drop in beef
production in Argentina (Table 3). The drop in imports into the United
1/ Bone-in cuts, boneless meat, and cooked, prepared, or canned meat items
converted into dressed weight equivalent, or the weight of the dressed
beef or veal carcass. This conversion excludes offals, animal fats:
exports of live animals -- cattle and calves -- are not included in
these figures, either. This estimate might overstate world trade in
beef and veal meat slightly. Imports in 1969 identifiable by both ori-
gin and destination amounted to only 2.43 million metric tons (Table
2). Current FAO estimates of 1970 net trade balances for most countries
in the world except Asian centrally-planned countries estimate net ex-
ports of 2.65 million metric tons, including CWE of live animals.
2/ Exports by Oceania and imports by the EEC actually increased (Table 2).



ANNEX 12

States during 1964 reflected the enactment of the Meat Import Act (PL88-482)
and the sharp rise in beef production that year (Table 1). The further
decline in imports the following year reflected the further increase in
beef production in 1965 and the relative increase in production of cow beef.
Relative import prices favored diverting some beef shipments from the United
States to Western Europe during 1964 and 1965 (Table 3), and this in fact
did occur: imports into the United States dropped 52 percent between 1963-65,
and shipments to the EEC increased 60 percent (Table 1). Strong demand in
Western European markets was confirmed by relatively high import prices in
Both the United Kingdom and Germany (Table 3).
6.        Sharply different trends evolved in the direction and value of
international beef trade during 1966, and several of these developments
persisted through 1969. First, exportable supplies increased sharply
because of sharp gains in output in Argentina (Table 3). Actual exports
from that country increased 53 percent between 1965-69 (on a CWE basis).
Prices for imported frozen and chilled beef in Western Europe came under
considerable pressure during 1966-68 because of larger exports of these
products from Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, 1/ and smaller effective
import demand in Western Europe. 2/ Import demand in EEC strengthened during
1969, partly because of the slowing down in the rate of growth of beef
production in Western Europe. Argentine exports of chilled and frozen beef
to the United Kingdon recovered to about their 1964-67 levels, too; and more
South American chilled and frozen beef was exported during 1969 than any
year since 1963 (Table 4), and at much higher prices. 3/
Current Organization and Structure of International Trade in Beef and Veal
Reasons for Persistent Price Instability
7.        Cyclical trends in beef production in Argentina explain nearly all
the yearly variation in representative values for imported beef in Western
Europe during 1963-69 (Table 3). The same inverse relationship between
1/ Exports, on a product weight basis, increased nearly 30% (Table 4).
2/   Which in turn reflected progressively higher import taxes for most beef
and veal imported into the EEC, currency devaluarion in the United King-
dom, the temporary ban on bone-in beef from South American countries by
the United Kingdom during part of 1967 and 1968, and larger beef pro-
duction in Western Europe during 1967 and 1968.
3/   Table 3 indicates average import values for boneless beef and quarters
in the United Kingdom was 40% higher in 1969 than in 1963, and prices,
c.i.f. German ports, for the same kind of carcass beef (Argentine fro-
zen quarters) increased 26% during the same seven years. The differ-
ence in price changes reflects the slight changes which occurred in the
composition of the imported product in the U.K. and the progressively
higher import taxes levied by the EEC on most beef imported for direct
human consumption.



ANNEX 12

cattle slaughter or beef production in Argentina and international beef
prices has held true since 1950. Similar fluctuations in beef production in
the United Kingdom and the EEC influenced international beef prices into a
relatively minor extent during the 1960's. Yearly variation in per capita
consumption of beef in Argentina reflected principally changes in beef
supplies (number of cattle slaughtered), although changes in consumer
purchasing power relative to beef prices influenced amounts of beef eaten,
too. Exporters did not compete particularly effectively for available
supplies with domestic consumers of beef in this country: when production
was down, smaller percentages of total supplies were exported, regardless
of high prices prevailing abroad (e.g., 1965 and 1966, Table 3). When
domestic supplies were large, proportionally more was exported, usually
at relatively low prices (e.g., 1963 and 1967, Table 3).
8.        Generally speaking then, changes in exportable supplies of beef in
Argentina explained differences in average prices at which beef was sold in
Western Europe during the 1960's. Exporters in Uruguay and Brazil usually
took advantage of higher prices abroad by exporting more beef during those
years, and they shipped less beef when international prices dropped. This
meant that combined exports from Brazil and Uruguay varied inversely with
Argentinian shipments (table 4). Uruguay usually exported higher portions
of her total beef production during periods of high prices, and proportionally
less during periods when prices abroad were depressed (Table 3). However,
price-stabilizing effects of exports from Uruguay and Brazil were more than
offset by fluctuations in beef and veal production in Western Europe: in both
the United Kingdom and the EEC, production tended to vary directly rather
than inversely with exports from Argentina during most of the decade.
Trade in Fresh, Chilled, and Frozen Beef and Veal
9.        Relatively stable trading patterns in fresh, chilled, and frozen
beef and veal evolved during the 1960's, and these should continue to prevail
during the 1970's. Exporters in Oceania and Central America sold as much
beef and veal to the United States and Canada as they thought they would be
permitted to ship under current American import regulations. Australians
and New Zealanders competed only nominally in Western European markets with
exporters from South America and Eastern Europe, and imports into the EEC
from Oceania were negligible, particularly after the evolution of the Common
Agricultural Policy in 1968 (Table 5).
10.       Competition was quite intense among South Americans and Eastern
Europeans supplying Western European countries during the 1960's, and it was
in Western Europe where the changes in direction of trade occurred. In the
Common Market about half of the increase in total imports between 1963-69
was supplied by other members of the Community. Other European countries
and Latin American exporters shared nearly all the rest of the imports, each
region supplying about half the beef and veal the EEC bought from third
countries (Table 5). Eastern Europe - mainly: Yugoslavia - replaced EFTA
countries as the Community's second most important supplier, principally
because of smaller shipments of beef and veal from Denmark. Total quantities



ANNEX 12
Page 5
of beef and veal imported by EFTA countries did not change very much between
1963 and 1969. European suppliers acquired about half this market, mainly
at the expense of Latin Americans, whose share dropped from about 2/3 to 1/3
during this period (Table 6). Nearly all the beef imported by EFTA countries
was shipped to the United Kingdom, and this market underwent significant
structural changes during the late 1960's. By 1970, practically all British
imports were boneless beef and fresh beef, and Ireland, Argentina, Australia
and New Zealand supplied nearly all this meat (Table 6). Import demand grew
50 percent in Spain and Greece from 1963-69. Exports from Yugoslavia to
Greece and from other Eastern European origins to Spain increased more than
twice as much as did shipments from Argentina and Uruguay to both these
countries (Table 6).
11.       On balance, then, total South American exports of chilled and
frozen beef and veal to Western Europe were about the same in 1963 and 1969,
but the volume of all fresh, chilled, and frozen beef imported by Western
European countries grew nearly 30 percent during these six years. Further-
more, significant changes in the relative importance to the trade of different
suppliers and buyers took place between 1963 and 1969 (Table 4).
Trade in Cooked and Canned Beef
12.       Beef which was cooked and then frozen, canned, or otherwise pre-
served, constituted a sizable share of all beef and veal imported into the
United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany (Table 7). This meat,
on a product weight basis, currently comprises nearly 6 percent of all beef
and veal imported into the United States. Argentinian shipments of cooked
and canned beef doubled fron 1963-65 to 1968-70. About half of these pro-
ducts went to the United States and another 40 percent to Europe. Argentina
now dominates the trade originating in South America. Declines in shipments
from Uruguay and Paraguay since 1965 more than offset the modest increase
in exports from Brazil since 1968.
Major Developments in International Trade in Beef and Veal, 1970-1971
13.       Total beef and veal production in Argentina, Uruguay, and Yugos-
lavia declined more than 6 percent in 1970. All this net decline occurred
in Argentina where the number of cattle slaughtered dropped 8 percent. 1/
Consumer purchasing power in Buenos Aires (relative to beef prices there)
turned up concurrently. Both these events reversed trends which had
persisted for three or four years in Argentina, and cattle prices there
advanced steadily during 1970. Argentinian exports of chilled and frozen
beef dropped 26 percent in 1970, although this decline in shipments was
offset by larger exports from Uruguay and Brazil (Table A). However, exports
from Yugoslavia dropped nearly 40 percent, too. These smaller exportable
supplies were sold in Western Europe at much higher prices during 1970, 2/
1/ Foreign Agriculture Service, USDA, February and July 1971.
2/   The average price for Argentine frozen quarters, c.i.f. German ports,
was up 27 percent in 1970 from 1969.



ANNEX 12
Page 6
in spite of the 4.5 percent increase in beef and veal production in Western
Europe last year. Current estimates suggest that total imports of beef and
veal increased slightly during 1970 in the EEC, and declined elsewhere in
Western Europe (Table 2). Import demand was particularly strong in Italy.
14.       Strong domestic demand in Argentina during 1971 generated a
critical shortage of exportable supplies there, since the number of cattle
slaughtered dropped as much as 40 percent during the first six months,
compared with the corresponding period in 1970. 1/ Exports for the six months
ending June 1971 were half the volume of beef shipped during January-June
1970. Since Yugoslavian exports were down 15 percent and shipments from
Uruguay were off 36 percent, too, representative prices for imported beef
in Western Europe advanced sharply during the first half of 1971. 2/ However,
these prices apparently attracted supplies fron other sources subsequently.
Quotations in July and August were nearly 30 percent below similar values
during April and May.
An Assessment of Uruguay's Competitive Position as an Exporter of Beef
15.       Uruguay's beef cattle industry became more export-oriented during
the 1960's. Domestic per capita consumption of beef and veal declined
significantly after 1965 (Table 1), and progressively larger shares of
domestic production were exported, especially during periods of relatively
high prices (Table 3). Beef and veal production declined rather steadily
between 1964 and 1969, according to estimates which do not include allowances
for live cattle exported (Table 3). Output apparently increased 30 percent
in 1970. 3/ Since exports were lower during the first half of 1971, beef
supplies or processing capacity rather than lack of foreign markets clearly
still limit Uruguay's foreign sales of beef.
16.       Uruguay's competitive position in the chilled and frozen beef
trade in Western Europe improved during the late 1960's. The loss of her
share of the British market (Table 4) was more than compensated by larger
sales and market shares in the EEC and Spain (Tables 5 and 6). Beef exported
from Uruguay usually is sold at prices competitive with similar meat from
1/ Agra Europe, Buenos Aires, August 1971.
2/ At the leading wholesale market in London, similar cuts of Argentine
chilled beef sold for nearly 50% more during April 1971 than average
values during 1970. Average values on exports from Argentina were up
nearly 60%, compared with the year before (Table 8).
3/ USDA, February 1971.



ANNEX 12
Page 7
Argentina (Table 8). However, the meat packing industry in Uruguay has not
yet developed the capability to produce in volume the higher valued products
such as boneless cuts and cooked, frozen beef. 1/ Uruguay's opportunities
for increasing her earnings from beef exports currently are being curtailed
at least as much by lack of appropriate processing capacity as by lack of
beef supplies. This is particularly true in the case of sales to the
United States of cooked and frozen meat and certain other specially prepared
and preserved products. Meat packers in Argentina and Brazil have demonstrated
markets, for these products do exist. In fact these probably are the meat
products for which foreign demand is growing fastest.
Projections of European Net Import Demand for Beef and Veal, 1975 and 1980
17.       Several estimates indicate that net imports by the EEC of beef and
veal, including live cattle and calves, on a CWE basis, increased more than
15 percent a year during most of the last decade (Tables 7 and 9). Net
imports by eleven other European countries 2/ probably declined between
1962 and 1969. (Inter-country differences in statistical treatment of the
CWE of live cattle traded and canned beef imported make estimations of net
imports of this group of countries extremely difficult). Regardless, a
number of recently published projections indicate clearly that net import
requirements in both the EEC and 11 other European countries are expected
to more than double during the 1970's. These conditional forecasts, which
are identified and summarized in Table 9, suggest that net demand for imported
beef and veal by the six member countries of the presently-constituted
European Co'mmunity will grow 9.5 percent a year through 1975, and then will
slow down considerably. Net imports (trade balances) by the other group
of 11 countries are expected to increase well over 15 percent a year during
the entire decade. During the second half of the 1970's, net import
requirements in the latter market are expected to expand more than net
import demand in the EEC. Beef exports from Uruguay stipulated elsewhere
in this report (Annex 1) assumes these shipments (on a CWE basis)
will increase 25 percent between 1970 and 1975. Since European net imports
should more than double by 1975, clearly one can assume that Uruguay will
not lack foreign markets for the incremental beef production generated by
the Fourth Livestock Development Project.
Projections of International Prices for Frozen Beef, 1975-80
18.       Prices for Argentine frozen quarters, c.i.f. German ports, are
projected to vary from $730-895 current US$ per metric ton during 1975-80,
1/ Nearly 70% of Uruguay's beef exports in 1970 was carcass meat. Only
about 30% of Argentina's shipments in 1970 were chilled or frozen
quarters. The rest were products having much higher values (Table 8).
2/   Other European members of OECD except Portugal and Turkey.



ANNEX 12

and to average $810 during the middle of this period (1977-78). This would
indicate average price gains per year of 2.8 percent since 1965/66, when
prices wsre expressed in actual or current terms. Actual price advances
during 1963-69 varied from 3.9 percent ot 6.6 percent a year, depending on
the origin, description, and destination of the beef.
19.       Similar, consistent projections of prices for beef exported from
Uruguay during 1975-80 indicate average unit values of $680 per metric ton.
However, the product mix of these beef exports is expected to shift to
higher priced products such as boneless beef, special cuts, and cooked,
frozen beef (Annex 1). These products have individual valuations far
higher than Uruguay's traditional exports of carcass beef (as Table 8 of this
Annex shows). Accordingly, the estimate that f.o.b. prices, Montevideo,
will average $710 per ton during 1971-75 is quite conservative,

1/ Imports of "carcass beef and veal" was suspended between December 1967-mid-April 1968 from all countries not
free of foot-and-mouth disease.
2/  Regulations leading to a single market for beef and veal within the EC came into effect on November 1, 1964.
During this transitional period, average import changes and levies on live cattle and most meats increased
each year, although tariffs and levies on frozen meat from tWri countries after were reduced or suspended
temporarily.
3/  Final single market stage regulations became effective July 30, 1968.  The apparent result was to assess
higher, uniform import levies and duties on live cattle, fresh and chilled beef and veal, and frozen beef
intended for direct human consumption, but lower taxes on most frozen beef imported frzo developing countries.
4/  Imports of bone-in beef from countries where foot-and-mouth disease is endemic was banned after October 1, 196.
/  Preliminary (February 1971).
All meat imports fron Uruguay were banned after 14 June 1969 on health and veterinary grounds.
7/  Imports reported by importing countries.
