PRESIlDNT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOANI TO THE REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
FOR TEE
FOUTRTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMNT PROJECT, SECOND STAGE
1.        I submit the following report and recomnendation on a proposed loan
to the Republica Oriental del Uruguay for the equivalent of US$13.5 million
to help finance the secand stage of the Fourth Livestock Development Project.
The loan would have a term of 14 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 74 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Uruguay (120a-UR) dated May 10, 1973, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 6, 1973 (R73-1131). The report is based on the findings of
the econ6omic mission which visited Urugaay in Augu.st and September of 1972.
A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        The Republic of Uruguay, with its cultura'lly homogenous, well-educated
population (over 90 percent literate), low birth rate (now about 2.1 percent)
and abundant farmland well-suited to livestock production, had attained by the
rmid-1950's one of the highest standards of living in Latin America. Favorable
world prices for Uruguay's pastoral products made the decade following World
War II a period of steady growth, but throughout this period Uruguay,'e live-
stock ranchers remained content with extensive exploitation of their land-
holdings, and the principal investment activity took place in the industrial
sector, where Government polic ies, oriented toward higher employment and
consumption for the largely urban population, fostered the development of
light, import-substituting industries under the umbrella of absolute or near-
absolute protection. When world beef and wool prices declined followirg, the
termination of hostilities in Korea, Uruguay, with its small internal market,
entered into a period of prolonged economic stagnation.
4.        GDP remained almost constant in real terms during the 1960's and
while the modest 1.2 percent demographic growth rate prevented the situation
from becoming explosive, per capita incomes are estimated to have declined
slightly to about UTS$820. This income level, however, was still high by
Latin Ajei,r standards; moreover, income in Uruguay was probably more evrenly
distributed than in most Latin American countries. Tne high proportion of
wage and salary earners and the virtual absence of subsistence agoriculture



-2-
tended to reduce income disparities. Based on the fragmentary data available,
the income share of the poorest 20 percent of income recipientsl/ during the
early 1960's in Uruguay was about 5.5 percent. This compares favorably with
the 1960-64 average for Latin America Free Trade Association (LAFTA) countries
of 4.1 percent for the same income bracket. Although the income share of the
highest 20 percent in Uruguay is equal to the average for LAFTA countries,
58 percent, only 25 percent of the income goes to the highest 5 percent, while
for the area as a whole the corresponding share is 31.5 percent. The distri-
bution pattern in Uruguay was thus somewhat better balanced than in most other
Latin American countries.  However, this income distribution was unfortuynately
accompanied by a scarcity of employment opportunities and incentives to invest.
These circumstances help to explain the high levels of emigration among the
younger, more highly trained population and the outbreak in the late sixties
of political and social unrest.
Improved Government policies toward the end of the decade led to
substantial eco-nomic gains in 1969 and 1970;  but these gains proved short-
lived as a number of factors, most of them related to impending Presidential
elections, made it difficult for the Government to adopt unpopular economic
measures. Approval of substantial wage increases and unwillingness to move
an increasingly over-valued exchange rate, coupled with relaxation of credit
controls, all contributed to a reemergence in 1971 of high rates of inflation,
extersive capital flight and a decline in economic activity.   A new Adminis-
tration took office in March 1972 and moved swiftly to deal with the rapidly
deteriorating situation. It designed a growth-oriented development strategy
to stirmulate private agricultural and manufacturing production and decreed a
number of concrete measures.   It (a) devalued the peso from UR$250 to UR$500
per US$1 and declared its intention to adjust the exchange rate frequently in
line With in-ternal price changes;  (b) raised certain taxes and the domestic
prices of petroleurm products which resulted in increased fiscal revenues;
(c) reduced its current expenditures budget for 1972;   and (d) raised elec-
tricity and telephone rates by 90 percent.
6.        The recent econoiec report points out that the March 1972 devaluation
and the adoptiorn of a flexible exchange rate system, which has become well
established during the past year through frequent small devaluations, permritted
a substantial rise in beef producers' prices and brought to a halt the balance-
of-payTents deterioration experienced during 1971 and much of 1972.   In many
respects, however, the impact of the new policies in 1972 was disappointing.
Gross domestic product in real terms did not increase from the 1971 level.
AIso, a poor harvest, rising wor'ld market prices for meat an.d grains, and
sudden increased demand for beef substitutes consequent upon the Government's
prohibition of beef slaughter for domestic consumption during the July-November
oer'iod a-l- contributed to heavy overall price increases. The cost of living
in Montevideo rose by 95 percent in 1972 compared with 36 percent in 1971.
Norrna2. w-age increases were larger and more frequent than in 1971, but real wages,
Jhich had reached a peak prior to the November 1971 e_ectionrs, decreased by
O8 nercent in 1972.
l inoployed persons and pensioners.

7.        While the rate of inflation remains high, the economic outlook for
1973 contains a number of favorable elements. Export volumes are up, which,
bolstered by very favorable international prices for both wool and beef,
should help total export earnings to rise by about 50 percent over 1972.
Although imports also will increase, particularly with higher prices for
petroleum and wheat, prospects are good for a surplus in the balance of
payments for the first time since 1969. As a result, net foreign exchange
reserves are expected to rise substantially over the year (at end-July net
foreign exchange reserves stood at US$56.1 million, up US$52.6 million from
a year earlier).  Expected increases in tax revenue, particularly from the
agricultural sector and from a recent increase in the value added tax rate,
together with substantially higher public utility tariffs and the Government's
expressed intention to continue restraining expenditures, indicate that the
overall Central Government deficit is likely to be only 2.5 percent of total
revenue (as opposed to 40 percent in 1971 and 19 percent in 1972). Total
output is projected to increase by about 4 percent. These favorable prospects,
of course, assume that there will be no substantial departure from the Govern-
ment's balance of payments policies during the year, and that restraint in the
granting of salary increases as well as implementation of recent tax measures,,
particularly those strengthening the agricultural land tax, will be successful
in decelerating gradually the rate of inflation. The political changes early
this year, when the Uruguayan armed forces assumed a major role in the political
decision-making process, have not resulted in any major modification of the
macroeconomic or livestock sector policies which the civilian authorities have
been pursuing.
8.        The economic report concludes that over the medium term, provided
sound economic and financial policies are followed, a sustained rate of growfth
of approximately 4 percent is realistic.  To achieve this rate of growth and
in view of the heavy debt service schedule of the next few years, an inflow
of approximately US$375 million in medium and long-term external credits will
be required during 1973-78 if reserves a-re to be built up to a reasonable level.
Uruguay's public debt profile in recent years has been heavily affected by
commercial arrears (for which the Central Bank has assumed the foreign obliga-
tion) which reached US$84 million by July 1972. Aided -by the sale on the free
market of about one-fifth of the country's gold reserves in NovemDer/December
1972, commercial arrears were reduced to about US$58 million by the end of the
year.  With the favorable outlook for exports in 1973, the Goverrment has now
begun paying all commercial debts of below US$25,000 and is currently completing
its repayment schedule for the balance of the arrears. The Paris Club members,
in expressing confidence in Uruguay's intentions, have inforrally advised the
Government that they did not consider it necessary to open formal negouiations
on the rescheduled commercial debts.
9.        The current prospects are that Uruguayts public debt service ratio
will decline from 30 percent in 1972 to slightly above 20 percent in 1973.
If the projected requirements of medium and long-term external credits are rnet,
thus reducing the need for short-term credits, Uruguay's external debt service
burden would be reduced further in the next few years. About US$85 million in
medium and long-term credits is now in the pipeline and comes largely from the



_4
Bank, from IDB, which has made loans in recent years for industry, transport,
education and water supply, and from AID, which made an agricultural sector
loan in 1968 and a capital goods import loan in 1969. Provided the Government
satisfactorily proceeds with the implementation of its program, it should find
it possible to mobilize the additional projected external capital required for
Uruguay's development. Annual debt service payments to the Bank are expected
to remain virtually constant during 1973-78; however, the Bank share of total
exterrnal public debt service, which was only 10 percent in 1973, is likely to
rise above 25 percent during the next four years, reflecting the completion of
payments on commercial arrears and loans from bilateral sources. Under the
circumstances, Uruguay should be judged creditworthy for additional borrowing
from the Bank.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN URUGUAY
t0.       Uruguay has received US$141.7 million (net of cancellations) in Bank
loans. Almost ninety percent of Bank lending has been for electric power
(58 percent) and livestock development (29 percent). Most of Bank lending for
power, however, is represented by three loans totalling US$64 million made
d-uring the 1950's. Since 1959, Bank lending has consisted of five loans
totalling US$41.2 million for livestock development, a 1962 loan of US$18.5
million for highway construction and improvement which is now fully disbursed,
and a US$18 million loan for thermal generating equipment and electricity
aistribution made in 1970.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
11.       When the most recent loan to Uruguay, for the first stage of the
Fourth Livestock Developmenit Project, was under consideration in April 1972,
the economic -oroblems facing the Government which had just taken office were
sufficiently serious that a pause in Bank lending was considered. Given the
fact, however, that the Bank is the n^ajor so-rce of credit financing for the
livestock sector, this approach was rejected because of the widespread and
detrimerntal effects which such a pause could have for the continued success
of the livestock developmeint prograrm! and on the national economy which is
dependent on livestock.  The decision to proceed with the loan was influenced
by the Government s announcement of its 1972 economic program and development
strategy and by the Governmentts decision to seek support for this program
from the IPF.  At the same time, however, the Bank considered it advisable
to limit the amoulnt of its commitment primarily because it was not certain
whether the Government would be able to fully implement the adjustments in
the economic and sectoral policies it was proposing. Thus, although the
Appraisal Report (PA-113b), dated February 17, 1972, dealt with a two-year
(1972-73) project, the Bank proceeded with a loan of US$11.2 million, which
-as considered sufficient to finance orly the first year of the project.



12.       Since the first stage loan was approved, the principal policy
initiatives of the new Government in the balance-of-payments area appear
to have gained acceptance within Uruguay, and on this basis, together with
the prospects of favorable world market prices for Uruguay's principal
exports and improvements in livestock sectoral policies discussed below, lt
is considered justified for the Bank to continue its support for the critical
livestock sector by going forward with a second stage loan and by including
in the loan sufficient funds to finance the estimated external requirements
of the Government's livestock development program through 1974.
13.       Looking beyond the loan now proposed, the UJruguayan economy will
have to rely heavily on the commodity-producing sectors if it is to gain the
momentum necessary to move onto a steady upward path. In its future lending,
therefore, the Bank's first priority should be to support the growth of these
sectors. This would mean a continuation of lending for livestock development
and would enable the Bank (a) to support the maintenance of sound overall
policies in the livestock sub-sector; (b) to help improve the technical and
financial capacity of the Government's Livestock Commission (the "Plan Agrope-
cuario"!, as it is often called) to promote directly, and through the demon-
stration effect of its program, increased investment in pasture improvement;
and improved ranch management, and (c) to help diversify livestock production
and to bring increased numbers of smaller producers into the Plan Agropecuario
program.
14.       At the same time, beginning with the next economic mission schedaled
for December, we intend to exanine the feasibility cf a significant Bank role
in industry. The problems in the sector are complex, because past protectionist
policies have led to structural inefficiencies.  A concerted effort, however,
to find ways to help resolve them is justified not only because of industryls
potential contribution to growth objectives, but also because the problems of
unemployment and underemployment are concentrated mainly in the urban areas,
and their resolution probably will depend heavily on the development of a
dynamic industrial sector. We shall investigate the possibility of promoting
non-traditional manufactured exports based on domes3tic raw materials, and of
fostering improved institutional arrangements for medium and long-term indus-
trial finance through lending to a proposed development barik. Other possible
areas of Bank lending may be electric power and transport.
15.       Thus far, IFC has made no investments in Uruguay.   IFC has been
approached by sponsors of a proposed private development finance company for
a possible equity and loan participation, but active consideration of this
request has been deferred until resolution of the difficulties which the
sponsors have incurred in attempting to obtain legislation necessary to obtain
foreign financing.

PART III - THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR
16.       While agriculture's contribution to national output and employrent
is relatively modest -- it provides, directly and indirectly, about 30 percent
of Uruguay's GDP and employs about 20 percent of the labor force -- its over-
whelming importance as a source of foreign exchange makes its expansion,
particularly of livestock, critical to Uruguay's economic development pros-
pects. Exports of livestock prod-acts accounted for about 85 percent of expo:rt
earnings in 1970 and 90 percent of export earnings in 1971 and 1972. Past
stagnation of the economy was directly related to the fact that, apart from
year-to-year fluctuations mainly related to climatic conditions, there was
little change in the level of livestock or crop production.
17.       About 90 percent of Uruguay's 16.5 million ha. of agricultural land
is used for pastures which support about 9 million beef cattle, 600,000 dairy
cattle, and 19.8 million sheep. In addition, the growing pig industry has
over 4o00,000 animals. Livestock production practices have been based histor-
ically on extensive systems of land use. Traditional management attitudes,
which tend toward low inves-ment and managerial input in the ranch enterprise,
are still widespread in the livestock sector. Over the past decade, however,
and largely as a result of the impetus provided by the Bank-financed program
of the Plan Agropecuario, there have been important advances made in the adop-
tion of a more intensive livestock technology.   Improved pastures have
increased ten times since the early 1960's, reaching over 1.2 million hectares
by t972, and are now responsible for 20 to 25 percent of total annual beef
output. Nevertheless, improved pastures still represent only about 8 percent
of total pasture land, and as all land suitable for livestock production is
already being -atilized, wider application of intensive techniques will be
crucial tc the long-ran expansion of livestock production.   A similar situation
exists in agriculture generally,   While the land in crops represents less than
t0 uercent of the total, much of it is also farmed on an extensive basis, and,
as a consequence, yield levels are generally low in absolute terms and, with
few exceptions, have shown little tendency to increase over the past 20 years.
As is to be expected from a sector based largely on extensive systems of
prodluction, most of the lan& is in relatively large holdings, with more than
70 percent of the land in holdings of more than 500 hectares and more than
20 percent in h-oldings of more than 100 hectares.  The remaining 10 percent of
the land is occupied by about 56,000 crop farms, dairy and pig farms, and
mixed livestock/crop farms (representing over 70 percent of all farms and
ranches), most of which are probably operating above subsistence levels, but
many of which the Goverrment considers too srmall to be capable of efficient
operation under the present extensive land use rriethods.
18.       Conscious of the need to introduce improved technology to increase
-roductiTrity i4 ranching, the Government in i959 established the Livestock
_o-mmis ssion as a serri-autonlomous, technical authority under the Ministry of
LiTvestock and Xgriculture. The Commission has had primary responsibility ^or
tsorrrJat:g and irmplementing the Government's livestock development program
a.c has acted as the executing agency for BanIc lending in the livestock sector.
Ra-1cher arnd farmer response to Bank-supporued cedit programs,, however, has



- 7 -
been determined by cattle prices which were often too low to offer sufficient
economic incentives for high levels of investment. Ranch-gate prices in pesos
began to increase in real terms during 1970 and 1971, but the failure to move
an overvalued exchange rate meant that the increase was much less than world
price increases would have warranted. This was reflected in the very heavy
volume of sales of contraband cattle to Brazil, estimated during 1971 to be
about one-third of the volume earmarked for export, which deprived Uruguay
of the value added in processing. The devaluation and the introduction of
a flexible exchange rate system in March 1972 had an important positive impact
on the livestock sector. There followed a series of increases in producer
prices which (combined with Brazilian export control and pricing policies)
have all but eliminated the flow of contraband cattle to neighboring areas of
Brazil. Assurances were obtained during negotiation of the proposed loan that
the Government would continue to permit increases in beef prices to the extent
necessary to discourage contraband sales of cattle in the future.
19.       The Government recognizes, however, that given traditional rancher
attitudes, improved pricing policies alone are not sufficient to assure high
levels of investment in the livestock sector. It has been moving, therefore,
during the past year toward making effective the implementation of the four-
year old IMPROME land tax which is designed not only as a means of raising
revenue but also as a device for making under-utilization of land and stock
increasingly unattractive to landowners. The tax is punitive on large,
unimproved holdings and does not touch small (under 200 ha.) or largely agri-
cultural holdings. Last year was the first year full payment of IMPRYME was
required under the law and, aided by a system of advance payments instituted
in November, the yield from IMPROME in 1972 was five times higher (in current
pesos) than it was in 1971. The Minister of Agriculture, furthermore, announced
to the livestock sector at the beginning of this year the Government's intenulon
strictly to enforce IMPROME, particularly with respect to the approidmately
4,000 ranchers who hold almost 60 percent of the total land in agriculture.
it thus appears that IMPROME, which is complex and difficult to adimini_ster, is
beginning to receive the political and administrative backing necessary to mince
it effective.
20.       A further aspect of the Government's program for increasing incentives
for more efficient production is the adoption this year of a policy of redaced
export taxes on beef production attributable to ranch improvementsv   The new
policy is in line with recommendations of recent Bank economic missions, which
have concluded that the tax involved acts as a disincentive to exports and
should be gradually replaced by measures such as the TMPROME land tax. Ranchers
will receive the benefit of reduced export taxes on the estimated incremental
annual production of beef derived from imptoved pastures established under
ranch development plans (using the same methodology formulated to determine
land productivity under IPROME) approved by Plan Agropecuario, whether or nlot,
financed from Plan resources.



- 8 -
21.       Another Governmenit initiative aimed primarily at stimulating more
adequate levels of investment in the livestock sector but which will also
have an income redistribution effect is a proposed land redistribution scheme,
which the Government has under consideration and which is expected to receive
wide support. According to the proposal being developed by the Ministry of
Agriculture, the first phase of the program would involve the redistribution
over a five-year period of approximately one million hectares, most of wh-ich
would be acquired through the expropriation of that part of individual holdings
which exceeds 5,000 ha. The purchased land would be allocated to smaller
ranchers considered to have adequate managerial capacity, with priority being
given to those now holding units considered too small to be economically
viable. The development of the new holdings would be financed by a series of
long-term development loans. A preliminary iMinistry estimate of the total
cost of land acquisition and development under the proposed plan during 197h-78
is at least US$25 million eiluivalent per year, which is likely to strain
Uruguay's very limited pubLic sector resources, even assuming external financ-
ing of a portion of the program, and means that the five-year timetable is
almost certainly optimistic. The Government has advised us that it intends to
seek Bank-financing for the beneficiaries of the land redistribution progran
in a Fifth Livestock Project;.
22.       While improvements in sector policies are thus underway or in
preparation, one area of weakness that remains is the domestic seed industry.
Development of this industry has progressed only slowly and the importation
of substantial quantities of seed is still required.   Under the second stage
project, the Government, with the assistance of Bank-financed specialists,
w-ll conduct a study of the domestic seed industry including an assessment
of the investment and credit requirements for expansion of production, seed
cleaning and processing facilities and the requlrements for rationalizing seed
testing facilities. Another obstacle to the development of the livestock
sector in the pas- has been the stagnation of the meat-packing industry. While
the economi^ report concludes that, as a result OL improved Government policies,
an expansion cf facilities, and improved financial prospects resulting from
high world meat prices, this industry does not currently present a serious
bottleneck to the development of the livestock sector, a problem could arise
if additional cold storage facilities are not erected relatively soon and
unless reCent improvements in sanitation standards continue. The J B, which
has provided financing for slaughterhouse improvements, has recently approved
the financing of a study to deteriine the most appropriate methods of expand-
ing cold storage capacity and improving refrigerated transportation facilities.
We intend to follow closely the Government's efforts to expand cold storage
facilitie8 and mairntain high sanitation standards.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The Fourth Livestock Development Project was appraised in May/June 1971.
The report entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Livestock Development Project -
Uruguayr' (PA-llob), dated February 17, 1972, was distributed to the Executive
Directors in April 1972 (R73-81A) in support of the loan (816-UR) for the first
stage of the project. The proposed loan for the second stage is based on this
Appraisal Report and on the findings of the updating mission of November 1972
which are incorporated in the following paragraphs. A Loan and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III. Negotiation of the proposed loan took place in
Washington from August 27 to August 31, 1973. The Government of Uruguay was
represented by the Honorable Hector Luisi, Uruguayan Ambassador; Ing. Julio
Aznarez, President of the Honorary Livestock Commission; Sr. Jorge Sambarino,
Director of Credit of the Central Bank; Sr. Jorge Devincenzi Suarez, Sub-Director
General, Banco de la Republica and Sr. Rodolfo Palleiro of the Banco de la
Republica.
Progress Under First Stage Loan (816-UR)
1972 Livestock Development Program
24.       Loan 816-UR is providing financial and technical assistance for the
continuation and expansion of the Government's livestock development program.
The loan amount (US$11.2 million) was based on the appraisal estimate of the
external financing requirements of the program for 1972. A summary table of
performance under the 1972 program is attached as Annex IV.
2$.       The number of loans to participants in the program in 1972 reached
,226 which was close to the 1971 level and exceeded the estimate of 3,650
made at the time of the appraisal of the Fourth Livestock Project. The
number of participants with holdings of less than 400 ha. was greater than
projected, but the distribution of participants by size was almosu the same
as in 1971, with roughly one-third under 100 ha., one-third between 100 and
400 ha. and one-third above 400 ha.  (The percentage distribution of
participants and funds invested by size of holding for 1971 and 1972 is shown
in Annex IV.)     The loans to ranchers and farmers  were used to improve
some 212,000 ha. of pastures. This was 43,000 ha. less than the appraisal
estimate, but still more than any other year or the program1 except for the
record year of 1971 when 290,000 ha. were improved.   The principal reason
that the amount of pastures improved fell short of the amount projected,
in spite of a larger than anticipated number of participants, was that
producer prices for beef were allowed to decline in real terms during the
latter part of 1971 and the first part of 1972, thus acting as a disincentive
to investment. Although, as discussed in Part II above, producer pricing and
other agricultural sector policies improved as 1972 progressed, the improvements
came too late to fully offset the negative impact of the earlier policies.



- 10 -
26.       Although the area of pastures improved was thus about `5 percent
of that projected, disbursements under Loarn 816-UR for ranch development
reached only US$3.8 million (total disbursements about US$4.1 million), or
about 40 percent of the appraisal estimate.  The much greater percentage
shortfall in loan disbursements is due primarily to the major devaluation
of the Uruguayan peso that took place in 1972. The appraisal estimate of
Droducers' on-ranch investments was computed at the 1971 official exchange
rate of UR$250 to US$1; the average exchange rate applicable to Bank dis-
bursements, however, turned out to be approximately UR$700 to US$1, while the
disbursements related to investments most of which were made before domestic
prices had begun to catch up with the change in parities. Bank loan funds,
therefore, went much farther than expected. Also contributing to the
unexpectedly low level of Bank disbursements was the fact that two new
components of on-ranch development loans introduced in the first stage project
made very little progress in 1972. One of those components was for heifer
purchases by Plan participants. It was unsuccessful because the Government-
controlled heifer price was too low to be attractive to potential sellers.
The other component was for working capital designed to help offset the loss
of income to ranchers resulting from heifer retentions.   This component was
not successful in 1972 apparently because the Plan technicians had difficulty
interpreting the administrative safeguards which had been developed to assure
that the funds were used for the intended purpose.   (Plan personnel are work-
ing to overcome the difficulties this year.) However, some of the impact of
the unsatisfactory performance of these two new components was offset by
orogress on a new sub-project -- for dairy beef production. The principal
objective of this sub-project is to encourage dairy farmers to raise to
maturity, and to fatten for the beef export market, male calves which are
currently killed at birth.  About I,000 farmers, mostly in the area of the
Miontevideo milkshed, participated in this sub-project, as compared to the
appraisal estimate of h50. The principal reasons for this better-than-expected
oerformance were a concerted promotional effort by Plan Agropecuario and the
fact that the projected financial rate of return was the highest of all sub-
projects.
Second Stage Pro.,ect
27       mThe second stage project would include the livestock development
program of Plan Agropecuario for 1973 and 19714.   The total cost of the
second stage project is estimated at US$41.1 million equivalent, of which
US$20.6 s-illion represents the foreign exchange costs. The amount available
from Loan 816-UR to finance these costs is US$7.1 millions (about US$2.8
million of which has already been disbursed f'or imported seeds and
fertilizers in preparation for the planting season now underway).    The US$13.5
m"'lion balance of the foreign exchange costs would be financed by the proposed
new loan.     Annex V attached hereto shows the Bank-approved reallocation
of' funds under Loan 816-UR and the allocation of funds from the proposed
new Loan for the combined 1973-74 operations.    These allocations are in
t-urn based on the consolidated project investments for 1973-74 contained
in Annex VI (which is discussed further ir paragrapn 30 below).



_ 11 -
28.       The second stage project would support a credit program for about
7,750 sub-loans to ranchers and farmerE. About forty percent of the sub-loans
would go to medium and large size cattle and sheep ranches of more than 500
hectares, with the remaining 60 percent benefiting smaller beef and dairy
cattle, pig and mixed livestock/cropping enterprises. The second stage
would continue the lines of credit for dairy beef, heifer pv,rchase and pig
production introduced in 1972 and would finance a new program for the
rehabilitation and development of small mixed livestock/crop farms. Efforts
will also be made to considerably strengthen the institutional structure
and the capacity of Plan Agropecuario to carry out its expanding administrative
and technical responsibilities.   The role of the internationally recruited
technical director would be that of a technician with a strong managerial
and organizational background. In addition, the Government has hired locally
a full-time accountant to revise and maintain accurate records of the Plan's
operations. The Plan, which has a competent corps of livestock technicians,
would seek to improve its technical services, through formulating a program
for lo-er level field extension workers as well as developing plans for
broadening its extension services over the next year.
29.       Specifically, the second stage project would consist of the
following components:
(a)       Cattle and Sheep Ranch Development
The financing, through long-term sub-loans, of development plans
for about 5,600 ranches and farms to improve livestock production (representing
about US$17.3 million of the US$20.6 million financed by the Bank for the
Second Stage Project). Farm investments would be for pasture improvement,
related structures, machinery and facilities, and purchase of breeding stocr.
Bahnk funds would finance the foreign exchange component of these expenditures,
amounting to 55 percent of on-ranch investment costs.  The ranches would ra-nge
from 200 ha. to 5,0OW ha. in size; the average size would be around 900 ha.
(b)       Da      Beef
Dairy and beef farms with "dairy beef" operations would be assisted
through long-term sub-loans for pasture improvement, machinery, and related
structures and facilities. The program was initiated under Loan 816-UR and
has pr6gressed better than expected (see paragraph 26 above). It is being
extended nationwide this year, and the second stage project would include
approximately 1,700 farms. Farm sizes lie in the range of 30-150 ha.
(c)       Piz Production
This program was also introduced for the first time under Loan 816-UR
and is designed to increase pork production as a substitute for beef in the
domestic market.   Due to a shortage of technical expertise, it proved
necessary to concentrate the program on 30 farms as opposed to the appraisal
estimate of 100, but the number of pigs per unit was higher than projected,
and the program made a significant contribution to aggregate pork supply



which, in conjunction with the increase in beef prices in the latter part of
1]972, resulted in pork being available on the retail market at a lower price
than beef for the first time.  It is expected that the internal market for
pork, combined with farmers' response to new technology and the planned
strengthening of technical services, will permit an increase in the size of
the program in the second stage project.   The second stage project would
support the development of about 100 additional pig production units.
Financing would be providedi for investment in fencing, structures, food-
mixing machinery, equipnent and stock.
(d)       Mixed Farms
The proposed loan would support a new program of financial and
technical assistance to mixed livestock/crop fprmers with average annval net
incomes per family of about US$900 equivalent. This program was developed
in 1972 and appraised by the November updating mission. On many of the mixed
farms, which would range in size from about 30 ha. to 200 ha., a combination
of shallow soils and poor production practices has led to soil degradation,
declining yields and reduced farm incomes.   The program would provide long-
term financing to about 400 farmers for the establishmeent of pasture-crop
rotation and the build-up of the cattle herds.   The investme-nts in pasture
establishment and improvement would be similar to those on the cattle and
sheep ranches, and the sub-project would provide a high level of technical
assistance. Because of the weak financial position of these borrowers, the
sub-loans would cover 90 percent of investmernt costs and carry a longer
grace period on repayment of principal than for other sub-loans under the
project. The sub-loans would also benefit from a lower interest rate to
be charged to s4b-borrowers holding less than 250 ha. (see paragraph 32
below). The average size of' sub-loans per farm would be approximately
US$3,600.  A more detailed description of the mixed farm program is con-
tained in Annex VIi.
(e'.      Technical Services and Training
Tne Second Stage Project would also aim at the strengthening and
expansion of the scope of technical assistance provided to the Government
and ?lan Agropecuario. In addition to the new technical director of the Plan,
who will be responsible primarily for the management and training of technical
I._af', t1e services or the agricultural economast already in the field will
be continued. Farthermore, the Second Stage Project would include experts
i.n dairy production, dairy industries, and pork production. Specialists in
Tch,e field of meat marketing, with specific expertise in external marketing
and the organization of a meat, board, would also be recruited.  The project
Woul-d also include t1) specialized technical services in the establishment
of a dornes-ic seed production and processing industry and (2) marketing
studiaes of selected dairy pt,oducts as a follow-on to work of consultants
'Ln&naCed -ancer previous Bank loans and 'oy AID.  Equipment and materials
needed to assure the effective execution of the consulting services would
also be included.  A table showing the different types and amounts of tech-
nica' services irA the second stage is attached as Annex VIII.

(f)       Contractor Machinery and Seed Producing Equipment
Under Loan 816-UR, US$0.2 million was made available for the procure-
ment of contractor machinery and seed producing equipment. The expected demand,
however, failed to materialize in 1972. Part of the difficulty was that seed
production machinery, because of its specialized nature, proved unsuited to
international oompetitive bidding.    Given the improved investment climate,
and a proposed easing of the procurement requirements for seed production
equipment (quotations from at least three suppliers from at least two
countries would be required), it is anticipated that the US$0.2 million
will be utili.ed this year.
Financing
30.       The cost estimates for 1973 and 1974 operations of the livestock
development program are detailed in Annex 3 which supersedes the cost data
for "year 2" contained in Annex 8 of the 1972 Appraisal Report.     The revised
cost estimates reflect inclusion of an additional year (1974) in the Project,
the introduction of the mixed farm sub-project, and revised price data obtained
by the November 1972 updating mission. Because of the availability of improved
price data and based on experience gained in 1972, the 15 percent contingency
included in the cost estimates at the time of appraisal has been reduced to
10 percent. As mentioned above (paragraph 27), the total cost of the second
stage project would be US$41.1 million equivalent, of which approximately
50 percent (US$20.6 million) represents the foreign exchange costs to be
financed by the balance available under Loan 8t16-UR (US$7.1 million)and the
proposed new loan (US$13.5 million). The second stage local costs would be
financed by the Government, the Central Bank, the Banco de la Republica and
the sub-borrowers as shown in the following table:

31.       The Livestock Fund of the Central Bank, established under the
Third Livestock Project (698-UR), would continue as the channel of funds
Drovided by the Central Barik and the Bank for credit operations under the
project. Beginning with the Third Livestock Loan, a number of rediscounting
alternatives had been offered to commercial banks in an effort to encourage
their participation in lending to sub-borrowers under the program along with
the State-owned Banco de la Republica (BOR). These efforts failed mainly
because of the commercial banks' continuing orientation towards short-term
lending to preferred clients. Therefore, upon the effectiveness of the
proposed new loan, the BOR would be the sole participating bank, and redis-
counting terms on funds on-lent by the Livestock Fund (Certral Bank) to the
BOR would be simplified. BOR would rediscount with the Central Bank 85 per-
cent of each ranch development sub-loan financed under the project, receiving
a 2 percern interest rate spread, which is oonsidered reasonable.
Sub-Loan Terms and Indexing
32.       Under Loan 816-UR, the principal of all sub-loans for on-ranch
development is subject to monetary adjustment, to avoid erosion by inflation.
The adjustment is applied anmually and is based on the lower of two indices:
the average increase in the ranch-gate prices of beef and wool during a
12-month base period (ended on the preceding October 31), and the rise in
the cost of liv-ing index during the same period. The adjustment formula is
applied fully to sub-borrowers with holdings of 400 or more ha. and only to
the extent of 50 percent to those with holdings of under 400 ha. The interest
rate paid by the sub-borrowers under that loan is 11 percent, and the terms
of the sub-loans range from 3 to 10 years including one to four years' grace.
D-uring the review of the proposed loan, it was decided to strengthen the
indexing arrangements applicable to sub-borrowers with less than 400 ha.
Rising world inarket prices had created substantially improved prospects for
the smaller ranchers and farmers, assuming that appropriate policies toward
the livestock sector were maintained by the Government. At the same time it
was recognized that the t1 percent rate of interest when applied to fully
indexed loans was very much higher than rates of interest applicable in other
sectors of the economy and that some reduction in the interest rate was there-
fcre justified.  It was also considered appropriate to apply a differential
interest rate for ranchers and farmers with holdings below a certain size,
but that ranch or farm size could only begin to be associated with low levels
of income at about 250 ha. Setting the dividing line at this point, for
example, would ernable all participants in the -mixed-farm sub-project to benefit
frorn the lover interest rate. During negotiations, therefore, it was agreed
that full indexing, in accordance with the p:eviously agreed formula, would be
appolied to all sub-borrowers regardless of the size of their holdings, but
tlhat the rate of interest would be 3 percent for holdings of 250 ha. and below,
6 pnrcent for holdings between 251 and 400 ha., and 8 percent for ranchers and
a-r,Drs Waith holdings of 401 ha. and over.t/ The average real rate of interest
charaed under the project would not fall below 6 percent.
f The interest rate on the fully indexed macrinery and ecuipment sub-loans
wo-ld also be reduced from the 11 percent currently applicable under
Loan 816--iJR to 8 percent.



- 15 -
33.       During negotiations the Government also agreed that the improved
indexing arrangements described above would apply to the new sub-loans yet
to be contracted under Loan 8t6-UR.
Procurement
34.       Under the proposed loan, international competitive bidding
procedures would be used for the bulk procurement by the Plan Agropecuario
of pasture seeds and fertilizers, and for goods and equipment related to
technical services. At the request of the Government, domestic manufacturers
of such goods and equipment would benefit from a preference in bid evaluation
of 15 percent or the prevailing rate of duty, whichever is lower. As in the
previous loans, bids for the supply of rock phosphates for local grinding
and direct application would be restricted to suppliers in countries where
rock phosphates have been tested and proved to be agronomically suited to
Uruguayan conditions. Other potential suppliers have been and would continue
to be invited to submit samples for testing in Uruguay. Bidding for all
other types of rock phosphate would be open to all suppliers. As under
Loan 816-UR, fencing materials for stock handling yards, farm machinery,
water pumps, piping, feed and building materials would be procured through
normal commercial channels. An adequate selection of international suppliers
is represented in the local market. In view of satisfactory experience under
existing loans, the Bank would require prior approval of contracts only when
they exceed US$50,000 in value (instead of the US$25,000 applicable under
existing loans).
Disbursement
35.       As in previous loans, two different disbursement techniques would
be used for the financing of on-ranch development loans. Of the US$12.9
million to be disbursed for this purpose under the new loan, US$8.2 million
would be disbursed by way of reimbursement of 41 percent of the value of
sub-loans made by the BOR. The US$4.7 million balance would be disbursed
directly to suppliers of imported seeds and fertilizers, and the peso equiva-
lent would then be deposited by the Borrower in the Livestock Fund of the
Central Bank and used to finance an additional 25 percent of the value ov
such sub-loans, so as to cover the full foreign exchange component of the
sub-loans. The latter technique was first adopted under Loan 698-UR, at a
time when Uruguay's foreign exchange reserves were very low, in order to assure
the availability of foreign exchange for the timely importation of seeds and
fertilizers for the Plan's pasture improvement program. While continuing this
procedure for this second stage project, we have advised the Governmernt that ,
since Uruguay's foreign exchange situation is now improving and the prospects
for continued improvement are favorable, we intend to discontinue the direct
disbursement system in arny future loans.
Retroactive Financing
36.       In view of the advanced stage of the spring planting season in
Uruguay and to help initiate as soon as possible the reorganization of the
Livestock Commission, it was agreed during negotiations that the Bank would
retroactively finance expenditures incurred after September 1, 1973, of up



- 16 -
to US$1.2 million for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers and of up to
US$0.1 million for consultant and technical services. We have reviewed
the bidding documents concerned and have found them acceptable.
Fertilizer Subsidy
37.       Since the early 1960's, the Government has maintained a policy of
subsidizing phosphate fertilizer costs from proceeds of beef and wool export
taxes, thus reducing farm gate costs to levels equal to those of Uruguay's
major competitors in New Zealand and Australia. The Bank has agreed that
the subsidy should continue in order to encourage wider and more regular
use of phosphate fertilizer, at least until 20 percent of Uruguay's pasture
area is improved. At this level of usage, the value of routine application
of phosphate in stimulating pasture production will have been amply demon-
strated and the subsidy could be phased out. Under Loan 816-UR, therefore,
the Government agreed to submit a plan to the Bank by June 1, 1973 for
phasing out the fertilizer subsidy in Uruguay once that level of usage has
been achieved. While this plan has not yet been completed, the level of
usage is still well below 20 percent, ard it was agreed during negotiations
to postpone the date for submission of the plan to December 31, 1973.
Economic Rate of Return
38.       When the project was appraised in 1971, an economic rate of return
of 31 percent was estimated. Since then the average price increase in peso
terms for project inputs was about 220 percent, almost equal to the increase
-.n the exchange rate, while beef export prices f.o.b. Montevideo rose about
400 percent. However, present high beef export prices (US$1,080/m ton) may
not be maintained. It is estimated that the world market price for beef in
1980, expressed in 1973 Unit;ed States dollars, will be about US$950/m ton.
Even under a somewhat lower beef price than the US$950/m ton projected for
1980, the economic rate of return would be satfactory.
PART V - LBaAL INSTRUMENTS ANT AUTHIRITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republica Oriental del Uruguay and
the Bank, the Report of the Conmmittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed tso the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Agreement contains provisions to reflect the various arrangements described in
tar- IV above, including the usual covenants for livestock projects.  Article VIII
contains amendments to the Loan Agreement for Loan 816-UR dated April 26, 1972.
These amendrmrents, which would be effective as of the date of effectiveness of
the oroposed loan, would corform the terms and conditions of Loan 816-UR to
those cf the proposed loan.
40.       T am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreezrnent of the Barik.

Loan 712    Fourth Power Generation and Distribution Project, US$18.0 million,
November 25, 1970.
The Bank loan finances most of the foreign exchange costs
of the installation of a 125 MS thermal unit in Montevideo,
the installation of distribution equipment for the Monte-
video system and consultant services (1) to improve UTEts
administration and accounting system, and (2) to assi8t
UTE and the Government to develop a long-range power
generation plan. The generation studies have been comple-
ted, and the accounting and administrative studies are in
progress. Construction of the steam unit is about three
months behind the contract schedule and is expected to be
in operation in December 1974. Projected cost overruns of
22 percent over the original contract price are due mostly
to escalation clauses and extension of the suppliers' credit
is being sought by the Borrower. These cost increases do not
affect the original decision to go ahead with the project
since there was no practical alternative solution at that
time. Tariff increases have been made vhich should cover
the rise in local costs. The rehabilitation of the
distribution system is also generally on schedule. The
reorganization of the financial structure, systems,
and procedures is on schedule, although further
progress may be slowed down by lack of properly trained
personnel and the slow speed with which old records are
being updated. 'The Bank will continue to review the bill
collection and other administrative problems in connection
with the on-going consultants' studies. The Closing Date is
December 31, 1974.

Mixed Farm Sub-Project
Background
1.        There are an estimated 3,500 small crop farms (30-200 ha), locaved
in the south and southwest of Uruguay, chat are subjec-t to declining yields
and income levels as a result of a long history of continuous crooping.
Because of inadequate management practices, these farms have experienced soiL
degradation and erosion, a substantial reduc-tion in productive capacity, and
a consequent decline in production. The average annual net incomes per family
of these farmers is estimated at about US$900 equivalent.   The proeosed )rgr-W,
would provide a long-Germ credit line and Gechnical assisbance co restore soil.
fertility through the in-troduction of a crop-pasture rotation, with an eventual
increase in both crop and livestock production and the restorauion of the farm,
as viable comnmercial enterprises. Exiscing production patterns are dominated
by cultivation of wheat, sorghum and maize.   The farmers own little macainery,
and most operations are performed by contractors. Fertilizer use is minimal,
and yields are very low.   Some dairy cact-.le may be kept, but mil prok d  .on
is used largely for home consumption.
Project Description
2.        The initial phase of the program would involve 4u0 iarms a, an average
investment of about US$3,600 Per farm for a tobtal investmenc of about US?;,44tJ,'.:
Of this amount, approximately 115 .ercenc would be in the form oL' incrementa:.
working cadital for the purchase of' fertilizers and herbicides for use onl
crops.  The project would finance the establishmenG of improved pasture on    :u,
10-20 nercent of the farm area which, with additional grazing gained froi c0,J
stubble and natural pasture, would form the basis for thle develooment of
,ivestock.  The farmers would continue to cultivate field croos on about- h'
the farm area, and the project would, through the provision of technical
assistance and short-term production credit, lead -to an imtjrovemenv in flUt'itOi '
oractices and an increase in yields.   It is an6iciinated -hac new oasdure s woai d
be established every five years, on a rocational basis, although the devaaL&,' of
the program would vary wich individual farms.
On-Lending Terms
3.        ihe proposed investmens program would be financially remunerai!-ve fo-r
the farmer, with a financial rate of re-turn on incremen.a,l investment over -.
12-year period estimated to be about 30 percent per annum.    however, ;ne i aome
is likely to face a major liquidity problem over -he first- few years durir.;
the herd build-up period.   For this reason, it will be necessary GO chane-e
repayment conditions somewhat from the pattern laid down for oasture deve i nc i
loans on beef-cattle ranches.   Since the program would be new, there shot.    d
considerable flexibility on the reDayment conditions, wiF,h terms ca:Lculated to
suit the specific needs of individual fanrs.   It will )robably be necessary .irn
most cases to reduce the contribu-tion made by the farmer to the initial invest-
ment cost of the droject from the noraal 20 percent expected from -the larger
ranchers, to 10 percent, and to allow a grace period on reoayment of nrinci-oal

of nD to five years, instead of up to four years in the case of the other
ranchers. Monetary adjustment and interest rates would be applied in the
same manner as to beef-cattle and sheep ranches.
Technical Assistance
4r        Although some of the borrowers under this sub-project would possibly
be experienced in livestock management, it is probable that for the majority
of farmers this would be a new enterprise. At the same time, the introduction
of a pasture-crop rotation would require a much higher level of farm manage-
ment than traditional production systems demand, and a greatly improved
knowledge of crop husbandry practices would be required. It will be necessary,
therefore, to supply a considerable degree of technical assistance in both crop
and livestock production to sub-borrowers under this program. As the technical
requirements for such assistance will be rather different from those of the
standard beef and sheep ranches, it will be necessary to recruit and train
specialized technicians for this function. A minimum of two such technicians
will oe employed at the start of the program, with further recruitment neces-
sary as the program expands.
