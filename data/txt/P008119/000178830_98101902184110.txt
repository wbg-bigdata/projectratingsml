INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY FOR A
FOURTH LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republica Oriental del Uruguay for the equivalent of US$11.2
million to help finance the first stage of the Fourth Livestock Project.
The loan would have a term of fourteen years, including four years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION
2.        During the past decade Uruguay has experienced virtual economic
stagnation. This was largely the result of a lack of consensus regarding
national objectives, in particular in relation to the emphasis to be given
to economic growth versus income distribution. In the latter part of the
period, the authorities failed in mobilizing political support for a pro-
gram capable of reconciling these objectives. As a consequence, policies
were followed which were detrimental to production, investment and exports
and there was no progress towards a better distribution of incomes either.
Uruguay's history of the 1960's, therefore, is one of declining per capita
income, high rates of inflation, serious fiscal problems and numerous
balance of payments crises. For some time daring that period, government
policies transferred resources from the key agricultural sector to the
urban population of Montevideo. Economic growth policies received too
little attention as witnessed by inadequate production incentives, a tax-
ation structure detrimental to production and investment increases, and a
low level of public savings leading to an inadequate level of public
investment.
3.        The present Government, which came to power in March of this year,
intends to implement a development strategy which is growth-oriented and
would consist of stimulating the private sector (principally the agricultural
and manufacturing sectors) through measures designed to provide incentives
for production and export. The new Government under President Juan Maria
Bordaberry inherited a difficult internal and external financial situation
as evidenced by accelerating inflation, a large balance of payments deficit
and a heavy burden of short-term debt. It has formulated and is trying to



-2-
implement a program to reverse financial deterioration, stimulate investment
and restore economic growth capacity.  Through proper incentives, including
a realistic exchange rate policy and the removal of distortion in internal
prices, and the provision of essential infrastructure facilities, there is
no reason why Uruguay's impressive production and export potential could
not be developed rapidly. To carry through this program, however,
continued political support is essential.
4.        The elections held in November 1971 brought to power in early March
President Bordaberry of the Colorado Party who was the former Agriculture
Minister under outgoing President Pacheco Areco. The new Government was
elected with only a small plurality, and the Colorados do not command a
majority in parliament. The Government, however, includes representation
from the opposition Blanco Party, indicating a degree of unity and cooperation
of the two traditional, moderate parties with respect to issues of national
policy. The radical left coalition which had been formed about a year and
a half ago from previously splintered leftist parties, was expected to pose
a considerable threat to the dominance of the two traditional parties. How-
ever, the coalition, organized as the Frente Amplio (Broad Front), obtained
only about 18 percent of the vote, failing to win the important urban vote
and the mayoralty of Montevideo. Nevertheless, the Frente Amplio does hold
the balance of power in parliament, and by allying with certain Blanco
elements could be significant in defeating some of the Government's par-
liamentary initiatives. At this moment, however, when it comes to issues
of national economic policy, the Government may be expected to gather suf-
ficient votes in parliament, including some support from the Blancos.   Only
time will tell how long the present Government will be able to retain the
initiative in matters of economic and financial policy.
5.        Uruguay, at the present time, is clearly at a crossroad, but the
outlook is for a set of policies and programs which would emphasize economic
growth. This is so because the Government realizes that without achieving
substantial growth over the medium-term it has little chance of resolving
the long standing conflicting claims for the use of resources and of stemming
the outflow from Uruguay of its young and qualified citizens. This turn-
around in policies deserves support.
6.        The most recent Economic Report (WH-205a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on February 18, 1971. In March of this year a small
economic mission visited Uruguay to update the information contained in that
report. Country data and a note on recent developments in Uruguay, the
external debt problem and the Government's economic program for 1972 are
attached as Annex II.

PART II - THE BANK'S PEE IN URUGUAY
Introduction
7.        Bank lending to Uruguay has had as its overall objective the
support of government policies aimed at stimulating economic growth by
providing financial assistance to export-oriented livestock production,
and to essential infrastructural investments. However, during extended
periods in the 1960's, as mentioned before, goverments pursued unsound
economic and financial policies. As a consequence, the Bank found itself
unable to lend during the period 1965-69. With a reversal of these
policies during the stabilization period of 1969-70, the Bank resumed
operations and made three loans, two for livestock and one for power.
Status of Bank Operations
8.        A summary statement of the nine Bank loans made to date is
attached as Annex I. While about 65 percent of our lending (US$82 million)
has been for four projects in the power sector, and a loan of US$18.5 million
(324) was made in 1962 to help finance a road construction project, in terms
of its direct impact on the level of production and the introduction of new
technology, Bank lending for livestock development has been the most impor-
tant element in our lending program (cf. Section III).
9.        The Bank's association with the development of the livestock sec-
tor in Uruguay began more than twenty years ago when in 1950 a joint FAO/
Bank mission advised the Government on a pilot scheme for new pasture
improvement techniques which laid the foundation for the subsequent lending
program for livestock in Uruguay. In 1959, the BaRk made its first live-
stock development loan of US$7.0 million (245). The project proved the
feasibility of the new technology in Uruguay, demonstrating that ranchers
were prepared to adopt modern techniques of pasture management. These
encouraging results prompted the Bank to make a second livestock loan in
the amount of US$12.7 million in March 1965 (407). &Sbsequently, however,
the technical success achieved under these two loans was temporarily off-
set by adverse government livestock sector policies. When these policies
were revised the Bank granted its Third Livestock Loan for US$6.3 million
in 1970 (698). Soon after, the Bank agreed, in 1971, to_make a supplemental
loan of US$4.0 pillion (773) to meet the inoreased progrua requiremients.
10.       The Closing Date for the Third Livestock Loan (698) was postponed
for six months to June 30, 1972 to allow completion of disbursements under
existing commitments for agricultural machinery and seed processing equip-
ment.



11.       The only lag in disbursements relates to the Power Generation
and Distribution Project (712). An initial half-year delay in project
execution was caused by slow administrative and management procedures and
the cumbersome system of controls exercised by the Govemment over the
operations of the Borrower - UTE (Administraci6n General de las Usinas
Electricas y los Tel6fonos del Estado).  This resulted in delays in
procurement and in the awarding of the contract to consultants selected
to recommend and help implement improvements in the organization pro-
cedures and operating efficiency of UTE. These problems are being over-
come.
12.       The proposed loan would be the Bankts tenth operation in Uruguay
and would bring the amount of Bank lending to US$141.7 million.   External
financing to Uruguay, other than by the Bank Group, is principally pro-
vided by US AID and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). USAID has
been active in transport, agriculture and industry. The IDB is financing
mainly transport, industrial development, including the meat packing
industry, and education. The past lending of the main official lending
agencies is summarized below in US$ million.

13.       No investments have yet been made by the IFC in Uruguay.



Future Direction of Bank Lending
14.       In view of the serious economic problems which the Government
will have to deal with I considered the advisability of another pause
in Bank lending. Given, however, the fact that the Bank is the major
source of credit financing for the critical livestock sector, I have
rejected this approach on the grounds of the widespread and detrimental
effects which such a pause could have on the continued success of the
livestock production program and the ultimate damaging effects it would
have on the national economy which is so dependent on livestook. This
decision was influenced by early indications from the new Government
regarding its economic program for 1972 and its development strategy,
and by the Government's desire to seek support for this program from
the International Monetary Fund. Nevertheless, while I attach great
importance to the Bank's efforts in continuing to support the
Government's livestock development program, I consider it advisable to
limit the Bank's initial loan commitment, particularly since I am not
certain whether there exists in Uruguay a political consensus regarding
the adjustments wht*ich the Government proposes to introduce in economic
policy. Thus, although the Appraisal Report, (PA-lOb) dated February
17, 1972, has been prepared on the basis of a two-year project and
finds that a Bank loan of US$25.6 million would be suitable, we are
proceeding with a loan of US$11.2 million, sufficient to finance only
the first year of the project. Depending on a clarification of the
outlook for the economy, I may recommend for your consideration,
probably toward the end of this year, a further loan of US$14.4 minion.
15.       Later this year the Government will present a medium-term
investment and external financing program to the external lending
agencies and a Bank mission will be visiting Uruguay to discuss the
Government's development strategy. The Bank's lending strategy will
clearly have to depend both on an analysis of the Government's program
and on the success of the Government in re-establishing sound financial
and economic management. Subject to adequate progress we would expect
to assist Uruguay in achieving its growth objective through maintaining
and possibly increasing the present momentum of livestock lending. In
the power sector we would expect to continue lending for the expansion of
generation, transmission and distribution capacity.  To this end, the
Bank's recent loan provides assistance for the urgently required
investment planning and organizational improvements in the power sector.
Similarly, provision in the loan for a study of long-range generating plant
needs will help chart the course of future Bank participation in
Uruguay's power sector.
16.       We intend to explore further new possibilities for agricultural
diversification which would lay the foundation for growth in other sectors



-6-
with the immediate aim of reducing the country's balance of payments
deficit. To assist in this process, the proposed project contains ,a
small amount for pre-investment studies which will identify new avenues
for Bank assistance, particularly in agriculture and related activities.
The new elements of dairy beef and pig production included in the pro-
posed project will provide important information on the feasibility of
mixed fanming in Uruguay, based on improved land use and management
techniques.
17.       In January 1972, the United Nations Development Programme
agreed to participate in the financing of a pre-investment study for
fishery research and development, which the Bank intends to follow
very closely. The Bank shall examine the feasibility of participation
in the agro-industrial sector, particularly the meat packing industry,
which will require greater assistance as beef and lamb output continues
to expand. In view of the traditional academic orientation of education the
Bank will review the requirementsfor technical education in Uruguay with par-
ticular reference to the needs of the growing livestock and industrial sec-
tors.  The Bank also intends to examine the need for investment to improve
access to the major touristic areas of the country. Finally, the feasi-
bility of a highway maintenance project is being considered. While Uru-
guay is serwed by a fairly extensive and generally adequate road network,
the need for further assistance in its improvement and in a more effective
maintenance program is urgent.
PART III - THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR
18.       Agriculture provides, directly and indirectly, about 30 percent
of Uruguay's GNP and employs about 20 percent of the labor force. Exports
of livestock products, amounting to US$191.0 million in 1970, accounted
for about 85 percent of export earnings. Crop production, contributing
about 25 percent as much as livestock to GNP, is mainly geared to supplying
local needs. Uruguay has a marked comparative advantage in the production
of beef cattle, sheep and milk. The Government has concentrated on in-
creasing meat production for export, since expansion of wool and dairy
production is limited by the international demand for these products. About
15 million hectares of the 16.5 million hectares devoted to agriculture
are pasture lands used for livestock. These pastures support about 8.5
million beef cattle, 600,000 dairy cattle, 19.8 million sheep and 380.000
pigs. Bank-sponsored projects have stimulated beef production so-that
exports of beef increased by about one-third between 1968 and 197Q. Mean-
while, the percentage of beef output domestically consumed has been only
slowly decreasing. The proposed project would help to substitute pork and
lamb for beef in the internal market, as well as stimulate production of
existing and some new sources of beef (dairy beef). To direct the development
of livestock, the Honorary Livestock Commission was established in 1959 as
a semi-autonomous technical authority within the Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock.



-7-
19.       Since there are no longer large areas of new land to bring into
use, improved pasture management and greater use of inputs, such as fertilizer,
must provide the principal means of increasing livestock production. A recent
sample survey under the Third Livestock Project of 50 representative proper-
ties indicates that output can be increased threefold from about 70 kilograms
(beef liveweight) per hectare on unimproved natural pastures to an average
of some 220 kilograms per hectare on improved pastures. Pasture improvements
have now been made on 6,100 ranches in the country. Under the Bank's lending
program, improved pastures increased ten times during the past decade, reaching
over 1.2 million hectares which still, however, represents only 8 percent of
total pasture land. During the Second Livestock Project, high export taxes
and restrictive credit policies severely reduced the financial rate of return
to the rancher to less than 8 percent in May 1969. This rate was substantially
below the real cost of money (11 percent on loans, most of which have been
indexed since late 1968 onwards) and the yields on alternative investments.
The resulting reluctance on the part of ranchers to invest, except where non-
indexed loans could be obtained, presented an obvious threat to the entire
livestock program.
20.       By the end of 1969, the Government agreed to introduce policy
reforms and improve investment incentives, including a sharp reduction in
wool export taxes, modification of beef export taxes to encourage quality and
removal of import duties on agricultural machinery. Along with the sharp
increase in international beef prices, these changes resulted in a substan-
tial rise in farm gate prices and the effect was a rise in the financial
rate of return to about 23 percent under the Third Livestock Loan. In the
proposed project, the financial rate of return is estimated at 25 percent
for beef and sheep ranches, 18 percent for pig farms, and 29 percent for
dairy beef farms. Recent information indicates that these estimates are
on the conservative side.
21.       At present there are some 79,000 ranches in the country:   73 per-
cent are under 100 hectares and account for about 6 percent of the land.
At the other end of the scale some 2 percent of the ranches have above
2,500 hectares and represent 35 percent of the land. The first Bank loan
supported a pilot project which demonstrated the advantages of modern tech-
niques of pasture improvements and management to the nation's ranchers.
After this initial success, Bank lending was channeled mainly to larger
and medium-sized ranches in order to obtain an increase in production as
soon as possible. Of the 3,600 ranches and farms eligible to receive credit
under the Fourth Livestock Project, around 2,000 units would be medium-sized
ranches of around 500 hectares but, for the first time, some 600 smaller
units of below 100 hectares will be developed, mainly for dairy beef and
pig farms.



- 8 -
22.       Some 17 meat packing and processing plants operate in Uruguay.
Since 1969, the private sector has invested over US$8.0 million to meet
international sanitary requirements, expand production of special
products and improve operating efficiency. Other investments have also
been made in plant and the industry, mainly privately owned, had shown
definite signs of becoming a viable and healthy extension of a growing
livestock sector. However, since September of last year, most plants have
either not been producing or have operated at a fraction of their:
capacity. The main reason was the inability of the packing plants to
purchase cattle for slaughter at prices low enough to permit profitable
export. As a result of the Government's exchange rate policy, which
led to an official exchange rate which greatly overvalued the peso, a
black market for exchange developed. Ranchers and farmers either'
retained their animals or sold them directly to Brazilian buyers, who
had purchased pesos at the black market rate and who then smuggled the
cattle across the border. Since March 2 of this year, the new
Government has established a more realistic exchange rate which w'1l
permit meat packing plants to pay a higher peso price for cattle. We
are confident that these new exchange rate measures will soon permit
the meat packing industry to operate at full capacity and take full
advantage of the Government's efforts to build up an efficient mept
packing industry.  In this connection, the proposed loan would prpvide
funds for technical assistance to the industry.
PART IV - TfHE PROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Livestock rDevelopment
Project, Uruguay" (No. PA-llOb) dated February 17, 1972 is being circulated
separately. A loan and project summary is attached as annex III     The
Fourth Livestock Project was appraised in May and June 1971 and
negotiations were held in Washington from January 24 - February 1, 1972.
The Gorernment of Uruguay was represented at these negotiations by Dr.
Hector Luisi, Uruguayan Ambassador; Dr. Benito Medero, Vice-President
of the Honorary Livestock Commission; Dr. Luis 0. Coirolo of the
Honorary Livestock Cammission; Dr. Jorge Sambarino, Manager of the Bank
of the Republic; and Dr. Rodolfo Olivet, Deputy Manager of the Bank of
the Republic.
24.       The proposed loan would provide financial and technical assist-
ance to continue the livestock development program begun under the three
previous Bank projects. On-ranch development loans for about 3,400
ranches and farms will be made. Three new elements are now included in



- 9 -
the proposed project: the financing of investments in dairy beef pro-
duction; pig raising; and loans to farmers to permit retention or
purchase of heifers for breeding purposes. The project, covering all
areas of the country, would also provide funds for the importation of
contractors' equipment. Credits to seed processors and fanmers for the
expansion of pasture seed production and processing facilities and funds
for technical services will also be provided.
25.       The Honorary Livestock Commission (Comision Honoraria del Plan
Agropecuario) will continue to be responsible for the supervision and co-
ordination of the livestock development program. The Comission will
have primary responsibility for the preparation, appraisal, approval and
supervision of the ranch development plans, the import plans for seeds
and fertilizers, the contractors' investments plans, and the technical
and financial plans of the seed producers and processors. The Goverment
will continue providing the necessary funds for the administrative costs
of the Commission. The project will continue to be assisted by an inter-
nationally recruited Technical Director and a Senior Agricultural
Economist.
26.       Specifically, the proposed project would consist of the
following components:
(a) Cattle and Sheep Ranch Development. The financing, through
long-temu on-ranch development loans, of development plans
for about 3,050 ranches and farma, to improve cattle and
sheep production and to shift emphasis from wool to
mutton and lamb production. Investments would be in
pasture improvement, breeding stock, fencing, machinery,
water supplies and other ranchT infrastructure. Bank funds
will finance about 51 percent of each on-ranch investment.
The average ranch size would be about 700 hectares. Also
included in the project are medium-term incremental
working capital loans eaII   .or by rancX jlans t-o t finance
retention 6f brdiiigheifers otherwise destined for
slaughter. Bank funds would constitute 37 percent of such
loans, with participating banks providing the balance.
(b) Dairy Beef. The objective of the new dairy beef program
is the raising of about 20,000 male calves, currently
killed at birth, to 14-18 months of age for slaughter and
export as baby beef. Some 450 farmers operating dairy
farms of about 100 hectares each will receive financial
and technical support for pasture improvement, fencing,
machinery and ranch infrastructure.



- 10 -
(c) Pig Production. The primary goal is the increase in
pork production as a substitute for beef in the domestic
market.   To this end the project would support about
100 new and existing farm units each year, averaging
some 30 hectares. Development plans would cover invest-
ments for initial feed costs on new farms and for '
farrowing and finishing pens, breeding pens, feed-mixing
machinery, fencing and other improvements on all farms.
(d)  Contractors' Machinery. Loans will be made for the
importation of machinery to be purchased by contraptors
for the construction of on-ranch water storage facilities
and pasture improvement of participating ranches and
farms. About 50 contractor loans are expected to be
made for ranch and farm machinery and dam construction
equipment. Loans to contractors will represent about
70 percent of the total investment cost.
(e)  Seed Production and Processing.  Loans to eligible,
farmers and seed processors will be made to purchase
special types of imported seed producing, harvesting,
cleaning, processing and certification machinery and.
;equipment.
(f)  Technical.Services and Training. Many of these services
will be provided by the staff of the Honorary Commission.
In addition:to supervision, technical services will con-
tinue to_be used for introducing new technology in,
livestock production and pasture management. Other
programs will include the demonstration of pasture and
forage conservation techniques, technical advice fo meat
and dairy processing plants on various subjects,
including marketing and hygiene. Related goods and
equipment to assure the effective execution of these
services would also be provided. The project will also
finance -local and overseas training of livestock and
credit technicians. In addition, a small amount has
been included for the financing of pre-investment studies
with a view to strengthening the government's capa.bilities
in identifying and preparing investment projects in
agriculture.
27.       Heifer financing was excluded under previous Bank projects.
It was assumed that most ranchers were unlikely to have more than;10
percent of their ranches developed with improved pasture, an area,
sufficient to meet the requirements of existing breeding herds. However,



it appears that ranch development has proceeded more rapidly over the
last two and a;half years than was originally contemplated and that on
many ranches much more than 10 percent of the pasture has now been
improved. In these circumstances an increase in the size of breeding
herds beyond that provided by normal biological growth is required to
fully utilize the pasture improvements and maximize the increase in
production and exports over the longer run. For this reason, the new
project includes loans to enable project ranchers to retain and/or
purchase breeding heifers that would otherwise be slaughtered.
Financing
28.       The total cost of the first stage of the project is estimated
at US$24.3 million equivalent and the proposed loan would cover the
foreign exchange component, estimated at US$11.2 million, accounting
for 46 percent of the total project costs. The cost-sharing arrangements
follow the same principle applied under the previous loans, and the
balance of 54 percent of project costs will be provided as follows:
Government, 7 percent of total cost; Central Bank, 13 percent;
participating banks, 18 percent; and sub-borrowers, 16 percent.
29.       The Livestock Fund of the Central Bank, established under the
Third Livestock Project, would continue acting as the channel for project
funds to be provided by the Govenment, the Central Bank and the
proposed Bank loan. The system of separate accounts for on-ranch
investments and technical services would remain in effect.
30.       On-ranch development loans will be extended on tenms ranging
between 7-10 years, including a grace period of 2-4 years. In the now
project, ranchers will be able to purchase additional breeding heifers
under the ranch development loans* The loans to eligible participating
ranchers and farmers for incremental working capital for heifer retention
and initial pig feed costs will be on teoms ranging from 3-7 years,
including not less than one year nor more than three years period of
grace. Loans to contractors will be for 5-7 years with one year of grace
and loans to seed processors will be for 10 years. As in previous
projects, the rate of interest charged to ranchers, farmers and
contractors for all loans and incremental working capital will be 11
percent.
31.       Under the Third Livestock Project relending for on-ranch
development was through the state-owned Bank of the Republic, a commercial
bank. Although it was open to other commercial banks to participate,
none of them,in fact,did so.  The new loan includes measures to make
commercial bank participation in the on-ranch development loan program
more attractive by refinancing a higher proportion of their sub-loans



- 12 -
and offering a wider spread on the relending. Further, to encourage
the maximum use of the commercial banks'own funds, the spread on loans
to participating banks would increase as the proportion of the banks'
own funds increases. To illustrate, when the bank puts up 10 psrcent
of the amount of a sub-loan, the livestock fund would charge 9 percent,
giving the bank a spread of only 2 percent. Hovever, when the bank
puts up 20 percent of the amount of a sub-loan, the interest rate
charged to the bank would be only 5 percent, thus allowing a 6 percent
spread. The graduated scale of interest rates charged to participating
banks would only apply to on-ranch development loans. Loans for ,
incremental working capital and to contractors and seed processors,
would bear a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent. Participating banks
will, of course, take full risk on all subloans. Banks wishing to,
participate in the program would have to meet eligibility criteria
established by the Central Bank.
32.       While the project provides medium-term incremental working
capital, additional short-term credit in the fonr of seasonal finaiicing
will also be required by participating farmers and ranchers. These
requirements will be determined by the Commission at the time the ranch
development plans are drawn up. Participating banks are to provide from
their own resources short-term working capital to ranchers and farmers
who obtain ranch development and incremental working capital loans.
Indexing
33.       As in the previous two loans, the principal of all long and
medium-tenm sub-loans will be in pesos but will be adjusted in accordance
with an index based on the average increase in the ranch-gate price of
beef and wool, but not to exceed the amount that would have resulted
from basing the adjustment on the increase in the cost of living index.
For on-ranch development loans, adjustment will be 100 percent for
loans to borrowers with ranches in excess of 400 hectares. Loans to
borrowers width less than 400 hectares will be adjusted by 50 percent.
Since the smaller ranchers and farmers account for only a minor
portion of the total volume of lending under the project, it is estimated
that on about 90 percent of the total amount of on-ranch loans a real
rate of interest of 1 percent will be charged. The Governent wnll
ensure compensation of the participating banks for any loss of incpme
resulting from partially-indexed sub-loans. The repayment record pf
sub-borrowers of indexed loans under the previous Bank-sponsored projects
has been good. As of June 1971, only about 3 percent of the amounts due
were six months behind and 2 percent were overdue beyond one year.,

Procurement
34.       International competitive bidding procedures will be used for
the bulk procurement of pasture seeds and fertilizers (US$3.0 million),and
machinery for seed producers and contractors (US$0.22 million). Wible
under previous projects only two foreign producers could provide rock phos-
phate (for local grinding and direct application) suitable for Uruguayan
conditions, other potential suppliers are being invited to submit samples
for testing in Uruguay. Bidding for all other types of rook phosphate will
be open to all suppliers. Goods and equipment related to technical services
will also be subject to international competitive bidding. Purchases of
fencing, materials for handling yards, farm machinery, water puwps, piping,
feed and building materials will be made looally by individual participating
ranchers and farmers. An adequate selection of international suppliers i8
represented in the local market. The procedures outlined above are the same
as those followed succeassfuly under the Third and Supplementary Third Live-
stock loans.
Disbursement
35.       As in the previous projects, the Bank will disburse directly to
suppliers of the imported seeds and fertilizers to be used by participating
ranchers under the on-ranch development credit program. The equivalent
amount of pesos will then be deposited by the Borrower in the Livestock Fund
of the Central Bank for making on-ranch development loans. Since these funds
would cover only part of foreign exchange costs of on-ranch development loans,
the Bank would also reimburse the Livestock Fund for the equivalent of 46
percent of on-ranch development loans. In addition, the Bank would also dis-
burse against the full foreign exchange costs of contractors' machinery, seed
processing equipment, the technical services and related equipment.
36.       Since the early 1960's, the Government has maintained a policy of
subsidizing phosphate fertilizer costs from proceeds of beef and wool export
taxes, thus reducing farm gate costs to levels equal to Uruguay's major com-
petitors in New Zealand and Australia. The Bank has agreed that the subsidy
should continue in order to encourage wider and more regular use of phosphate
fertilizer, at least until 20 peroent of Uruguay's pasture area is improved.
At this i vel of usage, the value of routine application of phosphate in
atimulating pasture production will have been amply demonstrated and the sub-
sidy could be phased out. Therefore, the Government will submit a plan to
the Bank by June 1, 1973 for phasing out the fertilizer subsidy in Uruguay
once that level of usage has been achieved.
Economic Rate of deturn
37.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be 31
percent, assuming an average long-term world beef price of US$700.0 per
metric ton, which is below present world prices. Even if world beef prices



- 14 -
were to average 10 percent less than the long-term price now projected, the
rate of return would still be 19 percent. Financial rates of return were
discussed in paragraph 20.
38.       At full development, after seven years, the investments under this
project are likely to result in an incremental beef production of 49,OOO
metric tons, valued at US$34.3 million equivalent. This should make possible
additional exports of an equivalent amount given current production and con-
sumption trends. An incremental 8,000 metric tons of mutton and lamb, plus
an additional 6,000 metric tons of pork, are expected to be produced as a
result of this project and would be worth about US$5.6 million equivalent.
PART      LEGAL INSTRUKTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Republica Oriental
del Uruguay, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for agri-
cultural projects.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI -h RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

'Annex II
PART II. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION
1.        A report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Uruguay" (WH-205a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on Feb-
ruary 8, 1971. In March 1972 an updating economic mission visited
Uruguay to make a preliminary evaluation of the economic policies of
the new Government which has recently come into office. The mission's
major findings and conclusions are presented below.
Recent Overall Performance
2.        A successful stabilization program was carried out between 1967
and mid-1970. A combination of wages, monetary and fiscal policies suc-
ceeded in greatly reducing the rate of inflation. After a record rise
of 136 percent in 1967, the rate of price increase declined to 66 percent
in 1968, to 15 percent in 1969, and to under 10 percent during the first
half of 1970. Real output grew by a record 6.2 percent in 1969 and by
about 4.3 percent in 1970, after more than a decade of virtual stagnation.
The private sector after years of disinvestment responded to the favorable
government policies by greatly stepping up investment in machinery and
equipment. Moreover, as a result of substantial improvements in price
incentives to livestock producers, a reorganization of the meat packing
industry and a firming-up of world beef prices, the balance of payments
was strengthened and the Government was able to amortize rapidly a large
foreign debt which had accumulated in the form of rescheduled commercial
and financial arrears during the mid-sixties.
3.        This commendable short-term perfonmance came to a halt by mid-
1970. Price inflation accelerated once again and the financial situation
deteriorated rapidly. The government's reluctance to move an exchange
rate which over-valued the peso led to capital flight and there was a
balance of payments deficit of about $50 million in 1970.
4.        During 1971, because of impending general elections, the Govern-
ment relaxed excessively its monetary, fiscal and wages policies and the
balance of payments situation deteriorated further. An increase in the
fiscal deficit, a soft incomes policy and a large expansion of credit to
the private sector fueled a high level of aggregate demand. The rate of
inflation accelerated and the cost of living index rose by 36 percent;
rising meat prices which loom large in the cost of living index accentuated
the cost-push elements. Overall output stagnated and according to pre-
liminary indications capital formation dropped by some 5 percent. In the
face of these developments, the Government failed to adjust the exchange
rate. Instead, it imposed exchange controls, increased import surcharges
and embarked on a cumbersome multiple rate system, including the maintenance



of effective exchange rates for its principal export products, which over-
valued the peso. As a consequence of these policies, customs-cleared export
earnings declined, capital flight intensified and foreign exchange reserves
of the monetary authorities dropped by US$33 million to US$97 million. In
addition, the G&vernment had to make arrangements with external creditors
to roll over some of its short-term obligations and a large amount of import-
payment arrears accumulated.
The Near-Term Outlook
5.        By March 1972 a new Government, consisting largely of elements
which fostered the 1969-70 stabilization, took office. As a first step,
the new Government devalued the peso and simplified the multiple ex;change
rate system as a part of an emergencystabilization program. The program
also includes a fiscal package consisting of increasing taxes and reducing
expenditures; a credit program aimed at reducing liquidity by controlling
the expansion of money supply;  and, a wages and salary policy designed to
curtail aggregate demand in line with the import and production possibilities
of the economy. On the basis of this program, the Government has started
negotiations for a stand-by arrangement with the IMF which would allow re-
duction and subsequent elimination of the existing payments arrears and the
rescheduling of short-term debt obligations.
6.        The budget for 1972 calls for a drastic reduction in the overall
deficit by about 50 percent in nominal terns. The planned deficit is to
equal only about 2 percent of GDP, compared with 6 percent in 1971.. This
reduction is primarily made possible by adoption of a severe austerity
program for expenditures and the imposition of export taxes made po,ssible
by a devaluation of about 100 percent of the exchange rate applicable to
trade transactions and an improvement in regular tax administration. In
addition, the new administration has announced a program for tax reform to
be implemented during the second half of the year. This program, which is
now under study, is expected to include:
(a) the transformation of the present turnover sales
tax into a value added tax resulting in an ex-
tension of the tax base;
(b) a structural change in the present income tax
system improving the progressiveness of the tax;
(c) a full-scale implementation of the minimum produc-
tivity land tax which will permit a gradual
elimination of export taxes;
(d) the elimination and consolidation of a very large
number of small indirect taxes; and
(e) a comprehensive program to improve tax adminis-
tration.



7.        Another step of great importance was the government's announced
policy of full cost pricing of public services. FoUowing the official
pronouncement, power rates were increased by about 90 percent on the average
and prices of gasoline and gas were increased by 100 percent. This signi-
ficant turnaround in public sector pricing will be crucial to increasing
public sector savings and to maintaining satisfaotory rates of return on
investments made by the public agencies.
8.        The new economic team is determined to restrain price inflation,
but is giving first priority to the elimination of major price distortions.
The impact of the devaluation in March and the corrective price adjustments
that are taking place in electric power, fuels, telecommunications and other
public service tariffs may be expected to hamper efforts to restrain infla-
tion. Because of these adjustments and the fact that consumer prices rose
by about 10 percent in the first two months of 1972 expectations are that
the internal prices will remain under pressure during the remaining months
of the first half of the year.  The authorities are, however, confident that
they will be able to reduce the rate of inflation during the second half of
the year by improving their tools to control excess demand and by implementing
a program that calls for substantial curtailment in the expansion of money
supply. As indicated above, the Government intends to implement an austere
budget which calls for a reduction of Central Bank credit to the public sector
by about 50 percent in nominal terms.  In addition, credit expansion to the
private sector will be restricted to about 38 percent, while pricea are ex-
pected to rise by some 40 percent and GDP by about 3 percent.
9.        The Government also intends to restrict wage and salary increases
to the minimum necessary to maintain the 1970 real wage level. This implies
an increase in real wages of over 11 percent over 1969 but a decline of 5 per-
cent below 1971. Achievement of this objective will present many political
difficulties. The authorities are convinced, however, that they must demon-
strate their ability to restrain inflation in 1972 in order to boost private
sector confidence and help accelerate the rate of economic growth during
subsequent years.
10.       As a result of the foreign exchange refonm carried out this March,
two foreign exchange markets have been created. The first is a so-called
"official" market for commercial transactions - exports and imports - and for
public sector operations, rates for which will be adjusted frequently as
necessary. The official market rate was initially set at Ps 495/500 per US$
equivalent to a 100 percent devaluation in the official rate and to about
35 percent in the effective import rate. Since export taxes on meat products
were imposed, the effective exchange rate for frozen quarters of beef remained
virtually unchanged from the level established in January 1972 when the previous



Government under extreme balance of payments pressure raised the
effective rate by some 40 percent. The effective rate for special beef
cuts was, however, increased by about 17 percent and for wool by about
10 percent in March. The second newly established market is the "free" 
exchange market for all other transactions, including tourist requirements.
The rate in this market will freely fluctuate with demand and supply.
The free market rate stood at a level of around 750 Ps per US$ during
the first week of the new system. The government expects that by year-end
1972 the spread betwe6n'the official and the more depreciated free'rate
will narrow.
11.    The Government's measures to establish a more realistic exchange
rate should contribute to an improvement in the current account of the
balance of payments provided the intended adjustments are timely and in
magnitudes required to encourage Uruguay's exports.   This year's exports
should recover most of the decline experienced in 1971, since it is expected
that the exchange rate adjustments made this year and the announced policy
of frequent rate adjustments will serve as a strong incentive to exports,
particularly of meat.  Under these circumstances, illegal cattle sales
to Brazil will become less attractive and the volume of recorded meat exports
should reach the level of earlier years. Since beef prices are continuing
to rise in. the world market, an increase of about 35 percent in the value
of Uruguay's 1972 meat exports is expected, compared to the low level of
1971. Total exports are projected to increase by only 9 percent in 1972
because of partly offsetting declines in export values of wool due to falling
prices and reduced availability for export of agricultural products because
of a poor harvest.
12.     Imports in 1972 are projected to remain at the 1971 level which
was high for a year of stagnating economic activity. This appears
reasonable since large stocks of raw materials and intermediate goods
are reputed to have been accumulated in expectation of a devaluation.
Mbreover, the authorities expect to have greater sucess in limiting
imports than was the'case last year. Thus, a positive trade balance is
expected in 1972 after last year's trade deficit.
13.    Overall balance of payments viability for 1972 depends largely
on the results of the negotiations now being carried out with the,IMF and
on the creditors' willingness to reschedule short-term obligations and
commercial arrears. If a new standby agreement materialized creditors'
willingness to reschedule their credits will be enhanced. In addition,
Uruguay may qualify for another round of IMF compensatory financing. With
this financial support Uruguay should be able to achieve balance of payment
viability in 1972.



14.       The outstanding long- and medium-term external public and
publicly guaranteed debt (including amounts undisbursed) at the end of
1971 stood at US$315 million. In 1971 scheduled service on this debt
amounted to US$71 million, or 29 percent of foreign exchange earnings
of which US$48 million was paid and the remainder rolled over into 1972
because of the very tight balance of payments situation. Largely, as a
result of these roll-overs, the service payments in 1972 rise to about
32 percent of estimated foreign exchange earnings. In addition, the
volume of outstanding short-term credits has increased substantially
and a portion of these may be consolidated and funded into long-term
debt.
Longer-term Outlook
15.       It is difficult to assess at this time the longer-term
implications of the new government policies but, o.n the whole, they
auger well, if the government is able to mobilize and preserve the
necessary political consensus in support of its program. Export earnings
may be expected to rise both as a result of greater incentives and on
account of the excellent outlook in the international market for beef.
Moreover, the Uruguayan economy has demonstrated in the recent past that
it is capable of a favorable response to sound economic and financial
policies. In view of the measures already taken by the new economic team
and its determination to increase public sector savings and investment;
to expand production and exports of livestock products; to create addi-
tional employment by attracting private investment and diversifying the
economy; to contain the rate of inflation within tolerable limits and to
protect the balance of payments through a realistic exchange rate, the
longer-term prospects of the economy should be greatly enhanced and the
external debt service burden should not be unmanageable.
16.       Service on the existing long- and medium-term public and
publicly guaranteed debt is expected to decline sharply after 1972.
However, short-term liabilities are now so high that conversion into
long-term debt of at least part of these liabilities, will probably
be required. A preliminary medium-term projection based on assumptions
of improved policies, better growth and making allowance for adequate
new capital inflows, indicates that some reduction in the debt service
burden could take place over the period 1972-1976. Although the debt
service ratio, including an estimate for the service of probable re-
scheduling of short-term debt, is .likely to remain high during the next
two years, it is projected not to exceed 15 percent by 1976.
