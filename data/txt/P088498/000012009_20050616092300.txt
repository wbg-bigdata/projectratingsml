A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsectorissues

Sound fundamentals and a strategy for integration in the world economy through elimination of
trade barriers have been effective in underpinning growth at a steady pace in Chile and shielding
the country from regional crises. Between 1990 and 2003 Chile's annual per capita growth
averaged 4.1 percent. This is significantly above the level for the region and compares well with
high performing economies in East Asia and the Pacific. Inthe same period, extreme poverty
was reduced to 4.7 percent of the population and the overall poverty level was halved to 18.8
percent.

The challenge for Chile is to sustain economic growth and social development and remain
competitive in the context of an open economy. Much will depend on the ability of the economy
to diversify and reduce its dependence on low value-added exports as factor accumulation and
natural resources are unlikely to remain sources of growth in the future. The Chilean economy
has already made progress toward this goal. Inrecent years, cellulose, fruit, salmon and wine
have emerged as important new export items. Nevertheless, dependence on natural resource
exports such as copper i s still high. In 2003, mining accounted for 7 percent of GDP and 41
percent of export earnings.

For these reasons, the Government of Chile (GoC) seeks -as a matter of highpriority -to create
the conditions for Chile's transition into a knowledge-based economy. This responds to an
international trend where the ability to produce, adapt, diffuse and commercialize knowledge i s
becoming an increasingly important determinant of economic growth and quality of life
improvements. The knowledge economy offers opportunities to the degree that Chile i s able to
buildthe skills andknowledge necessaryto succeedina highly competitive global environment.
Hence, improvingandexpanding access to tertiary education (TE) i s at the core of implementing
the Government's strategy for growth and social mobility.

The Chileantertiaryeducationsystem

The Chilean tertiary education system underwent a comprehensive series of structural and
financial reforms in the early 1980s. The tertiary education system was diversified and stratified
into three tiers: universities, professional institutes (IPS)and technical training centers (CFTs).
The reforms also deregulated the sector, stimulated private provision and introduced fees in
public universities. As a result, government spending on tertiary education has been declining
andChile is today among the countries inLatin America that allocate the least public fundingto
tertiary education relative to GDP.

The reforms of the 1980shad a profound impact on the sector's size, organization, financing and
management. Between 1980 and 2003, the gross tertiary enrollment rate increased from 7.4 to
30.5 percent. The reforms also lead to a proliferation of institutions, from 8 universities to 226
institutions, consisting of 63 universities, 48 IPSand 115 CFTs, many of which are located in
Chile's regions.

In recent years, the overriding policy goals have been to complement further expansion with
improvements to the quality and equity of tertiary education. As a reflection of these priorities,



                                                   1

funding for student financial assistance rose to about a third of public spending on TE in 2003,
national accreditation commissions have set standards and reviewed the quality of programs at
the undergraduate and graduate level and public support for institutional development has been
refocused to target quality improvements through a competitive fund. As a result of these
policies, tertiary enrollment of students in quintile 1 and 2 showed the highest growth of all
income groups between 1990 and 2000. Moreover, 33 percent of all tertiary students now study
in an accredited program and about 17 percent of public funding for tertiary education is
awardedon a competitive basis.

Despite these advances, tertiary institutions in Chile are faced with several challenges. Notably,
the goal of developing Chile into a knowledge-based economy places high demands on the
effectiveness of its tertiary education system. Below the main sector issuesare outlined.

Mainsector issues

Quality of tertiary education varies considerably. Despite the efforts that have gone into quality
assurance and accreditation inrecent years, significant potential remains for improving quality in
Chilean TE. Notably, outdated tertiary curricula and pedagogieshamper a transition to learning-
to-learn methodologies. Another concern is the insufficient qualifications of tertiary teaching
staff. Less than 17 percent of university professors hold a PhD, and only about 24 percent of
lecturers conduct research. Improving the situation by renewing academic personnel i s made
difficult by a legal framework that impedes a rapid turnover of senior staff. Moreover, as
documented by the OECD in its 2004 review of Chile, problems of low quality exist in initial
teacher education. In particular, a low capacity of graduating teachers in subjects such as
language, mathematics and science impedes full implementation of the new curricula in basic
education.

Inadequate responsiveness of tertiary education to student and labor market needs. Chilean TE
does not build on a clear strategy for responding to student needs and meeting industry demand
for highly trained human capital. Learning processes are largely professor driven and students
have few opportunities to practice or complete their thesis work in real-life circumstances.
Notably, a need exists to refocus the curricula by defining competencies to be achieved.
Evidence suggests a current mismatch between the supply of university graduates on one side
andthe demands of the economy and the ambition of developing Chile into a knowledge-based
economy on the other. Some careersturn out large numbers of graduates while others are inshort
supply. For example, the period 2000-2003 saw a sharp decline in the number of students in the
basic sciences.

Bottlenecksfor equitable participation. Inrecent years, the GoC has made considerable advances
in increasing the coverage of student financial assistance. As a result, tertiary enrollment of
students in quintile 1and 2 showed the highest growth of all income groups between 1990 and
2000. Nonetheless, students from quintile 1 and 2 remain underrepresented in TE. Because of
suchinequities Chile loses out on considerable talent. A bill introduced inthe Chilean legislature
would open up student financial assistance to students in private universities and non-university
tertiary education. Its effectiveness will have to be closely monitored. A key additional
bottleneck is the lack of tertiary learning opportunities for inadequately prepared secondary
graduates. Few possibilities exist for students unable to finance quality basic education to
prepare themselves for TE by taking remedial and preparatory courses. This problem i s


                                                 2

aggravatedby a lack of academic credit transfer mechanismsbetween CFTs, IPSanduniversities
hampering progression inthe system and late entry (cf. paragraph on coherence and articulation
above).

Low availability of advanced human capital. Universities are central to national innovation
systems as producers of advanced skills and transmitters of knowledge. Due to the GoC's
priority inrecent years to developing doctoral programs, the annual PhDproduction increased96
percent between 1999 and 2002. However, the number of doctoral graduates remains low
compared to leading economies. In 2003, only 144 PhDs graduated from a Chilean university.
The low supply hindersthe formation of a critical mass of highly skilled scientists in Chile and
impairs the ability of firms to build a capacity to develop and adapt new knowledge and
technologies.

Internal inefliciencies. A degree structure perpetuating long first careers i s a source of
inefficiency in Chilean TE. Programsdetermined to last 5 years show completion times around 6
or 7 years and in engineering, for example, the completion time is 8.5 years. In addition, first
year dropout is a significant problem, in part due to inadequately preparedsecondary graduates
and outdated teaching methodologies. Moreover, duplication and insufficient specialization do
not allow tertiary institutions to achieve economies of scale in tertiary programs. As a
consequence, large differences exist in studenustaff ratios between institutions. In addition, a
significant number of non-university tertiary institutions are short of reaching a critical mass of
students and teaching staff. The largest two CFTs and IPSaccount for as much as 55 and 44
percent of all enrollees intheir sub-sector, respectively.

Lack of coherence and articulation. Tertiary institutions in Chile have unrealized potential for
improving internal cohesion and strengthening ties to other parts of the educational system. The
cooperation between universities and non-university tertiary institutions - CFTs, IPSand
universities - i s weak. Attaining a non-university tertiary degree in Chile is in many cases an
educational "dead-end", leaving few options to build on acquired qualifications. Notably, the
lack of formal equivalencies and a rigid degree structure offer few opportunities to transfer
academic credits from one program to another, let alone between institutions. Students
transferring between institutions rarely receive credits for previously completed coursework, and
often must take supplementarycourses, even if the transfer i s for the same degreeprogram.

Inadequate linkages between universities and innovation. InChile, close to 44 percent of R&D i s
conducted in universities. Yet, tertiary institutions are considered to contribute little to
diversifying Chile's economy and turning science into business. Commonly cited problems
include an inward orientation of university researchers, lack of incentives to commercialize
researchand solve real-lifeproblems as well as redtape impedingpartnerships and cross-sectoral
mobility.

InsufJicient accountability and transparency. 95 percent of direct public funding (AFD) for TE i s
provided based on historical precedence and political negotiation. Full autonomy in traditional
universities' has not been adequately balanced with accountability for results. Consequently, few


 Traditional universities are the 16 public and 9 private universities brought together under the Council of Rectors.
 The universities are: U. de Talca; U. de Chile; P.U. Cat6lica de Chile; U. Cat6lica del Norte; U. Austral; U. de
 Concepci6n; U TBc. Federico Sta. Maria; U. de Tarapacfi; U. Metropolitana; U. Cat6lica de Valparaiso; U. de
 Antofagasta; U. de Magallanes; U. de Santiago; U. de Atacama; U. de Los Lagos; U. de Valparaiso; U. de la

incentives exist for institutions to use their control over the means of education to respond to
national priorities. A move to managefor results and increasetransparencyis made difficult by a
lack of reliable data on the sector. Advances have been made in establishing a labor market
observatory compiling data on the earnings of tertiary graduates. Nonetheless, the Ministry of
Education (MINEDUC) still has a low capacity to collect, process, validate and publish
informationon TE.

Government strategy for tertiary education

The above challenges have shaped the Government's long-term strategy for TE. The agenda set
out by the Lagos Administration is comprehensive and follows closely on those of its
predecessor administrations of the Concertaci6n coalition, providing continuity in the overall
policy framework. This strategy sets the goal that tertiary coverage should increaseto 50 percent
of the 18-24-age group by 2012. Other key priorities are increased equity in TE, the
implementation of stronger accountability mechanisms, and further improvements in the quality
and relevance of university and non-university tertiary education. To these ends, the GoC seeks
to complement advances inbasic education with increasedemphasis on tertiary education andon
ensuring a sustainable balance between public and private sources of financing. New initiatives
underthe Lagos Administration lie inthefollowing areas:
    Piloting of curricula and degree structure reform. Inspiredby the European Bolognaprocess,
    the GoC is using the 2004 round of its competitive fund for TE to pilot curricula
    improvement inorder to (i)     increase curricula flexibility; (ii) learning processes and
                                                                       improve
    pedagogies; (iii)    enhance articulation between short and long cycle programs; and (iv)
    develop academic transfer mechanisms.
    Quality improvement and consolidation of accreditation agency. GoC gives high priority to
    improving the quality of TE. Since 1999 it has maintained two commissions to develop
    quality assurance and accreditation at the undergraduateand graduate level. To sustainthese
    efforts, the Government has introduced a bill in the Chilean legislature that would write
    accreditation into law. If approved, the accreditation agency would be assigned to the
    following functions: (i)accreditation of undergraduate and graduate programs; (ii)
    institutional accreditation; and (iii) licensing of new tertiary institutions.
    Equity. The GoC is increasing access to student financial assistance for talented low-income
    students. Between 2000 and 2003 government support for student aid rose 19 percent in real
    terms. These efforts have been complemented with adjustments in the legal framework
    targeted at improving repayment terms and ensuring a high level of recovery. A new bill is
    currently under review inthe legislature that, if adopted, would expand financial assistance to
    studentsinprivate universities andnon-university tertiary education.
    Advanced human capital. Through MINEDUC and CONICYT, the Government i s taking
    steps to strengthen PhD education by providing scholarships and establishing doctoral
    programs, notably in the hard sciences. The GoC also seeks to strengthen Chile's
    participation in international knowledge networks by supporting the exchange of doctoral
    students anduniversity faculty.

0   Governance and accountability. The GoC has begun discussions with universities on how to
    increase accountability for results. As part of these efforts, it has reassigned key staff in the
    Division for Higher Education (DESUP) to improve the collection of data on the sector.
    Moreover, the Government has appointed a high level ministerial committee for tertiary
    education (CMES) in order to strengthen DESUP's capacity for sector oversight and
    management.

2. Rationale for Bankinvolvement

The World Bank has had a decade long cooperation with Chile in education (see Annex 2). The
proposed project lies in continuation of previous Bank operations in Chile and capitalizes on the
many lessons, which the Bank has accrued over time. In consequence of this long and fruitful
engagement inChile, the Bankhas establisheda valuable network andhas madecontacts with all
major stakeholders in TE. This involvement gives the Bank a unique opportunity to be at the
forefront of developments inChilean TE.

The Higher Education Improvement Project (MECESUP -P055481) has shown the value of the
Bank as a catalyst and broker for key sector reform. In particular, the establishment of a
competitive funding mechanism for quality improvement at the program level based on
transparent selection criteria has been an important innovation in Chilean TE. Having
successfully supported the management for results in selected sub-projects, the Bank is in a key
position to assist in the adoption of a new financing mechanism that moves performance-based
fundingto the institutional level.

The proposed operation would complement the Bank's efforts in the Science for the Knowledge
Economy Project (P077282) to assist Chile in strengthening its national innovation system.
Universities are the mainexecutors of researchandproducers of advancedhuman capital. Hence,
Bank involvement in both tertiary education and the funding of research would facilitate
coordinated efforts to increase the stock of doctoral graduates, strengthen Chile's science base
andenhancepublic-private researchlinkages.

More broadly, the Bank benefits from its extensive international experience intertiary education.
Assisting in advising the GoC, the Bank is therefore able to draw on a vast reservoir of
experience and extensive contacts with researchorganizations.

Finally, Chile provides the opportunity to pilot up-stream instruments in education. As a case of
good practice, experience shows that components developed in Chile can inspire other countries
to take similar steps to improve their TE system. Due to its active portfolio and contacts in the
region, Bank involvement would facilitate the dissemination of lessons learned from such
innovations to other countries inthe region.

3. Higherlevelobjectives to which the project contributes

The project forms part of the GoC's efforts to place Chile in a favorable position to realize the
benefits of the emerging knowledge economy. The goal is that the educational sector will
provide the skills and the knowledge necessary to sustain Chile's economic and social
development and enhance its national innovation capacity. To this end, the proposed project
would, in conjunction with the Science for the Knowledge Economy Project (P077282) and the



                                                 5

Life-long Learning and Training Project (P068271), form a coherent set of policies and
investments inskills and knowledge.

CAS goals supported by the project

The Borrower decided that a tertiary education operation should be included within the existing
Country Assistance Strategy framework and authorized lending envelope (FY2002) and
submitted a letter to the Bank dated March 26, 2004 to that effect. The project would be a
follow-on operation designed to sustain the momentum for reform created by the Higher
Education Improvement Project which closedon June 30,2005.

Although not originally foreseen as a new lendingoperation in the CAS, the proposed project i s
firmly founded on the Bank's three CAS-pillars of intervention in Chile. First the project would
add to the CAS goal of sustainingoverall economic growth and social progress inChile. Second,
the project would contribute to heightening inclusion by improving tertiary learning
opportunities for students from poor and/or indigenous backgrounds. Finally, the project would
support the modernization of the state by (i)  building capacity for strategic policy formulation;
(ii)strengthening sector monitoringand evaluation; and (iii) increasing accountability for the use
of public funding.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The proposed operation i s an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). A long-term, ongoing partnership
i s critical to implementing the GoC's strategy for the tertiary education sector. Notably, the
Government's strategy to increaseaccountability for institutional results by tying a proportionof
public subsidies to performance requires a long-term perspective. The success of this strategy i s
dependent upon developing institutional capacity for results-based management as well as the
designof an appropriate framework for monitoringandrewarding performance. Experience from
similar reforms in the OECD countries shows that the policy and institutional framework
necessary to implement performance-based funding requires time, adjustment and resources.
Therefore, a first step would be to strengtheninstitutionalcapacity for results-basedmanagement
and implement a new funding model in selected institutions (Phase 1of the APL). This would
allow the funding model to be validated and adjusted and subsequently scaled up to cover all
CRUCH universities (Phases 2 of the APL).

2. Programobjective and Phases

Program Objective

The program will support Chile's development into a knowledge-based economy by
strengthening its tertiary education system. It will achieve this objective by revamping the
financing system for tertiary education in order to (i)    enhance the quality and relevance of
tertiary education; (ii) access to tertiary education for all talented individuals; and (iii)
                        ensure
improve internal efficiency and strengthening accountability for results. Beyond the program
(APL), the goal is to support the GoC in completing the transition from the current funding



                                                6

system to a performance-based system applied to an agreed proportion of base funding for
universities.

Programphases

The APL will span 6 years (2005 -2011)with implementation intwo phases.

Phase 1(2005-2008) would (i)        enhancegovernment capacity for sector planningandoversight;
(ii) strengthen policies and strategies for tertiary education; (iii)consolidate the national system
for quality assurance; (iv) improve the national information system for tertiary education; (v)
provide funding for innovative sub-projects; and (vi) pilot institutional performance agreements
with additional money in a small number of state universities gauged to have adequate fiduciary
and informationmanagement systems.

Triggers: The second phase will be initiated under four conditions: (i)      statistical compendium
containing updated data on TE published by MINEDUC; (ii)           at least 2000 students enrolled in
supportedpreparatory programs; (iii) inthe share of students from income quintile 1and
                                        increase
2 in CRUCH universities from 18 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in 2007; and (iv) the first two-
year cycle of performance agreementscompleted inat least4 state universities.

Phase 2 (2009 - 2011) would (i) out performance-basedfunding to all CRUCHuniversities
                                     roll
by tying increases in AFD subsidies to performance agreements; (ii)      maintain support of quality
improvements; and (iii)    use the innovation fund to implement recommendations from the sector
studies, e.g. actions to improve participation of low income and indigenous students in tertiary
education.

3. Project developmentobjectiveand key indicators

The project's development objective i s to increase the efectiveness of publicfunding for tertiary
education by enhancing coherence, responsiveness, equity and quality in the system, through
stronger accountability for pe$omzance.

Indicators that would measure progress toward the development objective include: (i)        surveyed
perception among employers on the quality of tertiary graduates; (ii)           number of graduate
students from CFTs and IPStransferring to universities; (iii)       socioeconomic profile of tertiary
first year students; (iv) first year drop-out rate by institutions; and (v) percent of public funding
for tertiary education allocated on a performance or competitive basis.

4. Project components

The project will have two maincomponents: (i)      strengthening institutionalframework for tertiary
education and(ii)  sub-projectsto enhancecoherence, efficiency, equity and quality.

Project Component 1 US$8.00 million
                         -
Strengthening of the institutional framework for tertiary education
This component is designedto strengthenthe capacity of the Ministry of Education and relevant
agencies to develop policies and strategies, and management skills, to achieve the Program
Objective. The componenthas five sub-components:



                                                   7

        0   Improvementof sector oversight and regulation-US$ 1.OO million
        0   Strengthening of policies and strategiesfor tertiary education - US$ 1.50 million
        0   Consolidation of national systemfor quality assurance-US$2.50
        0   Establishment of a national observatory for tertiary education - US$ 1.50 million
        0   Project management - US$ 1.50million
Sub-component1.1-Improvement of sector oversight and regulation
This sub-component would strengthencapacity inthe Ministry of Education for sector oversight
and management. The sub-component would support the establishment of adequate structures in
the Ministry for the administration of a new law on student financial assistance. Further, it would
finance the setup of a small unit responsible for providing support to the director of DESUP in
regard to the design, negotiation and supervision of performance agreements (sub-component
2.2). Finally, the sub-component would support the necessary capacity that provide the director
of DESUP advice on (i)      the framework for Chilean tertiary education; (ii)   priorities for the
innovation fund (subcomponent 2.1); and (iii)  performance agreementdesign and negotiation.

Sub-component 1.2 - Strengthening of policies and strategiesfor tertiary education
This sub-component would finance studies of priority issues for post-secondary and university
education identifiedby the director of DESUP such as (i)    sufficiency andtargeting of the student
financial aid system for tertiary students; (ii)structure and efficiency of the tertiary education
system; (iii)  academic degree structure and curricular innovation; (iv) transfer of academic
credits; and (v) studies inthe Indigenous PeoplesDevelopment Plan (annex 10).

Sub-component1.3- Consolidation of national systemfor quality assurance
This sub-component would consolidate institutional and program accreditation in Chile by
supporting the operation of the accreditation commissions for undergraduate and graduate
tertiary education (CNAP and CONAP). In the event that accreditation i s written into national
law, the sub-component would finance costs in the form of goods, consultant's services and
operational expenditure linkedto the establishment of an independent national accreditation and
quality assurance agency.

Sub-component 1.4-Strengthening of a national observatoryfor tertiary education
This sub-component would support the strengthening of the national observatory for tertiary
education in MINEDUC to improve data collection and validation essential for effective
planning and management of the tertiary education system. The data should be relevant for (i)
sector oversight; (ii) assurance processes; (iii)
                      quality                          allocation of funding basedon institutional
performance; and(iv) university managementand planning. Indicators would cover such areas as
equity, efficiency and quality. The observatory would support existing reporting structures such
as the Labor Market Observatory for tertiary education and use OECD manuals, or other
recognized, definitions for tertiary education indicators as a reference point to ensure
international comparability.

Sub-component1.5-Project management
This sub-component would support the operation of the project implementation team, which
would be a discrete unit responsible to the director of DESUP. The unit would have a General
Coordinator and three deputy coordinators who would have the necessary experience and
expertiseto direct the activities of component 1and the two sub-componentsof component 2.

Project Component 2 -US$83.25 million

Sub-projects to enhance coherence, efficiency, equity and quality
This component would support a strategically targetedfund aimed at stimulating innovation and
institutional performance and increasing accountability for results. The component has two sub-
components:
         0  Innovative sub-projects for tertiary programs -US$69.75 million
         0   Sub-projects   to   stimulate    institutional effectiveness in critical       areas -
            US$ 13.50 million

Sub-component2 , l - Innovative sub-projectsfor tertiaryprograms
This sub-component would be used to stimulate innovation and strengthen tertiary programs in
regard to coherence, responsiveness, equity and quality. Proposals for innovative sub-projects
would be evaluated by peers based on transparent eligibility and selection criteria, resulting in
the successful proposals being those that best meet the specific objectives of the selection round
and have appropriate institutional support. The fundwould provide support through three lines:

(i) Technical training at the tertiary level. This line would support quality improvement activities
in tertiary institutions enrolling low-income students and offering technical training in fields of
highdemand from the productive sector.

(ii)Undergraduate university education. The objective of this line is to support innovations and
quality improvements in undergraduate university education and university teacher training
programs. The priority areas determined for each selection round on the advice of the Ministerial
Committee would include: curricula innovation; credit transfer, articulation and networks;
transition programs for inadequately prepared secondary school graduates; piloting of
preparatory courses for indigenous students (see Annex 10); capacity buildingfor results-based
management; and strengtheningof pedagogical programs.

(iii) Graduate university education. This line would support graduate education in order to
increase the stock of highly skilled research personnel in Chile and to strengthen the national
innovation system by enhancing university-industry linkages. In doing so, this line would
reinforce and complement actions under the Chile: Science for the Knowledge Economy
Projects. Preference would be given to creating and strengthening PhD graduate programs in
fields relevant to enhancing the contribution of Science and Technology to Chile's economic
development and to expanding the stock of research personnel in Chilean industry. Moreover,
this line would support the trainingof academic staff at the PhDlevel - inaccreditedprograms in
Chile or abroad- basedon institutional proposals.

Sub-component2.2 -Sub-projects to stimulate institutional effectiveness in critical areas
This sub-component would increase accountability for the use of public subsidies through
institutional performance agreements. In doing so, the sub-component would contribute to the
Development Objective by providing an incentive for institutionsto implement plans of action in
areas of highnational priority.

Performance agreements would build on the following arrangements: (i)             institutions would
receive government support for an action planwith clearly defined indicators and targets; (ii)   the
size of government support under each performance contract would be adjusted based on

performance; and (iii) focus would be on long term capacity building with the use of local
                        the
proceduresfor fiduciary managementand M&E.

In the first phase, performance agreements would be piloted in a small number of state
universities currently receiving AFD subsidies from the Govemment. Institutions would be
selected to reflect different levels of academic complexity in order to test the instrument in as
different circumstances as possible. A second roster of institutions could be added in the first
phasebasedon advances ininstitutional accreditation and strategic planning.

Each agreement would be negotiated between the institution and the Ministry of Education. The
negotiations would take place within a framework covering such items as the institution's
strategic plan; results from the institutional accreditation processes; the institution's
achievements in tertiary education provision; governance; management; and finances. As an
input to negotiation, the institution would provide a detailed proposal covering outputs and
outcomes to be achieved in the period covered in the agreement and how these could be
measured.

The agreements would be multi-year and contain (i)    funding commitments for the first year by
costing proposed activities and objectives; (ii)funding projections for subsequent years of the
agreement; (iii)agreed targets; and (iv) indicators to monitor progress. Based on reviews
compiling quantitative and qualitative evidence, Govemment financing would be adjusted in a
transparent manner according to the performance of each institutionmeasuredagainst the targets
reflected inthe agreement (see Annex 4 for more detail).

5. Lessonslearned and reflectedinthe project design

The Bank has a long history of support to the education sector inChile from which many lessons
have been learned. Notably, the proposed project builds on lessons learned in the MECESUP
project. This project has been thoroughly evaluated through an independent extemal impact
study. Furthermore, the OECD 2004 educational review of Chile, which includes a section on
tertiary education, provides a solid foundation for the proposed project. Finally, a background
study was preparedfor the project. This study overviews approachesto results-basedfunding and
compiles lessons learned from implementation in a number of OECD countries (see Annex 15).
Lessons learnedreflected inthe project's design include:

0   Dual support for capacity building at the level of the Ministry and the establishment of an
    innovation fund for tertiary programs proved an effective combination in the MECESUP
    project. The Ministry enhanced its capacity to formulate policy and the MECESUP
    competitive fund enabled it to stimulate implementation. This project would do the same by
    continuing to strengthen the Ministry and maintaining funding that can drive strategy
    implementation and provide an incentive for institutions to respond to sector priorities (sub-
    components 1.1 and 1.2 and component 2).

0   Evidence from the OECD countries shows that results-basedfunding places high demand on
    the capacity of supervisory authorities to engage in an evidence-based dialogue with
    institutions. Without a strong counterpart, information asymmetries may lead to under-
    performance. This lesson is incorporated in the project's design through capacity buildingin
    MINEDUC, including the establishment of a high-level ministerial committee for tertiary



                                               10

    education and support for a national observatory for tertiary education (sub-components 1.1
    and 1.3).
    A key lesson learned in reforming Chilean primary and secondary education is the need to
    link initial teacher education to the new curricula. Despite deep reforms, Chilean pupils
    continue to perform below expectations in international studies of the EA, TIMSS and
    PISA. A government initiative, begun in 1997, to strengthen programs of initial teacher
    education (FFID) was successful inlaunching a process of improvement in Chilean faculties
    of education. However, the program did not adequately address the problems of subject
   content knowledge for teachers and new teachers' pedagogical skills. Buildingon the FFID
    initiative, the proposed project would therefore include investments in pre-service teacher
    education under the innovation fund for tertiary education (sub-component 2.1).
    The MECESUP competitive fund made a cultural change in the sector by supporting quality
    improvement at the program level and providing an incentive for university staff to identify
   new solutions. Nonetheless, the impact on overall institutional practices and management
    was less pronounced. The proposed project would add performance agreements targeted at
    the institutional level. This builds on international experiences showing that institutional
   performance agreements: (i)    encourage dialogue between government and university leaders
    on national priorities and institutional goals; (ii)combine autonomy with added
    accountability for results; and (iii)
                                       stimulate institutional strategic planningand improvement
    processes.
    The MECESUPproject demonstratesthe value of establishing a flexible funding mechanism
    with transparent procedures as opposed to designating resources to narrowly defined
   purposes. Each round of the MECESUP competitive fund was designed to respond to
    specific sector development needs and saw a significant reorientation from investments in
    teaching facilities to improvement of curricula and learning processes. The proposed
   innovation fund and performance agreements would offer the same flexibility whilst laying
    down in detail the transparency of the procedures and the expected end results (component
    2).

    Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

The following alternatives were considered:

Investment in a student loan scheme that would improve access of low-income and indigenous
students to tertiary education. This alternative was rejected due to considerable government
commitment in this area and assessed low value added of Bank financing. Between 1997 and
2003 public support for student financial assistance increased 87 percent in real terms to 31
percent of public spending on tertiary education. Among the new initiatives is a scholarship
program for low-income students studying in technical training centers. A proposed law would
open financial assistance to students attending all accredited tertiary institutions. Furthermore,
the Government operates a scholarship program targeting indigenous students (see Annex 10).
Rather than investing directly, the project would support studies of student financial assistance
that would enable the GoC to better target its actions inthis area (sub-component 1.2).




                                                11

Focus the project exclusively on improving non-university tertiary education. This alternative
was rejected due to (i)    the program's focus on articulation between short- and long terms
programs; (ii)  the priority given by the GoC to strengthening university, including graduate
education; and (iii)the needfor abroadreformof the financing of traditional universities.

Up-front reform of the legal framework for the jinancing of traditional universities. This
alternative was rejected since changes to the funding of the traditional universities would likely
meet strong resistance from political groups, university leaders and students. As a result, the
GoC has a pragmatic approach to this issue, working within the present legal framework, and
buildingthe case for legislative action slowly andon the basis of results rather than more radical
immediate reforms.

Include private non-traditional universities as recipients of direct public support (AFD). The
alternative was rejected due to (i)   its fiscal implications; (ii) risk of spreading Government
                                                                 the
fundingtoo thin; and (iii)  resistancefrom key stakeholders. Rather, the proposed sub-component
1.2 would focus on improving the policy framework for private non-traditional universities.
Moreover, private non-traditional universities would have access to competitive funding for
pedagogical and graduate study programs (sub-component 2.1). Finally, private non-traditional
universities would receive public funding indirectly through AFI and student financial assistance
programs.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

NIA

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

Implementation of the project in general will be carried out at the system level. Component 2
will be implemented at boththe systemandthe institutionallevel.

At the system level, the project will be implemented usingthe existing structures of the Higher
Education Division (DESUP) and the MECESUP project department (PD). The latter has been
incorporated as a department-like organization within DESUP. The PD would be responsible for
carrying out procurement and disbursement activities at the central level, as well as for
monitoring and supervising procurement and disbursement at the level of the institutions and
individual study programs. The PD has the experience and capacity from the MECESUP project
to manage a large project, implement Bank fiduciary procedures, monitor implementation and
provide technical assistanceto beneficiaries.

At the institutional level, institutions would use their Institutional Coordination Units (ICU) to
oversee project activities. Each ICU will have an "upstream" and a "downstream" function: the
upstream tasks would consist of helping the institution prepare performance agreements and
proposals for the innovation fund; the "downstream" tasks would focus on implementation, e.g.
M&E, fiduciary management and internal arrangements for achieving the performance
agreement.




                                                   12

Project coordination

The PD would have a full-time general coordinator who reports to the director of DESUP. The
team would be organized in sub-teams, one per component. Each of the sub-teams would have
its own coordinator. The general coordinator and the component coordinators would constitute
the Coordination Committee for the project. This Coordination Committee would also include
the director of DESUP. Personnelresponsiblefor financial management, procurement and M&E
would closely coordinate their work and integrate project information systems.

Reporting

The PD will prepare an annual report at the end of every Government fiscal year summarizing
the status of implementation and updating indicators. Inaddition, the PD will report on progress
towards achieving the triggers.

Financialmanagement

The PD would provide administrative and financial management support to the project and
would be responsible for all payments directly to providers, contractors and consultants for
Component 1. For Component 2, support will be given to academic institutions based on
biannual financial planning. Academic institutions will be responsible for contracting andpaying
directly to contractors and consultants hiredby them. The PD will have the mainfunction in this
case of (i) consolidating financial management information; (ii)  supervising the use of project
resourcesaccording to the project's objectives; and (iii)
                                                        carrying out financial planning.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results

The project's monitoring and evaluating (M&E) module i s designed to (i)    monitor the project's
progress towards its Development Objective; (ii)     provide information on needed corrective
action during implementation; and (iii)    collect lessons learned on the effectiveness of the
proposed project components. The M&E module builds on activities under sub-component 1.3
aimed at strengthening MINEDUC's capacity for sector oversight and management through the
establishmentof a national observatory for tertiary education.

The M&E module includes 20 quantitative outcomes, output and process indicators selected
based on a causality tree approach (annex 3). To get a more complete assessment, two baseline
surveys will be conducted: one on the perception among business leaders on the quality of
tertiary graduates and another on the perception among university leaders of DESUP policy
instruments.

Inaddition to ongoing M&Eactivities, the project would preparefor an impactevaluation of the
innovation fund to be carried out at the end of the second phase. This evaluation would measure
impact by applying rigorous evaluation methodologies and take into account lessons learned in
the external evaluation of the MECESUP competitive fund. Activities in the first phase would
include the establishmentof adequate control groups andbaselinesfor supported sub-projects.

4. Sustainability

Financial sustainability. Chile is a country with a sustained record of growth and sound fiscal
management. Since the early 1990s much of the growth inpublic expenditure has been assigned
to improvements in education. However, this has not translated into a high level of public
support for tertiary education due to the considerable reliance on demand side financing.
Currently, public funding for tertiary education comprises 0.6 percent of GDP and traditional
universities receive only about 20 percent of their revenuefrom direct public subsidies. Thus, the
prospectsfor being able to maintain levels of funding - including potentially increasedrecurrent
costs -are considered high.

Institutional sustuinability. It is critical that a revised regulatory framework be established with
common consent and the end of the program's second phase, to codify and institutionalize the
changes that would be introduced to the funding system. This would ensure sustainability from
an institutional perspective neededto preserve a closer link between funding and performance in
Chileantertiary education.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

The economic and financial analysis shows that the project would have a net present value if it
succeeds to induce marginal gains in the internal and/or external efficiency of traditional
universities. To be profitable, it would suffice for the project to increase the average wage of
university graduates by one percent, increase the graduation rate by one percentage point or


                                                15

reduce the average completion time by a little more than one month. A likely scenario i s that the
project would help universities improve on all these dimensions, which would make the value-
added of the project considerably higher than the net present value of the investment.

2. Technical

The proposed project draws in its design on lessons learned from the MECESUP project.
Notably, the proposed innovation fund builds on experiences gained in external assessments of
the competitive fund. Performance agreements are designed to address an identified need for
strengtheningaccountability for results at the institutional level andthe proposedinnovation fund
would sustain momentum for quality improvement and innovation in tertiary programs. The
introduction of institutional results-basedfunding in Chile i s informedby extensive international
experience and research on the issue (see Annex 15). Among other things, the project's design
reflects lessons learned from implementation of university performance agreements in the
Canadianprovince of Quebec, discussedduringa visit to Canadaby the GoC's preparation team
inNovember 2004.

3. Fiduciary

The overall conclusion of the fiduciary team is that the project would be able to maintain
financial management and procurement arrangements compatible with Bank requirements. No
major risks have been identifiedbut specific recommendations were made during preparation in
regard to the strengthening of key personnel, improvement of existing information systems and
the mainstreaming of project management to the DESUP in order to strengthen the Ministry's
fiduciary capacity.

4. Social

Despite the great strides that Chile has made in reducing poverty and reforming the education
structure, it remains a country marked by high levels of inequality both in terms of income
distribution and educational achievement. Although significant improvement can be observed
between 1990 and 2000, students from vulnerable groups, including the poor, rural and
indigenous remain underrepresentedin TE. This under-representation can be largely explained
by two factors; (a) lack of academic preparation at the secondary level due to poor schools in
poor rural areas, and (b) lack of financial means to continue education.

PresidentLagos' administration has stateda goal to increaseTE coverage to 50 percent of all 18-
24 year olds by 2012, as expressedinthe New DealPolicy with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean
Society. The CAS also includes a goal to heighten inclusion by improving TE opportunities for
poor and/or indigenous students. This project aims to achieve these goals by (i) financing studies
on how to improve financial aid mechanisms and (ii)       supporting innovative projects to assist
vulnerable students improve their academic preparedness for entry into, and success at, TE
institutions.

5. Environment

This project is classified as Category C for purposes of environmental assessment. The project
would not support any major works. Inregard to university research, Chileanregulations for bio-

safety, use of laboratory animals, hazardous laboratory material, and other necessary safeguard
regulations were assessed andfound adequate inthe Chile: Sciencefor the Knowledge Economy
Project approved b y the Board in May 2003. To ensure that no environment problems arise, all
aspects of project implementation will be carefully monitored through regular supervision
missions.

6. Safeguard policies

The project would increase the quality of tertiary education in under-representedregions and
seek ways to improve access to university education for inadequately prepared secondary
graduates and students innon-university tertiary institutions. Specifically, an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan (IPDP) has beenpreparedto ensure that indigenous and poor students benefit
from the project. This IPDP is intended to address issues hinderingthese students access to TE,
as identifiedthrough a study and consultation carried out during project preparation. The IPDP
contains three main actions: (i) design of targeting mechanisms to identify and promote
                                          the
indigenous student participation inTE; (ii)            incentives for universities in selected areas to provide
remedial learning opportunities for indigenous students; and (iii)                    studies on ways to strengthen
indigenous scholarshipsfor talentedindividuals.

                CHILE: Chile- Tertiary EducationFinancefor Results Project

Chile is rapidly moving to a mass tertiary education system. Over the past decade enrollment in
Chilean higher education expanded significantly from about 250,000 students in 1990 to more
than 500,000 in 2003. Nearly all of the expansion was financed by private sources, reflecting a
policy of cost-recovery and growth in private provision of tertiary education. Today, Chile i s
among the countries in Latin America that allocate the least public funding to higher education
relative to GDP. Yet, due to sizable private spending, Chile features the highest share of GDP
allocatedto higher educationinthe region.

Significant private contributions to the financing of tertiary education provide an opportunity for
the Chilean government to strategically reorient resources to core public sector responsibilities.
B y prioritizing public resources and focusing on value for money, Chile may address pressing
sector issues such as inequities, insufficient supply of doctoral graduates and lack of coherence
and flexibility between tertiary learning settings.

The Government of Chile has already begun a process of reprioritizing public resources by
significantly scaling up support for student loan programs. Inaddition, about 7 percent of public
financing for tertiary education is tied to a best-studentformula and 5 percent of the base funding
for the 25 traditional universities is allocated according to performance criteria. Nonetheless,
unrealized potential remains for tying funding to desired educational outcomes. Almost half of
all public subsidies for tertiary education are allocated based on historical precedence and there
i s no system for collecting reliable, standardized information on the performance of tertiary
institutions.

Chilean public financing system of tertiary education
The Chilean tertiary education system was changed profoundly during the 1980s following the
most radical reforms to university education ever attempted in the region. The reforms aimed at
improvingefficiency by deregulating the sector and stimulating private provision. Moreover, the
reforms sought to alleviate the finance burden of the state by charging tuition to students and
encouraging higher education institutions to diversify their funding sources. As a result, Chile
today features one of the strongestmarkets for tertiary education inthe region.

The Chilean tertiary education system i s comprised by three types of institutions: Universities
offer undergraduate first-degree and postgraduate programs. They are the only institutions
authorized to award bachelor, master and doctoral academic degrees in Chile. Moreover,
universities are the only institutions authorized to award professional certificates in 17
professional fields (engineering, medicine, law, psychology, architecture, etc.). Professional
institutes (IP) deliver four-year programs and are authorized to award professional certificates in
any field, excluding the 17 fields that are the prerogative of universities. Technical Training
Centers (CTF) offer two-year technical vocational programs which lead to a Higher Technical
Level Certificate.

Tertiary institutions are subjectedto a statuary regime according to which they are located in one
out of four categories, full autonomy, accredited, examined and supervised. Institutions with full
autonomy have substantial freedom to plan and organize programs, designate personnel and
administer the budget. The 25 traditional council of rectors universities were declared
autonomous by definition. Chile has been a regional forerunner in quality assurance of tertiary
education institutions and their course programs. Since 1999, provisionary national accreditation
commissions have set standards and granted formal recognition to programs at the graduate and
undergraduate level basedon self-assessmentsandexternal peer-review processes.

To administer admissions, traditional universities operate university admission exams (PSU)
comprising skills centered tests in math and language and more specific knowledge centered
tests on various subjects. The PSU i s designed and scored in accordance with international
assessment standards. Access to traditional universities is highly competitive, with a few
institutions concentrating most of the applicants.

Levels andmechanismsoffunding
Chile allocates a total of 2.2 percent of GDP to tertiary education, which i s the highest
percentage in the Latin American region. Due to the aforementioned policy of cost-recovery,
most resources come from private sources. This reflects high private rates of return for tertiary
graduatesinthe labor market and apolitical decision to target public resources to basic education
and other social priorities.

Public sector funding of tertiary education comprises only 0.6 percent of GDP. This translates
into one of the lowest levels of public support per tertiary student in Latin America. Moreover,
spending on tertiary education is well balanced against the primary and secondary level. Primary
education is currently averaging about 64 percent of annual funds allocated to education,
secondary 20 percent andhigher education only 16percent (MINEDUC2004).

Decreto Fuerza de Ley no. 4 from 1981regulatespublic financing of Chilean tertiary education.
Funding is allocated through four mechanisms: (i)                    direct public support (AFD) to the 25
traditional public and private universities; (ii)              indirect public support (AFI) of public and
private institutions linked to a best-studentformula; (iii)             fundingfor institutionaldevelopment
and quality improvement; and (iv) student financial assistance in the form of scholarships
anda loan systemfor students enrolled in traditional universities based on an income contingent
repaymentscheme2.

Graph 1shows the evolution and composition of public expenditures intertiary education. Public
expenditures for tertiary education more than doubled in real terms between 1980 and 2003.

 A project law is currently under review inthe Chilean legislature, which would open up financial assistanceto
 students attending other tertiary institutions than the traditional 25 universities.


                                                            19

Notably, public subsidies for student financial support, direct public support (AFD) and funds for
institutional quality improvement projects increased (MECESUP). Meanwhile, indirect public
support (AFI) has remained stable. In 1990, AFI represented 18 percent of total public
expenditures on tertiary education; in2003, it was reducedto 7 percent.

Directpublicsupport
One of the most contentious issues regarding tertiary education in Chile is the direct financial
support given to the 16 public and 9 private universities that existed before tertiary education
was reformed in the early 1980s. AFD comprises about 50 percent of total public spending on
tertiary education.

95 percent of AFD i s allocated to universities based on historical precedence and a process of
political negotiation without systematic reference to obtained results. This allocation process
maintains a highly uneven distribution of AFD funds between traditional institutions. Per student
AFD funds vary from more than 1,400 USDper student for the University of Talca to about 150
USDper student for the Catholic Universityof Temuco.

Five percent of AFD is allocated to universities based on input, process and output criteria.
These funds are allocated according to the relative scoring of each university on five weighted
indicators: (i) critical mass obtained in each career measured by the number of undergraduate
enrollees per program; (ii)     internal efficiency measured by student-teacher ratios; (iii)           quality
measuredby the number of faculty holdingadvanceddegrees; (iv) scientific quality measuredby
the number of research projects per full time equivalent scholar; and (v) scientific Production
measuredby the number of publications per researcher. High weights are placed on quality and
scientific activities (84 percent) and low weights are given to efficiency and, particularly,
enrollees per program.

Performance funding does not mirror the distribution of AFD. Institutions that receive the least
funding per student are all well above the default five percent results-basedfunding. Inabsolute
terms University of Arturo Prat and Austral University, for example, obtained almost the same



                                                      20

amount of performance funding in 2003, while total AFD funding per student was almost three
times higher at the AustralUniversity.

Results-basedfunding provides AFD universities an incentive to perform, especially inregard to
the quality of staff and scientific activity. However, due to its structure and size, the mechanism
has had limited impact in the sector. Moreover, problems havebeen encounteredinthe operation
of the mechanism, which reduce its positive implications on transparency in the Chilean
university system. Notably, the lack of a national information system with reliable, standardized
statistics and unambiguous baselineshas given way to errors andinconsistencies inthe reporting
from universities.

Indirectpublic support
All institutions offering tertiary learning opportunities in Chile are eligible for indirect public
support. The AFI is distributed to institutions according to their ability to attract the 27,500
highestscoring studentsinthe university admissionexam (PSU). In2003, the distributionof AFI
between institutions was: 82 percent for the 25 traditional universities, 17 percent for private
universities and 1percent for IPSand CFTs.

Indirect public funding has been successful inproviding tertiary institutions - public and private
- a strong incentive to respond to student needs and provide learning opportunities of high
quality and relevance. As such, the AFI has been an important example of performance funding
in Chilean tertiary education. Nonetheless, potential exists for improving the mechanism,
particularly inregardto equity. PSUachievement- and hence AFI allocations -i s closely linked
to the ability to pay for quality basic education (Bernasconi and Rojas 2004). An alternative
approach to AFI would be to tie the capitation grant to the best students from the lowest three
income quintiles.

Fundsfor institutional development
In 1998 a decision was taken to gradually phase out the InstitutionalDevelopment Funddue to
criticism that political criteria dominated the allocation of funds. These shortcomings were
challenged by the creation of a competitive fund for quality improvement (MECESUP) under
which alltertiary institutions are eligible for support.

Designed to accelerate processes of institutional modernization, the MECESUP fund supports
projects developed and proposed by tertiary institutions. Committees of peers review and select
proposals according to transparent procedures and criteria. Thus far, supported areas include: (i)
technical training programs; (ii)   undergraduate programs in the hard sciences; (iii)      graduate
programs inall areas; and(iv) curricula redesign (World Bank 1998).

Issues to be addressed inthe APL
Given the lack of accountability for the results achieved with public subsidies, the proposed
program would seek to revamp the financing system. It would achieve this goal by gradually
phasing in and scaling up the use of performance agreements. B y the end of the program a
significant proportion of public funding for traditional universities would be allocated on a
performance basis. Incentive funding under the program would also have provided for increased
educational quality, improved internal and external efficiency and enhanced access to tertiary
education for poor andindigenous students.

Phase I (2005-2008)would (i)        enhancegovernment capacity for sector planning and oversight;
(ii)strengthen policies and strategies for tertiary education; (iii)
                                                                   consolidate the national system
for quality assurance; (iv) improve the national information system for tertiary education; (v)
provide funding for innovative sub-projects; and (vi) pilot institutional performance agreements
with additional money in a small number of state universities gauged to have adequate fiduciary
and informationmanagementsystems.
Phase 2 (2009- 2011) would (i) out performance-basedfunding to all CRUCH universities
                                    roll
by tying increases in AFD subsidies to performance agreements; (ii)     maintain support of quality
improvements; and (iii)   use the innovation fund to implement recommendations from the sector
studies, e.g. actions to improve participation of low income and indigenous students in tertiary
education.

Arrangements for results monitoring
This annex outlines the monitoring and evaluating (M&E) module for the Chile: Tertiary
Education Finance for Results Project. This objective i s to (i)   monitor the project's progress
towards its Development Objective; (ii)  provide information on needed corrective action during
implementation; and (iii) lessons learned on the effectiveness of the proposed project
                            collect
components.

The M&Emodule will buildon activities undersub-component 1.3, which seek to strengthenthe
Ministry's capacity for sector oversight and management through the establishment of a national
observatory for tertiary education. In addition, component 2 would support institutions in
establishing internal information systems. Hence, the project - by design - provides a strong
basis for accessingupdated, reliable information on the sector.

Duringpreparationacausality tree approachwas introduced inorder to:
    0  Establish a coherent theory of change for the project by articulating the intermediate
       mechanisms and results through which inputs and activities are expected to contribute to
       desired outcomes
    0  Make relationships between sub-components and higher order objectives explicit so they
       can be monitored, validated and managed
    0  Provide a framework for selecting indicators at the sub-component, component and sector
       level

20 quantitative indicators were selectedbasedon the framework provided by the causality tree.
Emphasis was given to creating clear, balanced, relevant and measurable indicators. To the
extent possible, indicators were designed to build on existing reporting structures in order to
ensure a flow of information from the early phases of the project.

To get a more complete impact assessment, two baseline surveys will be conducted: one on the
perception among business leaders on the quality of tertiary graduates and another on the
perception among university leaders of DESUPpolicy instruments. The surveys will be repeated
at the end of the first phase. For both surveys, the use of recognized sampling techniques will
ensure collection of a representative sample, which in turn will allow general conclusions to be
drawn.

Inaddition to ongoing M&Eactivities, the project would prepare for an impact evaluation of the
innovation fund to be carried out at the end of the secondphase. This evaluation would measure
impact by applying rigorous evaluation methodologies and take into account lessons learned in
the external evaluation of the MECESUP competitive fund. Activities in the first phase would
include the establishmentof adequatecontrol groups andbaselinesfor supported sub-projects.

The causality tree below provides an overview of actions, results and objectives. Each arrow
represents an alleged causalrelationship. For reasons of simplicity, the illustration predominantly
depicts direct relationships and hence does not give full justice to how outcomes are interrelated
andmutual supportive.

                CHILE: Chile- Tertiary EducationFinancefor ResultsProject

The project will have two main components: (i)    strengtheningof the institutional framework for
tertiary education and (ii)sub-projectsto enhance coherence, efficiency, equity and quality.

Project Component 1 US$ 8.00 million
                         -
Strengthening of the institutional framework for tertiary education
This component is designedto strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education and relevant
agencies to develop policies and strategies, and management skills, to achieve the Program
Objective. The component has five sub-components:

        0   Improvement of sector oversight andregulation -US$ 1.00million
        0   Strengthening of policies and strategiesfor tertiary education - US$ 1S O million
        0   Consolidation of national systemfor quality assurance-US$2.50
        0   Establishment of a national observatory for tertiary education - US$ 1.50 million
        0   Project management- US$ 1.50 million

Sub-component1.1-Improvement of sector oversight and regulation
This sub-component would strengthen capacity inthe Ministry of Education for sector oversight
and management. The sub-component would support the establishment of adequate structures in
the Ministry for the administration of a new law on student financial assistance. Further, it would
finance the setup of a small unit responsible for providing support to the director of DESUP in
regard to the design, negotiation and supervision of performance agreements (sub-component
2.2). Finally, the sub-component would support the necessary capacity that provide the director
of DESUP advice on (i)      the framework for Chilean tertiary education; (ii)    priorities for the
innovation fund (subcomponent 2.1); and (iii)  performance agreement design andnegotiation.

Sub-component1.2-Strengthening of policies and strategiesfor tertiary education
This sub-component would finance studies of priority issues for post-secondary and university
education identified by the director of DESUPsuch as (i)    sufficiency and targeting of the student
financial aid system for tertiary students; (ii)structure and efficiency of the tertiary education
system; (iii) academic degree structure and curricular innovation; (iv) transfer of academic
credits; and (v) studies inthe Indigenous PeoplesDevelopment Plan(annex 10).

Sub-component1.3- Consolidation of national systemfor quality assurance
This sub-component would consolidate institutional and program accreditation in Chile by
supporting the operation of the accreditation commissions for undergraduate and graduate
tertiary education (CNAP and CONAP). In the event that accreditation i s written into national
law, the sub-component would finance costs in the form of goods, consultant's services and
operational expenditure tied to the establishment of an independent national accreditation and
quality assurance agency.

Sub-component 1.4-Strengthening of a national observatoryfor tertiary education
This sub-component would fund the strengthening of the national observatory for tertiary
education inMINEDUC and provide training to key personnel inthe Ministry.Support would be
given to creating a system that would allow data to be collected and updated in a timely and



                                                33

efficient manner. The system would be operated and maintainedby DESUP in the Ministry of
Education.

DESUP would, in close consultation with key stakeholders, be responsible for establishing
standardized national input, process, output and outcome indicators for tertiary education.
Indicators would cover such areas as equity, efficiency and quality and should be relevant for (i)
sector oversight; (ii) assurance processes; (iii)
                         quality                              allocation of fundingbasedon institutional
performance; and (iv) university management and planning. The observatory would support
existing reporting structures such as the Labor MarketObservatory for tertiary education and use
OECD manuals, or other recognized, definitions for tertiary education indicators as a reference
point to ensure international comparability. Software supporting the information system should
be basedon open standardsinorder to facilitate exchange of data between systems.

On an annual basis MNEDUC would publish a statistical compendium containing updated data
on tertiary education. The compendium would contain national trends and averages as well as
institutional data. All data would be made available on the Internet.

Sub-component 1.5-Project management
This sub-component would support the operation of the project implementation team, which
would be a discrete unit responsible to the director of DESUP. The unit would have a General
Coordinator and three deputy coordinators who would have the necessary experience and
expertiseto direct the activities of component 1andthe two sub-componentsof component 2.

Project Component 2 US$83.25 million
                           -
Sub-projectsto enhance coherence, efficiency, equity and quality
This component would support a strategically targetedfund aimed at stimulating innovation and
institutional performance and increasing accountability for results. The component has two sub-
components:

            Innovative sub-projects for tertiary programs -US$69.75 million
             Sub-projects to        stimulate    institutional     effectiveness     in critical areas-
            US$ 13.50 million

Sub-component2.1 -Innovative sub-projectsfor tertiary programs
This sub-component would be used to stimulate innovation and strengthen tertiary programs in
regard to coherence, responsiveness, equity and quality. Proposals for innovative sub-projects
would be evaluated by peers based on transparent eligibility and selection criteria, resulting in
the successful proposals being those that best meet the specific objectives of the selection round
and have appropriate institutional support. The fund would provide support through three lines:

(i)Technical training at the tertiary level. This line would support quality improvement activities
in tertiary institutions enrolling low-income students and offering technical training in fields of
highdemandfrom the productive sector. All licensed3autonomous institutions would be eligible
for support under this line.

(ii)Undergraduate university education. The objective of this line is to support innovations and
quality improvements in undergraduate university education and university teacher training

 Inthis context "licensed" meanslicensed or inthe process of obtaining their autonomy.


                                                      34

programs. The priority areas determined for each selection roundon the advice of the Ministerial
Committee would include: curricula innovation; credit transfer, articulation and networks;
transition programs for inadequately prepared secondary school graduates; piloting of
preparatory courses for indigenous students (see Annex 10); capacity buildingfor results-based
management; and strengthening of pedagogicalprograms. Undergraduate rograms intraditional
universities would be eligible for support under this line. All accredited institutions would be
                                                                                  B
eligible for support inregardto the strengtheningof pedagogical programs.

(iii) Graduate university education. This line would support graduate education in order to
increase the stock of highly skilled research personnel in Chile and to strengthen the national
innovation system by enhancing university-industry linkages. In doing so, this line would
reinforce and complement actions under the Chile: Science for the Knowledge Economy
Projects. Preference would be given to creating and strengthening PhD graduate programs in
fields relevant to enhancing the contribution of Science and Technology to Chile's economic
development and to expanding the stock of researchpersonnel inChilean industry. All accredited
institutions with accredited graduate programs would be eligible for support. New graduate
programs would be eligible for support provided that the institution i s accredited and the
program (i)   has been established; (ii)s included inthe institutions strategic plan; and (iii)
                                           i                                                    applies
for accreditation within two years. Moreover, this line would support the training of academic
staff at the PhD level - in accredited programs in Chile or abroad - based on institutional
proposals. All traditional universities would be eligible for support.

Sub-component2.2 -Sub-projects to stimulate institutional efectiveness in critical areas
This sub-component would introduce performance agreementsinChilean tertiary education. The
objective i s to link campus missions to national and regional priorities, university autonomy to
public accountability and institutional performance to government funding. Indoing so, the sub-
component would contribute to the Development Objective by providing an incentive for
institutions to implementplansof action inareas of highnational priority.

Performance agreements would build on the following arrangements: (i)               institutions would
receive government support for an action plan with clearly defined indicators and targets; (ii)    the
size of government support under each performance contract would be adjusted based on
performance; and (iii)       the focus would be on long term capacity building with the use of local
proceduresfor fiduciary managementand M&E.

In the first phase, performance agreements would be piloted in a small number of state
universities currently receiving AFD subsidies from the Government. Institutions would be
selected to reflect different levels of academic complexity in order to test the instrument in as
different circumstances as possible. A second roster of institutions could be added in the first
phase based on advances in institutional accreditation and strategic planning. Over the medium
to long term, the sub-component could lead to a modified AFD that would allocate core funding
to institutions on the basis of performance.

The first round of performance agreements would introduce the concept of performance
agreements and focus on developing the capacity of universities to manage for results. Closely
linked to results from institutional accreditation processes, each participating university would be


  Inthis context "accredited" meansaccredited or inthe process of beingaccredited


                                                       35

invited to develop an institutional proposal covering outputs and outcomes to be achieved inthe
periodcovered in the agreement and how these could be measure. The proposal would have two
parts. The first part would aim at strengthening the institution's management capacity. Support
would be provided for the following objectives:

    0    Increasedcapacity for institutional leadership, evidence-baseddecision making and long-
         term strategic planning.
    0    Design and implementation of institutional management information systems (MIS)
         based on definitions used by the national observatory on tertiary education (sub-
         component 1.3) that allow university leaders to monitor and evaluate progress toward
         agreedgoals.
    0    Development of transparent financial management, auditing and procurement systems
         andproceduresthat ensure that public funds are expendproperly andefficiently.
    0    Establishment of systems for institutional analysis and internal quality assurance for the
         instruction, research, and service activities.
    0    Development of human resource management systems for the training, management and
         utilization of the faculty and professional staff.

The second part would respond to public priorities and the institution's mission by proposing
results to be achieved in the agreement period and how these would be measured. Proposals
would result from participation and consultation among university trustees, administration,
faculty and students. The performance agreements would provide funding to improve
institutional performance incritical areas such as:

    0    Quality improvements, e.g. basedon self-evaluations and inputfrom external reviewers.
    0    Improvements to the relevance of tertiary programs, e.g. by strengthening programs of
        highimportanceto the nationaldevelopment andenhancing linkages to industry.
    0   Enhancementof equity, e.g. through the introduction of remedial courses.
    0   EfSiciency gains, e.g. reforms focused on decreasing dropouts and degree completion
        time.
    0    Strengthening of vertical and horizontal articulation,e.g. arrangementsfor the transfer of
         academic credits from IPSand CFTs as well as degree structure reform.
        Enhancement of university-industry research linkages, e.g. incentives for university staff
        to collaborate with Chilean firms and commercialize researchfindings.

Each agreement would be negotiated between the institution and the Ministry of Education.
Details of the agreement would be discussedbetween the institution and a panel appointed by the
Ministry and chaired by the director of DESUP or hisker representative. A preparation team,
comprising representatives from DESUP and the Ministry of Hacienda, would develop
guidelines and timetables for the negotiation and review process. The process should give all
parties a sense of equal ownership of the final agreement and mutual interest and commitment to
ensuring its success.

The agreements would run for a period of three years and contain (i) commitments for
                                                                          funding
the first year by costing proposed activities and objectives; (ii)funding projections for
subsequent years of the agreement; (iii)    agreed targets; and (iv) indicators to monitor progress.
The director of DESUPandthe rector of each university would sign the completed agreement.



                                                    36

Each institution covered by a performance agreement would publish an annual performance
report. This report would provide data on indicators and spending and include comments from
university leaders. If any performance standards fall short from the expectation, the university
should present to the director of DESUP aplan for improvingits performance on the measure(s).
Updates on the plan's implementation should be presented to the director until the university's
performance has met the standard@)specified inthe agreement.

Based on reviews compiling quantitative and qualitative evidence, Government financing would
be adjusted in a transparent manner according to the performance of each institution measured
against the targets reflected in the agreement. At the end of the agreement period, each
participating institution would propose a new agreement with refined indicators, targets and
timetables.

                CHILE: Chile- Tertiary EducationFinancefor ResultsProject


Implementation period: 3% years for the first phase.

Project Implementation Planand OperationalManual
A draft of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was provided to the Bank Team during pre-
appraisal and was found to be satisfactory. The operational Manual was presented during
negotiations and was approvedby the Bank.

Executing agencies
Implementation of the project in general will be carried out at the system level. Component 2
will be implemented at boththe system and the institutional level.

At the system level, the project will be implemented usingthe existing structures of the Higher
Education Division (DESUP) and the MECESUP project department (PD). The latter has been
incorporated as a department-like organization within DESUP. The PD would be responsible for
carrying out procurement and disbursement activities at the central level, as well as for
monitoring and supervising procurement and disbursement at the level of the institutions and
individual study programs. The PD has the experience andcapacity from the MECESUP project
to manage a large project, implement Bank fiduciary procedures, monitor implementation and
provide technical assistanceto beneficiaries.

At the institutional level, institutions would use their Institutional Coordination Units (ICU) to
oversee project activities. Each ICU will have an "upstream" and a "downstream" function: the
upstream tasks would consist of helping the institution prepare performance agreements and
proposals for the innovation fund; the "downstream" tasks would focus on implementation, e.g.
M&E, fiduciary management and internal arrangements for achieving the performance
agreement.

Project coordination
The PD would have a full-time general coordinator who reports to the director of DESUP. The
team would be organized in sub-teams, one per component, Each of the sub-teams would have
its own coordinator. The general coordinator and the component coordinators would constitute
the Coordination Committee for the project. This Coordination Committee would also include
the director of DESUP. Personnelresponsible for financial management, procurement and M&E
would closely coordinate their work andintegrate project information systems.

Annual ProgressReport
The PD will prepare along with the university rectors anddeansheads of departments, an annual
report at the end of every Government fiscal year, summarizing: (i) status of the activities
                                                                        the
being implemented by the selectedinstitutions or study programs basedon the agreedindicators;
(ii)summary activities of the PD, including information on the agreed indicators; (iii)
implementation progress and problems during the preceding year; (iv) progress towards
achieving the triggers; and (v) a revised implementation plan for the following year, setting out
the measures recommended to ensure efficient implementation of the project and the
achievement of objectives duringthe following year.


                                                39

ImplementationCompletionReport
At the completion of the project, the PD, assisted by supported beneficiaries, would provide
input to an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in order for the report to be finalized no
later than six months prior to the closing date of the loan. This report will summarize, among
other things, (i)program activities interms of input, process, output andimpact indicators for all
project components; (ii)the project financial status; and (iii)implementation issues and
recommendations.

Financialmanagementand audit arrangements
The PD would provide administrative and financial management support to the project and
would be responsible for all payments directly to providers, contractors and consultants for
Component 1. For Component 2, support will be given to academic institutions based on
biannual financial planning. Academic institutions will be responsible for contracting andpaying
directly to contractors and consultantshiredby them. The PD will have the main function in this
case of (i) consolidating financial management information; (ii)   supervising the use of project
resourcesaccording to the project's objectives; and (iii)
                                                        carrying out financial planning.

The project operational manual, which will include procurement, disbursement, financial
management and internal control procedures and processes will be finalized prior to
effectiveness. To mange the project, the PD's financial management capacity will be
strengthenedwith the support of technical staff from MINEDUC.

Audits of project financial statements would be conducted in accordance with International
Standards of Auditing (ISA) by the Supreme Audit Institution, the Comptroller General of the
Republic (Contraloria General de la Repu`blica).The project incorporates the Bank's new policy
on eligibility for Bank financing (OP 6.00). The Bank's Board of Directors approved this policy
on April 13, 2004. To implement the policy, the Country Financing Parameters for Chile were
approvedby the LCR Regional Vice Presidenton February 2,2005.

BankLoanproceedswould bedisbursed indollars to the CentralBankof Chile.

Financialreporting
DESUP through the PD would be responsible for project financial management, accounting,
reporting and ensuring external auditing of all project related expenditures. The Budget office
would have input from the institutions and would report to the project coordinator. Annual audit
reports would be completed by Contraloria General de la Repu'blica,and forwarded to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.

                CHILE: Chile-TertiaryEducationFinancefor ResultsProject

Executive summary. The overall conclusion of the financial management (FM) team is that the
project would be able to maintain financial management arrangements compatible with Bank
requirements. Agreement was reached on an action plan on the standards to be met by the
financial statements in the Financial Management Report (FMR) format and the time frame for
their submission after being certified by the auditors. No major risks were identifiedbut specific
recommendations were incorporated in the action plan in regard to the organizational
arrangements, the strengthening of humanresources inthe PD and the content of the operational
manual. The conclusions of the FM assessment are that: (i)  the FMdesign should be tailored to
support the mainstreaming of project management to the DESUP in order to strengthen the
Ministry's financial management capacity; (ii) PD will be responsible for the preparation of
                                                the
project consolidated financial management statements and supervision of academic institutions;
and(iii) PD has to be complementedby an additional accountant to manageproject financial
         the
affairs.

The financial management risk assessment concluded that the inherent and control risks for the
project are low.

Country Issues. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) i s under review by the
Government as of January 2005 and is expectedto be finalized by the end of fiscal year 2005.

FinancialManagementAssessment.
As requiredby OPBP 10.02, a Senior Financial Management Specialist carried out a financial
managementassessment duringthe Project's pre-appraisal phase. A Senior Finance Officer from
Bank Headquarters also provided guidance in view of the project's innovative financing and
disbursementarrangements.

The Financial Management (FM) assessment took into account the capacity of DESUP and the
PD as well as the design of the project which includes support of academic institutions. It
involved ensuring that the project's design allows for an appropriate level of transparency in
order to facilitate oversight and control while supporting smooth implementation. The
assessment involved (i) review of the financial systems to be used for project accounting,
                           a
financial administration, controlling and reporting and (ii)
                                                           determination of internal controls and
administration procedures that need to be in place in order to control and monitor the project's
financial managementand auditing arrangements.

PD's mainfinancial management responsibilities. The PD will be the Bank's direct counterpart
responsible for financial management issues. Its responsibilities include (i)  the preparation of
consolidated financial statements; (ii)disbursement arrangements with the Bank and the
Government financial authorities; (iii)external audit arrangements; and (iv) supervision of
financial managementarrangements and processesin supported tertiary institutions.

Institutional Arrangements. Implementation of the project in general will be carried out usingthe
same financial management and audit arrangements that are in place for the MECESUP project.
Additional arrangementsregardingproject Component 2 will be implemented at both the system
and the institutional levelinorder to strengthenthe PD and its relationwith tertiary institutions.



                                                41

At the system level, the project will be implemented using the existing structures of the DESUP
and the PD. The latter has been incorporated as a new department within DESUP and shares
personnel with the other departments. The PD would be responsible for carrying out financial
management, procurement and disbursement activities at the central level, as well as for
monitoring and supervising fiduciary arrangements at the level of the institutions and individual
study programs. The PD has the experience and capacity from the MECESUP project to manage
a large project, implement Bank fiduciary procedures, monitor implementation and provide
technical assistanceto beneficiaries.

At the institutional level, institutions would use their planning or institutional development
offices as Institutional Implementation Units (IIU) to oversee the respective institution's project
activities, e.g. M&E, fiduciary management and internal arrangements for executing the sub-
project and/or performance contract.

A number of issues were considered in the FM design of the project in order to address the
inherent complexities of fiduciary oversight for the operation. These include:

 0   The PD needs to be strengthenedto (i) continuity; (ii) technical assistance to
                                              ensure                   increase
     academic institutions; and (iii)enhancecoordination at the operational level with DESUP.
 0   A needexists to strengthenfiduciary capacity at sometertiary institutions that would receive
     grants under component 2.

Fiduciary Capacity Assessment. The execution of sub-component 2.2 would in part build on
university systems for financial management, procurement and performance management. To
assess institutional readiness, it was agreed that the PD will develop a methodology for
classifying traditional universities by risk level. The criteria for the assessment would be detailed
in the Operational Manual and would encompass all administrative procedures and controls
required for sound financial       management, procurement and performance management.
Universities would be assigned a rating prior to negotiation of a performance agreement. Only
universities with a low risk rating would be invited to prepare a performance contract in the first
phase of the program.

Flow of Funds and Infomation. A number of entities will be involvedinproject implementation,
oversight, and financial management. The PD would provide administrative and financial
management support to the project and will be responsible for all payments made directly to
providers, contractors and consultantsfor Component 1.

For Component 2, support will be given to academic institutions based on biannual financial
planning. The various academic institutions will be responsible to contract and pay directly to
contractors and consultants. The PD will have the main function in this case of consolidating the
financial management information, supervising the use of project resources according to project
objectives andensuring financial planning.

Information Systems. The new project will build on the infomation system implemented under
the MECESUPproject. The new project will buildon the informationsystem implementedunder
the MECESUP project. This systemallows for the monitoringof sub-project implementation and
the transfer of resources. The system is currently not linked directly to proprietarily developed
university information systems. The PD will seek to establish such linkages by developing
appropriate software interfaces. This i s expected to lower the administrative burden of sub-


                                                  42

project managers. Although, the PD information system is not linked with the national
government's integrated financial management system (SIGEF), it provides a comprehensive
tool for project monitoring and can work in parallelto the SIGEF. The SIGEF is already in place
for the central government and i s expected to be available to all government institutions by the
endof fiscal year 2005.

Written Procedures. Project financial procedures will be documented in an Operational Manual,
which will define the roles and responsibilities of all entities involvedinProject implementation.
An advanced draft of this manual will be submittedto the Bank before loan negotiations and
should include: (i)accounting policies and procedures; (ii)reporting requirements from
academic institutions; (iii)  formats of the consolidated Financial Monitoring Reports for the
project; (iv) internal controls including criteria and procedures for processing payments and
transfers; (v) records management; and (vi) audit arrangements.

Financial Reporting. The PD will prepare biannual Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) in
accordance with Bank procedures, which specify accounting and report formats for all Bank-
financed projects. The preparation of these reports would rely on the information provided by
academic institutions. The PD will therefore need to agree on the format of reporting and the
preparation of consolidated reports for project management and the distribution of these reports
to the various stakeholders, includingnational controlentities and the Bank.

Audit. The financial statements of the project will be audited annually by the Supreme Chilean
Audit Institution, the Comptroller General of the Republic (Contraloria General de la
Repu'blica). The project financial statements audits will be conducted in accordance with
International Standards of Auditing (ISA). Inaddition, a technical audit of sub-projects will take
place on an annual basis and be used as part of project supervision and monitoring. This would
ensure the proper use of sub-project resources.

Financial Management Action Plan. A Financial Management action plan has been agreedwith
the Government. The plan includes standards to be met by the financial statements in the
Financial Management Report (FMR) format and the time frame for their submission after being
certified by the auditors. Moreover, the action plan contains specific recommendations as regards
the organizational arrangements, the strengthening of human resources inthe PD and the content
of the operational manual.

Disbursements
New Eligibility Policy. The project incorporates the Bank's new policy on eligibility for Bank
financing (OP 6.00), which opens for the financing of flat recurrent expenditure. The Bank's
Boardof Directors approvedthis p o k y on April 13,2004. To implement the policy, the Country
Financing Parametersfor Chile were approved by the LCR Regional Vice President on February
2, 2005.

Component1
As it is customary in Chile, the Government would prefinance project expenditure for this
component and request reimbursement for the Bank's share of the financing. Requests for
reimbursement would be submitted to the Bank on the basis of Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs).




                                                43

Sub-component 2.1
The innovation fund would support competitively selected sub-projects through multi-year
grants. These grants would be transferredto designatedaccounts inwinning institutions as lump-
sumamounts, releasedinseveraltranches; the first trancheupon signing of the Grant Agreement
and subsequent tranches according to progress in implementation (expenditure). Thresholds for
each tranche would be specified in the Operational Manual. The Bank would finance up to 95
percent of the expenditure effectively madeunder this sub-component.

Sub-component2.2
Under this sub-component several state universities would enter into a multi-year performance
contract with the GoC. The flow of funds to institutions signinga performance contract would be
managed in the following way: (i)    institutions would receive government support for an action
plan with clearly defined indicators and targets; (ii)the size of government support under each
performance contract would be adjusted based on performance; and (iii)        the focus would be on
long term capacity building with the use of local procedures for fiduciary management and
M&E.

The loan proceeds will finance upto 70 percent of expenditure madeby participating universities
to cover the cost of goods, works, services and operating costs incurred by the university
executing a set of activities leading to achieve the performance benchmarks agreed to in the
performance contract. Disbursements would be with an advance at contract signature with
subsequent withdrawals on the basis of documented expenditures (SOE). The terms and
conditions for the flow of funds to universities would be agreed in each performance contract.
The Bank would monitor the GoC's assessment of institutionalperformance on which it adjusts
the size of the performance agreement amount.

Disbursement Mechanisms and Documentation. The Bank will disburse to the Government
based on transaction-baseddisbursement requests sent by the PD. The following describes the
disbursementapproach:

1. The PD proceeds to assess completion of technical requirements and verifies that contracts
   and agreement conditions are fulfilled.
2. Academic institutions pay directly to providers or contractors and inform - on a quarterly
   basis-the PDthat the payment processhas been completed.
3. FMRs and disbursement documentation would be prepared by the PD basedon consolidated
   informationprovided by academic institutions andthe MINEDUC.

The Bank will monitor the flow of funds processes, especially to ensure that funds do not sit
undisbursedinthe academic institutions for alongperiod of time.

A. General
Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-
qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The ProcurementPlan will be updated at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity. The procurement procedures and Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) to
be usedfor each procurement method, as well as model contracts for works and goods procured,
should be included inthe Operational Manual(OM).

Procurement of Works: Civil Works procured under this project would mainly be for minor
construction to adapt existing buildings. New constructions will be approved on a case-by-case
basis. All civil works contracts estimated to cost over US$ 5.0 million equivalent would be
procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Civil works contracts
estimated to cost less than US$ 5.0 million equivalent may be procured using National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. The procurement under NCB would be done using
National SBD acceptable to the Bank. Works estimated to cost less than US$ 350,000
equivalent, may be procuredon the basis of at least three quotations from qualified contractors.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured would include computer equipment, software, teaching
materials, scientific equipment, scientific magazines, office supplies, printing services, and
logistics for seminars, workshops and travel. All goods estimatedto cost over US$ 500,000 shall
be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Sophisticated scientific equipment
(more than US$ 100,000) may be procured usingLimited International Bidding(LIB).All goods
estimated to cost less than US$ 500,000 may be procured in accordance with the NCB
procedures, using National SBD acceptable to the Bank. Smaller purchases of items such as
teaching materials, office supplies and equipment contracts valued at less than 1000 UTM

local legislation, may be procured through local shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. All
procurement notices shall be advertised in ChileCompra or in at least one local newspaper of
                                                                          ~~


national circulation. ICB procurement notices andcontract award informationshall be advertiFd
in UN Development Business online (UNDB online) and in the Development Gateway's dg
Market. ChileCompra shall also be used to publish information on awarded contracts in
accordance with provisions of paragraphs 2.60 of the Procurement Guidelines and as mandated
by locallegislation.

Procurement of Consultants' Services: (i) it is expected that the project would finance
                                              Firms:
several studies, design of information systems, data collection and analysis and workshops. All
contracts for firms would be procured using Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
procedures except for small contracts for assignments of standard or outing nature and estimated

(LCS) and Consultants' Qualifications (CQ). Single-source selection (SSS) procedure may be
usedonly in exceptional cases, with prior agreement of the Bank, inaccordancewith provisions
of paragraphs 3.10 of the Consultant Guidelines,for assignmentswhen only one firm i s qualified
or has experience of exceptional worth, and it has been confirmed by a request of expressionsof
interest. Consultants' services to organize workshops would be selectedusingLCS. Short lists of
consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$ 500,000 equivalent per contract may be
composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of
the Consultant Guidelines. (ii)  Individual Consultants: Specialized advisory services would be
provided by individual consultants selected by comparison of qualifications of at least three
candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions of Section V of the Consultant
Guidelines. Sole-source selection of individual consultants may be contracted with due
justification in exceptional cases, with Bank's prior agreement, in accordance with provisions of
paragraphs5.4 of the Consultant Guidelines. ChileCompra and/or a national newspaper shall also
be usedto advertise a request of expression of interest for consulting firms or individuals, and to
publishinformation on awarded contracts in accordance with provisions of paragraphs 2.28 of
the Consultants Guidelines and as mandatedby local legislation. Contracts expectedto cost more
than US$200,000 shall be advertisedin UAJDBonline and indgit4arket. University professors or
scientists from research institutes can be contracted individually under Bank financing provided
that they have full time employment contracts with their institution and have regularly exercised
their function for a year or more before they are contracted under Bank funding.

Grants for sub-projects comprise: (i)    Innovative sub-projectsfor tertiary programs that would
range between US$ 100,000 and US$ 5 million to cover the cost of works, goods and
consultants' services and (ii) Sub-projects to stimulate institutional effectiveness in critical areas
that would range between US$ 3 million and US$ 10million to cover the cost of goods, works,
consult ants^ services and flat recurrent costs. The grantee's program or institution would carry
out procurement under the review of the PD and in the case of ICB and major consultants'
contracts, under review of the Bank. Any procurement would be conducted according to the
procedures specified above following Bank guidelines. In the case that private tertiary
institutions are following commercial practices of the private sector these practices would be
evaluated by the PD, referenced in the Operational Manual and submitted to the Bank for its
acceptance. The Bank and the PD would conduct ex-post procurement reviews of funded sub-
projects.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement
The Bank has completed a capacity assessment of the Administrative Office of the Ministry of
Education and ofthe existing MECESUP PD and found it satisfactory. -ion                plan has bees  .
developed to strengthen this department. For component 2, the Ministry of Education, through
the PD, will be responsible for: (i) upstream, procurement-related activities, including assessing
the implementing capacity of the participants; (ii)  preparing and reviewing procurement plans,
(iii)developing and monitoring improvement action plans, justifying risk classification; (iv)
coordinating procurement reviews; and (v) preparing management reports on compliance and
prior review activities. In order to discharge these responsibilities, the PD will organize a
procurement team consisting of at least one senior procurement specialist, one junior
procurement specialist, and one procurement analyst, all of whom should be familiar with the
Bank's procurement guidelines. This team will assess the implementingcapacity of the selected



                                                 47

Institutions and determine the level of risk involved in the case of each beneficiary institution
using a methodology acceptable to the Bank. The team will prepare the procurement section of
the Project's OM. The team and its support staff will participate in a workshop focused on
ensuring that the participating Institutions will follow the procurement arrangements set forth in
the Loan Agreement (LA). The workshop will focus on the Bank's procurement policy and
procedures.

The overall project riskfor procurementis Low.

Most of the issuedrisks concerning procurement have been identified in the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The assessment carried during FY05 revealed that
local legislation and practices differ from Bank rules in several aspects. Buildingof institutional
experience with Bank procurement from the MECESUP project, the corrective measures that
have been agreed are:

0     A set of NationalSBDfor NCB would be agreedandincluded inthe OM.
0     A project O M including a procurement chapter and a manual of functions for the PD, both
      acceptable to the Bank, would be adoptedbefore loaneffectiveness.
0     A procurement information system acceptable to the Bank would be implemented before
      June 30,2005.
0     The Special Procurement Conditions listed in Section E would be included in the Loan
      Agreement.

C. Procurement Planand General Procurement Notice
The PD, has preparedan overall procurement plan for the tasks to be carried out duringthe first
18 months of the Project's implementation. This model procurement planwill be includedinthe
OM. Procedures for institutional procurement planning will be specified in the Operational
Manual. The Bank will annually review the project procurement plan and the PD will review the
planof institutions awardedaGrant to prepare an action plan andto assess the risk level.


                                                                      48

For projects that include ICB andconsultant contracts expected to cost more than US$ 200,000 a
General Procurement Notice (GNP) is required. The Bank will arrange for its publication in
UNDBonline and indgMarket.

D.Frequency ofProcurementSupervision
Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, one full annual
procurement supervision mission will be carried out in order to conduct ex-post-reviews of
procurement actions. Based on the overall risk assessment, the ex-post-review field analysis
should cover a sample of not less than 1in 10contracts signed. Identical supervision conditions
will be followed by the PD andbasedon the capacity of the institutions. An annual planof visits
should be submitted to the Bank for its review andapproval.

E.Special ProcurementConditions
The following Special ProcurementConditions would apply:

Works and Goods
1. All bid-related documents should be submitted together. Bidders shall not be required to
   submitbidsecuritiesor other documents inadvance and separately from their bids.
2. All bids received on or before the deadline for bid submission should be admitted for
   evaluation at the bidopening.
3. Bids should not be rejected at opening.
4. Foreign contractors/suppliers shall be allowed to bid and shall not be required to: (i)have a
   local representative to bid or (ii)register as a condition for bidding. Foreign
   contractors/suppliers shall, however, register before contract signature, as required by the
   applicable law andregulations.
5. For works: unit price contracts for works should be priced on the basis of unit prices quoted
   by bidders after correction of computation errors as prescribed in the Bank's SBD.
   Recalculation of bid prices based on the original bid price in proportion to unit prices in the
   official estimate shall not be carried out.

Consultants
6. The Ministry of Education and the beneficiary institutions shall publicly advertise
   expressions of interest as the basis for developing short lists of firms.
7. No openbiddingshould be carried out.

Procurement records. The PD will maintain detailed procurement records, reflecting the
Project's supply of goods, works, and consultant services, including records of time taken to
complete key steps in the process and procurement activities related to supervision, review, and
audits. These records will be maintained for at least two years after the Pmject's cbsing date,
The records for goods and works will include public notices, bidding documents and addenda,
bid opening information, bidevaluation reports, formal appeals by bidders and outcomes, signed
contracts with related addenda and amendments, records on claims and dispute resolutions, and
any other useful information. The participating institutions will retain all of the bidding
documents used, invoices, price comparisons, bids received, bidevaluation reports, and all of the
documentation required under the law andensure that it is readily available.

                                Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
                   CHILE: Chile- Tertiary EducationFinancefor ResultsProject

 The economic and financial analysis addresses the project's expected impact on external and
 internal efficiency in Chilean tertiary education. The analysis is centered on the 16 public and 9
 private traditional universities, which make up the Council of Rector's institutions. External
 efficiency refers to the effect of educationon employment andemployment income of graduates.
 Internal efficiency is an indication of the effectivenessof tertiary institutions inconverting inputs
 into outputs and is measured by indicators such as graduation rates and completion time. The
evaluation strategy consists of quantifying the monetary value associated with gains in the
internal and external efficiency, and subsequently identifying the minimum efficiency gains
required to ensure the profitability of the project. The lower these thresholds the greater is the
probability that the project will bejustified from a social costhenefit perspective5.

Wages and employment
Table 1shows the average salary of workers in the age group 25-54 in Chile, classified by years
 of schooling. The data are expressedinrelative terms to an index that takes the value 100 inthe
case of workers with 8 or less years of education. Inthe context of high growth in the supply of
university graduates it is important to report salary trends over time. For this reason, the data for
the years 1990-2003 are presented6.All statistics inTable 1are calculated directly from the data
 of the CASEN surveys, which is the main source of socio-economic data in Chile. In2003, the
 survey covered more than 60,000 households.

The most recent data (2003) indicate that the average salary of university graduates is more than
five times higher than that of workers with only primary education. The relative income gap
between university graduates and secondary school graduates is 3.21 and the gap relative to
those with incomplete university education is 1.81. This analysis represents averages and does
 not control for gender or age differences. When gender i s taken into account, it i s revealed that
 the income gap between university graduates andworkers with only primary education i s less for
 women than for men (3.93 vs. 4.95). This result reflects the fact that educated women are
 disproportionately represented in low-income professional jobs, such as teaching and non-
 medical health services. The income gap between workers with university education andworkers
 with only primary education increases with age. This is likely to mirror the impact of experience
 on the productivityof the most skilled workers.

 The observed variations in the salaries of workers with different levels of schooling do not
 necessarily represent a return on education, given that there may be differences in non-
 observable variables that account for part of the observed salary difhenEial. The traditional
hypothesis postulates that the income gap overestimates returns to education since individuals
with greater motivation and initial cognitive capacity achieve higher levels of education. The
income gap in this case would include the pay for this type of skills, which would be confused
with the pay for higher levels of schooling. Nevertheless, there may also be opposing effects,

  There is not sufficient information available to carry out an exact estimation o f the project's impact on internal and
  external efficiency. Hence, it is more useful to identify the minimum gains in efficiency that would justify the
  project.
  The reference group represented 24.5% of workers in the age group 25-54 years in 2003. Only 0.8% had no
  education.

such as in the case of liquidity constraints that restrict the access to higher education of young
people with academic abilities7. In the case of Chile, there are no estimates that can be used to
control for the effects indicated.

The data inTable 1show an increase in the wage gap between university-educated workers and
the rest of the working population throughout the 1990s. This trend implies that the higher
supply of university graduates has been fully absorbed by increases in the demand for skilled
labor. The widening wage gap is a trend that Chile has in common with most--deveEped
countries as well as most countries in Latin America'. However, it must be taken into account
that there is a lagged effect to be considered given that 2003 labor market information includes
up to the cohort that started studying in 1996 (assuming an average tertiary completion time of 7

years). Inthe subsequent period (1997-2003), enrollment in Chilean universities increasedby a
significant 52.8 percent. It is too early to assess the impact of this expansion.

Higher schooling levels are also associated with increased labor market participation. 88.0
percent of university graduates between 25 and 54 years of age are working, while the same
figure for individuals with only primary education is only 58.2 percent. For secondary education
graduatesthe employment rate i s 68.6 percent and for those with incomplete university studies it
i s 77.8 percent. The breakdown of the data by gender reveals that this pattern arises from the
labor market participation of women. While 82.2 percent of female university graduates are
employed this is only the case for 35.6 percent of women with primary education. This
relationship likely reflects a combination of traditional gender-basedwork division in Chile and
high opportunity costs associated with working in the household for highly educated women.
The male employment rate is relatively inelastic to the level of education.

Lengthof studies and graduationrates
No public indicators are available on the duration of studies, graduation rates and percentage of
students that change degree programs. Hence, it is necessary to turn to indirect information
sources when attempting to measure the internal efficiency of Chilean universities. The lack of
key performance data i s an indication of shortcomings in the management of universities and
public agenciesresponsible for assuringthe quality of tertiary education.

A first indicator of internal efficiency is excess duration of degrees. This is defined as the
difference between the actual degree duration and the expected duration. Data on this indicator
were compiled usinginformation presentedby Chilean universities inthe 2003 and 2004 rounds
of the MECESUP competitive fund. These competitions required applicant institutions to report
on the actual and expected duration of their degree programs. The data comprise information
from all programs irrespective of whether they were chosen for funding or not. The sample
includes 244 degreeprograms from traditional universities, 168public and 76 private.

The results are presented in Table 2, grouped by type of university and by area of study. The
averageexcess duration of degree programs is 3.41 semesters; with an average expected duration
of 10.3 semesters and a modal value of 10semesters (54 percent of the cases). While there are no
significant differences between public and private universities, there are differences between
areas of study. Time to completion i s especially high - five or more semesters - in the case of
technological programs (engineering), agricultural (agronomy, forestry, veterinary medicine, etc)
and law. Incontrast, health sector relatedprograms feature notably lower excess durations'.




  The data presented must be taken as preliminary evidence. First, the sample is not representative since it only
  includes those that applied to the MECESUP contests in the years considered. Second, and perhaps more
  importantly, it is not clear that the universities that applied for MECESUP funds used the same (or a consistent)
  methodology to calculate the actual student completion time.


                                                           52

The second estimate of internal efficiency is the graduation rate. For this, two alternative
methodologies are employed. The first analysis relies on information on new enrollment and
graduation numbers provided indata collected by the Chilean Council for Higher Education. The
ratio between graduates and new registrations can be calculated for a same year. This coefficient
reasonably approximates the graduation rate inthe case of degree programs in steady state. Inthe
context of a system with rapidly expanding enrollment, it is necessary only to sample such
programs. To this end, only degreeprograms that have a coefficient between new enrollment and
total enrollment within the rangeof 0.13 to 0.20 are considered".

The results of the procedure are presentedinTable 3. The overall graduation rate i s estimated at
57.1 percent, with a gap in favor of public over private universities (66.0 vs. 47.5 percent). The
highest graduation rates (over 70 percent) are found in the humanities, social sciences and
education, while the areas of science and law have the lowest graduation rates (below 30
percent).




lo
 Insteady state the ratio between new enrollment and total enrollment is the reciprocal of the actual duration of the
 program (0.20 in the case of 5 years, 0.16 in the case of 6 years, and 0.14 in the case of 7 years). For this, only
 degree programs whose indicator lies between 0.13 and 0.20 are considered.

                                 is: 0.134.20, and new enrollment is above 15 students

A variant of the same methodology is to build the coefficient based on graduation in 2003 and
new enrollment in 2000. This alternative attempts to adjust for the lag between the starting and
ending periods of degreeprograms, even when the available information only allows for a lag of
four years (versus 7 years that would approximate the actual duration of studies)"                    . The results
show a considerably lower graduation rate than that reported in Table 3 (around 35 percent).
However, this estimatei s subject to a greater imprecision, since the data cannot be disaggregated
due to changesindegree classifications over time.

The second analysis estimates the graduation rate basedon data reported in the CASEN survey.
This survey provides information on the type of studies undertaken by each person,
distinguishing amongthose who graduatedfrom university and those who did not complete their
university studies. An estimator of the graduation rate is built as the coefficient between
university graduates and the total number of people with university studies (graduated or not).
The results are presented in Table 4 for different age cohorts. The data show an average
graduation rate of around 77 percent. This data do not differentiate by type of tertiary institution
and include traditional as well as new private universities. The 45-54 age cohort can be used to
approximate the graduation rate of traditional universities, since this cohort precedes the
establishment of new private universities. The graduation rate (34.3 percent-) i s lower for this
cohort, which is consistentwith the lower graduation rate for traditional universities presentedin
Table 2.

Differences between the two methodologies are likely to reflect the fact that students can change
degree programs, either through internal transfers or by retaking the university entrance exam. In
this situation, the graduation rate reported by universities is lower than that reported by
individuals in the household surveys. By way of example, a student changing from degree
program A to degree program B, and who graduates from the latter, lead to a 50 percent
graduation rate seen from an institutional perspective. However, seen from the level of the
individual (household surveys), the same person would lead to a 100 percent graduation rate.
According to information provided in Tables 2 and 3, the respective graduation rates are
approximately 57 and 74 percent. This means that for every 100 youths entering university, 57
complete their original degree program, 17 graduates from a different degree program and the
remaining 26 do not graduate. An additional fact that should be taken into account is that the
retention rate at the end of the first year of studies is around 84 percent for traditional
universities, which is consistent with the above estimates.

Monetarybenefits from gains inexternal efficiency
One important objective of the project is to improve the quality and relevance of university
education, which should ultimately lead to better employment skills and subsequently higher
earnings. In order to assess the magnitude of improvements to the quality and relevance of
tertiary education, a simulation is carried out using the net present value of average salary
increases of new cohorts of university graduates. Salary increases in the range from 0.5 to 2.5
percent are considered. The estimate refers to the mean wage of new graduates from traditional
universities. This does not imply that all graduates will benefit from the project. Nonetheless,
claiming a 1percent average salary increase for a cohort i s the same as claiming a 10 percent
increaseinthe salary of one tenthof the cohort.

The estimate is based on the following data and assumptions: (i) size of each cohort i s
                                                                        the
calculated from data on new enrollment in traditional universities for the years 1999to 2004, and
a projected future enrollment by using the growth rate for that period (4.6 percent annual
increase); (ii)
              the average degree completion time i s 7 years, calculated as the weighted average
between the average duration of studies of graduates in their initial degree program (13.5
semesters) and that for those who subsequently change degree program (assuming four
additional semesters); (iii)the graduation rate equals 74 percent of the cohort; (iv) the present
value of the income i s calculated at the starting salary of Ch$529,000 (CASEN 2003),
considering an annual income growth rate of 4 percent (1.5 percent lifecycle and 2.5 percent per
capita growth of the economy) for a periodof 30 years (80 percent of the working lifecycle of 40
years for men and 35 years for women); (v) the employment rate of university graduates i s 88
percent; and (vi) the discount rate i s 6 percent and the dollar exchangerate i s taken as Ch$600.

The results of the simulation are shown in Table 5. Each cell shows the net present value in
millions of US$ of average salary increases (column) for the cohort entering the labor market in
the year indicated in each row. The last row shows the present value of the sum of the gains for
cohorts entering the labor market between 2007 and 2014. This assumes a lag of three years
between project implementation and its impact. The simulation considers the benefit of the
project on 10graduation cohorts. Thus, the estimates inTable 5 are conservative inthe sense that
they do not factor in permanent changes to the external efficiency of universities. The
counterfactual scenario (no project) i s provided by the current salary level and the parameters
described in the previous paragraph. Importantly, Table 5 assumes that there are no gains in the
internal efficiency of universities.

The results show significant gains associated with relatively minor increases in the average
salary of graduates from traditional universities. It would thus suffice for the project to lead to
gains in the quality and relevance of studies that lead to an increase of only 0.5 percent of the
average salary of graduates in order to achieve a net present value of US$ 295.8 million. This
gainis above the present value of the investment of the project (US$ 286.8)12.

wage gap as before (assuming that the value of the time of women at home equals at the margin

efficiency of universities.

The results show that a gain of one percentage point in the graduation rate for traditional
universities would lead to monetary gains of US$440.9 million, which exceedby far the present
value of the investment.

Finally, Table 7 presentsgains to be made from improvements inuniversity internal efficiency in
the form of a lower average student completion time. The gains arise from the increase in labor
income associatedwith an extension of the working-life span (equivalent to the reduction in the
length of study time). The reduction in tuition paid by Chilean families lead to a decrease in
university revenue. In this simulation, this decrease does not lead to additional gains as
universities are assumed not to respond by increasing total enrollment. This, however, i s a
conservative assumption that i s likely to underestimate the benefits-                    flowing from the project.

   Conclusion
  The analysis shows that the project would have a net present value if it succeeds to induce
   marginal gains in the internal and/or external efficiency of traditional universities. To be
  profitable, it would suffice for the project to increasethe average wage of university graduates by
   1percent, increase the graduation rate by one percentagepoint or reducethe average completion
   time by a little more than one month. A likely scenario is that the project would help universities
   improve on all these dimensions, which would make the value-added of the project considerably
   higher than the net present value of the investment.

Project Background
Objective. The Chile Tertiary Education Improvement Project aims to improve the performance
and equity of the Chileanhigher education system. One of the key objectives of the project i s to
encourage and facilitate access to tertiary education for students from the most vulnerable
households. This project is part of the commitment that PresidentLagos' Administrationmade to
the poor and indigenous peoples, as stated in "Un Nuevo Trato entre el Estado y Los Pueblos
Indigenas y la Sociedad Chilena. (June 2004)"              l3

Population. According to the latest census (2002), the total Chilean population reached 15.1
million. The population growth rate betweenthe latest Censuses (1992-2002) was 1.2%; slightly
less than the population growth rate between the prior two Censuses (1982-1992), which was
1.6%. Despite the lower growth rate of the national population as a whole, urban population has
grown at a faster rate during the latest inter-census period, in part, due to migration to urban
areas. Between 1990-2003, total rural population decreasedfrom 18.5% to 14.0%, and today, in
2004, about 86.0% of the population lives inurbanareas. The regions which reported the greatest
decline inpopulation were those that had the highest percent of ruralpopulations in 2003. These
regions are: Araucania (44.6% to 32.5%), Aise`n (34.1% to 21.5%), Los Lagos (42.1% to 32.9%),
Del General Libertador Bernard0O'Higgins (40.2% to 30.7%) and Del Maule (45.3% to 35.5%)
(CASEN household survey).

l3The Commission of Historical Truth and the New Deal with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean Society was formed
in 2001, and headedby former President Alwyin. The commission was created to gather diverse opinions and views
regarding indigenous peoples in Chile and to develop strategies to reach a conciliatory resolution. Recommendations
made by the Commission contributed to the creation o f the New Deal Policy with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean
Society presented by President Lagos in June 2004 at the first inter-governmental meeting organized by the Latin
American Indigenous Peoples Fund, which took place inChile.

Poverty. Chile made great strides inthe fight against poverty during the 1990s, and the last two
governments increased the share of public spending on investments in human capital and social
protection, in a concerted effort to increaseequity. The combination of targeted social programs
with macroeconomic stability and high levels of economic growth enabledpoverty rates to drop.
Duringthe period 2002-03 there was a2.1% reduction ofpoverty andthe population livingunder
indigent conditions was reducedby 7.2 % (CASEN 2003).

Despite these advances, Chile remains a country of high income inequality, with marked
differences between demographic groups. Indigenous peoples, youth, female-headedhouseholds
and rural residents are especially vulnerable. Notably, there is a strong correlation between
poverty and rural areas. The indigent rate in 2003 was 6.2% in rural areas, as compared to only
4.7% nationally and4.5% in urbanareas.

Indigenous PopulationandPoverty
Zndigenouspopulation. According to the 2002 Census, 692,192 people or 4.6% of the population
identifiedthemselves as indigenous. The Census classified as indigenous those groups identified
by the Indigenous Peoples Law. These groups are: Alacalufe (0.4%), Atacameno (3.0%),
Aymara (7.0%), Colla (OS%),        Mapuche (87.3%), Quechua (0.9%), Rapanui (0.7%), and
Yamana (0.2%). Most of the indigenous population lives in Regions I,VIII, IX, X, and the
Metropolitan Area of Santiago. About 35.2% of indigenous people live in rural areas, while
64.8% live in cities. However, in rural areas the concentration of indigenous groups is higher
than non-indigenous peoples. Gender composition is quite equal among indigenous peoples;
women account for 49.6% of the total indigenouspopulation.

Poverty among indigenous. There i s a strong correlation between indigenous peoples and
poverty. In 2000, approximately 10% of indigenous peoples were indigent or extremely poor,
while only 5.4 % of non-indigenous were. Even amongst the already-vulnerable rural
inhabitants, higher rates of poverty are seen amongst the indigenous population. In2000, 14.7%
of indigenous rural residents were indigent, as compared to only 7.5% of non-indigenous rural
 resident^.'^ While 10%of    indigenous poor households depend on subsidies, only 7% of non-
indigenous households do so. Social policies and programs need to be refined and adapted to
address the needs of these most vulnerable groups. Regions VII, VIII, and X, where the majority
of the Mapuche live, have the highest levels of the population living below the poverty line

includingthe right to secure ownership of land, the right to self organize, and the right to define
"Areas of Development," (Areas de Desarrollo Indigena -ADI) among others. With the New
Deal Policy with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean Society presentedby President Lagos in June
2004 there is greater recognition of the political rights of indigenous peoples, including their
right to formally participate in decision-making processes within State and Governmental
institutions at the national andlocal level.

EthnicityandEducation
Education trends. During the last ten years Chile has si nificantly improved education at all
levels. In2002, about 96% of the population was literate." As expected, higher education levels
are achieved in urban areas, both in terms of attendance rates and the highest level completed.
Yet, the greatest educational gains in the past 10 years were in rural areas, where the literate
population increased by about 3.2% in contrast to an increase in urban literacy rates of only
0.5%.16 In 1992, about 10%of the population was enrolled in some type of tertiary education.
This increasedto 30.5% in 2003. Despite overall increasesinthe number of years of education
attended, disparities betweenruralandurbanareas persist.

Previous studies conducted by CONADI state that demand for education has increased due to a
number of interrelated factors. Over the past 20 years Chile has seen rapid urbanization, which
has brought with it an increased demand for highly qualified professimals, leading to a widely
held view of education as a means of social improvement and mobility. Partially as a result of
this view, rates of enrollment and completion of the secondary level have increased, leading to
greater demand for continuation at the tertiary level. Two decrees have made an important
contribution to increasing the enrollment of indigenous students in continuing education: (i)
Decree No636 of MINEDUC, published in Diario Oficial on April 16, 1991, which established

Indigenous Population and Education. The rate of illiteracy among the indigenous population is
higher than that of the non-indigenous. While 96% of the non-indigenous population is literate,
only 92% of the indigenous qualify as such. 54% of the indigenous population has completed
primary education as compared to 66% of the total Chilean population. The differences in
enrollment rates between indigenous and non-indigenous students increase further at the tertiary
level. While 16% of the total Chilean population has completed some type of tertiary education,
only 8% of indigenous peoples did so.

The current Administration has been fostering specific actions to improve the well-being of the
poor and more vulnerable, includingthe indigenous peoples. One of the actions taken hasbeen to
expand the scholarship programs for tertiary education. These scholarships include; "Beca
Primera Dama, Millennium, Presidente de la Republica, MINEDUC, Juan Gomez Millas,
Pedagogia, Hijos de Profesionales de la Educacion, and Beca Indigena (First Lady, Millennium,
President of the Republic, MINEDUC, Juan Gomez Millas, Pedagogy, Children of Professionals
working for the Educational system, and Indigenous Scholarships). In theory, indigenous
students could apply to all of these and others. While the criteria for selection varies, in general
there are three basic considerations: (a) gr&*    (b) poverty-and vulnerability (as measuredby the
"Ficha CAS" or CAS dossier, that measures a household's vulnerability through variables such
as the physical condition of the house, and income); and (c) admission test (PSU) scores.

As the following table shows that Chilean tertiary education, despite significant improvement
between 1990 and 2000, is still highly inequitable. In 2000, persons belonging to the richest 20
percent of the population comprised 33 percent of the enrolled students, whereas the poorest 40
percent make upjust 18percent of the studentbody (Graph 3).

Indigenous Scholarship Program. The indigenous scholarshipis administrated by the-hdigenous
Scholarship Program, part of the Ministry of Education's Intercultural Bilingual Education
Program. In accordance with the law (Ley 19.253), the scholarship is reserved for indigenous
students who have demonstrated economic difficulties, that are enrolled in accredited
Universities, Professional Institutions or Technical Information Centers, and who perform well
academically. The annual scholarship (approximately US$ 678 in 2003) i s paidmonthly directly
to the beneficiary. The scholarship is only renewed if recipients maintain an established
minimumgradepoint average, and remaininthe samecourse of study (see Table 4).

As can be seen from the above table, indigenous scholarships have been increasing steadily in
the last years. However, the Indigenous Scholarship, like most of the other scholarships, only
includes the tuition and matriculation fees which are transferred directly to Universities and do
not provide for additional costs, such as meals, transportation, clothing, and books. Thus, few
indigenous and poor students can afford to continue their education, even with a scholarship.
Consequently, inorder to cope with poverty, many students opt to work rather than study, mostly
searchingfor jobs incities. Therefore, lack of educational andjob opportunities inrural areas are
increasing rural-urban migration. As a result, 64.8% of indigenous peoples live in urban areas,
whereas only 35.2% live inrural areas, according to the latest CASEN 2003.

Students Residencies. Between 1999-2003, CONADI financed the Program `Subsidio a la
Residencia para Estudiantes Indigenas de Educaci6n Superior' (Subsidy for Housing for
Indigenous Students at Superior Education). The program finances residencies in urban areas
where indigenous students from all communities and of both genders can live while attending
school. There are 9 residences in total, 2 of which are in Santiago. In 1999 the average annual
cost per student was CLP 550,000 (or US$ 916). In2003, this cost increased to CLP 1.0 million
(or US$ 1,666).

MainProblemsto Access Tertiary Education.
The poor and the indigenous face two main impediments in access to tertiary education: (i)
difficulty in competing academically, due to poor academic background and (ii)            difficulty in
affording education due to low income levels. These two factors make them vulnerable to
exclusion from the benefits of education as a means to improve their social and economic
conditions, thereby perpetuating the vicious circle of poverty. Most of the consulted population
statedthat the poor and indigenous peoples also face forms of social exclusion.

Social Exclusion. Whereas a study on indigenous post-secondary students, conducted as part of
the Chile: Science for the Knowledge Economy Project, found that there was no legal
discrimination (Repetto, 2003), consultations revealed that social exclusion is a factor
influencing indigenous students access third level education; this phenomenon is not racial,
rather it relates to social and cultural standards difficult to fulfill for some students, which make
                                                                               ~           ~


it difficult to access or complete their education. The indigenous students concurredthat
exclusion was prevalent, but reported varying degrees of the problem, and visualized different
resolution strategies. Some of the indigenous people stated that they preferred to focus on
personal success, then to devote attention to social exclusion; some disagree with the alternative
to focus on ethnic background.

 lox 1. Benefits to indigenous peoplesas viewed by indigenous students
 Indigenous students in Santiago who emigratedfrom rural areas stated the following: The criteria for
 awarding scholarships and benefits to indigenous peoples should not be based only on ethnic and
 gender variables. Currently, the selection criteria and process is poor as i s the monitoring and
 evaluation of student performance. These factors leadto a waste of funds investedin scholarshipsand
 residences. The students suggested that the selection process includes: (a) an interview, (b) an
 emotional test to determine student capacity to live by themselvesfar away from home, (c) grades, (d)
 an assessment of the student's willingness to learn English-because    the goal i s to have access to all
 educational materials produced in Chile and abroad, and to explore the possibility to study overseas.
 They also recommendedthat the students sign a contractthat they will stay in their Region for at least
 two years as a requirementof the scholarships.Finally, they statedthat the "ficha o dossier CAS" does
 not accuratelyreflect vulnerability andthereforecontributesto the exclusionof valuable students.

 Mapuche indigenous students born in Santiago stated the following: Scholarships mostly benefit
 rural students and provide almost nothing for urban students. They agree that the dossier CAS is not
 useful, but differ in their approach in how to improve it. According to them, the CAS criteria should
 only be applied to people who are really indigent and would otherwise not benefit from a scholarship.
 The urban Mapuche expressed a greater need than their rural counterparts, to maintain roots and
 traditions andincorporatethem into urbanlife.

Consultation revealed that results of affirmative action (discriminaci6n positiva) are not always
positive. It was reported that males and non-indigenous peoples were beginning to react
negatively towards efforts specifically designed to promote and facilitate university access for
the poor, indigenous and female. In addition, some indigenous students themselves, had
reservations about affirmative action out of concern that it might convey the impression that they
had been admitted solely for ethnic reasons, and not for their academic merits. Some o f those
consulted, including officials from CONADI, pointed to a potential for revising selection criteria
inorder to provide a stronger emphasis on academic performanceas well as ethnic origin.

To this end, an assessment of the indigenous scholarship would be very helpful to improve its
targeting. The indigenous peoples development strategy takes this into account as it would
finance a study on the targeting of the indigenous scholarship program. Such a study and the
dissemination o f lessons learned and good examples o f successful students would contribute to
counteracting the false perceptions related to actions seeking to mitigate exclusion related to
ethnicity, poverty, andor gender issues.

To combat social exclusion and to ensure that the New Deal's commitments made by President
Lagos to the indigenous peoples and Chilean society are met, the Ministry of Planning
(MIDEPLAN) is designing a nation-wide campaign to create a broader consensus on ethnic
equality and inclusion. The IPDP will help ensure that tertiary education institutions are targeted
inthe campaign.

Inadequate preparation. Data and consultations carried out with key stakeholders including
professors, indigenous students andMINEDUC staff suggest shortcomings inthe quality of basic
education for indigenous students living in poor and rural areas. As a result, indigenous
secondary graduates are more likely to fail the university admission test (PSU) and their access
to tertiary education remains limited (Table 2). Graph 4 reveals a strong correlation between
PSUtest scores and income.

FinanciuE constraints. The few students from poor and ruralareas that do score well on the PSU
exam or are able to enroll in some sort of tertiary education face financial problems. Poor and
more vulnerable are often only able to afford the most inexpensive subjects of study, which
might not be the ones they have the skills or vocation for. Duringconsultations, some professors
suggested that indigenous students generally prefer to enroll in the social sciences (e.g.
anthropology and history) in search of their roots and ethnic identify. This seems to be a
misperception. Although some study anthropology and equivalent subjects choice, others are
limited to the social sciences because they cannot afford more expensive programs of study such
as medicine, dentistry, architecture, etc.

IndigenousPeoplesDevelopmentPlan
Basedon the above analysis and recommendations drawn from consultations, the main objective
of the IPDP is to combat constraints faced by the poor and indigenous to access tertiary
education. Notably, the IPDP will: (i) transition programs for indigenous secondary
                                             support
graduates in order to increase their PSU scores; (ii)     explore ways to ensure adequate funds for
tuition and cost-of-living allowances for poor indigenous tertiary students; and (iii)   to include a
regional target approach to address identified lack of opportunities in areas where the indigenous
population andpoor are a majority.

The first phase of the project would be used to launch preparatory courses for indigenous
students. Based on lessons learned the second phase could be used to scale up activities.
Concretely, the following activities are proposed for the first phase:
                                                                    .% a
                  ..    ~                           -.
                                                                ~~
Social TargetAssessment. As a study under sub-component 1               Social Target Assessment will
be carried out. The target assessment would review selection criteria used in current programs of
affirmative action taking into account recommendations received during consultation. Moreover,
the assessment would develop eligibility and selection criteria for a special round of the
innovation fund targeted at financing preparatory courses for inadequately prepared indigenous
students. The assessment would focus on the following areas: (i)        regions Iand I1in the north to
target the Atacamenos and Aymaras; (ii) VI1and IX inthe south to target the Mapuches;
                                             regions
(iii)vulnerable villages or "comunas" as identified by the CASEN survey and the vulnerability
index createdby JUNAEB; and (iv) indigenous students living inurban areas.

Special round of the innovation fund. A call for proposals under the innovation fund (sub-
component 2.1) will be made for PSU preparatory courses for indigenous peoples. Sub-projects
that best satisfy developed selection criteria would receive support for an initial period of two
years.

Monitoring and Evaluation. An assessment administeredunder sub-component 1.2, will evaluate
results of the pilot indigenous preparatory courses. The assessment would track the academic
performance of students participating in the program and examine the social impact through the
perceptions of participating students and professors. Moreover, the assessment would reflect
lessons learned and recommend ways to improve the social impact and scale up activities in the
secondphase.

Zndigenous scholarships. A study will be conducted under sub-component 1.2 to evaluate the
existing scholarship program for talentedbut poor indigenous students. The study would identify
issuespreventing success, and would suggest means for improvement and viable ways to expand
the coverage of the existing program and better targeting. In addition, the study would explore
possibilities for awarding students who performed well in the preparatory course and the PSU
exam a full scholarship with a cost-of-living allowance to study the material of their choice.
Upon completion of the study, the GoC would discuss with the Bank how to implement the
recommendations.

This annex profiles international experiences and discusses strengths and weaknesses in
approaches to results-basedfunding of tertiary education. The structure of the annex reflects the
phases involvedindesigninga results-basedfunding system. The first section discusses the need
for establishing data collection structures and identifies steps involved in selecting performance
criteria. Section two outlines strengths and weaknesses of design options drawing on examplesof
results-based funding systems in Africa, Europe, Latin America and North America. With a
complete evaluation model in place, section three reflects on how resources can be tied to
selected indicators. Section four discusses implementation issues when introducing a results-
based funding system. Finally, section five outlines possible finance reform options for Chilean
tertiary education inlight of international experiences.

1.Fundingtertiaryeducationinstitutionsbasedonresults
Results-basedfundingcan be definedas the allocation of resourcescontingent on achieved rather
than promised results. Tying funding to results departs from traditional considerations in tertiary
education of line itemexpenditures and inflationary increases. These constitute input factors and
disregardresults, such as graduation rates, learningoutcomes and the contribution of university
researchto society (Fielding 1999).

Performance management rests on the assumption that effective government cannot be achieved
within a classic bureaucratic framework of tight regulatory control of sources and methods of
production. The relationship between the government and public tertiary education institutions
can be described within the context of the principal-agent model. The providers of tertiary
education have more information about education processes than the government. The
government (the principal) therefore delegates part of the decision-authority to the institutions
(the agents). However, the information asymmetriesbetween the government and the institutions
can create agency problems: institutions can exploit their information advantagesto pursue other
goals. These agency problems typically arise when funding i s based on inputs or on historical
patterns. As the government cannot observe the effort of university staff, the system may
preserveinefficiencies andineffective programs.
                                                                    - .
A way to overcome such agency problems is to redesign funding systems, so that incentives of
the principal and the agents converge. This is the essence behind the idea of results-based
funding. Governments should be tight on setting goals for tertiary institutions and assessing
results and provide flexibility on the methods usedto achieve these ends. Thus, decision makers
would assume a `stimulative and facilitative' role centered on incentive-induced-change rather
thancontrol andprescribe actions at the decentralized level (WindhamandPeng 1997).

1.1Buildingsystemsfor results-basedfunding
Tertiary education systems are of high complexity and cater to multiple objectives. Hence,
building a funding system without perverse incentives or unintended consequences requires


                                                 69

careful consideration of design options. Perfection is unlikely to be ensured in the design phase
andprogressis oftenbasedontrial anderror duringimplementation.

The impact of incentive driven institutional change i s contingent on the tailoring of components
to fit national and systemic characteristics. Even when an administrative culture has become
obsolete or dysfunctional it remains necessary to understand its institutional roots to secure
durable improvements. Equally important, administrative capacity limitations and other
institutional constraints must be taken into account when designing funding systems (Schiavo-
Campo 1999).

Kusek and Rist (2002) propose adjusting the complexity and ambition of a results-based funding
system based on a `readiness assessment'. Performing such an assessment gives reforming
agencies an understanding of what institutional capacity they do or do not have and what
resource can be drawn upon to initiativereform. A `readiness assessment' can also help to clarify
where reforms might begin, under the auspices of who and what demand exists for the use of
collected information.

1.2 Informationsystems
As governments begin to address the challenges of results-basedfunding, they face the need to
document performance with valid and reliable information. Allocating resources based on
institutional performance presupposescredible and timely national and institutional statistics on
a wide range of indicators. Without a good information system no basis exists for evaluating
institutional performance. When reliable data are lacking, the priority must be to builda data and
monitoring capability before considering the introduction of results-based funding (Schiavo-
Campo 1999).

Establishing structures for data collection often involves designing computer systems that
standardize information and reduce the administrative burden of handling large quantities of
data, Some of the elements that need to be addressed are responsibilities for data collection,
reporting and evaluation of collected information. Since institutions will be funded based on
collected information, systems needbuild in safeguards and structures for external validation of
data. National auditing agencies are often well-positioned and sufficiently independent to carry
out this task.

Given the complexity of getting reporting structures right it may improve changes of success if
performance reporting precedes results-basedfunding. Requiring tertiary institutions to present
periodic reports on priority indicators prior to the introduction of results-based funding
familiarizes institutions with data collection and establishes a reliable baseline from which
institutional performance canbe assessed.

1.3 Selecting indicators
The process of identifying indicators goes to the heart of designing a results-based funding
system. As pointedout by Burke(2001) "what gets measuredis often what gets valued, and what
gets funded i s even more prized".

Indicators are most effective when they mirror the government's strategy for change in the
tertiary education sector. A strategy implies the movement of the sector from its current stage to
a desirable but uncertain future stage. Because the sector has never been to this future position,
its intended pathway involves a series of linked hypotheses. In the Chilean Science for the


                                                70

Knowledge Economy Project, prioritizing outcomes and makingkey hypotheses explicit was an
important first step in selecting indicators. Ideally, indicators should reflect the aspects of the
tertiary education sector that, if improved, are presumed to result in the achievement of general
goals such as equity, efficiency andquality (Niven 2002).

Indicators come in four types: Inputs involve the human, financial and physical resources
received to support programs, activities and services, such as funding, enrollments and staffing.
The performance criterion corresponding to inputs is economy, i.e., the timely acquisition of
quality inputs at the lowest possible cost. Processes are the manner inwhich inputs are procured
and the means by which results are delivered. Processes are internal to an institution and include
teaching methods, the use of technology and procurement. Process indicators can be useful
proxies for performance when output or outcomes cannot be definedwith clarity.

Outputs reflect the quantity of products produced such as the number of graduates or the
number of research articles published. The performance criterion corresponding to outputs is
eflciency, Le., maximizing the quantity of outputs in relation to a given total amount of inputs.
Outcomes cover the quality and societal impact of the products produced. Outcome indicators
include learning results, job placements and user satisfaction. The performance criterion
corresponding to outcomes i s eflectiveness, Le., maximizing outcomes in relation to the outputs
produced (Schiavo-Compo 1999).

Each type of indicator reflects a tradeoff between accountability and measurability. Focusing
exclusively on inputs and processes facilitates the monitoring of what and how means are used
but neglects the purposes for which resources are obtained. Output indicators are relatively
simple to observe and quantify but may be only vaguely associated with societal impact.
Outcome indicators are generally more relevant, but also less useful for assigning
responsibilities. For most purposes it i s preferable to rely on a combination of indicators rather
than focusing on any single measure. Yet, an abundance of data adds complexity, and risks
makingthe performance system unwieldy and difficult to understand. Hence, most results-based
funding systems attempt to strike a balancebetween manageability andcomprehensiveness.

2. Designoptions international cases
                   -
Significant variety exists between countries in the methods and processes applied to select the
criteria by which tertiary institutions are evaluated. Although all contain idiosyncratic details,
systems can be classified into two categories: System-wide fixed set of indicators where little
change is introduced over time on the criteria used to evaluate institutions and fixed-term
performance contracts with explicit evaluation criteria, periodically negotiated between the
supervising agency andeach tertiary institution.

2.1 Fixed set of indicators
For performance systems with a fixed set of indicators, a distinctioncan be made between simple
criteria systems where institutions are evaluated based on one or two indicators and multiple
criteria systems with several indicators. France, Denmark and the Netherlands are examples of
countries basing a significant part of institutional funding on a simple criteria system. Countries
operating a funding system with multiple performance criteria include the United States and
South Africa.




                                                 71

2.1.1 Simple criteria systems
The Frenchtertiary education system receives about 50 percent of its funding based on a simple
input formula. Fundingis tiedto the numberof students enrolled while adjusting for variance in
expenses per students in different careers. Calculated funding is allocated to institutions as a
lump-sum,which provides tertiary institutions with significant budgetary autonomy.

The main advantage of the French system is the simplicity of the funding criterion. As pointed
out, input indicators make it relatively unproblematic for decision makers to track spending and
allocate funding. The drawback, however, is weak incentives for universities to provide quality
education and ensureefficiency by avoiding delays instudent completion.

The Danishtaximeter modeluses a simple output criterion to determine the level of funding for
tertiary institutions. Depending on their research activities, institutions receive between 30 and
50 percent of their funding based on their educational production. For each student who passes
an exam an amount of money is paid to the university. The total of these "active" students
determines the available funding in a particular year. Universities do not receive compensation
for studentswho fail their exams or do not take exams.

The taximeter model promotes efficiency in the tertiary system by highlighting the need for
students to complete their coursework and progress inthe system. Hence, historically determined
budgetary slack i s dealt away with as institutions are only rewarded for their incremental
"production". The risk associated with the taximeter model i s the incentive of institutions to
artificially increase pass rates to receive more resources. To avoid decreasing educational
quality, the model depends on the existence of a strong quality assurance mechanism and deep-
rootedprofessional standards among university staff.

The Dutch funding system allocates about 50 percent of public funding for university teaching
based on an output criterion. Whereas the focus in Denmark i s exams passed, the Dutch system
rewards student degree completion. To avoid unintended fluctuations in funding, resources are
allocated based on two-year averages of the number of graduates. An important feature of the
Dutch system is that the macro-budget for the university sector is determined before deciding on
the distribution of resources to individual institutions. Hence, the formula does not imperil
budgetstability.

The Dutch funding system provides a strong incentive to dismiss incapable students as soon as
possible and to assist talented students in graduating without delay. The simple performance
criterion makes it transparent to institutions how they will be evaluated and thereby facilitates the
adoption of long-term strategies to reduce university dropouts. However, as is the case in the
Danish and French tertiary funding system, the evaluation criterion does not by itself cater
multipleobjectives such as quality, relevance and equity.

2.1.2 Multiple criteria systems
The U S state of Tennessee applies multiple performance criteria to about 6 percent of the core
budget for tertiary education. The funding system consists of four standards and ten indicators,
each given a certain weight. Built into the system are provisions that allow institutions to be
evaluateddifferently based on the type and duration of their degrees. An important characteristic
of the funding system is that universities are competing against their own record. Hence, a
university is not advantaged by the poor performance of another institution. The system is



                                                 72

revised every five years andeach revision gives the state as well as the universities a chance to
decide on new policies and changes inthe nature and number of indicators (Bogue 2002).

The implementation of the Tennessee model has been assured through the involvement of
institutional and government officials in the funding procedure, thereby giving all levels a sense
of ownership to the system. In the 1997-2002 cycle, campuses were for instance permitted to
choose two performance indicators, one related to their own educational interests and one
directed to the State's strategic goals. Yet, the systemhas been criticizedfor involving too many
people and using an excessive amount of resources on calculating indicators that are of limited
use intertiary institutioninternal decision-making (Bogue 2002).

The South African funding model - applied to 89 percent of the core budget for tertiary
education - is another example of a multi-criteria approach. Block grants for public tertiary
education are divided into four categories reflecting teaching, research and specific institutional
issues. The Ministry of Education publishes an annual statement, which determines how
performance criteria will be calculated and weighted. This provides clarity to institutions on how
they will be evaluated while ensuring a degree of flexibility despite the use of pre-selected
indicators.

An interesting feature of the South African model is the operation of a competitive fund for
institutional development to supplement the multi-criteria funding system. Critics of results-
based funding often charge correctly that removing resources from institutions with poor
performance will only make improvement more difficult, if not impossible. In South Africa,
under-performing institutions are not necessarily destined to declining budgets. By gaining
access to earmarked competitive funding, these institutions have an opportunity to improve
themselves by financing institutional restructuring.

Multiple-criteria funding can cater multiple objectives and can consequently be used as a driver
for specific, high-priority tertiary education policy components. In contrast to simple indicator
systems, multiple criteria make it easier for policy makers to ensure a balanced sector
development and avoid unintended consequences. However, multiple criteria formulas may
result in a complex and opaque funding system. When providing incentives to the decentralized
level, simplicity may sometimes provide the greatestbenefits.

2.2 Performance contracts
Results-based funding based on performance contracts i s a flexible design where evaluation
criteria are negotiated between the supervising agency and each tertiary institution. Performance
contracts are institution specific rather than system-wide in their content and application. They
typically cover aperiod of 3-4 years.

Performance contracts have been used in France since 1989 - in addition to the aforementioned
simple input formula - where government adopted a system of university funding through
performance-centeredbudget dialogues. These dialogues lead to four-year contracts between the
government anduniversities.

Universities are asked to provide a self-assessment, and to present their plans for the next four
years. These plans form the basis for discussions with the Ministry of Education. In this
dialogue, goals and evaluation criteria are identified and agreement i s reached on how public
funding will be tied to results. The contracts are not legally bindingdocuments but "reciprocal


                                                  73

commitments", which serve as a reference to make decisions within the university system. In
2000, 188 institutions representing 75 percent of total tertiary enrollment were involved in
contract funding (CHEPS 2001).

The contractual budget comprises on average about a third of total public subsidies for tertiary
education. The impact on decision-making processes has been substantial. Notably, the contract
regime has prompted the development of tools for expenditure analysis and management
information systems to support institutional improvement processesand planning (Musselin and
Mignot-Gerad 2002).

Performance contracts have been met with some resistance from within French universities. In
part, this reflects a lack of performance dialogue with heads of faculties and departments that are
responsible for delivering agreed results. Performance contracts are agreements between
university presidents and the Ministry of Education (Musselin 2002). As Burke and Minassians
(2002) point out - drawing on experience from the United States - a key problem is that
performance criteria tend to become increasingly invisible on campuses below the level of vice
presidents, because of the failure to extend performance funding and reporting to internal
academic units.

Finland has prioritized consultation in the contract negotiation phase through an intensive
budget dialogue involving lower management levels and regular reporting between universities
and the Ministry of Education duringthe contract period.

Prior to performance contract negotiations, universities send in proposals including an activity
and a finance plan for a three-year period. This launches a process of consultation where the
Ministry of Education and universities identify targets and evaluation criteria. Ministry officials
and university staff, inter alia, interact in unofficial seminars and meetings in order to take
account of institutional and disciplinary views and ensure transparency and predictability in the
negotiation process (Holtta and Rekila 2003).

The Finnish performance contracts include both general goals for the tertiary education system
such as quality, impact of education and total number of offered degrees as well as specific goals
for the individual institution.

Funding based on performance contracts gives wide room for political maneuverability and
prioritizationof high profile government policy. While this impairs institutionalplanning beyond
the contract period, it caters for political necessities and ensures system endurance. Performance
contracts offer a significant degree of flexibility to take account of idiosyncratic characteristics
and needs when tertiary institutions are few and differences between them arelarge.

A notable feature of performance contracts is the high demand they place on the capacity of
supervisory authorities to engage in an evidence-based dialogue with institutions. Without a
strong counterpart, information asymmetries may lead to under-performance, as institutions are
able to press for undemanding targets. Hence, if sufficient steering capacity at the central level
does not exist, funding tied to a fixed set of system-wide criteria is likely to be more effective
thancontractsindrivinginstitutional improvement.

3. Rewardinginstitutionsbasedonperformance
Inaddition to agreeingon the criteria that will be usedto assess institutionalperformance, aneed
exists to decide how and what proportion of resources will be tied to results. Inconsidering how
institutions should be rewarded or penalized basedon their performance, Burke and Minassians
(2002) have introduced a useful distinction between performance funding and performance
informedbudgeting.

Perj4omzance funding ties public funding directly and tightly to the performance of tertiary
institutions on one or more predefined indicators. The tie is automatic and formula-based. If a
university achieves a set target on an indicator, it receives a specific amount of performance
funding. By contrast, perj4omzance infomzed budgeting allows policy makers and administrators
to consider institutional achievement on performance indicators as a guiding factor in
determining resource allocations. The link in performance informed budgeting is loose and
discretionary (Burke and Minassians 2002).

Performance funding and performance informed budgeting each has strengths and weaknesses.
Performance funding offers a high degree of predictability and provides high power incentives
for institutions to perform. Funded institutions know precisely how their performance will be
evaluated and which aspects of their institution need to be strengthened in order to obtain
additional resources. Hence, performance funding allows long-time planning and creates a stable
environment in which institutions can improve. Performance informed budgeting, on the other
hand, provides weaker incentives to performsince achievedresults are only considered indirectly
inthe resourceallocation process.

The profiled strengths and weaknesses are reversed when considering system endurance.
Performancefunding does not allow discretionary policy decisions to be made in light of budget
constraints or political necessities. With budget shortfall and high institutional performance, the
system may not endure as decision makers would not be in a position to reward institutions
according to the agreed formula. B y contrast, performance informed budgeting provides more
flexibility to control aggregate spending and maintain the funding system despite changes in
economic or political circumstances. A loose tie between funding and performance appropriately
reflects that budgeting i s inherently political, and legislators are often reluctant to cede their
budgetary discretion to a "rational" performance-basedbudgetingsystem (Moynihan 2003).

The described funding types are not mutually exclusive. Designing a system with elements of
both performance funding and performance budgeting allows the tertiary education system to
achieve the benefits andcounter some of the problems of each approach. Inthe UnitedKingdom,
for example, teaching and research are evaluated based on a fixed set of indicators. Yet, the
process of determining the scoring on each indicator - and inturn funding -%-not           entirely
quantitative and mechanistic. Qualitative peer review processes allow issues such as extra cost of
providing for certain types of students and the quality of research to be factored in when
assigningresourcesto tertiary institutions (HEFCE 2003).

3.1 Tying governmentsubsidiesto indicators
There are generally three methods by which performance funding can be determined based on
predefined indicators. First, institutions can be awarded a predetermined amount of funding for
each unit delivered. Examples of production units include enrollees and tertiary graduates.
Production unit allocations can be designed to compensate for differences inthe cost structure of



                                                 75

tertiary programs. However, unit-cost mechanisms are rarely able to take account of changes in
the marginal cost that accompany fluctuations in enrollment. Second, funding can be tied to the
degree an institution reaches agreed targets. Full goal achievement triggers a predetermined
ceiling amount whereas results below the targets are rewarded with a fraction of this amount.
Tying funding to target achievement rely on a strong capacity at the level of the Ministry of
Education to set ambitious, but realistic targets. Finally, funding can be allocated according to
inter-institutional benchmarking where institutions are funded according to their relative scoring
on selected indicators. On each indicator, the institution that performs the best determines the
target. A predetermined cap amount is tied to the best achievement, and a fraction of this amount
will be allocated to institutions according to their relative goal attainment.

Per production unit and degree of target achievement performance allocations install strong
incentives for performance that are easy to communicate to internal stakeholders. However, they
presuppose reliable and timely baseline data. Funding tied to inter-institutional benchmarking
creates an element of competition between public institutions and introduces flexibility into
institutional funding systems. Nonetheless, benchmarking does not allow for institution specific
indicators and makes it less transparent for institutions what will trigger additional resources.

3.2 Weighingindicators
Results can be ranked by assigning weights to indicators. This allows supervising authorities to
promote specific institutional objectives while placing less emphasis on others. Hence, weights
offer flexibility since they permit political priorities to be reflected in the allocation of funding.
Weights may also accommodate for changing priorities without opening discussions on
evaluation criteria.

While being politically attractive, weights risk undermining the importance of certain goals as
institutions focus their efforts on indicators with greater weights (Serban 1998). Moreover,
weights may disproportionately favor institutions that have already achieved high performance
on some indicators. Assigningequal, or almost equal, weights to all indicators i s likely to be less
contentious, but may trigger frequent changesto the battery of indicators.

3.3 Levelsof results-basedfunding
Allocating all resources on a performance basis may lead to significant variation in institutional
funding from one year to another. Budget instability is likely to work to the detriment of
improvement processes, as tertiary institutions would need to make dramatic adjustments to
fixed and variable cost structures in order to match the level of funding each year. Adjustments
imply the hiringof faculty and staff in years where performance i s positive, and massive layoffs
in years when performance does not meet expectations. To avoid such fluctuations, most
countries limit performance funding to a predefined fraction of publicsubsidies for tertiary
education. This need not reduce incentives to perform, as the - in most cases - discretionary
nature of results-basedfunding gives tertiary institutions an incentive to pursue it.

Concern about budget stability often leads government to tie performance funding to additional
money, that is, fundingthat comes on top of the base budget tertiary institutions would receive in
any given year. This approach i s vulnerable to budget cuts, as alternative funding programs are
often the first to be suspended. Introducing results-based funding as a fraction of institutional
base budgets likely increases the impact on institutional performance and reduces the system's
vulnerability to budget cuts. Nonetheless, performance driven cuts to base budgets - as pointed



                                                  76

out - may require painful adjustments to cost structures from year to year. Also, this approach
may be met with strong resistancein the design and implementation phase, as more stakeholders
stand to lose from low institutional performance (Serban 1998).

4. Implementation
Implementing a performance-basedfunding system goes beyond technicalities. Even a carefully
tailored design may fail if it does not rest on some degree of support from key stakeholders.
Tertiary institutions are generally populated with well-articulated individuals, some of which
stand to lose from changes in funding structures. Hence, developing an implementation strategy
with explicit assumptions and contingency plans increasesthe likelihoodof success.

Three methods exist for initiating results-basedfunding: (a) legislation mandates the system and
specifies evaluation criteria; (b) legislation mandates the system and establishes the framework
for decision-makers and institutional management to agree on indicators and reward
mechanisms; and (c) supervisory authorities in collaboration with institutional management
voluntarily agree on andadopt a new results-basedfunding system (Burke andMinassians 2002).

Mandated systems provide clarity and commit policy makers to systemic changes. While
mandated systems institute a system on paper, they risk undermining program sustainability if
they are imposed from above and ignore the importance on consulting stakeholders. No
consultation generally means no consent and ownership at the decentralized level to results-
basedfunding.

Resistance can be expected from groups that stand to lose from reform. Notably, the success of
changes to the financing of tertiary education depends on the incentive system and the way
incentives are shared. Financing reforms are generally most successful when members of the
dominant, or powerful group are convinced that they will benefit and those who are adversely
affected are less influential (Varghese 2004).

Resistancemay also arise from those that will be better off as a result of the reform. Perhaps this
group i s not well informed, or dislikes change and uncertainties. Thus, informationand actions to
demystifying suggested changes to institutional funding i s important in the preparatory phase.
One strategy to garner institutional support i s to introduce performance funding, at least for the
first few years, as additional funding for tertiary education.

Prior to nation-wide introduction, results-basedfunding models can often be improved through
small-scale experiments. Pilots and phased implementation create opportunities for further
refinement and adaptation of the mechanism and scaling up based on evidence and lessons
learned. Specialized training in data collection, reporting and analysis may be needed in tertiary
institutions and ministries prior to implementation. Also, management structures may need to be
updatedto operate the system. Careful specification and a commonunderstanding of all elements
of the system are key to success. Clearly defined responsibilities make it apparent to everyone
involved what, when, how and by whom performance data will be collected and reported to
supervisory authorities.

5. Optionsfor results-basedfundinginChileantertiary education
The critical importance of tertiary education in a knowledge-based society suggests a need for
strengthening linkages between the funding of institutions and achieved results in Chilean
tertiary education. First, results-based funding would provide Chilean policymakers with an


                                                  77

opportunity to balance increased accountability with institutional improvement. Second, funding
by results may increase the efficiency and transparency of the market for tertiary education in
Chile. Finally, tying incentives to political priorities would serve as an effective driver for
addressingkey sector issues.

The educational sector is no stranger to transparency andevaluation. Chile has a long tradition of
openness about learning outcomes and responsiveness to comparative evidence from abroad. In
tertiary education, a mechanism was recently established to fill information gaps on the labor
market outcomes of graduates. In addition, accreditation processes have provided tertiary
institutions with important diagnostic tools and a small fraction of direct public support i s
already tied to performance. Hence, Chile is in a favorable position to take the next step toward
funding by results.

The current concentration of public subsidies and student loans in traditional universities (see
Annex 1)can be understood inhistorical terms. Yet, it is important to evolve the funding system
toward a system that relates public subsidies more closely with results. When considering design
options, Chile would be able to draw on a rich base of international experiences and good
practices inresults-basedfunding.

One of the main prerequisites for funding by results i s the existence of a system for collecting
and reporting performance information. Although universities and the Ministry of Education
collect some statistics, significant effort would need to go into building necessary information
structures with build-in verification procedures and safeguards (see sub-component 1.3).

A simple taximeter designdoes not suffice. Chile is faced with several sector issues that concern
more than efficiency and dropouts (see section A). Multifaceted sector issues require complex
responses, which should be mirrored by the incentive structure established by the funding
system. Multiple-criteria funding can be used to drive the implementation of reforms, e.g.
pertainingto equity and curricula reform.

Any funding methodology will need to recognize that there are major differences between
Chilean tertiary institutions interms of size, offered degrees and cost structure. The University of
Chile, for example, has the responsibility for the National Seismology Center. The financing of
such a center should not be basedon the educational performance of the Department of Geology.

Given the heterogenic nature of Chilean tertiary education, a contract design may be most
effective and manageable. Performance agreements, with periodic adjustments, can be tailored
closely to institutional specifics and linked to sector priorities (see sub-component 2.2).
However, contracts will require capacity building in the Ministry of Education - beyond the
current capacity in the Higher Education Division - for analyzing data andeffectively
negotiating evaluation criteria andtargets (see component 1).

Results-based funding may strike hard in institutions far from the frontier of knowledge.
Maintaining a competitive fund for tertiary education with rigorous review processes would
allow underperforming institutions to improve themselves by obtaining time-limited funding for
institutional restructuring (see sub-component 2.1).

To buildconsensus for reform, performance funding could initially have an element of additional
funding for tertiary education. However, a lasting impact in the sector requires that results-based



                                                  78

funding be applied to a significant proportion of the base budget. Hence, the success of
performance funding in Chilean tertiary education is closely tied to a reform of direct public
support.

Adopting a model of performance funding - rather than performance informed budgeting -
would mark an important change in the funding for tertiary education in Chile. Tying funding
directly andtightly to performanceprovides transparency and predictability. Reaching agreement
beforehand on a fixed macro-budgetwould ensure stability inthe budget for tertiary education.

Changes in the funding of the traditional universities would likely meet resistance from both
political interests and students. Therefore, a pragmatic approach, buildingthe case for legislative
action slowly and on the basis of results rather than more radical immediate reforms, may be the
only way to ensure a real impact inthe university system (cf. the proposedphasedapproach).

Piloting agreed designs in a few tertiary institutions with reliable statistics would allow the
systemto be refined and improved before being applied to the entire sector. Particularly, it could
be tested how best to encourageinstitutions to establish internal structuresof accountability. That
way agreedperformance criteria and targets would be visible and have an impact below the level
of top university management.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

The aim of this letter is to inform you of the higher education policy and strategic objectives of
the Government of Chile that will provide the framework for Chile's move towards a
knowledge-based economy and continued investments in higher education through the Tertiary
Education Finance for Results Project (MECESUP 2). This new project will build on actions
launched under the Higher Education Quality Improvement Program (MECESUP l),            supported
by IBRDLoan4404-CH.

Policy Objectives
Free trade and globalization open a world of opportunity for Chile to the degree that we have the
capacity and the skills necessary to reap the benefits from this process. Higher education
institutions are central to responding to the challenge of educating people for this new reality -
individuals who can create, use and disseminate knowledge. Therefore, it is essential to continue
the reform process of Chilean higher education. In concrete terms, this implies educating
growing segments of the population in different stages of their lives, making profound changes
in undergraduate teaching to open education and increase curricula flexibility, and deliver
general and cross competencies that are essentialfor the 21* century.

According to population projections and past growth in higher education enrollment, it i s
expectedthat a growing fraction of the adult populationwill demand tertiary studies. To keep up
with demand, tertiary institutions would have to offer an estimated one million places by the year
2012. This would meanreaching a total coverage of 50 percent among the 18- 24 age cohort.

The university system still has important deficiencies in the organization of studies, caused by
the transition to mass education and structural weaknesses in curriculum management, which
have perpetuated excessively long and rigid programs with low teaching efficiency and



                                                80

insufficient consideration of the final users. Similar scenarios have been recorded elsewhere,
such as the European Union, where a comprehensive process of curricula redesign - known as
the Bologna Process - has been launched. Chile would benefit from similar efforts and has
accordingly begun experiments with curricula redesign through the MECESUP 1 Competitive
Fund.The MECESUP2 program wouldbuildonlessonslearned from theseefforts.

At present, higher education quality is a concerninmost countries of the world. A new law for a
Higher Education National Quality Assurance System, currently under review in the Chilean
legislature, would establish a set of norms that would allow tertiary education careers and
institutions to be reviewed andaccredited. For that purpose, a Higher Education Observatory will
beimplemented andwill buildon successfulexperiencessuch as the Employment Observatory.

Sustained economic and social development in Chile demands institutional strengthening that
guarantees pluralism and tolerance, offers youth equal access opportunities and contributes to
Chile's social and territorial integration. To this end, it is important to find an appropriate
balance between institutional autonomy andpublic accountability. The new project would launch
a new phase in institutional development through performance agreements for institutions
receiving direct public funding. This mechanism will be explored as a pilot project in the
MECESUP2 program.

Chile's transition to a knowledge-based economy i s impeded by the lack of advanced human
capital and an inadequate national scientific and technological capacity for innovation. The
Government of Chile has begun addressing this problem through the World Bank supported
Bicentenary Science and Technology Program (Loan CH-7172). This project seeks to strengthen
S&T policies, improve Chile's science base and enhance public-private linkages. The
MECESUP 2 program will be duly coordinated with this initiative through its investments in
graduateeducation and advancedhuman capital.

Project Objectivesand Scope
The Tertiary Education Finance for Results Project forms part of the Government's efforts to
support Chile's transition to a knowledge-based economy. The initiative i s aimed at providing
Chile with the skills necessary to increase its global competitiveness, to sustain economic and
social development, and to ensure that no talent will be lost due to differences in learning
opportunities. Specifically, the goal is to increase the effectiveness of public funding for tertiary
education by enhancing coherence, responsiveness, equity and quality in the system, through
stronger accountability for performance.

In spite of significant advances made under the MECESUP 1 Program (Loan 4404-CH), key
structural weaknesses remain that should be faced with determination: (i)   intefiiaEneXciencies,
in teaching and institutional management; (ii)   inequities in the access to higher education; (iii)
heterogeneousquality of tertiary education, with very different institutional academic capacities;
(iv) limited articulation between education levels; and (v) lack of remedial education and
students' mobility.

Addressing these issues will require a long-term approach. For this reason, the MECESUP 2
Project is aimed to be a continuous effort towards the year 2011. The program is structured as a
two-phasedadjustable program modality (APL) with a duration of 6 years: Phase 1for the 2005-
2008 period, which i s the responsibility of the current Government, and Phase 2, for the 2009-


                                                 81

2011period, which will be handedover to the next administration. The programmatic approach
provides the flexibility to take into account lessons learned before replicating and making larger
scale investments and the opportunity for the new Government to adjust specific objectives.

As a preparation towards Phase 2, the Government has set the following goals: (i)       statistical
compendium containing updateddata on tertiary education publishedby MINEDUC; (ii) least   at
2000 students enrolled in supported preparatory programs; (iii)  increase in the share of students
from income quintile 1and 2 intraditional universities from 18 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in
2007; and (iv) the first two-year cycle of performance agreements completed in at least 4 state
universities.

This Project will buildon the experiencesandoutcomesachievedby the MECESUP 1Program:
   0    to prepare a curriculum renovation of Chile's university undergraduateprograms, and in
        particular of pedagogies, which contemplates both the structure as well as the length of
        tertiary education programs;
   0    award academic innovation sub-projects by means of a competitive fund and implement
        institutionalperformance agreementson an experimental basis;
        support doctoral postgraduate programs and participation in national and international
        knowledge networks ina continued way.

To these aims, the proposal is to allocate resourcesto academic renewal and upgrading, curricula
redesign based on results and competencies, innovations for better teaching and learning,
equipment for research, strengtheningof technical and graduateprojects and a limitedpercentage
of biddable resourcesfor infrastructure.

This will allow us to lay the foundation for:
   0    development of a financing systembasedon performance agreements;
   0    implementation of a curriculum structure for higher education and of a system to transfer
        and accumulate academic credits that will allow students' national and international
        mobility; and
   0    consolidation of the improvement of the quality of the tertiary education offer and its
        permanentinnovation.

In summary, the MECESUP 2 project will buildon prior reforms and apply a long-term vision
with the ultimate goal of improving higher education and provide the human capital that supports
Chile's transition into aknowledge-basedeconomy.

Yours sincerely,
