MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECU ]WVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPIUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A PUBLIC WORKS AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Mali for SDR 14.7 million, the equivalent of US$20 milion, on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for public works and capacity building.
2.    Coumty/Sector Background. Mali's population growth rate is about 2.S% p.a. and is twice as
high In urban areas (5% p.a.). Rapid urbanization Is reflected in the Increasing urban-to-total population
ratio, which now stands at about 19%. Among urban areas, Bamako, the capital city, has experienced
the fastest growth (8% p.a.) and its population has reached the 850,000 mark. All this has led to intense
pressure on urban infrastructure and services while, at the same time, the reduced public sector
expenditure levels required by the on-going adjustment program have restricted the ability of central and
local governments to rehabilitate and maintain public facilities. As a result, there has been a deterioration
in the quality of urban life and, more generally, in the economic productivity of urban areas. Fast urban
population growth, slow economic growth and the progressive reduction in the size of civil service, have
intensified open urban unemployment (16% in 1988 in Bamako) and the development of an increasingly
important informal sector. If public funds were available, and less cumbersome procurement procedures
were used, the local construction industry would be well positioned to undertake a program of public
works, and create jobs in the process.
3.    Project Objectives. The Project's objectives are: (a) create temporary employment during project
implementation by means of labor-intensive technologies (wherever these are economically efficient), and
contribute to employment creation in the long run by showing that such technologies are indeed feasible;
(b) to increase the productivity of Bamako and its vicinity by means of a program of urgently needed,
small-scale public works; (c) to increase the capacity of the public sector to orient and manage efficiently
its demand for, and expenditures on, goods and services; to demonstrate the feasibility of less
cumbersome and more transparent procurement procedures and contract administration; (d) to improve
public procurement in general by strengthening the Direction Gdndrale des Marches Publics; and (e) to
strengthen the capacity of the private sector (particularly small and medium-sized contractors, informal
subcontractors, and consulting firms) to design, implement and supervise a wide range of public works;
and more specifically, to improve the individual skills of workers employed by contractors financed under
the project, in order to increase their long-term ability to respond to employment opportunities after
project completion. lbese objectives are important as they are specifically designed to alleviate the
pressure on urban infrastructure and services, to increase Government's capacity to rehabilitate and
maintain public facilities, while reducing urban unemployment by promoting and strengthening the local
construction industry.
4.    Project Descripion. The project consists of one major "hardware" component which, in terms
of cost, represents the bulk of the project, and several "software" components: (a) a program of essential,
small-scale public works aimed at rehabilitating and maintaining urban infrastructe (e.g., street repair
and paving, small-scale rehabilitation of public facilities, small drainage works, garbage collection, sewer
cleaning and sand removal) to be carried out by local contractors using labor-intensive technologies
(US$20.24M, 72% of project costs including cofinancing); (b) a package of technical assistance to be
offered to contractors in the areas of work organization, management and labor force training
(US$1.55M, 6%); (c) a training program to improve the capacity of local governments to identify



-2 -
subprojects, and the capacity of consulting firms to prepare feasibility studies and technical project
proposals (US$.28M, 1%); (d) a program aimed at increasing grassroots participation in urban
infrastructure maintenance (US$.25M, I %); (e) consulting services aimed at closely monitoring progress
under the project (US$.37M, 1 %); and (f) a procurement reform implementation component to train staff
in the DGMP and in the main technical ministries, and to provide needed equipment and consulting
services to help draft standard bidding and contract conditions (US$1.04 M, 4%). The executing
agency's operating costs (US$1.77M, 6%), the executing agency's capital budget for installation of the
accounting system  and audits (US$.37M, 1%), PPF refinancing (US$1.35M, 5%), and price
contingencies (US$1.OM, 4%) make up the balance of the total project cost of US$28.22 million. The
estimated costs and financing plan are given in Schedule A, the procurement arrangements in Schedule
B, page 1, and the disbursement arrangements in Schedule B, page 2. Germany has confirmed its
participation in cofinmcing the project by earmarking the equivalent of US$6M or 21 % of total p.o,ect
costs. Schedule C gives the project's preparation timeframe and staff involved.
5.    Project Implementation. The implementation of the project will be entrusted to an execuing
agency named Agence d 'Exution des Travaux d 'Iantit Public pour l'Emploi (AGET7PE-MAU). This
Agency was created in early March 1992 as a not-for-profit 'association"; it will operate as a private
entity with a small staff. The Agency's Procedures Manual, which at all times must be satisfactory to
IDA, establishes: the procedures whereby the Agency receives requests from the central or local
governments to execute specific subprojects; the procedures to be used by the Agency to classify
subprojects and prequalify construction firms; the procurement procedures it must follow, including
standard Bidding Documents and model Contract; the procedures to be used for subproject supervision
by consulting firms; the accounting and disbursement procedures required for individual subprojects; the
fnancial management procedures of the Agency; the nature and periodicity of reporting by the Agency;
the procedures to secure external auditing of the Agency; and its personnel management procedures. The
Government and the Agency have signed a Framework Agreement which describes the Agency's modus
operand4, and which includes the Procedures Manual as an integral part. Both are satisfactory to IDA.
The Agency's Director General has been identified and is also satisfactory to IDA.
6.    In order to begin project implementation immediately after credit effectiveness, five pilot
subprojects have been selected by the Government (with IDA's approval) and are being carried out unde.
PPF financing. During project implementation, the intended subproject beneficiaries will contractually
agree to transfer to the Agency all power and authority: (a) to review subproject proposals; (1) to select
subprojects to be executed; (c) to call for bids; (d) to review bids and award contracts; (e) to administer
contracts; and (f) to provide technical assistance to contractors. As a counterbalance to its considerable
autonomy and independence, the Agency will be audited ex post at regular intervals. In addition, the
Bank will conduct intensive project supervision, including review meetings with Government at least
twice a year and a formal mid-term project review.
7.    Project Sustainabil y. The project is likely to have a sustainable effect because: (a) it will help
strengthen and promote small- and medium-sized construction firms and the labor force, and the local
consulting industry, thus enabling them to respond to future demand for their services; (b) it will
demonstrate the feasibility of efficient public works execution and encourage the development of private
contract management services, thus helping increase the efficiency of public sector expenditures; and (c)
it will show the possibility of using labor-intensive technologies in the context of public works execution,
thus contributing to a reduction in the level of unemployment.

8.    Lessons Learnedfrom Previous IDA Inwlvement. Pour projects similar to the one proposed here
are currenty being implemented in Senegal, Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin. The Poblic Works and
Employment Project in Senegal (Cr. 2075-SE) has been under implementation for over two years, and
the experience derived from it has facilitated the preparation of more recent projects. The success of the
Senegal project Is evidenced in, among other things, the fact that: (a) contract unit prices quoted by
contractors are 15% lower than anticipated as contractors take into account the fact that they will receive
payments only ten days after submitting their invoices; and (b) about 37% of total amounts paid to
contractors are in turn paid out by them to workers in terms of salaries and wages. The lessons leamed
from the implementation of the Senegal project which are being addressed in this project include: (a) in
the procurement area, a post-qualification bid was introduced to take into account the remaining capacity
of the contractors in contract award as well as provide explanations for bids that are lower by 15 percent
than the reference price; (O) as experience has shown that government has been slow in disbursing
counterpart funding, a dated covenant bas been inserted relating the review of subproject batches to the
disbursement of Government's counterpart funding; (c) the trainng component for contractors has been
prepared early enough for it to be available right from effectiveness so that contractors have immediate
access to training; (d) a grassroots participation program has been incorporated; (e) that proposed
subprojects must not have a negative environmental Impact has been introduced as a criterion of
subproject eligibility and selection.
9.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Since 1988, the Government of Mali has implemented a
sustained adjustment program. Severe imbalances in public finance have been brought under control,
external and internal payment arrears have been cleared, inflation has been kept at a low level, and real
GDP has grown on average over three percent per annum. Despite the progress achieved, persisting
imbaWances in the distribution of public expenditure, together with the constaints on the total level of
govemment spending, imply that GOM has not been able to undertake many urgently needed public
works. For this reason, Government has requested IDA's assistance fbr the implementation of a program
of essential, small-scale public works to increase the productivity of Bamako and its vicinity. These
works are suitable for implementation by labor-intensive technologies and will, therefore, have a positive
impact on employment levels. This project is expected to provide many new opportunities for the local
private sector and will support effectively the reforms being carrih~d out at the macro level. IDA also
has fist-hand experience with similar situations in three other Sahelian countries, where public works
projects are rurrently under implementation. (Senegal, Niger and Burkina Faso).
10.   Agreed Actions. Agreement on the following was reached during negotiations: (a) agreement
on the terms of reference for the technical and managerial assistance package for contractors, the
information and training program for beneficiaries and consultants, and the program to ensure grassroots
participation, all of them acceptable to the Bank; (b) agreement on an Arrn*6 establishing the taxes and
duties to which contracts financed under the project will be subject; (c) agreement regarding Government
counterpart funding; and (d) agreement on the size and content of the procurement reform component.
The conditions of Board Presentation were: (a) that IDA has received an initial list of contractors and
engineering firms considered eligible, under the Procedures Manual, to bid for labor-intensive civil works
or services; (b) that the Articles of Agreement (Statuts) of AGETIPE-MALI and the Framework
Agreement (Convention) between AGETIPE-MALI and Government have been amended to the
satisfaction of IDA; and (c) that Government has sent IDA the signed Statuts and Convention, mentioned
in (b) above. The conditions of effectiveness are- (a) that an operational accounting system consistent
with the Procedures Manual and satisfactory to IDA has been set up in AGETIPE-MAI; (b) ta
AGETIPE-MALI has appointed and signed a contract with external auditors acceptable to IDA; (c) that



-4 -
IDA has approved an initial action plan for the technical and managerial assistance program to
contractors, and final action plans for the information and training program for beneficiaries and
consultants, and the program to ensure grassroots participation; (d) that IDA has approved an initial
program of selected subprojects representing an aggregate estimated cost of the equivalent of US$4.6
million or more; and (e) that an ArrOte on the exemptions granted under the Convention, satisfactory to
IDA, bas been signed by the relevant minister of the Borrower. The following agreements will be
reflected in the Development Credit Agreement: (a) that the Agency's Articles of Agreement and
Procedures Manual must be at all times acceptable to IDA; (b) that the Agency will af pt the final
version, acceptable to IDA, of the Action Plan for technical and managerial assistance to contractors no
later than six months after credit effectiveness; (c) that the Agency's Director General must be acceptable
to IDA at all times; (d) that the Agency will submit to IDA the second, third and fourth batches of
subprojects totalling at least US$6.7 million, US$7.4 million, and US$7.8 million no later than September
30, 1993, September 30, 1994, and September 30, 1995, respectively; (e) the Government will cause the
Agency to execute subprojects (other than those financed by the credit or by other donors) with an
aggregate cost of US$2.22 million equivalent before September 30, 1996, including intermediary bat6hes
of subprojects costing at least US$450,000 during the twelve months ending September 30, 1993;
US$600,000 during the twelve months ending September 30, 1994; and US$750,000 during the twelve
months ending September 30, 1995; (t) the Government will make available to the Agency, out of its own
resources, the fimds required for the execution of these subprojects; (g) IDA reserves itself the right not
to review the annual subproject batches submitted by the Agency if the Government has not honored its
counterpart funding obligation; (h) the nature, scope and precise timing of the mid-term project review;
and (i) Government and IDA will carry out an assessment of the implementation of the procurement
reforms no later than October 1993, the recommendations of which will be used to revise, if necessary,
the Procurement Code and its application measures. These revisions must be satisfactory to IDA and will
serve as a basis for further IDA financing for the procurement component.
11.   Environmental Aspects. 'Te cumulative impact on the environment of w%orks to be financed under
the project Is expected to be minor. In fact, many of the eligible subprojects will have a net positive
impact on the environment (soil and water conservation works, sanitation, tree planting, garbage
collection). To ensure that subprojects will not have a negative impact on the environment, an evaluation
criterion has been included in the Procedures Manual stipulating that proposed subprojectsjudged harmfil
to the environment will not be eligible for £Kecution. The project is classified as category C.
12.   Program Objective Categories. The project's employment creation aspects (particularly its
emphasis on labor-intensive technologies) will contribute to poverty alleviation. TMis positive effect wil!
be amplified to the extent that constmction firms subcontract part of their work to "firms in the informal
sector, where weaker adherence to labor regulations results in more employment at lower-wage levels.
While not targeting them specifically, the project will likely create employment among women organized
in local "groups", as is already the case with one of the pilot subprojects under implementation.
13.   Project BenefJs. The project will help reduce a significant backlog of econamic and social
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in Bamako and its vicinity. It will also help strengthen
private formal and informal construction firms, as well as consulting (engineering and architectural)
firms. The smooth operation of the Agency will have a demonstration effect and show a workable
alternative to traditional procurement procedures. Since the bulk of project-related expenditures will
cover local costs, this project is likely to have a greater multiplier effect on the local economy than other
projects. The project will also contribute to strengthening the Direction Gn6rale des Marches Publics



and to improving the public procurement system in general.
14.   Risks. The first major risk Is that the volume of employment created by the project may fall short
of expectations or be Insignificant when compared to the present level of urban unemployment. To
reduce this risk, a strong emphasis on labor-intensive technologies will be maintained throughout project
implementation. However, it is important to realize that Mali's overall unemployment situation canot
be solved by this project alone, but It will play an important role in helping to improve the present
situation. The second major risk is that the Agency may misuse its considerable independence. This risk
is reduced by the selection of an adequate Director General whose appointment will have to be at all times
acceptable to IDA. In addition, the proposed intensity of supervision and frequent external audits will
provide ample opportunity to deal with inadequate performance on the part of the Agency or with
Government interference. The third major risk is that local contractors and consulting frms may lack
the capacity required to implement the project on time. This risk is reduced by the fact that the project
has been carefully scal .t and spread over four years to take into account the absorptive capacity of the
industry. In addition, technical assistance and training components included in the project are expected
to increase the capacity of local contractors and consulting firms. However, this risk wUIl have to be
reassessed during the mid-tern review.
15.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
