                             Amendment No.3 to the Grant Agreement

            Dear Mr. Rawcliffe,

                     We refer to the Grant Agreement between the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
            Facility (“Recipient?) and the International Development Association (“World Bank?), acting as
            administrator of the CCRIF Trust Fund, dated April 26, 2007, for the CCRIF Project (the
            “Agreement?), as amended.

                    Pursuant to the letter from Milo Person, Executive Chairperson, CCRIF, dated August 22,
            2011, requesting the World Bank a transfer of the uncommitted balance in an amount of
            US$997,902.39 from the Multi Donor Trust Fund No. TF070721 to the above referenced Trust
            Fund, I am writing on behalf of the World Bank to indicate our agreement to extend to the
            Recipient an additional grant in an amount not to exceed nine hundred ninety seven thousand nine
            hundred and two Dollars and thirty nine cents (U.S. $997,902.39) for the Project on the terms and
            conditions set forth or referred to in the Agreement.

                  The World Bank therefore proposes to amend the first paragraph of the Annex to the
            Agreement as follows:

            By deleting in the first sentence of said first paragraph, the words, “an amount not to exceed
            seventy million United States Dollars (U.S. $70,000,000)?, and inserting in said paragraph the
            following: “seventy million nine hundred and ninety seven thousand nine hundred and two
            United States Dollars and thirty nine cents (U.S. $70,997,902.39)?.

                      All other provisions of the Agreement, as amended herein, shall remain in full force and
            effect.

                     Please indicate the Recipient’s agreement to the foregoing amendment by having an
            authorized official of the Recipient sign and date the enclosed copy of this Amendment No.3, and
            return it to the World Bank. Upon receipt by the World Bank of this countersigned copy, the
            Amendment No.3 shall become effective as of the date of the countersignature.
