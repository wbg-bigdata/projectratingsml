Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
From the Grant Agreement: “The objective of the Project is to help provide a better mechanism for dealing
with catastrophic risks initially in the Caribbean region by supporting an (sic) establishment and operations
of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (the Facility).? The outcome is that Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) member or associate member countries that participate in the Facility receive a
cash pay-out in the event of a hurricane or earthquake of an intensity and proximity that meet the
parameters of their respective policy.

SUMMARY

1. The purpose of this Level 2 Restructuring is to increase the amount of the Trust Fund
   CCRIF Grant Agreement (TF058302) from US$70,000,000 to US$70,997,902.39
   million by transferring to it US$997,902.39 from the Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF
   – TF070721), as requested by the Grantee. The MDTF, which is administered by the
   World Bank, was set up in 2007 with World Bank and other donor contributions1, for
   the express purpose of supporting CCRIF’s establishment, initial operations, and
   growth of financial capacity to provide hurricane and earthquake insurance to
   participating Caribbean countries and territories.

2. The MDTF received donor contributions equivalent to US$67.4 million. Interest
   income to the MDTF since then, net of administrative charges, has raised the amount
   to slightly less than US$71 million. CCRIF received an initial US$24 million grant
   from the MDTF on April 26, 2007. The CCRIF Grant Agreement was amended on
   November 11, 2008, to add a further US$26 million, and again on October 25, 2010,
   to provide an additional US$20 million. This final transfer of US$997,902.39 from
   the MDTF to the CCRIF Grant Agreement is the balance in the MDTF as of August
   31, 2011.

3. The Restructuring is consistent with the purposes of the MDTF, the terms of the
   Administration Agreements between the World Bank and the donors, and the
   purposes for which CCRIF was established. It does not entail any change in the
   CCRIF project development objective or outcome indicators. It is needed to ensure
   that sufficient funds are available to reimburse CCRIF, to the extent of available
   funds, for anticipated eligible expenditures – including certain administrative and
   R&D costs and its reinsurance premium – as well as potential policy pay-outs that fall
   within the level of CCRIF’s risk retention.


PROJECT STATUS


4. CCRIF was established to provide parametric hurricane and earthquake coverage to
   Caribbean countries and territories. The objective of the insurance is to enable the
   governments of the participating countries and territories to receive a rapid injection
   of liquidity in the wake of a hurricane or earthquake that meets the parameters of their
   policies. The pay-out to the government is intended to help it satisfy urgent
   expenditure needs while mobilizing donor and other resources necessary for the relief
   and longer-term recovery effort.

 In addition to the World Bank, the contributing donors were Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean
Development Bank, European Union, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

                                                  1
5. CCRIF is performing satisfactorily and there are no outstanding financial
   management, audit, or procurement issues in this recipient-executed trust fund. Key
   progress indicators include:

•   16 Caribbean countries and territories joined in 2007, double the number estimated to
    ensure a well diversified risk pool. All 16 have renewed coverage each year since
    then.2
•   CCRIF has steadily built its risk bearing capacity. Its audited assets totaled US$114.1
    million as of end-May 2011 (the end of its 2010-2011 fiscal year). This exceeds the
    US$100 million target that was established at CCRIF’s inception.
•   In addition, CCRIF has gained the confidence of major reinsurers and has each year
    been able to lay off a significant part of its risk to them at acceptable prices. For its
    current insurance year (June 1, 2011, to May 31, 2012), it obtained US$125 million in
    reinsurance, including a US$30 million capital market swap intermediated by the
    World Bank Treasury. With this, it has the capacity to withstand a 1 in 1,400 year
    event, without drawing on more than US$25 million of its own assets. Its assets in
    excess of $25 million are estimated to give CCRIF the capacity to withstand a 1 in
    10,000 year event, although it would require recapitalization thereafter.

•   CCRIF is fulfilling its role of providing a rapid injection of liquidity to the
    governments of those members whose policies have been triggered. Coming within
    two weeks of the event, payouts as of September 26, 2011, have totaled $32.2
    million, as shown in the table below.

•   In response to its members’ demands, CCRIF is developing an excess rainfall
    product to supplement its earthquake and hurricane policies.
•   CCRIF has initiated a technical assistance program in order to increase its value
    to its members. The program encompasses: (i) sponsorship for Caribbean
    participants in a range of training and professional development workshops and
    seminars on disaster risk management issues; (ii) data collection and analysis to
    strengthen members’ understanding of their vulnerability to climate change
    hazards and of cost effective adaptation measures; and (iii) some scholarships for
    undergraduate and post-graduate studies in areas related to disaster risk
    management and catastrophe insurance.
•   CCRIF has also established collaborative relationships with regional partners such
    as the Caribbean Community Secretariat, Caribbean Community Climate Change
    Centre, Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology, United Nations-
    Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Caribbean Disaster
    Emergency Management Agency, and the Disaster Risk Reduction Center at the
    University of the West Indies.
•   A beneficiary survey financed by the Bank in June 2011 revealed overall positive
    views of CCRIF. Appreciation was expressed for CCRIF’s attractively priced
    products, its technical assistance program, its flexibility and client-
    responsiveness, and its collaboration with other Caribbean institutions.

•   CCRIF has gained international prominence. It is invited to speak at conferences
    and symposia in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific on themes related to disaster risk
    management and catastrophe risk insurance. Its technical advice is sought
    regarding parametric products for agriculture, tourism, and utilities.
•   Risks to CCRIF’s on-going operations are low given its financial strength, its
    members’ continued interest in its products and services, and the broad
    appreciation within the region, including among partner institutions, for its
    contributions to disaster risk management and reduction.
