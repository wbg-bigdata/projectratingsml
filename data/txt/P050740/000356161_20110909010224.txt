1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background. At appraisal of the Health Sector Development Project
(HSDP), Sri Lanka‟s per capita income (US$830) was the second highest in South Asia
(behind Maldives), and its growth rate was close to 5.9 percent. In 2002, twenty three
percent of Sri Lankans were estimated to be living below the national poverty line, with
the poverty incidence highest among the rural population groups, and the conflict-
affected districts of the North and Eastern Provinces. With the end of the civil conflict in
May 2009 the growth rate and income per capita continued to grow rapidly and are
presently estimated at 8 percent and US$2,290 respectively.

Sri Lanka had good health outcome indicators at project preparation. Maternal mortality
ratio (MMR) (47 per 100,000 live births) and infant mortality rate (IMR) (12.2 per 1000
births) as well as the Human Development Index (0.74), life expectancy at birth (73
years) and literacy rate (over 90 percent) were comparable with more developed countries.
These outcomes were attributed to the widespread availability of primary health care
services and the high level of literacy. In spite of this, persistent maternal and child
malnutrition, substantial disparities in health outcomes, and a growing incidence of non
communicable diseases (NCDs) amidst a changing demographic profile were recognized
as the major challenges facing the health sector. Institutional and management weakness
in planning, budget formulation and monitoring were other factors identified to be
constraining service delivery.
Health sector program. The health program is guided by the Strategic Framework for
Health Development (2004 – 2015) and the Health Master Plan (2005 – 2015). The
government is both a financier and provider of health care, offering nearly 50 percent of
outpatient care, over 90 percent of inpatient care and almost 100 percent of preventive
services. The private sector predominantly offers outpatient services. The Provincial
Councils (PC) are responsible for managing primary and secondary facilities and
programs, while the central MoH is responsible for management of tertiary facilities,
pharmaceutical procurement, human resource development and deployment, and
formulation of policy and national guidelines. MoH divisions, the lowest administrative
units below the districts, are primarily responsible for the delivery of preventive health
care services. The health facilities are organized in a multi-tiered arrangement from
dispensaries and maternity homes to district general hospitals, provincial hospitals and
teaching hospitals.

Rationale for Bank assistance. Drawing on its global knowledge and expertise, the Bank
would help to re-orient the health system in light of the changing demographics and
epidemiological profile, to strengthen the budgetary process through the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and introduce a needs-based allocation formula to
redirect public funding to benefit the poor.




                                             1
Link to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The project objectives were consistent
with the 2003 CAS and its three central themes, peace, growth and equity. Under the
“peace? theme, the project was meant to contribute to restoration of health infrastructure
in the conflict-affected areas and under “equity? to transfer more resources for health to
the poorer areas with worse health indicators. The project was designed to contribute to
two CAS outcomes: (a) effectiveness in the use of existing resources improved; and (b)
decentralized sector management strengthened with greater focus on the needs of the
poor.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The development objective of HSDP was to improve efficiency, equity and quality of
health care by strengthening planning, management and monitoring capacity at the
district, provincial and central level with specific focus on supporting preventive care
services at the district and divisional level.

The following were the original PDO Key Indicators at the time of Board approval:
    Percentage of districts with IMR of 12.1/1,000 live births or lower;
    Percentage of districts with MMR of 46.9/100,000 live births or lower;
    Prevalence of anemia among pregnant women;
    Percentage of districts with injection-site abscess rate of 10/100,000 doses of
       DPT3 or less;
    Percentage of institutional deliveries in teaching, general and specialist maternity
       hospitals;
    Budget allocated to health is aligned with explicit sector objectives and targets

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was revised in June 2009 as part of project restructuring and additional
financing. The revised PDO was to contribute to improvements in efficiency, utilization,
equity of access to, and quality of public health sector health services in Sri Lanka, with a
particular focus on district and provincial level.

The key performance indicators were revised to:
    Bed occupancy rate by level of hospitals, (General hospitals and above);
    Bed occupancy rate by level of hospitals (Base hospitals and below);
    Proportion of lower level hospitals with emergency treatment units (ETU);
    Proportion of women over 35 years screened for cervical cancer;
    Proportion of pregnant mothers screened for anemia.

The PDO was revised to better reflect the focus on the provincial component. The
original PDO indicators were revised because these were viewed as “higher-order
indicators? - indicators that are affected by many factors within and outside the health
sector and whose outcomes cannot be attributed to the project. The revised set of PDO




                                              2
indicators (and the intermediate outcome indicators (see ICR Datasheet) were deemed to
be a more realistic measurement tool and to reflect the revised PDO and activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project would support health programs at the central, provincial and district levels
covering all 26 districts in Sri Lanka. The direct beneficiaries were health departments
and staff at central and provincial levels whose implementation capacity to deliver health
services to the population at large - the ultimate project beneficiary – was to be enhanced.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1. Support to district health authorities to improve service delivery and
outreach (appraisal estimate US$40 M; actual US$35.7 M). This component was to
support district health programs; especially the maternal and child health (MCH) network,
and those associated with NCDs. The major activities to be financed were capacity
building of district and provincial staff in planning and management; refurbishment of
health facilities and offices; provision of medical equipment and supplies; staff training;
and expansion of services through existing clinics and outreach. The district plans were
to be prepared based on identified gaps and activities executed under the coordination
and oversight of the PCs. Allocation of the component‟s resources amongst the provinces
and districts was to be based on an agreed allocation formula that took account of
population, vulnerability, health status and other relevant criteria.

Component 2. Support to central programs and hospitals (appraisal estimate US$14 M;
actual US$6.5 M). The component was to promote synergy across selected central MoH
programs - Family Health Program and Nutrition, Immunization and NCDs and Mental
Health - and their convergence at the provincial and district levels, with emphasis placed
on (a) improving capacity to deliver MCH and nutrition services; (b) immunization
service quality; (c) capacity building to deliver NCD; and (d) improving efficiency and
quality of hospital services.

Component 3. Support to policy making, budget formulation and monitoring and
evaluation (appraisal estimate US$8.9 M; actual US$1.86 M). The component was
meant to strengthen capacity for stewardship of the central health ministry in the areas of
policymaking, budget formulation and monitoring and evaluation. The following
activities: (a) improvement of the budget framework process; (b) Annual Health Forums;
(c) capacity building for a user-driven monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system,
household surveys and vital statistics; (d) development and implementation of a health
care waste management system; (e) review of the drug procurement and distribution
system; and (f) a feasibility study on alternative health financing were to be financed
under the component.

Component 4. Project Management (appraisal estimate US$6.3 M; actual US$4.52 M).
Project management-related activities, including upgrading District Health Authorities
into Program Management Centers (PMCs); strengthening planning, procurement and
monitoring capacity of the PCs; operations of the Project Management Secretariat (PMS);


                                             3
the design and implementation of a Monitoring Information System (MIS), as well as,
baseline, mid-term and end-term studies and issue-specific studies were to be financed
under this component.

1.6 Revised Components

The Bank approved the restructuring of, and additional financing for, the project (IDA-
45750) on June 23, 2009. The design of the central level components was simplified and
implementation arrangements were also streamlined. A Project Management Team
(PMT) was created and the PMS was absorbed within the MoH. Additional financing of
US$24 million was extended to (a) correct the funding shortfall created by the
reallocations (US$22.5 M) to the tsunami response and avian influenza threat; and (b)
respond to the emergency needs of post-war reconstruction of health services in the
conflict-affected areas. The provincial component was allocated US$23 million and the
central component US$1 million.

Component 1. Support decentralized health service delivery at provincial and district
levels (Additional Financing Estimate US$23 M; actual US$24.5M). The project under
the component would continue to support activities included under component one of the
original project. US$12 million was allocated to the conflict-affected Provinces:
Northern (US$10 M) and Eastern (US$2 M). The remaining US$11 M was allocated to
other districts and provinces based on the agreed formula which was already in use.

Component 2. Strengthening the stewardship functions of the central Ministry of
Health (Additional Financing Estimate US$1.0 M; actual US$1.1 M). The three original
central level components (2, 3 and 4) were consolidated and the activities scaled down,
with priority given to strengthening stewardship functions of MoH, including
development and effective use of evidence and information systems for policy, planning,
monitoring and management. The avian influenza subcomponent added during
implementation in 2007 was subsumed under this component.

1.7 Other significant changes

a) Reallocation of Grant proceeds: The tsunami of December 2004 affected 14 out of
   the 26 districts in Sri Lanka causing major destruction to life and physical
   infrastructure. A total of US$19 million was canceled from the grant and reallocated
   to a separate project in response to the tsunami. A further US$3.5 million was
   reallocated to a new component for avian influenza in 2007. Both actions seriously
   affected the original project‟s financing base.
b) Finance Commission: To align implementation of component one within the
   decentralized framework, the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) was amended in
   January 2006 to include the Finance Commission as the agency responsible for
   providing oversight to the PCs.
c) Closing Date: The Closing Date was extended from June 30, 2010 to December 31,
   2010 to ensure smooth completion of activities under the restructured project and to
   absorb Additional Financing provided.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation. The preparation of the HSDP was informed by the GoSL‟s Strategic
Framework for Health Development (2004 - 2015). The core project areas of focus were
consistent with the major development challenges facing Sri Lanka. Major stakeholders
from central government, medical associations, non government organizations (NGO)
and development partners (DP), as well as, provinces and districts, participated in project
preparation. Each of the nine PCs signed an agreement with IDA. A detailed Project
Operational Manual was prepared to guide implementation.

Project design. The project design relied on the use of government systems, which
worked well for the provincial component. The design was consistent with the devolution
arrangements in Sri Lanka; utilized the provincial structures, without creating parallel
implementing mechanisms, and provided the PCs with the freedom to plan their
individual programs. This was the first instance the Bank had financed sub-national
health activities in Sri Lanka. The innovation added to the project‟s complexity and risk.
The original PDO was too broad and not backed up by a realistic set of indicators. A
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) conducted in February 2004 lauded the diagnosis of
health sector problems, but noted that the PDO was broadly stated and that the project
scope was rather ambitious. The QER panel advised the project team to prioritize project
objectives to one or two key goals; to scale down the large number of subcomponents and
activities during appraisal; to focus primarily on systems development and institutional
capacity building; and to refine and better link the outcome/impact indicators to the
project development objectives and components. The project team adopted only the
recommendation on focusing on systems development and institutional capacity building
during project appraisal.

Individual MoH units/programs were responsible for the implementation of project
activities at the central level. However, the design of the central level components proved
to be complex and ambitious both in terms of content and scope of proposed activities.
The central level components comprised too many subcomponents and implementing
units, which did not properly coordinate with each another. The PMS established as the
de facto coordination unit to oversee implementation could not exercise technical
oversight over the project; it was placed outside the regular MoH structure and limited its
role to fiduciary matters.

Lending instrument. The project was financed by a sector investment loan. For the
provincial component, the project disbursed funds in a programmatic manner using
government fiduciary arrangements to finance approved annual district health plans.
The approach provided districts with flexible and predictable funding, as well as a
mechanism to monitor additionality of IDA resources. The districts were permitted to
carry forward unspent budgets to the following financial year.




                                             5
Lessons applied during project preparation. The following lessons informed project
preparation and implementation:
 Ownership of IDA-financed projects by the MoH had been a major constraint in
   earlier projects. To engender ownership, project design and operational arrangements
   were prepared jointly with the major stakeholders and great effort was made to build
   awareness and commitment for health reform among stakeholders, including the
   medical trade unions and provincial authorities.
 The use of traditional project management units (PMUs) in Sri Lanka has been
   characterized by problems of ownership and implementation bottlenecks and was
   rejected. A Project Management Secretariat, which later was changed to Project
   Management Team, was created in place of the traditional PMU.
 The success of donor-financed projects depends critically on continued engagement
   with government and other partners during implementation. The Bank strengthened
   its in-country technical and operational capacity for health, i.e., a national health
   specialist in the beginning and later an international health specialist.

Risk analysis. The following important risks were identified during appraisal: (a)
government‟s commitment to broader public sector reform may not be sustained, (b)
sector policies and strategies may not lead to anticipated improvements in health
outcomes, (c) priority health interventions supported by the project may not be sustained
by MoH, (d) disruption in the peace process could prevent project implementation in
conflict-affected areas, (e) support for a SWAp may not be sustained, (f) weak MoH
implementation capacity, (g) resistance to partnerships with Civil Society Organizations,
and (h) poor functioning of the health system. The risk mitigation measures were
generally appropriate. Many of the identified risks underscored the importance of
building national consensus for health reform and project ownership. A major risk missed
at appraisal was the complex governance arrangements at the central MoH in view of the
numerous programs, departments and units, which became a major bottleneck.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation capacity at the district level. The project helped to build capacity in
output-based planning and monitoring and to promote transfer of technical skills from the
center to the districts. The planning units established in the provinces, districts and
hospitals greatly contributed to institutionalizing the planning function. Those programs
with established structures and positions at provincial and district levels, such as MCH,
registered better performance compared with centrally managed ones, without similar
structures at the provincial and district levels. Towards the latter part of the project, other
programs such as the NCDs program established similar structures in the provinces and
districts.

Preparation of district annual workplans. The annual budgets for the provinces and
districts were developed as part of the government‟s budgetary process. The process
involved Bank review before final approval by the Finance Commission, which increased
workload and occasionally led to implementation delays. The preparation of annual
district health plans sometimes took place without sufficient coordination with the central


                                              6
MoH programs. Instances to renovate and/or upgrade existing health facilities without a
coherent plan to meet the service needs of the population were observed. As a result,
some newly renovated and upgraded facilities remained under-utilized for lack of
medical equipment, supplies and human resources. The need to align provincial level
investments with national development objectives and to ensure better coordination of
execution of district plans has been recognized. Resolution of the problem will require
reviewing and clarifying the present devolution for the sector.

Delayed restructuring of the project. A quality assurance group (QAG) assessment of
the project during supervision in June 2008 highlighted implementation difficulties faced
by the central level components, mainly because of the ambitious and complex design
and concluded the project was “a good candidate for restructuring at an early stage of
implementation?. The mid-term review recommended that the project be restructured, but
restructuring was finalized only in early 2009, which left only one year before Closing
Date. The delay was due in part to the uncertainty over the Government‟s willingness to
replenish the shortfall of US$22.5 million reallocated to tsunami and avian influenza
response.

Reallocations. A significant portion of the project‟s proceeds was reallocated early in the
project‟s life towards the tsunami emergency response and subsequently to confront the
avian influenza threat in 2007 without a clear plan on what activities to cut, creating
uncertainty regarding funding and disrupting implementation of central level activities.
Some of the originally prioritized activities were terminated prematurely citing lack of
funding. In a majority of cases, subcomponents were trimmed down to reflect previous
expenditures and irrevocable budgetary commitments, with the exception of mental
health where project support was terminated for lack of progress.

Simplification of original central level components. The simplification of the central
level activities and mainstreaming of project implementation within the MoH through the
newly formed Project Management Team contributed to improve coordination between
the MoH with the Finance Commission and the provinces and provision of technical
assistance by the MoH to the Provincial Authorities. Coordination difficulties persisted,
however, for some central level programs (e.g. nutrition with multiple structures).

The role of conflict. The escalation of conflict from 2005 until May 2009 had profound
effects on government operations. Nine out of the twenty six districts were affected by
conflict and faced significant implementation constraints. Several key positions
remained vacant because of the difficult working and living conditions. With the end of
conflict, the additional financing greatly contributed to meeting the health needs of the
conflict-affected districts during the resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
and improving the health infrastructure of the affected districts. In one year, the Northern
Province managed to absorb US$10 million and complete all planned reconstruction and
restoration activities.

Finance Commission. The Finance Commission ensured that project financing got
embedded within the government‟s fiscal decentralization framework and facilitated



                                             7
alignment of district plans to budgets. The Commission helped empower the provinces
and through them the districts to tackle important matters related to decentralization, and
to protect investments meant for the sector from being appropriated for other purposes.

Fiduciary support and competence of local contractors. The vigorous capacity building
efforts by government and Bank teams towards ensuring fiduciary compliance, especially
under the provincial component, greatly helped to resolve procurement and financial
management reporting problems, which had initially bogged project implementation. Sri
Lanka is also endowed with competent contractors at the provincial level, which enabled
the districts to undertake the extensive renovation works under the project.

Government ownership. The government demonstrated strong ownership of the MCH
and NCD programs and keen interest in output-based planning and improving capacity
for policy making. However, the leadership necessary to execute some critical reforms,
such as evidence-based budget formulation and annual health forums, and to ensure
stronger coordination of central level programs was wanting. Coordination among the
various units working on nutrition, health information, and programs dealing with NCD
remained a challenge throughout. Inefficient allocation of resources persisted as
evidenced by the continued better resourcing of centrally managed hospitals compared
with the lower level hospitals.

Human resources for health. The project experienced delays in appointment of staff to
critical positions, especially at the central MoH and selected positions in the provinces,
and high staff turnover experienced by the newly established planning units and other
units in the districts. The training program under the project, especially foreign training
was not implemented as envisaged and opportunities were missed out.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design. The design of the M&E system relied on
using the existing information system of the central MoH and the provinces
supplemented by specific progress monitoring reports, Registrar General‟s data and two
household surveys, at the beginning and end of the project. Data collection and reporting
modalities were already in place for a majority of indicators, although with delays
witnessed in compilation of vital statistics and Annual Health Bulletins. Only two PDO
indicators could be directly attributed to the project‟s investments and activities, namely
the percentage of districts with injection-site abscess rate of 10/100,000 doses of DPT3 or
less and the percentage of institutional deliveries in teaching, general and specialist
maternity hospitals. Three out of six PDO indicators (IMR, MMR and anemia
prevalence) were “higher order indicators? for which changes in the indicators could not
be attributed to project activities. Indicator number 6 was vague and could not be
measured. The revised PDO indicators after project restructuring were more realistic and
relevant to project design.

The choice of the intermediate indicators was reasonable. The indicators were relevant
and linked to project activities. Baseline data was largely present for the PDO indicators,
but absent for several of the original intermediate indicators. Annual and end of project


                                             8
targets were available for PDO indicators. The bulk of indicators measured the quality
dimension with a few measuring efficiency. With regard to equity, the PDO indicators
assessed district/regional disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. Owing to the
prominence given in the PAD, to the needs of certain population groups like the estate
workers, the impact of the project on these groups should have been monitored. The
revised PDO indicators did not explicitly measure the equity dimension.

M&E Implementation. The project strengthened capacity of major units responsible for
data collection and dissemination – Vital Statistics Unit, Medical Statistics Unit, Census
and Statistics Department – and initiated the establishment of a national nutrition
surveillance system. The government successfully conducted a Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) in 2006/07 and reduced the eight-year backlog on mortality registration to
a four-year lag. The original intermediate outcome indicators were not regularly
monitored during implementation, although the revised ones were regularly monitored.
Implementation of the project M&E system met many challenges, owing mainly to the
design of the sub-components, with each subcomponent operating separately with its own
set of outputs. Many of these units lacked qualified staff. The Management, Development
and Planning Unit (MDPU) of the MoH charged with coordinating project M&E
activities lacked authority to coordinate the activities across the different directorates of
the MoH. The M&E task force created to improve coordination did not resolve the
problems which persisted throughout the project‟s life.

M&E Utilization. Significant amounts of data get generated through the health
management information system, but use of information for planning and management is
limited. The project aim to reduce the delay in compiling the Annual Health Bulletins
from four years to under six months from end of the fiscal year was partly met (under two
years). The Annual Health Forums appeared quite promising in the beginning, but were
abandoned for lack of commitment by MoH leadership. However, there were cases
where districts and specific programs used data for evidenced planning. The project
supported community surveillance activities for prevention and control of selected
communicable diseases. The Family Health Bureau operates an effective system for
monitoring of the MCH program, but its success in operating its parallel information
system has become a hindrance to the government‟s efforts to harmonize and consolidate
the HMIS.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. The project triggered Operational Policy 4.01 on environmental
assessment due to potential adverse impacts of medical waste and associated construction
works. The National Policy and Guidelines on Health Care Waste Management were
prepared under a previous IDA-financed National HIV/AIDS Prevention Project. The
HSDP supported to institutionalize health care waste management in the MoH and to roll
out implementation in accordance with the regulations under the National Environmental
Act. Plans to establish a Health Care Waste Management Unit in the MoH are in progress
and budgetary provision is being made by the MoH and the provincial authorities. The
two centralized steam sterilizers installed to treat medical waste from the 10 largest
teaching hospitals in the Colombo Municipal area are now partly operational. The


                                             9
project mainly supported small scale renovation works of existing health facilities. In
addition, the project contributed significantly in addressing the IDPs.

Legal Covenants. All five key legal covenants were complied with although with some
delays in regard to the mid-term review (MTR) and the independent evaluation of
component one.

Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. Financial management arrangements of the central components
were generally in compliance with the covenants in the Grant Agreement, with
occasional delays in preparing financial monitoring reports consolidated from district and
provincial interim unaudited financial reports. The exception was 2007 when the
financial management arrangements were rated moderately unsatisfactory and the
Auditor General issued a qualified opinion on financial statements. The assessment of
financial management of the district component on the other hand was unsatisfactory in
the beginning, but gradually improved to satisfactory in 2009 after the main problem of
lack of proficiency by staff in financial management procedures was addressed.

Procurement. The MoH had procurement capacity, and management of central level
procurement was mostly rated satisfactory. The provincial component recorded major
limitations, especially in the first half of project implementation due to low procurement
capacity in the districts. Many of the weaknesses were resolved through capacity
building efforts initiated by the project and the Bank team. The main procurement
shortcoming was poor packaging of procurements, especially for civil works as
procurement plans were tied to budget cycles, which led to piecemeal execution of the
works.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Bank and government are preparing a follow on project. The proposed operation is
expected to support the government to address the pressing problems arising from the
demographic and epidemiological transition, and will support systems for sustainable
health care financing.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives. The PDO (original and revised) and the key areas identified for
reforms by the project were aligned with the main objectives of the Ministry of Health‟s
health sector strategy. The objectives were relevant to the country and sector context and
consistent with the CAS. However, the original PDO was too broad and not easily
measurable. The revised PDO was also broad, but more realistic, as it had good indicators.
The relevance of the PDO is rated as substantial.

Relevance of Design. The project components matched the project objective; however,
the relationship between the provincial component and the central level components was
weak in ensuring synergy of implementation. The separation of the district
implementation arrangements and adoption of a programmatic approach was relevant in
view of devolution arrangements for health services delivery. The potential impact of the
complex and ambitious design of the central level components and implementation
arrangements and the role of the Finance Commission were not adequately taken into
account during project design, although these were recognized and corrected during
implementation. The justification to include already well performing programs e.g.,
MCH and immunization, was questionable. Emphasis should have been placed on under-
performing programs/areas (e.g., NCD, nutrition, health care waste management, health
systems improvement actions to optimize health care performance). The rating of
relevance of design is moderate.

Relevance of Implementation. The project underwent several changes to improve
implementation and address emerging challenges. The considerable capacity building
efforts directed towards fiduciary management and overall planning and bringing on
board the Finance Commission early on contributed greatly to boost implementation of
the provincial component. Project restructuring was most helpful in simplifying central
level subcomponents and implementation arrangements. Delays in project restructuring
had a negative impact on central level activities, however. The rating of relevance of
project implementation is moderate.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The detailed assessment of the project outputs and outcomes by component is included in
Annex 2.

Attainment of the PDO outcome targets. Three out of six original PDO outcome targets
were achieved (Table 1). However, the achievement of two of them cannot be attributed
to the project. Two of the original key indicators could not be assessed. For anemia in
pregnancy, the data collection approach was changed making the results for the indicator
incomparable with baseline. The indicator on budget alignment was vague and not
described in a measurable manner. On the other hand, for the revised PDO outcome
targets, two were achieved, another two were substantially achieved and one on anemia
was partially achieved (Table 2). Although the target of 85 percent of women screened
for anemia was not met, the percentage of women screened for anemia registered a
significant increase from 14.3 percent at baseline to 48 percent in 2010.

 Seven out of twelve original intermediate outcome indicators were met. Improvements
were registered in availability of neonatal life saving equipment in the districts,
establishment of district program management centers and training in health care waste
management. The MoH developed plans for nutrition and NCDs; but did not realize
much progress on the development of the MTEF process. All eight revised intermediate
outcome indicators were monitored under the project; one was achieved, four were
substantially achieved, and three were partially achieved (details provided in the Data
Sheet). Provision of clinical care guidelines, expansion of women screening clinics,


                                           11
improved capacity for planning and reporting in the districts and establishment of health
care waste management in the Colombo Area are among the areas where substantial
progress was recorded.

Quality, Utilization, Equity and Efficiency of Delivery of Health Care. Emergency
Treatment Units (ETUs) were established in 54 percent of lower level hospitals (against
13.3 percent at baseline) and bed occupancy rate increased in the lower level hospitals
from 36.7 percent to 46.2 percent. Reports from Kandy District imply there has been a
reduction in mortality of acute care patients within the first 24 hours of admission since
introduction of ETUs. The improved bed occupancy rates and shifting of some of the
patient load to lower level facilities from higher level facilities can partly be attributed to
extensive refurbishment, hospital quality improvement activities (5S1) and establishment
of ETUs. The number of women screened for cervical cancer using Papanicolaou
Screening Test (PAP) smears tripled and pregnant mothers screened for anemia
quadrupled. Postpartum care coverage increased from 67 percent to 87 percent.
Programs for screening and management of major NCDs (diabetes mellitus and
hypertension) were scaled up in many districts through existing facilities and outreach.
Dental care services including screening children for dental problems were expanded.
Post immunization abscess rates increased because of improved reporting.

Regarding efficiency, there was a shift in utilization from higher level hospitals to lower
hospitals. Bed occupancy rate for higher level hospitals dropped from 97.8 percent to 87
percent and institutional deliveries from 50 percent to 34 percent. However, there has
been no commensurate reduction in the funding of secondary and tertiary hospitals,

which may in the end lead to increased inefficiency; although, it is feasible that, as a
result of the shift of patients to lower level hospitals, the higher level hospitals are seeing
more complicated cases of patients that are more expensive to manage. The increased
utilization of lower level hospitals may be reversed if skewed funding towards the
centrally managed hospitals under the MoH budget is not corrected and policy guidelines
to regulate hospital referrals are not put in place. In spite of increased utilization of the
lower level hospitals, much more still needs to be done to reduce system losses and
under-utilization of the existing health infrastructure for these hospitals.

A reduction in the district disparities against the national averages for some of the health
outcome indicators (IMR and MMR) was reported, though this cannot be attributed to the
project alone. A considerable share of project proceeds was expended in the conflict-
affected districts, and districts with plantations made deliberate efforts to target the estate
workers. Although, there is no solid evidence, the project activities are likely to have
benefitted the poor and vulnerable population groups in the districts. The improved
quality of care in the lower level facilities increased access for the poor and vulnerable,
who seldom would have sought care from the higher level hospitals. Access to, and
utilization of services by these groups and their health outcomes should have been
monitored to determine the extent to which they were reached.

Status of implementation of key actions proposed under the project. Achievement of the
PDO required complementary actions on (a) improving capacity for evidenced-based
planning; (b) strengthening capacity for policy-making and budget formulation to reflect
sector priorities; and (c) orienting the public health system towards outputs and results.
The project built considerable capacity at the provincial and district levels in the areas of
output-based plan development, monitoring, and implementation including procurement
planning and management. According to an observation made by the Finance
Commission, the health sector is the most responsive in its recent exercise on results-
based planning and management. Capacity for policy formulation increased as
demonstrated by the many relevant policy documents developed during the project‟s
lifespan, for example mental health, nutrition and MCH policies. The use of evidence-
based planning especially by the MoH is still low despite the considerable volume of
information generated by the system. Attempts to strengthen the budget process faltered
and did not progress far, and the budget process still faces the same obstacles noticed at
appraisal. Some other proposed actions identified during appraisal could not proceed for
lack of funding and commitment, such as the review of the drug procurement and
distribution systems and feasibility study on alternative health financing. The increased
attention towards NCDs demonstrates growing alignment of the sector to the emerging
health needs. Although the project supported initiation of nutritional surveillance, and
implementation of nutritional education programs targeted to children of under five years
of age through public health midwives and preschool teachers, nutrition activities were
generally implemented on a limited scale compared to what was originally envisaged
under the project.

The achievement of PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory. Although the project was
able to substantially meet most of the revised indicators, only one original PDO indicator



                                              13
(institutional deliveries in teaching or specialist hospitals) considered appropriate for the
project was achieved. In addition, progress on some of the critical systems improvements
did not proceed as anticipated, such as the better alignment of the budget to priority needs.

3.3 Efficiency

The project supported cost-effective interventions for prevention and management of
maternal and child health and emerging non-communicable diseases, the major causes of
disease burden, and thereby contributed towards improvement in the welfare of
individual citizens and the national economy. The improved infrastructure and services
for the lower level hospitals increased their utilization and improved the efficiency of the
system. The project financed considerable civil works, mainly renovation of existing
facilities, some of which were not properly planned and coordinated with the center. This
is likely to generate significant levels of recurrent expenditure. Achievement of
efficiency is rated as moderate.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Combining a moderate rating for the relevance of objectives; design and implementation;
achievement of PDOs; and for efficiency; the overall outcome rating is moderately
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Institutional Change/Strengthening. Institutional strengthening was a major theme
under the project. Progress in institutional strengthening was evidenced in:
 Improved overall district capacity for planning and management of health care. A
    notable achievement is the establishment of planning units in all districts and
    provinces across the country.
 Strengthened capacity of major units responsible for data collection and
    dissemination: Vital Statistics Unit, Medical Statistics Unit, Census and Statistics
    Department (Demographic and Health Survey unit). These units obtained new
    equipment, improved their technical capacity and revised and modified operating
    processes and systems.
 Improved capacity to deliver services: establishment of ETUs, 5S quality
    improvement systems, health care waste management, NCD prevention programs,
    including the appointment of Medical Officer for NCDs in each district. The
    development of clinical guidelines for in-patient care in public hospitals.
 Improved capacity for formulation of national policies, including mental health,
    maternal and child health and nutrition policies.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) The project realized
some positive unintended outcomes, namely: (a) building national capacity for avian
influenza response in Sri Lanka; (b) control and management of major disease outbreaks:
rabies, leptospirosis, dengue fever; and (c) revamping the health infrastructure in the
conflict-affected provinces following the end of the military conflict, where significant



                                              14
additional resources were allocated with extremely short time-frame to implement the
activities. Also, community participation in the co-financing of health improvement
activities and water and sanitation was observed in Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Sri Lanka‟s health outcomes are above average, which demonstrates the country‟s
commitment towards health care. It has already almost achieved universal access to
health care with a modest level of funding, and modest additional resources are required
to maintain the current level and quality of services. The military conflict with the LTTE,
which was the major risk to the economy at appraisal, has ended. With the exception of
unforeseen shocks, there is no obvious major macro issue that precludes Sri Lanka to
sustain the development outcomes already achieved.

The project promoted major system improvements. At provincial and district level,
where the fiscal impact of the project is likely to be greater, project management and
implementation were incorporated into the existing government operations and several
initiatives started under the project, e.g., the establishment of ETUs, scaling up 5S quality
improvement systems, establishment of health care waste management systems, setting
up planning units in each district, and NCD prevention programs are likely to be
sustained. The plans for the continuation of some of the initiatives financed under the
central component, such as the demographic and health surveys, cause-of-death analysis
of vital statistics, and nutritional surveillance were not clear by the time of the ICR
mission. With respect to hospitals, the MoH needs to institute policy actions for
management and regulation of patient referrals within the network, and it is important
that funding provided under the project to lower level hospitals is sustained. Project
resources were small in comparison to the overall sector‟s budget – about 2 percent of the
government‟s budget for health – but the resources made available to the provinces were
substantial (up to 30 percent of their capital allocations). As noted in earlier sections,
some of the civil works were not properly planned and coordinated and are likely to
generate significant levels of recurrent expenditure for the PCs.
Overall the risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The original PDO was aligned to the overall goal of the health sector strategy and
reflected the major sector concerns. The Bank made deliberate efforts to build ownership
of the project with major parties and undertook detailed technical analysis. The design of
the provincial component ensured that the project was implemented within the
decentralized arrangements. However, many of the original PDO indicators were
inappropriate, being higher level indicators. The design of the central level components
was complex with many subcomponents. At appraisal major risks were identified and the


                                             15
mitigation measures were generally adequate. Lessons from earlier projects were taken
into account during preparation. However, more attention ought to have been given to the
complex institutional arrangements and weak implementation capacity of the central
MoH to undertake some of the proposed reforms. Many of these design weaknesses were
identified at QER; unfortunately, the QER recommendations were not fully incorporated
during appraisal. On this basis, quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Supervision missions and follow up of agreed actions were adequate. The missions were
usually sufficiently staffed and paid adequate attention to compliance with legal
covenants, safeguard policies and fiduciary arrangements. Considerable efforts were
made to build fiduciary capacity at central and provincial levels and the World Bank
Country Office played a critical part in the follow up of agreed actions and other
emerging matters. ISR ratings (IP and DO), especially in the first three years of the
project appeared overly generous and contrasted with the implementation problems and
the lack of evidence of progress. The Bank took timely action to bring on board the
Finance Commission to oversee the implementation of the provincial component. In
addition to major implementation challenges noted in the central level components right
from inception of implementation, a significant portion of project proceeds were
reallocated to unforeseen emergencies. In hindsight, the impact of these actions on the
project ought to have been considered and the project restructured earlier on as
recommended by QAG. Supervision improved after project restructuring. Quality of
supervision is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Based on the moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and for quality of
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Government consistently met its counterpart obligations and set up an appropriate
implementation infrastructure, although sometimes with slight delays. Particular efforts
were made to strengthen district capacity. Despite the injection of additional funds the
project was able to achieve nearly 100 percent disbursement, with only a six month
extension. Government should have done more to address some of the implementation
bottlenecks, such as the high turnover of staff, and to facilitate major reforms, for
example, the better alignment of the budget to sector priorities. Despite government
efforts, central level programs continued to experience coordination difficulties
throughout. Government performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance




                                             16
The main implementing agencies were the MoH, Finance Commission and the provincial
and district health departments. The MoH was responsible for providing technical
oversight to the project and coordinating implementation of specific central level
program activities. With the exception of a few, most central level programs faced
implementation problems, partly because of lack of ownership by the MoH, weak
implementation capacity and coordination challenges. Performance by the MoH is rated
as moderately satisfactory. The Finance Commission overall was successful in its efforts
in providing oversight to the provincial and district authorities, despite delayed project
reporting and disbursements. It also assisted the provincial authorities to maneuver the
political intricacies of decentralized implementation arrangements. On the basis of this,
the performance of the Finance Commission is rated as satisfactory.

The provincial and district authorities demonstrated exemplary commitment to the project
and absorbed a major share of its proceeds. Overall performance of the district
component was consistently rated satisfactory during project implementation. Provincial
and district performance is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Based on the moderately satisfactory rating of performance of government, moderately
satisfactory performance of the MoH and satisfactory rating of the performance of the
Finance Commission and the provincial authorities, and the fact that some major planned
systems improvements could not go ahead, overall Borrower Performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

   Decentralized health services work best when roles and responsibilities are clear, the
    central level fulfills its stewardship functions, and the decentralized levels are
    provided with adequate resources. The programs with well established structures and
    positions at provincial and district levels, such as MCH, registered better performance
    compared with centrally managed ones, without similar structures.
   In order to avoid disbursement delays, where there are many implementing agencies,
    Special Account reimbursements should not depend on consolidation of Interim
    Unaudited Financial Reports (IUFR) from all agencies, as this would penalize
    agencies whose accounts were submitted early on, as was witnessed under HSDP.
   The Northern Province demonstrated that it is possible in a post-conflict scenario,
    with nearly 300,000 IDPs, to implement activities worth ten times the usual budgetary
    allocation timely and effectively when there is political will and commitment.
   While fully justified because of the national disaster situation, when project resources
    are reallocated in the event of such emergency, there is need for a clear plan of action
    detailing activities to be cut and how the shortfall in funds would be made up, instead
    of leaving the problem to be dealt with much later.
   Piecemeal and fragmented implementation of civil works could have been avoided by
    development of a proper procurement master plan for works and a Health



                                            17
    Infrastructure Development Master Plan. The MoH would then have been able to
    ensure utilization of national standards and norms.
   While bed occupancy can provide a crude measure of efficiency for utilization of
    hospitals, it may be inappropriate for comparing hospitals of different capacities and
    levels. In such cases, the indicator ought to be fine-tuned to reflect the pattern of
    disease burden in terms of type of disease, complication and injury.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Annex 5 contains the full text of the borrower‟s contribution to this ICR. The following
point is made by the Bank‟s ICR team, with respect to Government‟s contribution.

The Borrower in its comments highlighted the key achievement of the project in
institutionalizing planning in the districts with establishment of dedicated Planning Units.
The Borrower however noted the high turnover of the project management team as well
as the Bank Task Team Leaders as a major drawback to the success of the project. The
report expressed the concerns by programs on the management of the reallocation of
project proceeds towards the tsunami response and avian influenza threat. Apart from the
high turnover of the project management team and Bank TTLs, the issues raised are
consistent with the finding of the Bank ICR. We hope that while designing and planning
the future projects the lessons learnt from this experience will be taken seriously by the
Bank.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

                                                   24
The case for public intervention in the health sector and government involvement in its
management, organization and financing is well accepted. Public intervention is justified
both on the grounds of equity and the need to address the market failures which
characterize health markets. Economic analyses in the health sector commonly rely on
four techniques: cost-minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility
analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. These techniques however are seldom routinely
conducted for health sector projects because of measurement challenges involved in
valuing costs and outcomes related to health interventions. This analysis assesses (a) the
economic rationale for the project as adduced at appraisal; (b) design and implementation
implications for efficiency and equity; (c) financial analysis; and (d) sustainability
implications.

Economic rationale for the project as adduced at appraisal. The project‟s focus was on
providing cost-effective interventions for prevention and management of maternal and
child health and emerging non-communicable diseases. These areas represent the major
causes of disease burden, and since affordable cost-effective interventions already exist,
the areas warrant being tackled, not only to improve the welfare of individual citizens
but to contribute to overall national economic growth. By directing resources to the
provincial councils and stressing delivery of prevention services, the project assisted to
redress the imbalance in resource allocation, and reverse the highly centralized and
curative orientation of the existing health delivery system. The increased resources to the
provincial level were utilized to improve infrastructure and quality of services for the
lower level hospitals, and aided to reduce the practice by patients of by-passing lower
level facilities for the much more expensive higher level hospitals. Although Sri Lanka is
relatively efficient compared to other countries in the region, under utilization of lower
level hospitals was noted as a major efficiency concern.

Although, Sri Lanka stands out as one of the few developing countries to have achieved
near universal access for health care services, a few segments of the population still lack
access to health care, notably the estate workers. Improving access to health care for the
disadvantaged populations groups was one of the major objectives of the project. The
project introduced a needs-based formula to allocate project funds to districts and
supported the process to initiate the MTEF process and establish more credible,
transparent and predictable budget process.

Implementation implications for efficiency and equity. The project contributed to
improving utilization of lower level hospitals and expanding cost-effective preventive
services for major non-communicable diseases, notably screening services for diabetes
mellitus and hypertension, as well as screening for anemia in pregnancy and school
children for various ailments including malnutrition and dental caries. Efficiency
improvements were observed in the Bed Occupancy Rate for higher level hospitals,
which dropped from 97.8% to 87%, and institutional deliveries in teaching and
specialized hospitals, which fell from 50% to 34%, leading to improved utilization and
efficiency of lower level hospitals. Despite the improvements, additional measures are
required to increase and sustain the utilization and efficiency gains made by the lower



                                            25
level hospitals in terms of increasing resources to lower level hospitals, reversing skewed
funding towards the higher level hospitals, and issuing policy guidelines to regulate
hospital referrals. These measures alone may not be adequate without rationalizing the
existing health infrastructure. The project financed considerable civil works, some not
properly planned and coordinated with the center, which undermines the efficiency gains
achieved, as they are likely to generate significant levels of recurrent expenditure from
increased maintenance costs and unplanned expanded service delivery. So far the need to
coordinate district investments with the center has been acknowledged, but the necessary
policy actions are yet to be acted upon.

The project introduced a needs-based allocation formula and made attempts to correct the
inequality in district budgetary allocations. A significant share of project proceeds was
expended in the conflict-affected districts, and districts with plantations made deliberate
efforts to target estate workers. These activities certainly benefitted the poor and
vulnerable population groups in the targeted districts. Data on access by the
disadvantaged population groups were not recorded. As a result, evidence to evaluate the
extent to which the poor and vulnerable population groups were reached under the project
is absent. Although not plausibly directly attributable to the project, there has been a
reduction in the variations between district IMRs and MMRs against the national
averages.

Financial analysis. The project almost fully disbursed (97.7 percent of Grant (IDA-
H0950) and the Credit (IDA-45750)). Figure 1 below shows the disbursement project
for the IDA portion of the project. Over its duration, the project made an exchange rate
gain of about US$6.00 million against the SDR. Almost 80% of project proceeds were
spent under the provincial level in accord with the project objectives.

Sustainability implications. In terms of delivery of health services, Sri Lanka‟s
performance is above average, which demonstrates the country‟s commitment towards
social services including health care. It has already almost achieved universal access to
health care with a modest level of funding. Assessments conducted during appraisal
found that only modest additional resources were required to maintain the current level
and quality of services. The major risk to the economy at appraisal was the military
conflict with the LTTE, which was resolved 1.5 years prior to the revised Closing Date.
With the exception of unforeseen shocks, there is therefore no major macro issue that
precludes Sri Lanka to absorb the financial costs of the project. The project served as a
catalyst for mobilizing resources for non-communicable diseases, and with the
infrastructure for non-communicable diseases put in place, government should be able to
sustain the newly introduced non-communicable diseases interventions. The share of the
total project cost to the government health expenditure is quite small, equivalent to 2% of
the annual health sector budget. The fiscal impact of the project is greater in the
provinces (nearly 30% of the capital allocation) where a larger share of project resources
was spent: sustaining project benefits in the provinces will require the central government
providing additional resources to the provinces given the budget process remains highly
centralized. Major reforms were promoted under the project and ensuring a sound policy
environment remains critical for the success of reforms. Failure to institute a hospital
referral policy framework and to sustain funding originally provided under the project is
likely to negate the gains made under the project and encourage by-passing of lower level
hospitals for higher level ones. The project endeavored to initiate an MTEF process and
establish a more credible, transparent and predictable budget process. Progress was
limited, and the scenario at appraisal largely remains unaltered, which portends a serious
risk for the project as some of the critical reforms which underpinned the project
depended on improving the credibility of the MTEF process.

 According to table 1, grant was fully utilized. Original Allocation of Additional finance
a sum of 115 Million LKR on 14th August 2009 increased as 185 Million LKR due to
the reason of budgetary errors occurred in 2009/2010, But the additional allocation came
too late so there was no time to plan and carry out activities within the government and
world bank regulatory mechanism.


Family Health Component
This component was headed by the Family Health Bureau. HDSP has contributed a lot
for upliftment of the MCH services in Sri Lanka by providing funds for some essential
activities of the national and district components.

Achievements of the Family Health component are given below.

    1. Workload assessment of Public Health Midwife was carried out in order to obtain
       the optimum utilization of the workforce to increase the efficiency and
       effectiveness of the MCH programme. Results were disseminated by a published
       report and seminars. Thereafter policy decisions were taken by the Ministry of
       Health to regularize the basic training of PHM and to reduce their workload.

    2. Formulation of the National Maternal and Child Health Policy was carried out and
       the policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in January 2011.

    3. The revised Management Information System developed under HSDP for
       MCH/FP is in place with improved coverage and quality of data submitted in
       returns.




                                                      31
   4. Infra structure development of the Family Health Bureau by constructing the new
      auditorium complex with enhanced capacity of the centre to carry out training and
      other activities of the programme. In addition infrastructure facilities of the
      technical units of the FHB were improved by providing office equipment and
      furniture to respective sections.

   5.    „Health Promoting Schools‟ were developed to enhance the capability of school
        children and the school community to make healthy and informed decisions in
        matters related to their own health and to make the school environment safe and
        healthy. The necessary guidelines, circulars and booklets were prepared but funds
        were not available for printing due to reallocation of funds. Therefore, printing
        was carried out using GOSL funds. Development of school canteen policy and
        implemented in coordination with both ministries.

   6. Family planning programme was strengthened by establishing new FP clinics and
      provision of equipment required to conduct FP clinics. Thereafter capacity
      building of health staff on FP continued.

   7. Provision of equipment and supplies to MCH clinics particularly supplies for
      Haemoglobin estimation, weighing equipment, blood pressure apparatus etc. In
      addition newborn care equipment was supplied to specialized institutions to
      provide advance newborn life support.

   8. Improved mobility of the Public Health Midwives by supplying Moped instead of
      bicycles, in-order to increase the efficiency of the health workers.

Nutrition Component
Nutrition was identified as a subcomponent under maternal and child nutrition Sector of
the Health Sector Development Project. The overall objective of this component was to
reduce under nutrition in children less than 5 years to 20% by year 2009. This nutrition
component comprised of several major activities. Upon assessing the current level of
knowledge and practices of the PHMs, the curriculum was fully reviewed and revised.
Nutrition surveillance system established and in operation in 30 sites. National nutrition
policy and strategic plan is published as a public document. Nutrition education through
preschool children and pilot project on reduction of overweight and obesity of school
children, Nutrition oriented school garden project, Capacity building of Nutrition
Coordination Division and Nutrition research projects was also completed under the
project.


Immunization component
Immunization programme in Sri Lanka reveals as one of the best immunization
performers in the Asian region as well as the in the world.



                                           32
However with the studies done by the Epidemiological unit findings shows that this
remarkable achievement is threatened due to the fact of disparities in the quality of
immunization services provided. Along with the support of the World bank funding for
improving the quality of the immunization has been focused. This was done in two
phases with release of the funds for the development of the infrastructure facilities and
training of the primary healthcare staff in one of the selected “Best Practice?
immunization clinic in the MOH area. Other than the provision of the allocated budget
for the enhancement in the quality improvements in the best practice immunization
clinics, training and other resources and commitments were also played important roles in
establishment of these clinics.

Evaluation of this component has taken place and currently report is under preparation.

Non-communicable diseases component

Diseases of non-infectious origin consist of non-communicable diseases, injuries and
mental illness. Over the past few decades, the disease burden of chronic diseases has
increased worldwide. In low and middle income countries, NCD account for 50% of the
disease burden while mortality due to these chronic diseases is higher than that of
developed countries. In Sri Lanka, the analysis of age standardized data for the period
1991-2001 has revealed that the NCD mortality in Sri Lanka is 20-30% higher than that
of many developed countries. In 2001, chronic NCD were responsible for 71 percent of
all deaths while the balance was due to injuries, communicable diseases, and maternal
and peri-natal conditions. Furthermore, an increasing burden of NCD is projected as
evident by the analysis of mortality trends over the past decade.

Major achievement of this component was construction of a central NCD unit in the
MOH. In addition four Provincial NCD units were improved. National NCD risk factor
survey was conducted. Under capacity building in-service training of district focal points
were carried out.

Mental Health component
Under the project a central mental health unit was constructed. In addition, capacity
building of Medical Officer /Mental Health has been done.



Hospital Efficiency & quality component

Under this component development, distribution and introduction of 93 national Clinical
Guidelines to all hospitals of the country was carried out. . This activity has fulfilled a
major gap the lack of national clinical guidelines for management of common conditions.

Also, development of 48 Training Modules to improve the skills in the management of
common clinical situations was done and they were disseminated to the regional health


                                            33
administrators and most of the hospitals of the country so that training of the healthcare
providers could be done at local level using the expertise of the consultants working in
these hospitals with minimum cost to the state.

Quality Management Units were established in nine hospitals in the two focus provinces
(Uva and Southern). This activity included training of health care providers in these in
these institutions in the concepts and implementation strategies on Quality Improvement.

A building was constructed to house the Quality Secretariat with provisions to serve as a
training facility on Quality improvement of Health Care. Establishment of the quality
management unit is yet to e completed.


Public Expenditure and Management component

Under this component it was planned to conduct a study on public expenditure review for
the past ten years and to prepare a medium term expenditure review. This project was
given as a consultancy. The consultants have delivered the public expenditure review for
the past 10 yrs but were unable to prepare the medium term expenditure review as the
Ministry of Health has not finalized the priorities in the medium term plan during the
project period.



Monitoring and Evaluation component

This component was based in the Management Development and [planning unit and
following activities took place.
           ? The First provincial Health Summit was conducted at North Western
               province in 2005 and the second at North Central province in year 2008.
               (100% completed)

           ? The National level Annual Health Forum (AHF) was conducted on „policy
             dialogue for better health“ in year 2007 with the participation of island
             wide health authorities and different level stakeholders. (100% completed)

           ? External review of AHF was conducted in order to measure
             equity/efficiency/quality and to study the overall performances compared
             among districts/ costing/ financing/ expenditure and results was
             disseminated. (100% completed)

           ? Developed and launched the AHF website. Developed and published AHF
             guidelines, AHF report 2006/07 (100% completed)

           ? Results framework developed and indicators finalized.




                                           34
           ? Developed & installed Human resources data software at central, district
             & provincial level health institutions. On the job training programmes
             were conducted island wide. The system is in full operation. (100%
             completed)

           ? Refurbished the Management Development Planning unit and furnished
             with office/IT/audio equipment and furniture . And first steps were taken
             to establish Resources Center at MDPU (100% completed)

           ? Central- Provincial dialogues were conducted from year 2006 to 2009 in
             view to facilitate national level directorates to provide policy guidance to
             districts for development of district health Plans


Vital Statistics Component

Objective of this component was to provide up-to-date data on mortality statistics for
planning, monitoring and evaluation of the health sector.

Accordingly,
 Thirty-three(33) scanning centers were established in order to scan births, deaths and
   marriages data.
 Required equipments provided for scanning (Eg. Computers, printers, scanners etc.).
 Provided infrastructure in order to strength of Vital Statistics Unit (E.g.; Computer,
   printers, scanners, furniture etc.)
 Staff at district offices were trained on scanning.
 Staff of Vital Statistics Unit(VSU) were trained on ICD – coding
 Provided CAPIO,ASCENT Capture , ACME, MICAR, software to improve vital
   statistics system.
 Provided a Nisan Double Cab –Diesel vehicle to the Registrar General Department.
 Assistance provided to clear back-log

Due to unforeseen problems, the system could not continue. Those problems were,
  1. Instead of simplifying the already existing process, in some ways the new system
      has complicated it.
      e.g. - * Sending documents to an additional place [Land Registrar‟s Office for
      Scanning]
            * Instead of manual entry only the new system needs computerized entry
           with manual double checking and correction.




                                            35
Medical Statistics component

Medical Statistics Unit is responsible for dissemination of national health statistics.
Under the project capacity of staff (nationwide) involved in data collection and
dissemination were improved through training programmes.

To maintain the quality of these data, continuous training is needed for the medical
record officers who prepared these statistics in Hospitals. HSDP Project has funded for 2
such training programs (6 weeks duration and 60 staff trained).

Also, three training programs were conducted on ICD 10. Duration of each training
program was 2 weeks. In addition, 19 training programs were conducted on Hospital
statistics. The duration of each training program was 2 days.

Under the HSDP project, Medical Dictionaries, Calculators, ICD 10 and IT equipment
were purchased. In addition, IT maintenance cost was done by the HSDP project.

A double cab was purchased for the hospital supervision work of the MSU under the
HSDP project.


Demographic and health survey component
Department of census and statistics is the main government organization which is
responsible for data collection , analysis and dissemination through national surveys and
census.

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) successfully conducted the National level
Demographic and Health Survey 2006/7. About 20,000 housing units were selected using
two stages stratified sampling method for the survey excluding Northern Province. After
data collection, data entry and editing was done and two reports were published namely,

1. Demographic and Health Survey
2. Prevalence of Anaemia among children and women in Sri Lanka 2006/7.

During the process the capacity of DCS staff on technical and non technical aspects of
conducting surveys was improved.

As this is a special survey involving only female enumerators, there is a need to get
external assistance in organizing some parts of the survey. Ministry of Health
understands the importance of continuing the DHS at regular intervals and currently,
discussions are underway in planning for the next survey.




                                            36
Healthcare Waste Management Component:
Though Healthcare Waste Management is an integral part of infection control, the major
biggest teaching hospitals ( Colombo Group of Hospitals) in the country namely National
Hospital of Sri Lanka, Castle Street Hospital for Women, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for
Children, Eye Hospital, Dental Institute, HIV/ AIDS programme, did not have proper
healthcare waste management programmes. Though some fragmented programmes were
carried out. there were no accepted waste treatment facilities available for the above
institutions.

Major Achievements:
  1. Two Waste Treatment sites were developed by constructing waste treatment and
      storage facilities.
  2. 03 Steam Sterilizers and boiler were procured for waste treatment and 01 waste
      shredder was procured for shredding of treated sharps.
  3. Two vehicles were procured and modified for transportation of healthcare waste
      from hospitals to the two treatment sites.
  4. Bags, bins and a skip were provided to all health institutions based on the
      requirement.
  5. Training provided to around 700 health staff.

   The above facilities cater to National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Castle Street Hospital for
   Women, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, Eye Hospital, Dental Institute, HIV/
   AIDS programme.


   This provided the opportunity to initiate obtaining Environmental Protection Licenses
   and the Hazardous Waste Licenses for all the hospitals as establishment of the
   treatment facilities were a requirement. This was a long standing legal requirement
   under the Environmental Act.


District planning component

District Planning Unit plays an important role in continuous improvement of the Planning
and Management of the Health Systems at the District level, in order to achieve and
sustain the highest possible health status of the people according to District needs and
priorities based on the National Health Policy.

Following assistance was given under the component.

Assistance in establishing district planning units by providing essential equipments and
guidance and training of Medical Officers (planning) and planning officers.

Provided guidance in conducting situation analysis before planning process each year.



                                           37
Provided guidance to design strategies and programmes for addressing problems, issues
and deficiencies that impede service delivery, aiming at reaching the desired health status
of the people with future projections for the district.

Also assisted the finance commission in yearly evaluation of their plans.


Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response component

This is a component later added to the project. Redistribution of funds carried out to
accommodate this component. Three institutions, namely, MRI, Epidemiological Unit
and HE were involved.

With the establishment of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza ( HPAI) in the Far
East, it was identified that the threat of the spread of the disease in other countries was
high. Further, it poised the risk of the emergence of pandemic influenza due to HPAI.
Therefore, it was deemed necessary for the countries to prepare a National Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Plan (NIPRP) and establish an effective disease surveillance
system to detect H5N1 in the event of its emergence and for rapid and effective
response.

In this background, Sri Lanka developed a comprehensive NIPRP .Selected planned
activities were implemented under the HSDP. These specific activities included
strengthening national Influenza Like Illness (ILI) surveillance network established in
selected 20 sentinel hospitals, establishment or refurbishing isolation centers in 20
sentinel hospitals and strengthening laboratory capacity of the National Influenza Centre
(NIC) at the MRI.



Major achievements:


ILI surveillance network was established at selected 20 sentinel hospitals

Performance of ILI surveillance (disease/laboratory) was strengthened

Isolation capacity of high risk influenza patients were strengthened by refurbishing and
constructing patient isolation wards/centers in 20 sentinel hospitals

Capacity development programs were carried out for the sentinel site personnel

Regular review activities to monitor and evaluate influenza preparedness and response
activities in districts were carried out



                                            38
Consultative meetings were held with different stakeholders to shape the national
preparedness and response

National communication strategic activities were strengthened

Laboratory capacity of the National Influenza Center was strengthened to diagnose
H5N1, H1N1 and seasonal influenza
    Ensured availability of reagents, consumables and materials essential for
       influenza laboratory surveillance
    Influenza was upgraded and the molecular laboratory was refurbished
    MRI website was upgraded to facilitate ensuring dissemination of information
       pertinent to influenza
    International expertise / consultancy services were obtained to strengthen
       technical capacity in relation to influenza laboratory diagnostics

Laboratory reinforcement for the two sub national influenza centers in Kandy and Galle


2. Drawbacks if any, observed during the implementation of the
activities
Planning

Changes made in the plan by missions after initiation of action caused lot of problems in
the line ministry components in achieving their objectives.

Frequent turnover of the officials of the project management team as well as that of the
Team leaders of the WB was one of the major drawbacks. This lead to making
modifications to the planned activities frequently and based on personal opinions and
impressions . Sometimes the weightage given to importance of some activities was not
consistent.

       Refurbishment of High Risk Laboratory and Purchase of equipments to high risk
        laboratory could not be carried out as money was NOT available as money was
        diverted to provinces..
       Sample Storage Facility, Respiratory Laboratory Equipments. (Rs 1 M).01 No.
        Deep freezer unit (-70°C) is to be purchased urgently. The total budget allocation
        for this activity has been deducted.
       The operational research on the implementation on Guidelines of selected
        NCDs. was one such situations where already allocated funds were diverted
        elsewhere.
       NCD major public awareness planned. But WB asked for policy development. So,
        the planned activity could not be done.

There were several lapses identified in the process of designing and implementation of
the system for vital statistics.


                                           39
      Most of the categories of the relevant permanent officers and staff of the Vital
       Statistics Unit have not been involved in the process of designing the system
     The system has been implemented in full scale without piloting it.
     Instead of simplifying the already existing process, in some ways the new
       system has complicated it.
      e.g. - * Sending documents to an additional place [Land Registrar‟s Office for
      Scanning]
            * Instead of manual entry only the new system needs computerized entry
            with manual double checking and correction.

Implementation

There were delays in carrying out the project activities as several agencies were involved
and technical assistance had be obtained from outside agencies ( eg. Universities)

Financial constrains were imposed on activities due to unforeseen situations such as
diverting funds for Tsunami Relief.


Funds

The allocated funds were reduced as they were diverted to provinces. Making the
condition worse, these was a calculation error, and less than agreed amount was sent to
line ministry component. This made it difficult to the project office to pay the already
contracted out wok. After several discussions, money was sent. Then there were an
excess of around Rs. 30 million. As there was only 3 months left to complete the project,
it was not possible to identify activities, get necessary approval, develop bid documents,
advertise, evaluate, offer tenders and complete activities by 31st December 2010. Because
of this we could not completely utilize the funds.

Non availability of accounting staff was a major drawback in order to accomplish the
disbursements efficiently. Allocation provided for daily subsistence is inadequate
particularly when on outstation travel. At the beginning of each year, a considerable
delay in releasing funds was experienced and this caused delay or curtailment of
activities.


3. Suggestions and recommendations for the above and any future
concerns and improvement

       In a future project, a comprehensive plan should be developed in advance with all
        relevant stakeholders targeting the priority health issues. National policies and
        strategic plans should be followed when preparing district levels plans. The plan
        should not be changed after approval.




                                           40
    General to any software projects
   1. Such large scale projects should be piloted before going for country wide
      implementation.
   2. Involve the permanent staff of the relevant department on designing, piloting and
      implementing of a system.
   3. A feasibility study should be performed including sustainability.
   4. Project evaluation criteria must be predefined at the planning level and included
      in the project proposal.
   5. System should have a comprehensive documentation such as System Requirement
      Specification, User Manuals and Technical documentations, even if the system
      comprises of one or more Off–the- Shelf Software.
   6. Recognize the time constraints faced by the state officials and modify some M&E
      tools by developing tools in a simple and user friendly manner.




                   Health Sector Development Project (HSDP)
              Provincial Component submitted by Finance Commission

The HSDP aims to improve efficiency, equity and quality of health care by strengthening
planning, management and monitoring capacity at district, provincial and central level
with specific focus on supporting preventive care services at district and divisional levels.
The medium-term goal is to reduce inequalities across and within districts, by addressing
disparities in health indicators in disadvantaged areas and among vulnerable groups. The
process of modernization of the public health sector is constrained by the limited
resources available in the country, which are almost completely absorbed by the
operational costs of running the health system and do not permit strategic investments in
priority areas. The project financed investments to strengthen the programs that are
responsible for the successes in the past at the district, provincial and central level and
reorient their structure in key areas to best address the continuing and emerging needs of
the Sri Lankan population. By allocating more resources to geographical areas with
higher prevalence of poverty and vulnerability, the project aims to contribute to reducing
both the imbalances in the allocation of public resources for health and the disparities in
health outcomes across and within districts.

The project was launched in 2004 when a rigorous results-based planning and monitoring
process was introduced. For 2005, all districts were allocated equal resources (US
$ 100,000 from project funds & 17,000 from GOSL funds). From 2006, district budgets
were based on a Resource Allocation formula. This formula uses 9 indicators {District
Population (weight 25), Land area (weight 15), safe drinking water coverage (weight 10
inversed), sanitation facilities‟ coverage (weight 10 inversed), hospital bed occupancy
rate (weight 10), under-five mortality rate (weight 5), Low birth weight (weight 5),
Provincial Specific Development Grant funds for the preceding year (capital funds made


                                             41
available by the Government) (weight 15) and the Per capita GDP (weight 5)}. Finance
Commission directed districts to invest 60% in preventive health activities and to restrict
constructions to 20%.

In keeping with the Constitutional mandate of the Finance Commission, management of
the district component came within its purview. To facilitate this role, resources were
provided from the project, originally in the budget of the HSDP project office and from
mid 2006, via a separate budget line. The components consisted of support for project
implementation and setting up of a provincial Management Information System (MIS).



   ? Achievement of Results - Some Highlights

Establishment of District Planning

One of the most important achievements of the Project has been the institutionalization of
District Planning with establishment of dedicated Planning Units. The first tentative
attempts at District Planning were made in early eighties when pilot projects were carried
out in Matara and Kandy districts. There was no attempt to extend the initiative to other
Districts. In early nineties there was a revival of the initiative by the Management
Development Planning Unit (MDPU) starting Planning Units in Districts, starting with
Anuradhapura. This was extended to a few Districts. District Planning took root with the
implementation of HSDP and all Provinces and Districts now boast Units and these units
have also been extended to some Secondary and Tertiary care institutions. Human
Resource Development (HRD) activities continued during the year under review, with
inputs from the MDPU, district initiatives and training in SLIDA.

   ? Achievement of Objectives

The HSDP, through its strategy of programme supporting, has contributed to
improvements in quality of health services, the health information base, and capacity-
building in Sri Lanka. At the central level, major achievements have been in hospital
quality improvement, completion of the Demographic and Health Survey, and improving
coverage of maternal and child health services. These central level achievements had
positive ripple effects on the district components. The decentralized component
supporting all 26 health districts has set in motion a process of evidence-based planning,
more effective implementation, and results monitoring. Moreover, the delivery of both
preventive and curative services has benefited from the project resources, which have
made significant investments in the infrastructure and capacity of district and province
level facilities. The staff of facilities from the PD office down enjoys conductive work
environments. The project took the first steps in addressing the structural issues of
efficiency and quality in the hospital-based health care delivery system, including:

           the imbalance in the quality of services within and between different categories
              of hospitals,
           the pattern of bypassing district and provincial facilities and consequent
              overcrowding of larger, higher level facilities located in large municipalities
              (Colombo, Kandy, Galle),
           the absence of modern hospital management, the little attention placed on
              consumer satisfaction

    ? Situation Analysis

   The districts prepare annual results based district action plans using a template. Plans
    are in keeping with National Policy and based on the Health Master Plan. MDPU
    organizes annual Central / Provincial dialogue to ensure this aspect as well as to give
    a forum to technical managers at National level to give direction to programmes. The
    Center Provincial dialogue in 2009 was well organized and much appreciated by the
    Finance Commission and the Provinces. The plan is evidence based, the evidence
    being derived from time series data related to district‟s core health indicators of
    programme areas (MCH, preventive care, curative care, and nutrition, services to
    vulnerable groups, management and stewardship). Coordination between different
    stake holders is improving, with dedicated planning teams in situ in some districts.
    The plan may address all or a few of these programme areas, prioritized. Actions
    proposed are logically linked with results to be achieved. The adoption of Legal
    Framework (LF) approach is another major achievement of the HSDP. A core list of
    indicators is provided but other indicators can be selected depending on priority
    problems affecting individual districts.

   In 2005, a bottleneck for speedy implementation of actions was low financial limits
    of Deputy Provincial Directors and Provincial Health Directors. In 2006, those limits
    were revised upwards, on representations made by the Finance Commission. In 2005,
    most districts had created PMC and staffed them. In 2006, they made all efforts to
    equip those centers with computer, email facility, multimedia projector etc. and
    arranged training for the staff, using project funds.

   The provision of fax machines, E mail facilities to MOH offices has resulted in
    timely reports to the RDHS and improved the quality of the MIS, and thus the
    evidence base being regularly updated for planning and monitoring.

            It was encouraging to see MOH staff using multimedia projectors for monthly
             progress review meetings and for health promotion.
