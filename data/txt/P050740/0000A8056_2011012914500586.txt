                         The project has progressed satisfactorily since its implementation in October 2004. It is due to close with nearly 100% disbursement on schedule on December 31, 2010. The PDO of

                         sector health services with a particular focus on district and provincial level health services in Sri Lanka. As updated in the results framework and based on discussions held during
                         the mission, the project is on track to achieving the project outcome indicators.

                         The original project (US $ 60 million) objective was to improve efficiency, equity and quality of health care by strengthening planning, management, and monitoring capacity at the
                         district, provincial, and central level with specific focus on supporting preventive care services at district and divisional level. It had 4 components- (1) support to district health
                         agencies in improving service delivery and outreach, (2) support to central programs and hospitals, (3) support for policy making, budget formulation and monitoring and evaluation,
                         (4) project management. In September 2009, the project was restructured and provided with additional financing (amounting to US $ 24 million) with a six month extension to project
                         closing date from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010.

                         The restructured project has two components:
                         Component 1(the provincial component received 81% of the project funds): All districts continue to prepare annual comprehensive plans under the following six areas: maternal and
                         child health, prevention of communicable and non-communicable diseases, control of communicable and non communicable diseases, health needs of vulnerable populations,
                         nutrition and improving district / provincial management. The plans for 2010 are currently being implemented to meet the project completion deadline of December 31, 2010. This
                         component has achieved many results. They include establishing emergency treatment units, functioning `5S' quality hospitals, the procurement of essential medical equipment,
                         providing better investigative services through mobile laboratories, establishing satellite laboratory networks, and facility improvements in expanding services for mental health care,
                         dental health services, outpatient services at secondary and primary health care facilities. Furthermore, on the preventive side, large scale improvements have been made in dental
                         health services with many districts setting up community based preventive dental services, improving the mobile outreach services for maternal and child health and non
                         communicable diseases screening to difficult-to-reach areas like the plantation sector and rural areas. These results are now used for results based planning and management on
                         the medium term (for 2011-2013).

                         Component 2 (central component was 19% of project funds) has also progressed satisfactorily and most subcomponents of the project are now completed. The component was
                         implemented by various units; Family Health Bureau, Nutrition Coordination (NC) Unit, Epidemiology Unit, Medical Research Institute, Health Education Bureau, the Medical
                         Statistics Unit, the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Unit, Vital Statistics Unit of the Registrar Generals Department, the hospital quality sub-component implemented under the
                         Deputy-Director General (DDG) Medical Services, the Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) Unit, the Management Development and Planning Unit (MDPU); implementation progress
                         in all of the units is satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has progressed satisfactorily since its implementation in October 2004. It is due to close with nearly 100% disbursement on schedule on December 31, 2010. The PDO of
                         the project (following restructuring and additional financing in September 2009) is to contribute to improvements in efficiency, utilization, equity of access to, and quality of, the public
                         sector health services with a particular focus on district and provincial level health services in Sri Lanka. As updated in the results framework and based on discussions held during
                         the mission, the project is on track to achieving the project outcome indicators.

                         The original project (US $ 60 million) objective was to improve efficiency, equity and quality of health care by strengthening planning, management, and monitoring capacity at the
                         district, provincial, and central level with specific focus on supporting preventive care services at district and divisional level. It had 4 components- (1) support to district health
                         agencies in improving service delivery and outreach, (2) support to central programs and hospitals, (3) support for policy making, budget formulation and monitoring and evaluation,
                         (4) project management. In September 2009, the project was restructured and provided with additional financing (amounting to US $ 24 million) with a six month extension to project
                         closing date from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010.

                         The restructured project has two components:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Page 6 of 7

                         Component 1(the provincial component received 81% of the project funds): All districts continue to prepare annual comprehensive plans under the following six areas: maternal and
                         child health, prevention of communicable and non-communicable diseases, control of communicable and non communicable diseases, health needs of vulnerable populations,

                         nutrition and improving district / provincial management. The plans for 2010 are currently being implemented to meet the project completion deadline of December 31, 2010. This
                         component has achieved many results. They include establishing emergency treatment units, functioning `5S' quality hospitals, the procurement of essential medical equipment,
                         providing better investigative services through mobile laboratories, establishing satellite laboratory networks, and facility improvements in expanding services for mental health care,
                         dental health services, outpatient services at secondary and primary health care facilities. Furthermore, on the preventive side, large scale improvements have been made in dental
                         health services with many districts setting up community based preventive dental services, improving the mobile outreach services for maternal and child health and non
                         communicable diseases screening to difficult-to-reach areas like the plantation sector and rural areas. These results are now used for results based planning and management on
                         the medium term (for 2011-2013).

                         Component 2 (central component was 19% of project funds) has also progressed satisfactorily and most subcomponents of the project are now completed. The component was
                         implemented by various units; Family Health Bureau, Nutrition Coordination (NC) Unit, Epidemiology Unit, Medical Research Institute, Health Education Bureau, the Medical
                         Statistics Unit, the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Unit, Vital Statistics Unit of the Registrar Generals Department, the hospital quality sub-component implemented under the
                         Deputy-Director General (DDG) Medical Services, the Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) Unit, the Management Development and Planning Unit (MDPU); implementation progress
                         in most of the units is satisfactory. The mission notes that few initiatives of some of the units ­ the vital statistics unit, the nutrition coordination division, hospital efficiency unit, the
                         HCWM activities, the Epidemiology unit and the MDPU- need urgent further attention to achieve the planned results.
