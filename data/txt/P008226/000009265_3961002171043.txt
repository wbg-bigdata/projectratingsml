EMORIANDUM AND REC0HNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
or M
INTIPYATIONAL BMNK FOR RECONSMTUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTrVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE RSPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR A STUDENT LOAN REFORM PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recoszendatLon on a proposed loan to the Republic of Venezuela for the
equivalent of US$58.0 m$ilion to help finance a Student Loan Reform Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard varlable lnterest rate, with a
maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.        B^kanmd. The Government of Venezuela (GOV) has traditionally
placed high priority on human resource development: about 21 percent of the
total government budget (S 9 percent of CDP) is allocated to education. Net
enrollment rates at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels in Venezuela
are 85, 38, and 22 percent, respectively. Enrollments in higher education
(which is tuition-free at the undergraduate level, with annual fees between
US$400 and US$8SO being charged for graduate studies) have doubled uince the
late 1970's, reaching over half a mllion students in 1990. Graduate
education is relatlvely new in Venezuela, and is expanding faster than
undergraduate educations frm one percent in 1989 to 2 5 percent of the total
enrollment in 1990. owever, this rapid expansion has been accompanied by
problem of quality and relevance. Approximately 13,000 students are
reistered in 25 (mostly public) institutions across the country, mainly in
specialized courses, rather than in master's or doctorate programs. The rapid
growth of the higher education system has been accompanied by a highly skewed
allocation of public educatlon resources (over 35 percent of the GOV's
education budget in 1990 was for higher education). While this reflects the
high priority placed on increasing the numbers and improving the skllls of
higher-level profesesonal, technical, and managerlal human resources, the GOV
recogniLes the need to reduce the relatively high expenditures in higher
education through cost recovery mechanisms and other finan1ial strategLes to
mobilize, allocate, and use resources efficiently. The high political
sensitivities regarding the establishment of student fees for higher oducatlon
in Venezuela suggest that this will be a long and difficult process.
3.        Despite the heavy emphasis placed on higher education, there is
still a great need for hlghly skllled professionals ln all sectors. Venezuela
has spent the last three years struggling to overcome an acute economic
crisis, and implementLig an ambitious economlc adjustment program, which
lncludes the prlvatization of a number of public enterprlies. The
Decentralization Act of 1989 gave municipalities and state governments the
right to take over service delivery for a number of basic services. Given
that the Venezuelan public sector is wldely regarded to be among the weakest
of the major countries of Latin America, both at the central and the local
loevls, large numbers of professional, technLcal and managerial staff wlth
appropriate qualifications are and will continue to be needed to implement the
economic reform, privatization, and decentralizatLon processes. There will be
new needs for hlghly sklled professionals ln the private sector as well.
Without sufficient numbers of highly skilled professlonals both ln the public



-2-
and the private sector, it is unlikely that the GOV's new economic policies
can be sustained. As a short-term measure, the GOM is considering a program
zo promote selective immigration of about 50,000 skilled workers from Europe
over the next five years, as a way of compensating for the severe shortage of
trained human resources. The medium-term objective of the GoV, however, is to
develop the conditions for future reforms in laigher education efficiency and
finance and improve higher level human capital formation.
4.        over the past sixteen years, the Fundacion Gran Mariscal de
Ayacucho (FGMA) has provided educational credit and grants to Venezuelan
students, both graduate and undergraduate, in all fields of study, in-country
and abroad. It provides scholarships and loans to individuals and eatabl'shes
inter-institutional agreements with universities and other agencies to support
training and research activities. The FGMA is a well-established institution,
widely recognised as a key player in the development of higher-level human
resources for Venezuela. It is attached to the Ministry of the Family, which
in turn is responsible for social policy and for the coordination of social
programs in Venezuela.
S.        The FGNA's mission is to develop human resources for Venezuela's
development process, through the provision of educational grants and loans.
Of the 54.000 grants and loans provided since 1976, about half have supported
students within Venezuela, and about half have supported students abroad.
Roughly 80 percent of students have received grants while 20 percent have
received loans. Over the last two years, however, a dramatic reversal has
taken place, and about two-thirds of students have been recipients of loans.
About 50 percent of awards have been for studies at the undergraduate level,
30 percent for graduate, and 20 percent for technical levels. In 1990, the
FOMA granted 296 scholarships and 1230 student loans, for a total of about
US$7 million. Within Venezuela, loans for undergraduate education cover
living expenses only, while loans for graduate education cover both tuition
and living expenses. Loans for overseas studies cover transportation, tuition
and living expenses.  The existing loan program is in urgent need of reform to
improve its financial viability. Reform of the student loan program is of the
highest priority for the GOV, as a means to begin to rationalize the use of
resources in education, contribute to the improvement of higher level human
capital formation, and lay the groundwork for future reforms in the financing
of higher education.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assis ance strategy in
Venezuela is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. In the
social sectors, emphasis is on improving the quality, coverage, targeting, and
monitoring of social services; improving the efficiency of resource
allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector, and support 'or private
sector development. The proposed project would directly support this
strategy, by assisting the GOV in its dual efforts to: (a) design and
implement a financially viable student loan scheme, which would be an initial
step for future reforms in higher education finance; and (b) improve higher
level human capital formation, and ultimately improve the capacity for
implementing economic reforms. Recommendations from the Public Administration
Study are being taken into account in project design. Future recommendations



-3-
for policy reform will emerge from planned and ongoing ,ector work. An
Education Sector Review is underway, and is focusing on critical human
resource development issues in the country, including issues of resource
allocation among the different levels of education, and examining key issues
in primary, secondary, and higher education. A Basic Education Reform Project
(FY93), which would improve quality, access, equity, aw.d internal efficiency
in basic education, is under preparation. A Higher Education Project (FY9S)
would build on the results of the policy studies supported by the proposed
project, directly supporting reforms in higher education management and
finance, emphasizing mechanisms to increase the income-earning capacity of
universities through cost-recovery.
7.        Lessons Learned from Prevgous Bank Involvement. Given that the
FY91 Social Development Project (Loan 3270-VE) was the first Bank-financed
human resources project for Venezuela, there are no completed projects in the
country from which relevant lessong from Bank experience can be drawn.
Likewise, there are no completed projects in Latin America that have financed
large scholarship or student loan programs to improve planning, management,
and implementation capacity. However, the FY88 Education Program Prenaration
and Student Loan Proicot in Jamaica (Loan 2899-JM) fixanced a student loan
component, mostly for domestic higher education. A valuable lesson learned
from this project is that, wnen adequate collection procedures were
established, cost recovery increased substantially. These included the
publication of names of delinquent beneficiaries in the media, and initiating
legal action against beneficiaries and guarantors who fail to respond. The
proposed project will include appropriate collection strategies for student
loans, which will be effectively monitored. The proposed project will also
incorporate features from the ongoing Indonesia Professional Human Resource
Develonment Proiect (FY90), such as strengthening the respective overseas
training office, and including a program of overseas post-graduate training
for key staff in central government agencies, provincial and local
governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations. Lessons from
several completed projects in other countries have also been taken into
account in the design and conditionality of the proposed project, including:
(a) optimizing opportunities for varied overseas training experiences through
effective management of the student loan component (Loan 1904-IND); (b)
carefully monitoring the return rate of overseas fellows on degree courses
(Loan 2021-CHA and Credit 1167-CHA)l (c) ensuring that the duration of
training is sufficient to permit the full attainment of the training
objectives (Credit 1069-EGT): (d) have a formal monitoring and reporting
system at the outset of project implementation (Loan 2258-IND); and (e)
elaborate explicit project objectives and key project indicators, and monitor
achievements on a regular basis (Credit 1297-CHA).
8.        groject Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (a) to strengthen and reform FGWA's student loan program; (b) to improve
the level of professional, technical and managerial skills in both the
private and the public sectors; and (c) to strengthen policy research on human
capital and higher education issues in order to provide a solid base for
future reforms in higher education finance and management.



-4-
9.        Pro5tD2ggXntLan.  The proposd project will support a
comrehensive reform of the F?GM' student loan program, iutroducing lending
instruments which wlll comb'ne affordabllity and improved recovery. These
inatruments will substantially increae the interest rate charged (to about
two-thirds of market rates); improve selection criteria (placing more emphaesi
on financial need); introduce graduated monthly payments (to reflect
relatively lower income of new graduates); establish a repayment period of 15
years; introduce a ceiling of ten percent of expected income on annual
repayments; and improve collection policLies to raise repayment from the
current 1.5 percent of debt to at least 70 percent. An improved loan recovery
strategy, with collections handled through a financLal Lnstitution under a
Fiduciary Agreement, will be established. The FiducLary will sign with each
student beneficiary an agreement providing for the student loan, and will
carry out the student loan program. It is expected that the combined result of
these activities will lower the real subsidy level from the current 93 percent
to a maximum of 50 percent, after taking into account inflatLon,
administrative costs, and default. The GOV is thoroughly committed to
implementing these reforms, in an effort to Lmprove the financial viability of
the program.
10.       The proposed project has two major components: (a) reform and
strengthening of the student loan program (95 percent of total costs); and (b)
institutional development for two human resource development-related
Lnstitutions: the FGNA and the School of Social Management (8SM) (five percent
of total costs). Within the student loan comnonent, the proposed project
would finance institutionally-sponsored student loans to support management
development in key Lnstitutions, covering higher-level human resource
development for both the public and private sectors. The fields of management
and finance would receive special attention within each instLtution. About 74
percent of student loan funds would finance graduate overseag studles, 17
percent graduate domestic studies, and nine percent domestic undergraduate
studLes. BeneficlarLes will be encouraged to return to government
institutions by exempting them from repayment, provided they return to work at
their sponsoring instit.tions for twice the length of time they were supported
under the student loan program. The government agencies or universitLes
sponsoring these students would be responsible for repayment of these student
loans, through budgetary transfers, over a perLod not to exceed flve years.
The project would also support an open program of student loans for
lndivlduals, coverLng professLonal development ln varLous fields, at the
graduate (domestLc and overseas) and undergraduate (domestLc only) levels.
11.       Within the lnstJ=Lcn1 delooment component, the financial and
Lastitutional capacity of the GOM to promote and support the development of
hlgh callber Venezuelan professionals would be strengthened by thoroughly
reforming student loan terms, ad improving cost-recovery mechanlsms, while
strengthening its admLnistratlve capacity to effectively select students and
ensure debt repayment. The project would also support the design and
implementation of a management information system for the FoM, through the
provision of equipment, software, technical assistance, and staff training.
The YOMa will initiate a technical asesment and classifLeatlon of graduate
study programs in Venezuela, as a firat step towards the establishment of an
accreditation system fo. graduate program. In addition, the project would



-5-
sapport training, technical asistance and studies, ln order to strengthen
policy research in hlgher education, labor markets, education and human
resources policy, and human capital formatLcn. These studies will feed into
the dialogue on improving the finance and efficiency of higher education. The
55K, a new public training and documentation center, would be supported in its
endeavor to develops (a) linkages with similar establlshed instLtutions
elsewhere in Latin America to guide program development; (b) curricula aimed
at practical issues facLag social sector admlnLstrators at the state and local
levels; (c) increased capaclty to glve technical assLstance to local agencles
admlnistering social services; and (d) tralning progr as for publlc officials
at multiple levels. These will be achieved through the provision of
oquipment, staff training, technlcal assistance and studies.
12.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$8S.6
mllion, excluding taxes and dutles, of whlch US$56.9 million is expected to
be in foreign exchange. Cost estimates and the financing plan are shown ln
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in schedule B. The timotable of key events of project processing is
summarised in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations ln Venezuela is
shown in Schedule D. A map of Venezuela is attached. The Staff AppraiLal
Report, No. 10474-Vt, dated May 27, 1992 is also attached.
13.      Agr.e ^AtLps. Agreement has been reached on: updated equipment
listo for equipment procurementt terms of zaference for studies; tralnlng
plans; draft regulations regarding the polLcLes and conditions for the new
student loan program; terms of reference, draft contracts, and shortlists of
agencies for the placement and admlnLstratLon of resources for overseas
trainLng; model bidding documents for the procurement of goods; the first
annual program of activltles; monltorlng lndLcators; the draft Flduclary
Agreement; and lnstltutlonal development actlon plans. The FoMA has issued
the corresponding resolution creating a project unlt wlth the appointment of a
project manager, three assistants, and the steering committee, and the SSM has
appointed a project coordLnator.  At negotiations, the GOV pr.*vided
assurances that it wills (a) establish and maintain the special account; (b)
participate in the annual reviews and ln the mid-term revLew and take any
necessary action to enable FGYA and SSM to implement any adjustments the Bank
may recommend; and (c) exchange vliws with the Bank on the results of the
policy studies, and submlt to the Dank action plans based on the results of
such studies and the ank's conmments by the agreed dates, and implement such
action plans under timetables agreed with the Bank. The YOA will: (a) submit
to the Bank an annual report on the implementation of student loan programs as
well as annual programs of all project investments; (b) particlpate ln the
annual reviews and in the mid-term review of the implementation of the
project, in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; lc)
implement the Student Loan Program in accordance wlth the Student Loan
Regulations, which shall not be changed without the Bank *s consent; (d)
furnLsh to the Dank, on the agreed dates, completed studies for Bank revlew
and agreement; and (e) malntaln the project unlt and steering committee durinq
the execution of the project. Action plans, based on the results of the
studles and the Bank's comments, will be implemented under timetables agreed
with the Bank.



-6-
14..      As conditions of effectiveneso, evidence will be submitted to the
Bank thatt (a) the new regulations for student loans have been officially
adopted by the FGMA; (b) the GOV has entered into a subsidiary agreement with
FGMA and SBM pro-iding for the transfer of loan proceeds from the GOV through
FGMA, to 88M, and the obligations to be assumed by SSMI and (c) the FGMA has
entered into a Fiduciary Agreement with a financial institution for carrying
out the student loan program. A  condoitios  of disbursement, (a) no
withdrawals shall be made for payments for axpenditures related to overseas
training under the student loan program unless the FGMA has entered into an
administration contract for placement, financing, and monitoring of students;
(b) no withdrawals shall be made for expenditures that are not included in an
annual program approved by the Bank; and (c) no withdrawals shall be made for
expenditures uhder the student loan program unless the Fiduciary has entered
into the respective contract wiith the student beneficiary.
15.       EnironmentulLAgMIqts.  The proposed project does not require an
envirosmental assessment, as its expected environmental impact is negligible.
16.       Proiect Benefits. The main benefits expected from thb proposed
project would be: (a) a comprehensive reform of the student loan program in
order to increase its financial viability, administrative efficiency, student
selection, and debt collection procedures, as a first step in improving higher
education finance and education resource management; (b) additional cost-
recovery mechanisms in higher education could be introduced once there is a
proven well-designed and functioning student loan program, which could be
expanded to cover needy students having difriculties in meeting tuition
payments and/or living expenses; (c) improvement of higher level human
capital formation in Venezuela by helping the FGMA to significantly expand and
progressively target its student loan program.
17.       Rik   The main risk is that the comprehensive reforms of the
student loan program may not be sustained. The project would address this
risk by annual reviews of the implementation of the student loan program and
its conditions, with built-in arrangements for modification of conditions as
necessary. Although several studies have indicated that brain-drain has not
been a problem in Venezuela, the deterioration of the economic environment in
recent years raises questions about the possibility of non-returning students,
especially in science. The recent acceleration of economic growth should
greatly reduce this risk, since employment generation accompanies growth, and
employment opportunities are one of the most important determinants of skill
retention.
18.       Rcommendatio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
