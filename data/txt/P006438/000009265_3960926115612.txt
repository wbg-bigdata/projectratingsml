MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A NORTHEAST ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$109 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 15 years maturity and would help finance an endemic disease control
project in the Northeast of the country.
2.        Background.  A significant portion of Brazils territory is
located in the tropical zone, where the environment is rich in vectors and
reservoirs of communicable diseases. Many of those have become endemic,
primarily due to insufficient control measures, exacerbated by limited
resort to treatment even for those diseases which are treatable. Within
Brazil, health status is poorest in the Northeast, as evidenced by a low
life expectancy at birth of 51 years (65 years for the country as a whole),
a high infant mortality rate of 125 per 1000 live births (67 per 1000 live
births for the country as a whole), and an exceptionally high prevalence of
endemic infectious diseases, including schistosomiasis, Chagas' disease,
tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, malaria and leprosy.
3.        Chagas' disease, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis are highly
disabling diseases affecting almost exclusively low-income groups throughout
Brazil. They are most prevalent in the Northeast, where the ecology is
particularly suitable to the reproduction of insects and other vectors and
hence the transmission of these diseases. There are about six million
Brazilian chagasic patients, 60 percent of whom live in the Northeast; and
about 10 million people with schistosomiasis, most of them living in the
Northeast, where prevalence as high as 80 percent can be found in some
population groups. Leishmaniasis is less widespread at present, with about
20,000 persons currently affected. But the growth rate has been explosive
in the last several years; 98 percent of reported cases come from the
Northeast. Altogether, more than 65 percent of the 36 million people living
in the Northeast are at risk of contracting these three diseases.
4.        In addition, because of the dramatic growth in the number of
cases, the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has become a national
health emergency. By October 1987 Brazil had an estimated 2,100 AIDS
patients (exceeded only by the United States and France in absolute
numbers); it has an unusually high rate of transmission attributable to
blood transfusions, because of lack of testing and poorly regulated blood
banks.
5.        The government's strategy in the health sector now emphasizes
basic health care and preventive activities, including control of infectious
and endemic diseases. In line with this approach, it is reallocating
resources from costly hospital service and giving priority to basic care and
prevention, particularly in the Northeast where problems are most severe.



- 2 -
6.         Institutional capacity in the health sector in Brazil is uneven,
but the Superintendency of Public Health Campaigns (SUCAM), the implementing
agency for endemic disease control programs, has been one of the more
effective institutions within the health sector, with a good record of
performance and commitment among senior staff. In the 1970s, SUCAM
implemented one of the world's most effective programs for controlling
schistosomiasis. However, in the 1980s SUCAM has suffered from an
inadequate budget, which has resulted in a slowdown in its control programs.
It needs to increase its staff, upgrade its physical facilities, purchase
and install needed equipment, and improve its data processing and accounting
procedures.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Brazil of
promoting macroeconomic adjustment, economic growth, and institutional
efficiency involves social sector programs addressing the most critical
problems and ways to improve efficiency in the utilization of scarce
resources. This project is targeted mainly towards rural and urban poor in
the Northeast, and addresses a major public health problem in Brazil; i.e.,
the steep increase of endemic diseases resulting from the slowdown of
control activities. The project provides an effective instrument for
redirecting public spending from costly hospital care into programs that are
primarily preventive and targeted to the poorest region of the country.
Bank support for this type of project makes an important contribution to the
government's efforts to increase its financial and institutional commitment
to disease prevention and control programs. (A new project for malaria
control in the Amazon Basin is also being prepared.) Lessons from health
components of Bank-financed rural development projects in the Northeast and
a small malaria control component in the Northwest have been incorporated
into the design of this project, especially in the program to improve
institutional capacity for project implementation.
8.        Project Obiectives.  The main objective is to arrest the
increasing trend of three major endemic diseases (Chagas' disease,
schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis), in order to reduce the prevalence and
intensity of human infection in the population at risk in Brazil's Northeast
region to a level where the diseases no longer pose a public health problem.
The project would also assist the Government in developing an AIDS program,
including AIDS testing in blood banks and AIDS education through the mass
media. In addition the project aims at improving institutional capacity to
carry out disease prevention programs.
9.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project would support the
strengthening and expansion of disease control activities carried out by
SUCAM in the Northeast and in portions of Minas GeraiR. Under contract with
SUCAM, the State Health Services would carry out related care and
surveillance activities; the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a highly respected
public research institute, would carry out the operational research
component of the project; and PAHO would assist SUCAM in hiring key
management staff and consultants. Five components are included: (1)
Prevention and Control of Disease Transmission (78.2% of total project
costs), involving epidemiological mapping, surveys, screening for disease,



- 3 -
treatment of cases, and vector control; (2) Community Mobilization (5.3%)
including information, education and communication (IEC) through
interpersonal education and mass media coverage for community participation
in disease control activities; (3) Operational Research (0.7%), including
studies aimed at solving practical problems in the control of endemic
diseases and cost-effectiveness analysis of proposed approaches; (4)
Institutional Development (11.9%), including the strengthening of SUCAM's
administration and human resources, improving data base processing
capabilities, strengthening SUCAM's IEC capacity and construction of
facilities for the Regional Directorates; and (5) Control and Prevention of
AIDS (3.9%), entailing the provision of lab equipment and chemicals,
training, mass media messages and technical assistance. The project would
be carried out over a period of six years. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$218.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$89.5
million (41%). Breakdowns of costs and financing are shown in Schedule A,
and amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.   These
schedules, a map, and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6837-BR, dated January
15, 1988, are attached. Retroactive financing in an amount not to exceed
US$1.5 million is recommended to finance start-up costs of the project
initiated after appraisal.
10.       Agreed Actions.  In satisfaction of conditions of negotiations,
the Government has taken a number of steps, including provision of evidence
of the Government's allocation of project counterpart funds in the 1988
budget, the establishment of a project management unit and the signature of
contracts satisfactory to the Bank with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and PAHO
for their activities under the project. The Government has also appointed a
Project Manager satisfactory to the Bank, who participated in negotiations.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that: (a) SUCAM will hold
annual meetings with Regional Directorates and the State Secretariats of
Health to evaluate progress in the project and address implementation
issues; (b) a survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices on endemic
diseases will be completed by July 31, 1988; and (c) if the project manager
is to be replaced, the candidate will have adequate qualifications and
experience, and the Bank will be allowed to comment on proposed candidates.
A condition of effectiveness will be that SUCAM and the State Secretariats
of Health of at least five project states, or states involving one half of
the project area or one half of the project population, will have signed an
*         agreement for provision of laboratory space and implementation of project
surveillance activities.
11.       Risks.  Low salaries, in addition to harsh and occasionally
dangerous working conditions, may hamper SUCAM's efforts to contract the
required staff to carry out the project field operation in a timely fashion.
To minimize this risk the Government will, when necessary, arrange for
contract staff to be hired by states and municipalities (allowing for
payment of better wages, higher per diems for field work, and hardship
allowances), with reimbursement by SUCAM to states and municipalities from
Loan proceeds. There is a long-run risk of resurgence of diseases after



project completion if the government does not sustain its financial
commitment to disease control activity. This risk will be minimized since
the project will eventually reduce the disease control costs to those of
surveillance which are low compared to the costs of reducing high incidence
rates of disease. Finally, there is a risk that behavioral change at the
individual and community level, which is critical to the success of disease
control, will not occur. For this reason two components -operational
research, and IEC- have been included in the project.
12.       Benefits.  Three major benefits are expected from the project:
(1) substantial reduction of the risk of contracting Chagas' disease,
schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis, and thus a substantial reduction of the
associated welfare and productivity losses; (2) savings on medical and
hospital care costs; and (3) improvements in SUCAM's management,
administration and efficiency as regards endemic disease control programs,
with spill-over effects on the efficiency of controlling other ndemic
diseases, such as rabies, trachoma, bubonic plague and malaria.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
