Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's main objective is to contribute to the integration of low-income people into the
national economy, and to the realization of their income generating potential by improving their
access to financial services. To this end, the project aims at improving the financial stability and
outreach capacity of savings and credit institutions (SCIs) nationwide, and especially at expanding
financial services in rural areas. This is proposed to be achieved by: (a) Consolidating the Savings
and Credit Institutions (SCI) sector; (b) expanding financial services in rural areas; and
(c) undertaking monitoring and evaluation, and carrying out studies, to inform the strategy and
policy relating to rural finance.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. When the project started to be prepared in 2000, Mexico was in the midst of a remarkable economic
comeback and significant political transformation. Following the severe macroeconomic and financial
crisis of 1994-95, the financial system had stabilized, credit to the private sector was picking up, and the
economy was expanding at a rate of nearly 7 percent per annum. Yet in 2000, about 58 million Mexican
people – 50 percent of the total population – still lived in poverty, and the lack of access to efficient
financial services was affecting their ability to overcome poverty, especially in rural areas. While the
commercial banking sector had recovered from the collapse of 1994-95, about three-quarters of all adults
in metropolitan areas – and 85 percent of individual entrepreneurs – had no access to these financial
outlets. In rural areas, where about half the population lived in extreme poverty, participation in the
formal financial system was low. A survey1 of rural marginal areas in the Oaxaca and Huasteca regions
conducted in 2000 showed that just 2.5 percent of households had access to credit from a financial
institution, and less than 6 percent used formal savings instruments.

2. Non-bank financial intermediaries referred to as Savings and Credit Institutions (SCIs)2 had shown
some resilience to the 1994-95 financial crisis, as many of them were protected from the currency crisis
by their full reliance on deposits mobilized in local currency to support their loan portfolios. They played
an increasingly important role in rural areas, as traditional government subsidized agricultural credit
schemes had shrunk. Efforts by the government to induce the expansion of commercial banks’ rural
branch networks between 1996 and 1999 had been unsuccessful, due primarily to the banks’ critical
financial situation, and their increased reluctance to intervene in rural areas.

3. The advantage that the SCIs had vis-à-vis the banking system was clear – they were able to lend
while the rest of the banking system was contracting credit flows, and well-functioning SCIs were
attracting new membership and growing in scale as the rest of the financial system was shrinking. As of
2000, it was estimated that there were more than 630 SCIs, extending savings and loans services to
approximately 2.3 million people (equivalent to about 7 percent of the economically active population).
These non-bank financial institutions, however, lacked a legal and regulatory environment and reliable
supervision, which contributed to a high degree of institutional heterogeneity and regulatory arbitrage.
Several SCIs failed in 1998-2000, in some cases due to openly fraudulent activities, leaving clients with
lost savings. This was leading to a generalized lack of confidence in the non-bank sector, which partially
extended to the banking sector, contributing to limit the development of financial intermediaries.

4. Against this background, the government embarked on a strategy to strengthen the SCI sector. A
new law designed to address the lack of regulation and establish a supervisory framework for the SCIs –
Law of Savings and Popular Credit (LACP, Ley de Ahorro y Crédito Popular) – was passed in April
2001 and became effective in June 2001. This law aimed to strengthen and rebuild confidence in the SCI

Marginal Areas. Report No. 21286-ME.

         The term “Saving and Credit Institution (SCI)? – Entidad de Ahorro y Crédito Popular – is used to denote
diverse non-bank financial institutions that mostly serve middle- and low-income segments of the populations,
including cooperatives, credit unions, popular savings and/or credit entities, and some other types of institutions.

                                                         1
sector, through the gradual incorporation of all SCIs into a new legal and regulatory framework. The
National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), per mandate of the new law, became the sole
regulatory and supervisory entity for SCIs. The institutional framework prescribed by the legislation
required the affiliation of SCIs to Federations (with grouping of Federations into Confederations), which
would supervise, monitor and oversee SCIs’ activities and status according to established guidelines, and
report to CNBV. A complementary law, enacted in June 2001, transformed the former PAHNAL
(Patronato del Ahorro Nacional)3 into the National Bank for Savings and Financial Services
(BANSEFI), which started its operations in January 2002. BANSEFI’s mandate included:
(a) coordinating the government’s programs to support the orderly development of the SCI sector to
comply with the new law, including training and technical assistance to sector institutions (CNBV,
Federations, SCIs), developing an information system, and carrying out communication campaigns; and
(b) providing second-tier banking services to SCIs (Banco de cajas) including liquidity management and
development of new products and services.

5. The government combined these institutional and legal reforms with a substantial public investment
in strengthening capacity of the SCIs and the agencies for supervision, and in deepening outreach of the
SCIs in the marginal rural areas through the present project. This was initiated in 2002 by BANSEFI in
coordination with other public sector agencies, including the CNBV and SAGARPA. The project was
fully in line with the Mexican policy of financial inclusion, and consistent with the Bank’s 2002-2004
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) central objective of broad-based, sustainable growth for poverty
reduction. By improving access to reliable financial services, especially those based on local savings, and
helping create sustainable financial intermediation networks in marginal rural areas, the project aimed to
alleviate a major constraint to social integration and rural development. The project built upon and
complemented past and ongoing Bank operations and analytical work in the financial and rural
development sectors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

6. The project was designed as a technical assistance operation. As stated in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), “The project’s main objective is to contribute to the integration of low-income people
into the national economy and to the realization of their income generating potential by increasing their
access to financial services. To this end, the project aims at improving the financial stability and outreach
capacity of savings and credit institutions (SCIs) nationwide, and especially at expanding financial
services in rural areas.? The key performance indicators, as indicated in Annex 1 of the PAD, are as
follows:

Sub-Project Development Objective            Key Performance Indicators
Sub-PDO 1: Sector institutions               Participating SCIs that qualify are certified by CNBV, and
strengthened and regulatory framework        procedures for liquidation of unviable SCIs initiated4; SCI
supportive of SCI development put in         sector infrastructure (information system) put in place; and
3
          PAHNAL, which was a decentralized organization of the federal government, had a 50-year history and
network of 590 branches focused exclusively on capturing deposits, mainly among small-scale clients, investing
their funds primarily in government debt securities, and providing nodes in the payment system often used to
distribute payments by the federal government.
4
  No physical target was mentioned in the PAD, although it was expected that 60% of the project-assisted entities
would be certified, namely, 240 entities out of about 385 entities receiving TA under the project, with about 1.1
million of the sector membership.

Sub-PDO 2: Access of rural                About 60,000 low-income families in marginal areas accessing
communities to sustainable financial      financial services provided by SCIs; Some 8,000 low-income
services is improved.                     families trained in financial matters; and Project institutions
                                          strengthened and certified under the law.
Sub-PDO 3: Studies, monitoring and        Sector consolidation plans understood by sector participants,
evaluation carried out and sector         developments assessed and used to reform policies and
information disseminated.                 programs.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

7. There was no change in the Project Development Objective (PDO). An Additional Financing (AF)
loan was approved in January 2008, which focused on scaling up activities related to improving the
outreach capacity of SCIs in marginal rural areas with the target being increased to about 440,000 low-
income families (up from 60,000 families).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8. The direct beneficiaries of the project were expected to be as follows:

        385 SCIs operating in rural and urban areas, with 1.8 million members (78 percent of sector
         membership), participating in the nationwide sector strengthening and consolidation program,
         and about 60 percent of these meeting the requirements for certification by CNBV (240 entities
         with about 1.1 million membership).
        Some 800 managers and senior staff of all institutions would benefit from training programs in
         accounting, credit analysis, risk management, governance, and other topics.
        Although not mandatory, all project institutions would be eligible to procure, and benefit from,
         the project supported information system services.
        Expanding the outreach of financial services in marginal rural areas was expected to benefit a
         total of some 60,000 low-income families, increased to 440,000 families with the AF loan. The
         target population was rural communities belonging to municipalities with very high, high and
         medium levels of marginality, as defined by CONAPO (Consejo Nacional de Población). The
         project design included provisions to cater to the specific needs of women and indigenous people.
        About 8,000 low-income families were to benefit from training programs in basic financial
         matters, including establishing linkages with the financial institutions.

9. The project was expected to indirectly benefit households which comprised of current and potential
clientele of SCIs, hailing primarily from low-middle income segments of rural areas which were for the
most part either not served or under-served by the banking sector. Consolidating the SCI sector and
building confidence in these intermediaries was expected to increase the number of households that used
their services. Households and micro-enterprises located in these marginal rural areas would also be able
to obtain access to secure, liquid savings instruments and to other financial services (such as lending and
payments services) at lower cost than those obtained from traditional informal service providers.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Consolidation of the Savings and Credit Institutions Sector (USD 40.01 million).
The aim of this component was to strengthen eligible SCIs nationwide and their supervising entities. This
was to be achieved by (a) carrying out an assessment of existing SCIs to determine whether they may
qualify for authorization by CNBV under the new law, and providing technical assistance to strengthen or
restructure eligible SCIs, and to liquidate unviable ones; (b) supporting the design and establishment of an
information system for the sector, to allow SCIs to generate and disseminate information for their own
use and that of sector regulatory bodies such as CNBV; (c) carrying out a training program for the staff of
SCIs; and (d) providing technical assistance and training to CNBV to strengthen its capacity to supervise
the SCI sector and to aid in the development and adaptation of corresponding regulations, and to
Federations in support of their auxiliary supervision role.

Component 2: Expanding Financial Services in Rural Areas (USD 26.18 million – increased to
USD 84.78 million with AF). The aim of this component was to expand the outreach of SCIs in selected
marginal areas. This was to be achieved by (a) providing technical assistance to individual SCIs to
support the design and implementation of regional development plans to allow them to sustainably
increase their outreach to low-income rural populations currently underserved by the financial services;
(b) providing training to low-income populations in these areas, to improve their capacity to link up with
financial institutions. This component, known as PATMIR, was originally targeted to selected
communities in seven out of eight regions of central and southern Mexico participating in the Marginal
Areas Program implemented by SAGARPA with support of the World Bank.

Component 3: SCI Sector Studies, Information Dissemination, Monitoring and Evaluation
(USD 5.69 million – increased to USD 6.29 million with AF). This component aimed at improving an
understanding of constraints affecting the provision of financial services to low-income clients, at
monitoring the effectiveness of policies and programs, and at developing financial innovations adapted to
Mexico. This was to include, inter alia, studies on financial intermediation, sector performance and
auxiliary supervision; workshops and information campaigns to inform stakeholders; and M&E of project
implementation and development of the SCI sector.

Component 4: Project Management (USD 4.88 million – increased to USD 5.78 million with AF).
This component supported the operations of a Core Team at BANSEFI, in charge of overall project
coordination, and of a Technical Unit in SAGARPA for implementation of Component 2.

1.6 Revised Components

10. The components were not revised during the implementation of the Project. The scope of
Component 2 was, however, expanded with the AF loan to cover marginal rural communities throughout
the country (PATMIR II). The AF loan also supported corresponding sector-related M&E studies and
project management arrangements.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

11. Reallocation of Funds. A reallocation of funds took place on March 9, 2007, which assigned funds
from the “Unallocated Category? to the remaining five expenditure categories. On October 11, 2007, a

                                                     4
second and final reallocation was made to realign the amounts allocated across the five expenditure
categories.

12. Closing Date Extensions. On November 23, 2007, the original closing date of December 1, 2007 was
extended to December 31, 2008 to process the AF loan to scale up the successful PATMIR I activities.
The AF loan was approved on January 17, 2008 for a three year period, with a closing date of February
28, 2011. To be concurrent with the AF loan, on November 13, 2008, the closing date of the original loan
was also extended to February 28, 2011.

13. Implementation Arrangements. In December 2010, a change was made in the project
implementation arrangements. The responsibility for implementing Component 2 was transferred from
SAGARPA to BANSEFI. This physical movement of the component implementation team to BANSEFI
took place in January 2011, weeks before project closing, and therefore an amendment to the Loan
Agreement to reflect this change was deemed unnecessary. The technical team in charge of Component 2
in SAGARPA and the corresponding budget allocations were transferred accordingly to BANSEFI to
pursue the execution of next phase of PATMIR.

14. Phase II Project. It became clear during the first 18 months of implementation (after the initial results
of the TA classification were available) that the institutional change expected was unachievable within the
two year time frame allowed by LACP and agreed to in the project. This would have required more time
and additional resources. Also, additional resources were required for the refinement of the technology
platform and its national roll-out. A Phase II project (focused only on technical assistance and the
technology platform) was approved by the Board in June 2004, and commenced implementation in
December 2005, synchronously with this project. It will close on July 31, 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15. Soundness of the background analysis. In the initial stages of preparation, the project was
conceived as a pilot Rural Microfinance TA project, consisting essentially of Components 2 and 3, which
was to be launched in the rural areas of Oaxaca and Huasteca, based on the experiences of the Marginal
Areas Program implemented by SAGARPA with assistance from the World Bank. Project design was
based on thorough analyses for these components. The PDO, its specific sub-objectives, and the
component design were entirely in line with the findings of the survey5 of marginal rural areas in the
Oaxaca and Huasteca regions carried out in 2000. Following the promulgation of the law, SAGARPA
requested the Bank’s support to: (a) restructure and redesign PATMIR to conform to the new approaches
for institutional strengthening to comply with the requirements of the law; and (b) expand the smaller
rural microfinance TA project planned for Oaxaca and Huasteca to cover six marginal areas.

16. During the later stages of project preparation, the government requested the Bank to include a TA
component to help implement and operationalize the then recently passed law for SCIs (LACP).
Strengthening SCIs nationwide and improving their supervision framework was undoubtedly an
appropriate and overdue objective. A census and survey of the financial intermediaries was made in 2001

        World Bank, June 2001. Mexico Rural Finance: Savings Mobilization Potential and Deposit Instruments in
Marginal Areas. Report No. 21286-ME.

                                                      5
to determine the number of entities in the sector and the nature of their operations in the rural areas. A
detailed analysis was made of the financial statements of a sample of 43 SCIs from two federations to
study their financial condition, and determine the broad scope and extent of TA required for SCI
strengthening. The sample SCIs probably represented the larger and better performing entities in the
sector, and even among these, based on pure financial requirements of capital adequacy and provisioning,
no more than a third would have been certified without project TA. The additional requirements of solid
internal control systems, governance mechanisms, operational manuals, among others, would have
reduced that number even further. The PAD expected a 60-80 percent certification rate6. Considering the
status of the entities and the limited time provided for strengthening, the TA effort was under-estimated,
and the target for certifiable entities ambitious.

17. For the SCI information system, a technical diagnostic study was done to develop a conceptual design
of the required technical architecture and a feasibility study. The study was comprehensive and described
the system both from an organizational and technical perspective. It contained a detailed description of
the critical data communication, processing, data management and application systems, business training
and equipment needs. Since this sub-component was introduced at a relatively late stage of project
preparation, and both the project cost and Bank support ceiling had already been approved, it was agreed
that this initiative would be spread over two phases, with this project covering the first phase activities. It
was clearly indicated in the PAD that there would be a second phase dealing with the refinement of the
system and its national rollout. It was also evident that the USD20 million allocated for this component
was inadequate to cover even the first phase expenses.

18. Assessment of the project design. The project design was sound and coherent. The PDO tackled a
major constraint to development and poverty alleviation, with clearly defined components and a good
synergy and complementarity between them. Through Component 1, the project supported the
government’s efforts to strengthen the overall SCI sector, so that sector institutions would be able to
provide secure and expanded services, with improved financial discipline and sustainability, and over
time, increase their coverage. In addition, because rural areas were seriously underserved and because of
the intrinsic problems in serving clients in this market, the project included a financial inclusion program
(Component 2) aimed at improving access of rural communities to sustainable financial services.
Component 3 carried out studies to inform on results, and possible need for change in approach.

19. Adequacy of government’s commitment. Government commitment was strong from the start of
the project and continued thereafter. Passage of the new law LACP showed the government’s
determination to overhaul the SCI sector, and adequate budgetary allocations were made to implementing
agencies throughout the project implementation period. However, political will to effectively enforce the
new law LACP has dwindled over the years in the course of project implementation. During project
preparation, communities in rural areas had clearly expressed their demand for assistance in establishing
savings and other financial mechanisms. The involvement and consultation of SCIs and other
practitioners in the elaboration of the new law was through the participation of COMACREP (Consejo
Mexicano de Ahorro y Crédito Popular), which was specially established in February 2001 as a reaction
to the legal reforms, to carry out the dialogue with official authorities on regulatory and developmental

6
  On page 35, it is expected that 80% (320 institutions) of project-assisted institutions would meet the certification
requirements. On page 41, it is expected that 60% (240 institutions) would emerge from the consolidation process
as certified entities. The analysis on page 41 is a lot more detailed and therefore renders the 60% certification target
a lot more credible.

issues. COMACREP was aslo involved in detailed project design. Successive drafts were prepared and
discussed among government agencies (SHCP, CNBV) taking into account various supervision models
and international experience.

20. Assessment of risks. Overall project risk was assessed as moderate at appraisal. The PAD lists as
many as nine potential risks. Most of these, however, are lower level risks mostly under control of
implementing agencies. A key risk - the political risk of a lack of effective enforcement of the reform
measures included in the new law LACP - was not envisaged in the PAD, but eventually materialized
through the repeated postponement of the deadline for mandatory certification and authorization of SCIs.

21. The PAD noted that the project was innovative and risky, as it sought to support a major reform in the
sector in a relatively short period of time. It also stated that the value added of Bank support in this
project, and more generally in Mexico, lay primarily in its technical guidance and contribution to the
dialogue on policy and support for institutional development. However, the project envisaged Bank
involvement at the implementation stage only in order to help SCIs meet the requirements of the law. The
project did not include any specific instrument for higher level policy dialogue and/or mitigation
measures to address issues which could potentially affect effective and timely enforcement of the new
law LACP during project implementation. The PAD made a provision for monitoring of law
implementation,7 but this related mainly to fine-tuning of some technical aspects of the law which had
been identified by the Bank as weak during project preparation.

2.2 Implementation

22. Project implementation benefited from very good teams in BANSEFI – which had overall
responsibility for project management and coordination, as well as implementation of Component 1 and
most of Component 3 – as well as SAGARPA, which was specifically in charge of implementing
Component 2 (PATMIR I and II) which eventually became the largest component of the project after
receiving the additional financing (AF) loan. Both teams were adequately staffed by highly qualified
personnel with strong academic credentials and experience. Many of these were involved in the project
from the preparation stage and remained stable during implementation, also receiving strong support from
their respective higher managements.

23. All key activities under the project were subcontracted by the executing agencies to technical
assistance providers with demonstrated experience in the implementation of programs similar to those
envisaged under the project. This intensive reliance on international technical assistance had a high cost
but also proved to be effective, as a result of the experience of the selected specialized firms, and also the
incentive and motivation to maintain their standards and international reputation. Project implementation
and coordination was effected at central level by the BANSEFI and SAGARPA teams. This
centralization allowed BANSEFI and SAGARPA to maintain consistency among the various TA
contracts, as well as ensuring adequate monitoring and evaluation and fostering the exchange of
experiences and best practices. Especially under Component 2, TA providers were encouraged to propose
their own methodologies at the bidding stage, and their contracts were paid on the basis of results.



7
         Annex 12 of the PAD includes a matrix to serve as a tracking device for progress and resolution of issues
and mitigation of risks associated with law implementation as part of regular Bank supervision.

                                                        7
24. Component 2 (PATMIR I) had an early start thanks to its thorough preparation, which had been
carried out jointly with the implementing agency (SAGARPA) and with technical support from the Bank
under the ongoing Marginal Areas Program. Nevertheless, the task of providing support to SCIs in
marginal and often remote areas to increase their outreach, while also getting them ready to comply with
the new law LACP, turned out to be more complex and time-consuming than initially expected. Due to
the experience gained in the implementation of PATMIR I, preparation of PATMIR II (additional
financing loan) was also very thorough.

25. The need for additional time to reach the project objectives was even more patent in the case of
Component 1. Meeting the requirements for SCIs’ certification under the new LACP proved to be a
much bigger task than initially expected, mainly due to the generally low financial status of many SCIs
and changes in the law. “D level?8 entities, defined as “those that are definitely not in a position to comply
with the minimum requisites to operate in conformity with the LACP and should be liquidated? created
political difficulties, especially as the way to deal with “D level? entities had not been clarified earlier.

26. Implementation of the information system for the SCI sector included in Component 1 was affected
by a range of issues, including inadequate allocation of funds under the project. At an early stage during
project implementation, it was considered necessary to increase the scope of this sub-component in order
to respond to the actual needs and requests of its potential users, transforming it into an integrated multi-
modular technology platform. Contractual difficulties took place with the main supplier, which were
eventually solved but generated delays in the availability of this service to participating SCIs. These and
other delays in enforcing the new LACP law translated into reduced interest and limited participation
from potential SCI users, affecting the financial viability of the technology platform.

27. Effective enforcement of the new LACP law was repeatedly postponed during the project
implementation period. This, together with some other changes in the legal and regulatory framework
particularly in 2009, had a significant impact on the implementation of Component 1, including
introducing variability and uncertainty in the SCI certification target (see Annex 10 for details). The
repeated postponement of the deadline for SCIs to comply with the Law (LACP), and now LRASCAP,
has affected the implementation of Component 1 and, in particular, achievement of its quantitative targets
in terms of number of certified SCIs. Some entities were basically ready for certification but postponed
their application in view of its costs; some others postponed their adjustment process in a “wait and see?
attitude; and yet some others were legally required to get certified at some point in time, and operated
within the law without certification during other times due to certification threshold changes.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28. M&E design. The original project results matrix (detailed in Annex 1 of the PAD) was overall
adequate, although it had some shortcomings. PDO outcome indicators for Sub-PDO 1 (strengthening of
SCI sector and a supportive regulatory framework put in place) include the effective certification of SCIs
by CNBV. The PAD did not provide a physical target for certified entities. With the benefit of hindsight,

8
  This refers to the entity classification based on the consultant diagnostics which determines their readiness for
certification. The classification process is complex, covers an array of factors across which the entity is graded, and
results in a numerical score. The classification structure is as follows: 80-100 points: B+; 60-80 points: B; 40-60
points: C; and <40 points: D. Entities already certified are classified as A.


                                                          8
intermediate outcome indicators could also have included, besides the number of SCIs strengthened,
indications on the corresponding volume of assets or membership under the ambit of certified SCIs..
However, the targets for these were implicitly 100 percent, since only certified SCIs would have been
able to continue their operations under the new LACP (with the others being either merged or liquidated).

29. M&E implementation and utilization. Data to monitor performance indicators for implementation
of Component 1 (number of SCIs assisted, classification results, entities certified and the corresponding
membership and assets) were regularly collected by TA service providers and reported to BANSEFI as
part of their contracts. BANSEFI also regularly did an evaluation of the size of the SCI sector, based on
information provided by the Federations and consultants’ reports. Similarly, detailed monitoring data on
the progress of implementation of Component 2 were regularly collected and reported by TA service
providers. PATMIR, implemented by SAGARPA, developed since its beginning a comprehensive
database to record, evaluate and make decisions on the evolution of PATMIR. During PATMIR I, this
consisted of periodic data collected from each of the 33 participating SCIs, giving information on their
size, scope of activities, financial performance, status of certification, new members added, including
giving details about women members and indigenous peoples’ share in membership, number of
transactions, incremental deposits, lending, among other aspects. Additional information was collected
about the TA service providers’ approach to membership generation, membership and management
perceptions through focus group discussions and face-to-face interviews, and risks and challenges. The
M&E system was extended to cover the expanded additional financing-based PATMIR II activities.

30. As part of Component 3, BANSEFI and SAGARPA collaborated in carrying out a detailed
household survey (four rounds), with follow-up of a sample of households and communities from 2003
till 2007 (section 3.2). Additionally, several studies were carried out focused on a range of aspects,
notable among these were those relating to institutional efficiencies, rural area credit bureau, perceptions
of recipients of remittances and government transfer payments, correspondent banking, BANSEFI’s
future strategic direction, development of rural population needs-oriented financial services and products.
All of these initiatives helped in determining the manner in which the rural population was supported by
the SCI sector. A list of the surveys and studies is provided as an attachment to Annex 2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31. Safeguard Compliance. The project was designed as a technical assistance operation and was
correspondingly given an Environmental Category C. Only one safeguard was triggered, the Indigenous
Peoples safeguard policy (OP 4.10). As identified during project preparation, indigenous populations of
various ethnic groups represented a high percentage of the rural populations in the marginal areas
included in Component 2 (PATMIR I). In accordance with the earlier OP 4.20, Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan (IPDP) was prepared for each region on the basis of a social analysis and a
consultation process with IP communities. Two of these initial IP studies carried out during project
preparation were the basis of the finalized Social Development Model proposed in the project. These
studies, along with the diagnostics studies for the regions, were given to the TA providers who finalized
the Action Plan for IPs and the technical assistance plans for the participating entities in their respective
regions during project implementation (PATMIR I). Under PATMIR II, the project continued to use the
detailed and comprehensive social analysis carried out for the seven regions covered under PATMIR I. At
the micro/entity-level, the project followed an IP Framework approach with IP Participation Plans
prepared and implemented by the TA providers. The SAGARPA implementation team reviewed

                                                     9
implementation of the IP Participation Plans. The Bank team, as part of its regular review process and a
final evaluation of the combined PATMIR component, also assessed compliance, which was found to be
satisfactory.

32. Fiduciary Compliance. The project stands out in the country portfolio with ratings for both financial
management and procurement being consistently satisfactory. No major fiduciary issues requiring
government or Bank attention emerged throughout the project implementation period, as corroborated by
audit reports and procurement post-reviews. On the procurement side, there were some issues with a main
supplier for the technology platform, which were satisfactorily resolved. Bank missions also
recommended some improvements to the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR), which were agreed with
BANSEFI and successfully implemented.

2.5 Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

33. A second phase operation was approved in June 2004 (effectiveness in December 2004).9 From 2005
onwards, this operation (Phase II project) was implemented in parallel with the present project. It had an
original closing date of July 31, 2009, which was revised to July 31, 2012. This Phase II project (with
two AF loans) has a total cost of USD 300.48 million (Bank loan USD 154.5 million), and was designed
to finance mainly the implementation of the second phase activities relating to the technology platform
developed under this project, together with an additional allocation to finance the underestimated TA
effort for the strengthening of the SCIs.

34. The present project and its follow-on Phase II project were largely implemented in parallel. Some TA
contracts to strengthen SCIs under Component 1, concluded under the first project, were extended to
continue activities under Phase II funding. For these reasons, and because activities were basically the
same and carried out in a continuum, except for the PATMIR outreach program which was entirely
financed under the present first project (PATMIR I – original project; and PATMIR II – additional
financing), it is indeed a challenge to distinguish the specific results, outcomes or outputs of the Phase II
project from those of this project. Therefore, the Project Outcomes for Component 1 described in next
section are in essence the result of activities carried out in both phases.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

35. The objectives and design of the project remain highly relevant, and they are still fully consistent with
current national development plans and the Country Partnership Strategy 2008-2013. Access to financial
services in Mexico has made progress but still remains a challenge. The Mexican financial sector remains
small relative to the size of the economy. Although the commercial branch infrastructure in Mexico has
expanded relative to its 2005 levels, particularly following recent reforms permitting banking through
agents, it is still below levels seen in comparable countries such as Chile and even Guatemala. Moreover,
the banking infrastructure is very unevenly distributed within the country. Financial inclusion remains
high in the development agenda in Mexico in particular for marginal rural areas as a means of integrating
poor households in the national economy and enabling them to realize their income-generating potential.

36. The SCI sector has continued to experience substantial growth in recent years. It currently consists of
an estimated 880 SCIs with a membership of about 8.7 million in 2010 (more than a threefold increase in
membership from estimates of year 2000). Compared to the banking sector, the SCIs have a wider
coverage and deeper penetration in marginal areas. It is estimated that they have 60 percent of their
branches in small, semi-urban and rural localities of up to 50,000 inhabitants. In contrast, only 13 percent
of the branches of commercial banks are established in such localities. Progress still has to be made to
effectively implement the regulatory framework for the SCI sector. This is a priority given the growing
size of the sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Objective 1: Consolidation of the SCI sector (Sector institutions strengthened and regulatory
framework supportive of SCI development put in place): Rating: Satisfactory

37. Number of SCIs certified, merged/liquidated: At project closing, 99 entities have been certified by
CNBV, and an additional 56 are either under consideration by CNBV or ready for certification, satisfying
all legal requisites. While the achievement is below the original (inferred) target of about 240 SCIs to be
certified under the project, this original target had been set to cover approximately 60 percent of total
assets and total membership of the industry. The actual 155 entities represent 77 percent of sector
membership (6.7 million) and assets (MXN 77 billion), therefore achieving the intended target. Another
138 entities are almost ready for certification, accounting for an additional 8 percent of sector membership
and 10 percent of sector assets. The certification status at project closing is provided in Table 1 (next
page).

38. As indicated earlier, the reduced number of certified SCIs has been mainly due to the changes in the
law from time to time. Initially, there was no asset threshold for certification, and 60 percent appraisal
certification target was based on all project-assisted entities requiring certification to remain operational.
In 2007, this threshold was raised to UDIs 6.5 million (equivalent to USD 2 million). This suddenly
made certification unnecessary for over 70 percent of the sector entities. A large number of entities that
had received TA under the project were no longer legally required to be certified. Likewise,
postponement in the deadline for certification resulted in some entities delaying certification to avoid
supervision costs, and others, particularly cooperatives, adopting a “wait-and-watch? attitude for a new
and perhaps more pliant law for financial cooperatives. This threshold was once again revised in 2009 to
UDIs 2.5 million (equivalent to USD 600 thousand). Close to 50 percent of the sector entities have an
asset base below this certification threshold and can operate without requiring certification from CNBV.

39. In terms of actual operational performance, certified entities, or entities near-ready for certification,
meet the financial standards prescribed by the prudential regulations for sustainable financial
intermediaries. For the authorized entities, arrears as a percentage of total lending averaged at
7.29 percent for cooperatives and 10.66 percent for SOFIPOS, provision for loan loss average at about
100 percent, return on assets was 2 percent for cooperatives and 2.9 percent for SOFIPOS, and the level
of capitalization average at 188 percent for cooperatives and 238 percent for SOFIPOS. Annex 11
provides detailed information on the principal financial indicators and their improvement over time.

40. Through their transformation into regulated intermediaries, the project-assisted SCIs (and these
constitute a large part of the sector) have demonstrated remarkable growth over the last seven years
(2003-2010, amounts in nominal terms) of project assistance, as follows:

    (a) Members served: increased by 300 percent from 1.8 million to 7.2 million members; as a
        percentage of Economically Active Population, from 4.3 percent to 15.0 percent;
    (b) Deposits: grew from MXN15.5 billion to MXN68.8 billion, which implies an annual average
        growth rate of about 18.5 percent in real terms;
    (c) Lending: has maintained more or less the same growth trend, with total lending increasing from
        MXN14.0 billion to about MXN65.0 billion;
    (d) Assets: increased from MXN19.7 billion to MXN87.0 billion demonstrating an annual average
        growth rate of 18.4 percent in real terms;
    (e) Assets as a percentage of the Gross National Product: grew from 0.28 percent to 0.67 percent;
    (f) Number of branches: grew from 946 to 2,749, implying a growth rate of 190 percent.

41. More importantly, those project-assisted SCIs which received in-depth technical assistance, but have
not been certified, have also substantially improved their performance over the years, including having
homogeneous accounting systems, uniform manuals, methodologies and tools which meet international

                                                        12
standards. The quality of management in the entities has improved, with about 6,800 SCI and federation
staff having been trained through 340 courses relating to accounting, credit analyses, accounting
migration, and governance aspects (more than 5,000 under this project).

42. Supervision Framework put in place. The SCI supervision department of the regulatory agency,
CNBV, has been significantly strengthened through training, exposure visits, and workshops and
seminars to deepen knowledge about auxiliary supervision, deposit protection, early warning system, risk
management, and other related aspects. Supervision Committees have been established, and certified in
all 13 authorized federations under LACP of 2001. The project TA provider was designated by CNBV
as the only agency authorized to train and certify supervisors. Close to 205 supervisors were trained and
certified under the project, and re-certified every two years as required by law. The quality of supervision
was further enhanced and focused clearly on deficient areas in the SCIs through the following initiatives:
(a) diagnosis of the operation of the supervision committees for certified federations; (b) implementation
of improvement plans for the operational supervision committees; (c) workshops on shared areas of SCI
improvement identified by the committees; and (d) assistance in the definition and updating of the
supervision manual and its tools, as well as workshops for presenting these tools to federations.

43. Resulting from the LRASCAP of 2009, financial cooperatives have to reregister and be affiliated to
cooperative federations only. Some LACP federations cannot remain authorized with the exit of the
cooperative members since they are unable to meet the minimum membership requirement. A
restructuring of the federations is taking place, with an expected 3 federations remaining authorized under
LACP and about 20 under LRASCAP. While federations under LACP are mandated to perform
supervision of member entities, cooperative federations under LRASCAP cannot; this will be done
through the national level Supervision Committee with six branches at the regional level. The capacity
created in the members of the 13 existing LACP federation supervision committees is getting
redistributed among the 3 LACP supervision committees, and the supervision structure under
LRASCAP. The project pool of available trained and certified supervisors has enabled the regulatory
authority to quickly adjust to the legal changes and to continue to maintain the existing high quality of
sector supervision.

44. SCI Information System operational. Initially, the information system was intended mainly to enable
SCIs to provide required financial reports to CNBV as their supervisor, and to other relevant government
agencies. It was planned that the project would finance the design and development of the basic
infrastructure and software, and the provision of services to about 100 SCIs. National roll-out of the
system would be funded under a follow-on second phase operation, in accordance with the expected pace
of SCI strengthening. It was expected that a fee-for-service cost recovery mechanism would be put
gradually in place (by the end of the fifth year of operation, which sets the year 2012 as the deadline).

45. During implementation, based on an SCI survey at project commencement, the concept of a limited
function information technology pilot was modified to satisfy the needs of SCI users who wished to have
a single system also catering to a range of other operating needs. Thus the concept of cost recovery just
from SCIs to finance the platform became redundant. BANSEFI became the main user of the platform.
With 66 progressive SCIs participating in the platform, it became apparent that the sector SCIs would not
be able to generate enough transactions to support the platform. There was a strategic shift in the focus
and use of the platform by diversifying it to provide financial services such as remittances, electronic



                                                    13
payments, government transfer payments, among others. This generated enough revenue streams to
finance the operating cost of the platform. The platform is self-financing today.

46. At closing, the project had developed a full scale modular banking services platform for the entities,
while at the same time serving as an engine on which several of new financial products could be
introduced – remittances (national and international), government program transfers, debit cards with
fingerprinting facility, payment services, risk management, prevention of money laundering,
correspondent banking, and soon to be introduced mobile phone banking. The platform is expected to
revolutionize the way financial services are offered to, and accessed by, the rural (and urban) sector
clients. Realization of cost-saving and service improvement has been possible in BANSEFI operations
as well, both at headquarters and its 488 branches. 66 SCIs using the platform have been able to reduce
costs, generate regulatory reports, manage their operations, and open additional branches resulting from
the real-time transactions accounting possible with the platform.

47. Some indicators of the outreach and depth of the platform are provided below:

    (a) BANSEFI operations: The platform is servicing about 9.3 million BANSEFI clients with 6.2
    million accounts. It is supporting 488 branches, 6,356 point of sale terminals, and 30 ATMs.
    BANSEFI issued about 11.5 million debit cards (close to 15 percent of the market). About 1,350
    users log into the system every day executing about 450,000 transactions;
    (b) SCI operations: About 66 SCIs are using the platform for all of their operational, management,
    accounting, monitoring and reporting requirements. Almost all of these entities are certified and form
    a part of the 99 SCIs certified by CNBV. As such, a large portion of the 7.2 million sector
    membership benefits from the computerized services offered by the platform;
    (c) BANSEFI-SCI network: This is an association of about 286 SCIs with 1,846 branches led by
    BANSEFI with its own 488 branches to offer a range of financial services and products to the rural
    population. These services include electronic payments, national and international remittances,
    distribution of government transfer payments, micro-insurance, foreign exchange, among others. As
    an illustration, BANSEFI works with about 60 US remittance companies to either move funds in cash
    or directly into the recipient accounts in Mexico. It has close to 4 percent of the US-Mexico
    remittance market. With about 1.5 million remittance transactions at an average amount of USD500,
    about USD1 billion in remittances alone was handled by the network in 2010. Close to 15 million
    electronic payment transactions were made in 2010; and
    (d) Government transfer payments: Five government programs are now covered by the platform for
    distribution, reaching out to about 4.5 million recipients with 20 million transactions annually, and
    distributing about USD2 billion.

48. In terms of financial sustainability, the revenues generated by the platform from government fee
relating to distribution of transfer payments, partial fee recovery provided by the SCIs that are using the
platform (partial recovery), fee from remittances, and the notional savings in operating cost relating to
BANSEFI operations cover the operating cost of the platform.

Objective 2: Expanding Financial Services in Rural Areas (Access of rural communities to
sustainable financial services is improved): Rating: Satisfactory

49. New Member Creation. PATMIR, implemented as Component 2 of the project, has exceeded
expectation.. A total of 620,884 new clients (141% of aggregate PATMIR I and II target) gained access to
financial services in selected marginal rural areas as a result of the project.

50. PATMIR has contributed to elevate considerably the overall quality of the SCI sector strengthening
approach, its geographical and social coverage, and its financial performance. In its almost 10 years of
operation, PATMIR has been extended to 1,413 municipalities (out of a total of 2,435 for the whole
country) of which 1,027 (73 percent) are of high or very high degree of marginality.10 It is estimated that
PATMIR has reached 9 percent of the economically active population in localities with less than
15 thousand percent inhabitants. Participating SCIs received high quality technical assistance under the
project, focused on market analysis, financial education, financial products and services, deepening
penetration and outreach, rural and marginal areas, women and indigenous populations. Moreover, the
project has induced the creation or adaptation of methodological innovations to serve rural marginal areas
in a cost-effective manner, such as the use of “pocket PCs? for data entry in the field, and the adoption of
zoning techniques to define financially viable service routes.

51. Out of the 33 SCIs assisted under PATMIR I, 9 had obtained certification by the end of this first stage
of the program, with the remaining having a B+/B classification. Under PATMIR II, out of 121 SCIs
assisted, 38 financial cooperatives were certified by the end of the project, and the remaining 83 SCIs had
B+/B classification, indicating that these entities were ready/near-ready for certification.

52. Financial Education of Low-income families and Linkage with Financial Institutions. Achievement
of this outcome has also exceeded project expectations. Although PATMIR I explicitly indicated a target
of 8,000 low-income families, early on during the implementation of the program, it became apparent that
dissemination of information by the TA providers about the financial institution that they represented, the
financial services and products that were offered and their benefits, household level financial planning
and the use of savings and lending products, among others, was central to the mobilization of the new
membership. Only after the potential clients were convinced about the usefulness of becoming members
would they be willing to provide their membership contribution to the institution. In PATMIR I, all of the
194,130 new members added to the sector were provided education and exposed to a range of relevant
financial topics. No explicit target was set for PATMIR II for financial education as this was embedded

  The index of marginality is a summary measure based on nine socio-economic indicators allowing to measure
social exclusion.

in the TA effort. Overall, therefore, all of the 620,884 new members benefited from TA provider initiated
financial education, surpassing the target of 8,000 low-income families.

Objective 3: Studies, Monitoring and Evaluation and Information Dissemination: Rating:
Satisfactory

53. Under Component 3, several studies were conducted mainly at household and community level with
a main focus on understanding constraints and measuring benefits of improved access to financial
services for low-income rural populations. This included a household panel survey with four rounds
conducted from 2003-2007, with the collaboration of SAGARPA and BANSEFI. Data from this panel
survey gave rise to several publications and useful findings in particular for the design of field
interventions to foster financial inclusion in marginal rural areas.11 Qualitative assessment studies on the
PATMIR component were also carried out. Some studies were conducted at the beginning of the project
in 2002-2004 (cost of financial transactions in the SCI sector, technical efficiency of SCIs, performance
of federations) and others in the later years (new products development for SCIs, remittances, credit
bureau, needs and preferences of the sector clients/members, among others). Studies specifically related
to the activities of BANSEFI (evaluation of BANSEFI as the sector promoter, BANSEFI’s vision and
strategy, correspondent banking, among others) were also undertaken. Dissemination activities have
significantly contributed to fostering understanding by the main stakeholders of the new legal framework
introduced under the LACP. A market survey was conducted in 2003, on the basis of which a media
campaign was designed and implemented through a variety of means such as leaflets, media spots and
caravans. Revised dissemination campaigns were also carried out focused on subsequent amendments to
the law in 2007. A list of surveys and studies, and dissemination activities are provided as an attachment
to Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

54. The economic analysis of technical assistance interventions is particularly difficult to quantify due to
problems of attribution, multiple-generation effects, and the lack of financial flows generated from project
investments, among others. For these reasons, it was agreed at the Decision Meeting that the PAD would
not include a quantified economic analysis, but instead a qualitative assessment and discussion of
expected benefits at three distinct levels: (a) institutional level; (b) fiscal implications; and (c) client level
benefits.

55. At the institutional level, results of the classification of SCIs attended under the project (section 3.2),
which account for the bulk of membership and assets in the sector, clearly demonstrate that these entities
have considerably improved their financial and organizational performance. They also benefit from
economies of scale, in particular those that increased their membership as a result of PATMIR.

56. At the fiscal level, the main immediate impact of the project consists in investment costs associated
with the project. All activities and entities supported under the project are expected to be self-financing
over time. Although investment costs for SCI strengthening under Component 1 are significantly higher
than expected, it can be reasonably assumed that economic benefits will outweigh these costs, as a solid
and reliable SCI sector with expanded outreach will make an important contribution to social and
economic development.
11
        It was decided to stop this panel survey in 2008, due to attrition of the sample and endogeneity issues.

                                                         16
57. At individual client or household level, increased access to reliable financial services for low-income
people enables them to benefit from adequate and secure savings and liquidity management instruments,
which protect the value of their deposits. Before the project, most households did not have access to
formal deposit services. Many of them held assets in informal financial mechanisms, or kept savings in
physical assets easily convertible to cash but subject to losses such as livestock. As they are now
depositing their savings with the SCI, safety and return are enhanced, interest income is earned while
building creditworthiness. SCI members also have access to other services from their institution, in
particular credit at a more reasonable price than informal lending. Other services include access to formal
remittances services, reduced transaction costs on the distribution of government transfer programs, and
the purchase of other financial products such as insurance.

58. At the client/member level, the three main transaction cost savers have been remittances, government
transfers, and benefits from enhanced deposits and lower loan rates. An indicative order-of-magnitude
benefit to the membership is shown below (although not used for the assessment of economic viability of
the project):

    (a) Government transfer cost to recipients reduced by about MXN 75 per recipient for 4.5 million
    recipients (or about MXN330 million; USD30 million) for government programs, and about MXN
    15 for remittances per transaction for about 1.5 million transactions (MXN22 million;
    USD2 million). Just these two services would have saved the recipients about USD32 million each
    year or about USD120 million over the last 4 years.
    (b) The incremental return on deposits (which fetch about 5% per annum on average) of MXN2
    billion (USD175 million) on a base of MXN55 billion of incremental deposits.
    (c) Borrowing from the formal sector would have generated interest rate savings across the board
    (cooperatives charge about 24% per year as opposed to micro-finance institutions such as
    Compartamos which charges up to 100% per year), and additional revenues would have accrued
    from productive income-generating investments.

    59. For this ICR, an attempt has been made to quantify the economic viability of the main component
    of the project, Component 2, which deals with the implementation of PATMIR and represents close
    to 60 percent of the total project costs. For this purpose, a least-return (or break even) analysis has
    been tested. Under this approach, a set of minimum benefits that must be generated by the project
    component in order to justify its costs (IRR of more than 12 percent) are determined and the
    feasibility of obtaining these benefits is assessed.

60. Based on actual investment costs under PATMIR, in order to justify economically this component of
the project, it would be necessary to assume that at least 46 percent of the savings of new PATMIR
members would be “re-invested? to generate an IRR of 12 percent over a 15 year period. This is higher
than the overall percentage of SCI credits that is typically used for productive investment (22.1 percent
based on data from household surveys carried out under PATMIR I). However, other types of credit uses
– and, more generally, the availability of secure savings for PATMIR members – also generate economic
returns, although they are more difficult to quantify (e.g. improved health resulting in fewer unproductive
days; improved education and literacy resulting in productivity increase; etc.). Another way to look at the
“minimum necessary? benefits to justify investment in Component 2 is that the required “net economic



                                                    17
productivity increase? per new PATMIR member would have to amount to at least MXN 218 (about
USD 19) per year for himself and his family. This appears to be achievable.

3.4 Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory

61. As detailed above, project design and objectives remain highly relevant, most PDO indicators were
either achieved or successfully exceeded. The sub-objective of consolidating the SCI sector (in terms of
number of entities) has been partly achieved due to postponement of the effective enforcement of a
comprehensive regulatory framework for the SCI sector, despite the issuance of a new law LACP before
project start-up. Nonetheless, a substantial number of SCIs accounting for the bulk of membership and
assets in the sector have been considerably strengthened under the project. The largest component of the
project, which consists of expanding outreach in marginal rural areas, has been very successful with
620,000 new families obtaining access to financial services. Monitoring and evaluation and studies have
been carried out under the project, which enabled to improve practices in the field. Despite
methodological limitations, there are positive indications of economic efficiency.

3.5 Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

62. Poor rural or semi-urban areas and low-income clients are naturally targeted under the overall project.
PATMIR (Component 2) had an explicit focus on social inclusion for marginal rural populations, which
it successfully achieved under the original project (PATMIR I) and maintained under the additional
financing (PATMIR II). Both stages of the program operated in rural communities (less than 15,000
inhabitants) belonging to municipalities with very high, high and medium levels of marginality.12 The
program incorporated a large proportion of women and indigenous population of various ethnic groups
into the formal financial sector. Women featured high in PATMIR, accounting for about 53 percent of the
total number of new clients generated by the program. PATMIR I operated in selected regions of central
and southern Mexico with a high concentration of indigenous population (accounting for about 72
percent of total indigenous population in Mexico). About 29 percent of the new clients of the SCIs
supported under PATMIR I were indigenous peoples. With the country-wide extension of PATMIR II
(adding new areas accounting for the balance of 28 percent of indigenous population), about 18 percent of
new members were indigenous peoples.

     (b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

63. The entire project was geared to institutional strengthening and capacity building. Its achievements
are already described above.




12
         In Mexico, marginality if officially measured by an index that combines features related to levels of
education, occupation, housing, and access to public services with other indicators, at the level of each municipality
and community. According to the Consejo Nacional de Población (CONAPO), there are five levels of marginality,
namely very high, high, medium, low and very low. The first three levels of marginality are used for targeting public
interventions in poor communities.

                                                         18
    (c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

64. One outcome of the project that was unintended is that the project made a significant contribution to
strengthening BANSEFI and solidifying its role and position vis-à-vis the SCI sector. The role assigned to
BANSEFI, in line with its official mandate, was to coordinate support to the SCI sector and
implementation of Components 1 and 3. Although the official mandate of BANSEFI also includes the
provision of banking services to SCIs, as well as the promotion of savings through its own network of
over 500 branches, the project did not envisage to strengthen these activities. One exception was the
information system, which was to be managed by BANSEFI, but mainly intended to enable SCIs to
comply with their reporting requirements to CNBV under the new law. The delayed enforcement of the
SCIs regulatory framework (LACP and now LRASCAP) has indirectly contributed to reinforcing the
position of BANSEFI. The development of a comprehensive technology platform under the follow-on
Phase II project is, at the same time, supporting the operations of BANSEFI’s own branches while also
allowing it to offer other financial services to SCIs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops – N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Rating: Moderate

65. The financial viability and prospects for sustainability of individual SCIs participating in the project
have considerably improved as a result of technical assistance and training provided under the project to
these entities and their federations. Reliance on savings from their members for lending is also a
characteristic of the SCI sector which fosters sustainability. With the supervision structure in place,
assisted by Early Warning Systems, regular reporting, among others, the viability of institutions will be
under closer scrutiny than before these came within the ambit of regulation. Even for entities that do not
require certification, periodic reporting will enable federations and CNBV to monitor their performance
and growth parameters. Since close to 77 percent of the sector assets are now covered by SCIs that are
certified, the risk for the sector consolidation is rather small. and focused on the SCIs that require
mandatory certification but still operate uncertified. For the financial cooperative sector, the risk relates to
three specific areas: (a) the new cooperative federations that are being created under the LRASCAP may
not be able to mature into their expected function of representation of the cooperatives, provision of back-
office support, and guidance and technical assistance to cooperatives soon enough; (b) the Supervision
Committee established for the cooperatives at the national level with regional offices may take some time
to become fully operational; and (c) entities that do not require mandatory certification (below the
certification threshold) may not be able to afford technical assistance so vital to their operational
improvement. These aspects are being addressed in the next phase of BANSEFI project.

66. The operating costs of the technology platform, which was developed under this project and a follow-
on Phase II project, are presently covered by the fees received by BANSEFI for the distribution of
government transfers such as the Oportunidades program, and incomes from other banking operations
such as remittances which also use the technology platform. The SCIs that use the technological platform
do not pay the full corresponding costs of this service. While this may well be entirely justified from a
development point of view, cross-subsidization between development support to SCIs and BANSEFI’s
own regular banking operations lacks transparency and may ultimately jeopardize the competitiveness of
BANSEFI’s own banking operations.



                                                      19
67. From the technical perspective, the platform as it exists today has been functional for several years,
and some of its equipment has a vintage dating back to 2000. BANSEFI's mainframe is now almost 10
years old, way beyond the industry standard of 5-6 years, and is due for replacement. Additionally, the
number of transactions processed has increased from just 26 million in 2006 to 60 million in 2011, with
on-line transactions growing from 22 million to 43 million during the same period. This has obviously
stretched the utilization of the mainframe capacity, and the memory and processing capacity of the
midrange servers which could result in a system failure. An upgrade, both for the applications package
and the hardware, which is a normal requirement in any industry resulting from business growth, is a
priority need for the platform. This is also being addressed through the next phase of BANSEFI project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

    (a) Ensuring Quality at Entry: Rating: Satisfactory

68. As noted in section 2.1, the quality at entry was satisfactory. The Bank provided substantial technical
support for project preparation, in the context of other ongoing operations and strong sector analytical
work. With regard to Component 1, a number of risks associated with the new legislation were discussed
with government authorities during project preparation and steps were taken to mitigate these risks and/or
establish monitoring devices during project implementation. However, the project lacked a specific
instrument and/or provisions for higher level policy dialogue during implementation. The time and costs
needed to effectively strengthen the SCI sector and the information system were also underestimated.

    (b) Quality of Supervision: Rating: Satisfactory

69. The Bank supervision missions provided hands-on and pragmatic support to project implementation,
helping solve issues as they arose in a flexible way, while maintaining good dialogue with
implementation agencies. All of the missions were well-staffed, having a banking sector technology
expert and a social specialist, and led by an overall rural financial sector policy specialist. A second phase
project was conceived at an opportune time, and an additional loan for this project was prepared to scale
up the successful financial inclusion (PATMIR) component. There was a strong focus on assistance to
the client on the technical issues of the technology platform, on monitoring and evaluation, and safeguard
and fiduciary compliance. However, with the postponement of the deadline for certification, changes in
LACP, and the introduction of LRASCAP in August 2009, Bank supervision could have reduced the
target for the number of certified SCIs.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Rating: Satisfactory

70. The overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory, in line with the same ratings for quality at entry
and supervision.




                                                     20
5.2 Borrower

       (a) Government Performance: Rating: Moderately Satisfactory13

71. Government commitment was strong from the start of the project and continued thereafter. Passage of
the new law LACP showed the government’s determination to overhaul the SCI sector, and adequate
budgetary allocations were made to implementing agencies throughout the project implementation
period. However, political will to effectively enforce the LACP dwindled over the years in the course of
project implementation, and the introduction of a new parallel LRASCAP affected the project
implementation performance.

       (b) Implementing Agency (or Agencies) Performance: Rating: Highly Satisfactory

72. The two project teams, at BANSEFI and SAGARPA, provided excellent leadership and direction to
the project. The teams were adequately staffed, committed and effective. They achieved excellent
collaboration between the two different institutions.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Rating: Satisfactory

73. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory. Notwithstanding the limitations noted
above, the Borrower showed commitment to the project objectives during the preparation phase and
followed through during implementation, including through strong counterpart funding, a follow-on
second phase project, and an additional loan to scale up the PATMIR component.

6. Lessons Learned

74. The following lessons are among the most important:

        An unregulated and unsupervised rural financial sector will most likely be composed of a range
       of entities with varying levels of acceptance relating to accounting, reporting, management and
       monitoring, internal controls, governance and other aspects. It is also highly likely that a fairly large
       proportion of the sector participants will have less than adequate financial and operating performance.
       A technical assistance effort focused on sector entity improvement has necessarily to be a medium-to-
       long term initiative, ranging between 4-6 years, for it to produce solid institutions. This becomes
       even more important when dealing with financial cooperatives which have a strong social and
       political base, making reform considerably more difficult.
        Governments should allow for a longer lead time for the entities to get certified and encompassed
       under a regulatory framework. Invariably, there is an optimistic expectation that the hitherto
       unregulated entities would be able to comply with the requirements of the new law with ease and in a
       relatively short period of time. The original law in Mexico expected this to happen in two years.
       Bolivian government expected results in 12 months. Postponement in the deadlines for compliance
       invariably results in the law losing credibility, with many entities continuing to operate in violation of
       the law.

13
     The Ministry of Finance indicated that this rating should have been “Satisfactory?. The ICR team explained that
     the rating was influenced largely by the extent to which the government supported the implementation of the law,
     which delayed the reform of the sector entities.

                                                          21
    An operation aiming to support the implementation of a major sector reform should include
   milestones for effective policy implementation, specific provisions or instruments for high level
   policy dialogue with government authorities and/or mitigation measures in case of delayed or
   inadequate implementation of the policy or law. This would be particularly relevant in cases where
   the law has been recently passed, and there are uncertainties about the potential for satisfactory
   implementation of the legal or regulatory framework.
    Where the sector consists of a large number of entities which are poorly performing and most
   likely need to be merged or liquidated, the political ramifications emanating from liquidation could
   easily jeopardize the sector consolidation process, and where supported, the process could be painful
   and time-consuming, and the use of internationally reputed consultants could impart transparency and
   credibility to the process.
    The technology platform is a crucial requirement to bring the sector entities together as an inter-
   connected network of rural financial intermediaries. This also enables the entities to offer a range of
   financial products and services that they would individually be unable to do. More importantly, it is
   ambitious to expect all sector entities to embrace the platform or to be able to contribute transaction
   volumes (and user fees) high enough to finance the full operating cost of the platform. These have to
   be cross-subsidized in a transparent manner in the nature of a public good with the objective of
   financial inclusion of some of the poorest sections of the population. This has been the
   recommendation of several internationally renowned microfinance practitioners.
    In order to reach low-income households where literacy rates are low and functional literacy is
   practically nonexistent, efforts need to be made in the area of social intermediation. Awareness
   raising and assistance at the community level are therefore essential to improve the likelihood of
   successful access to rural financial services.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and Partners

75. The implementing agency, BANSEFI, collaborated closely with the Bank in the preparation of this
ICR. The first draft was shared with BANSEFI in early September 2011. Comments were received
from all component implementing departments and incorporated into a revised draft. Comments
were then invited on the final draft in late October 2011. BANSEFI had no further comments,
and the Ministry of Finance commented on the final draft with some editorial suggestions in
November 2011. Their final comment (November 9, 2011) is reproduced below:

“the project has been very important for BANSEFI and has all the support from the Ministry of Finance,
hence the new loan we have been working on. We would rate the project satisfactory or highly
satisfactory, given the exceeded outcomes, but it is the Bank’s report.?

  Component 1: Consolidation of the Savings and Credit Institutions Sector
  (USD 40.01 million)

  The aim of Component 1 was to strengthen eligible SCIs nationwide and their supervising
  entities. This was to be achieved by (i) carrying out an assessment of existing SCIs to determine
  whether they may qualify for authorization by CNBV under the new law, and providing
  technical assistance to strengthen or restructure eligible SCIs, and to liquidate unviable ones;
  (ii) supporting the design and establishment of an information system for the sector, to allow
  SCIs to generate and disseminate information for their own use and that of sector regulatory
  bodies such as CNBV; (iii) carrying out a training program for the staff of SCIs; and
  (iv) providing technical assistance and training to CNBV to strengthen its capacity to supervise
  the SCI sector and to aid in the development and adaptation of corresponding regulations, and to
  Federations in support of their auxiliary supervision role.

management and staff on finance, accounting,
risk management, credit analysis and                                 (Target exceeded)
governance.
Output 8: CNBV supervision system put in            Supervision    Supervisory framework
place and supervision carried out.               system functional established and operational
                                                                   (Target achieved)


                                                  26
Output 1: 290 SCIs were assisted under the technical assistance program in 2003 and a
maximum of 417 in 2005. SCIs entering the TA program were assessed and classified in four
categories, with periodic re-evaluation for those that remained in the program (not certified). At
project closing, a total of some 331 SCIs were in the technical assistance program.

Output 2: An estimated 376 SCIs which benefited from TA had action plans prepared and
implemented by the technical assistance providers, resulting in accounting systems which
conform to international standards, internal controls, improved governance, improved
operational and financial indicators, management reporting, regulatory reporting, among other
things. These are the SCIs that have either been certified, or that obtained conditional extension
in December 2005 for technical assistance during the period 2006-2008.

Output 3: The law allows the assisted entities to move ahead with merger/liquidation either
through BANSEFI or other approved agencies. This resulted in a sharing of the project target
between the agencies. The project facilitated merger of 22 SCIs and liquidation of 3 SCIs.
FONAES has already facilitated merger of 40 SCIs and another 34 are in process. A number of
liquidation requests have been carried out directly by FIPAGO after the SCIs shut down their
operations (numbers unknown).

Output 4: The information system initially envisaged has been expanded into an integrated
technology platform used by both the SCIs (66 SCIs for their full requirements and 286 to offer
financial services/products as a part of the BANSEFI/SCI network), and BANSEFI (including its
488 branches) and offers a range of new financial products and services. As anticipated at
appraisal, this has been achieved through resources under this project and the follow-on second
phase project.

Output 5: The technology platform has been developed into a much larger undertaking than
initially planned. The number of SCIs that use it is lower than originally planned, but it has been
fully adopted by BANSEFI and its 488 branches, and has expanded its use from a mere
information system to a platform which offers a range of new financial services which has
deepened financial inclusion (adding close to 7 million new members at BANSEFI for
government transfer payments) and reduced transaction costs for users (for example, for
international remittances). While 66 SCIs are using the platform for their complete accounting
and information needs, 286 SCIs with close to 1,846 branches/points of service are using the
platform as a part of the BANSEFI/SCI network to offer a range of financial services.

Output 6: At present, SCI users pay a portion of the cost. The distribution of government
transfers (such as Oportunidades) through the BANSEFI branches using the technology platform
is a main source of income to cover operating costs of the technology platform. At appraisal, it
was clearly indicated that although a cost recovery program would be initiated, only actual
experience would indicate whether these subsidies would be of a temporary or permanent nature.

Output 7: Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 340 training courses and workshops were
implemented on topics as diverse as prudential regulations issued by CNBV, accounting, credit
analyses, accounting migration, prevention of money-laundering, risk management, governance



                                                27
and internal controls, among others. Total attendance was almost 7,000 persons, consisting of
managers, employees and staff of over 400 SCIs and authorized federations.

Output 8: The regulatory agency, CNBV, has been significantly strengthened through training,
exposure visits, and workshops and seminars to deepen knowledge about auxiliary supervision,
deposit protection, early warning system, risk management, and other related aspects.
Supervision Committees have been established, certified in all 13 authorized federations under
LACP of 2001, and operational. Resulting from the LRASCAP of 2009, financial cooperatives
have to reregister and be affiliated to cooperative federations only. Some LACP federations
cannot remain authorized with the exit of the cooperative members since they are unable to meet
the minimum membership requirement. A restructuring of the federations is taking place, with
an expected 3 federations remaining authorized under LACP and about 20 under LRASCAP.
While federations under LACP are mandated to perform supervision of member entities,
cooperative federations under LRASCAP cannot; this will be done through the national level
Supervision Committee with six branches at the regional level. The capacity created in the
members of the 13 existing LACP federation supervision committees is getting redistributed
among the 3 LACP supervision committees, and the supervision structure under LRASCAP.
The availability of project-trained and certified supervisors has enabled CNBV to quickly adjust
to the legal changes and to continue to maintain the existing high quality of sector supervision.

Component 2: Expanding Financial Services in Rural Areas (USD 26.18 million –
increased to USD 84.78 million with AF)

The aim of Component 2 was to expand the outreach of SCIs in selected marginal areas. This
was to be achieved by (i) providing technical assistance to individual SCIs to support the design
and implementation of regional development plans to allow them to sustainably increase their
outreach to low-income rural populations currently underserved by the financial services;
(ii) providing training to low-income populations in these areas, to improve their capacity to
link up with financial institutions. This component, known as PATMIR (Programa de
Asistencia Técnica al Micro-financiamiento Rural), was to originally target selected
communities in seven out of eight regions of central and southern Mexico participating in the
Marginal Areas Program implemented by SAGARPA with support of the World Bank. The
scope of Component 2 was, however, expanded with the AF loan. Instead of being limited to
selected communities in eight regions of central and southern Mexico as foreseen in the original
design (PATMIR I), its activities were also extended to marginal rural communities throughout
the whole country (PATMIR II).

financial transactions

    Output 1: By the project original closing date, a total of 194,130 new clients had gained access
    to financial services or 324 percent of the original project target (PATMIR I). The total target
    was increased to 440,000 with the additional financing extending activities to the whole country
    (PATMIR II). The total number reached by project completion is 620,884 or 141 percent of the
    revised target.

    Output 2: Under PATMIR I (2001-2007), 53 percent of new clients were women, and 29
    percent of new clients were from indigenous population groups. Under PATMIR II, more than
    50 percent of new clients are estimated to be women, and 18 percent indigenous population.

    Output 3: Under PATMIR I, about half of the new branches of SCIs supported by the project
    had more than 75 percent of their members living in rural areas. About half had their members
    are concentrated in municipalities with very high or high levels of marginality, all in rural areas.
    Under PATMIR II, all new clients were concentrated in localities with less than 15,000
    inhabitants (rural areas) and with very high, high or medium level of marginality.

    Output 4: All 121 SCIs that participated in PATMIR I and PATMIR II were affiliated with
    Federations and authorized to operate.

    Output 5: All 33 SCIs that participated in PATMIR I had a satisfactory performance as they
    were either certified or admitted under conditional extension; an additional 5 SCIs were initially
    included but dropped due to unsatisfactory performance. Among the 121 SCIs that participated

CNBV review/ready for certification) and 51 were classified B (near-ready for certification).

Output 6: At commencement of the project, the approach to the implementation of this initiative
was modified to be non-selective, focusing on the entire targeted new membership rather than a
limited number of 8,000 families. Also, while the new membership target was formally revised
as a result of the additional loan, this target remained unaltered since this activity was embedded
in the membership creation effort of the TA providers. This was the basis for creating a genuine
information-based demand-pull for new membership at the SCI level. Household level financial
education and dissemination of information on financial services and products offered by the
SCIs were a pre-requisite to new membership creation. All of the new 620,884 members
benefited from this initiative.

Component 3: SCI Sector Studies, Information Dissemination, Monitoring and
Evaluation (USD 5.69 million – increased to USD 6.29 million with AF)

Component 3 aimed at increasing understanding of constraints affecting the provision of
financial services to low-income clients, at monitoring the effectiveness of policies and
programs, and at developing financial innovations adapted to Mexico. This was to include, inter
alia, studies on financial intermediation, sector performance and auxiliary supervision;
workshops and information campaigns to inform stakeholders; and M&E of project
implementation and development of the SCI sector. The AF loan also supported sector-related
M&E studies and project management arrangements.

                             Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic analysis of technical assistance interventions is particularly difficult to quantify
due to problems of attribution, multiple-generation effects, and the lack of financial flows
generated from project investments, among others.

The PAD did not include a quantified economic analysis, but instead a qualitative assessment
and discussion of expected benefits and project impact at three distinct levels: (a) institutional
level (SCI sector consolidation, economies of scale and efficiency gains); (b) client level
benefits; and (c) fiscal implications.

At the institutional level, results of the classification of SCIs attended under the project
(section 3.2), which account for the bulk of membership and assets in the sector, clearly
demonstrate that these entities have considerably improved their financial and organizational
performance as a result of the project. They also benefit from economies of scale, in particular
those that increased their membership as a result of PATMIR, but also more generally due to
enhanced confidence of existing and potential new customers which leads to additional deposits
and other activities in the SCI sector.

At the fiscal level, the main immediate impact of the project consists in the investment costs
associated with the project. All activities and entities supported under the project are expected
to be self-financing over time and not require recurrent government subsidies. Although
investment costs for overall SCI strengthening are significantly higher than expected, currently
receiving additional funding under a follow-on Phase II project, it can be reasonably assumed
that economic benefits will outweigh these costs in the long run. A strong and reliable SCI
sector with expanded outreach will undoubtedly make an important contribution to social and
economic development.

When extending PATMIR country wide, special efforts were made to improve its cost-
efficiency, resulting in a reduction of over one-third (from MXN 2,000 to MXN 1,285) of the
investment costs per new SCI member (section 3.2).

At individual client or household level, increased access to reliable financial services for low-
income people enables them to benefit from adequate and secure savings and liquidity
management instruments, which protect the value of deposited funds. Surveys done during
project preparation14 indicate that most households did not have access to formal deposit
services, but many of them held assets in informal financial mechanisms (primarily through
holding cash at home, participating in informal rotating saving groups, and lending to others) or
kept savings in physical assets easily convertible to cash but subject to losses and therefore
risky, especially livestock. As they now have the possibility to deposit their savings with the
SCI, safety and return are enhanced, interest income is earned while building creditworthiness.

Household surveys done during project implementation also indicate that a large proportion of
SCI members (between 40-50 percent of new members) eventually take loans from their
institutions. This represents a move from informal high cost sources of lending to the more
reasonably priced loans extended by formal financial sector institutions. Access to financial
services also involves being able to use formal remittances services at significantly reduced
cost, which is a major factor in rural Mexico, and to purchase other financial products that the
SCIs might offer such as insurances. Lastly, the distribution of government transfer programs
through the formal structure results in reduced transaction costs and delays.

Surveys and data collected during implementation of the PATMIR component of the project
indicate that by the end of PATMIR II, total mobilization of savings from new SCI members
enrolled as a result of the project was over MXN 1,765 million. Credit was granted to them for a
total amount of MXN 2,045 million. On average, a new SCI member deposited a savings
amount of MXN 4,100, which is equivalent to over three times the amount invested to enroll
him as SCI member, and got an average credit of MXN 4,800 per member.

Specific information on the actual use of their savings by new PATMIR members is not
available. However, general data are available on the overall use of credits granted by SCIs to
their members on the basis of accumulated savings. These data, which are derived from
information collected in the household surveys carried out under the project, have been used for
the ERR analysis.

For this ICR, an attempt has been made to quantify the economic profitability of the main
component of the project, Component 2, which consists in implementation of PATMIR and
represents close to 60 percent of the total project costs. For this purpose, a least-return (or
break even) analysis has been tested. Under this approach, a set of minimum benefits that must
be generated by the project component in order to justify its costs (IRR of more than 12 percent)
are determined and the feasibility of obtaining these benefits is assessed.

Based on actual investment costs under PATMIR, in order to justify economically this
component of the project, it would be necessary to assume that at least 46 percent of the savings
of new PATMIR members would be “re-invested? to generate an IRR of 12 percent over a 15
year period. This is higher than the percentage of SCI credits which are used for productive
investment (22.1 percent in table above). However, other types of credit uses – and, more
generally, the availability of secure savings for PATMIR members – also generate economic
returns, although they are more difficult to quantify (e.g. improved health resulting in fewer
unproductive days due to sickness or caring for sick people; improved education and literacy
resulting in productivity increase; etc.).

Another way to look at the “minimum necessary? benefits to justify investment in Component 2
is that the required “net economic productivity increase? per new PATMIR member would have
to amount to at least $218 peso (about USD 19) per year for himself and his family, which
seems a reasonable assumption.

As indicated in the text (paragraph 75), the ICR was a collaborative exercise between the Bank
and the BANSEFI project implementation team. The first draft of the ICR was discussed with
the BANSEFI team in September 2011. Comments were received and incorporated to prepare a
revised draft in October 2011. This final draft was sent to BANSEFI/Ministry of Finance in
mid-October for comments. On November 4, the Ministry sent some editorial comments on the
draft, and accepted the draft on November 9, 2011 as is, with one final comment. Through their
email of November 9, 2011, BANSEFI too accepted the draft as is with no further comments.

The final comment from the Ministry of Finance is reproduced below:

 “the project has been very important for BANSEFI and has all the support from the Ministry of
 Finance, hence the new loan we have been working on. We would rate the project satisfactory
 or highly satisfactory, given the exceeded outcomes, but it is the Bank’s report.?

                       Annex 10. Changes in the Law and Effect on Certification

The initial deadline for certification of SCIs by CNBV, in accordance with the LACP law, was two years
from the law’s effectiveness, i.e. June 2003. Main changes thereafter are provided below.

      (a) In January 2003, the transition period was extended for two additional years, i.e. SCIs had until
          June 2005 to get certified (or else cease their operations). This extension was in fact supported
          by the Bank due to the additional time required by the sector entities to receive the complete
          range of technical assistance to get ready for certification.
      (b) In May 2005, an additional extension of six-months (until December 2005) was provided, with a
          provision that only those institutions found to be eligible by that date for “conditional extension?,
          based on financial and operational criteria, would benefit from an additional transition period of
          up to three years (i.e. until December 2008) for certification. Other institutions would be required
          to wind down their operations starting January 1, 2006. This extension was a final opportunity
          provided to the entities to register with a selected federation and seek project technical assistance
          for certification. No further extension in the deadline was expected at this stage.
      (c) In August 2007, the deadline was extended once more until December 2012 (though with some
          restrictions to encourage earlier certification), together with opening again the possibility for
          institutions that had not participated earlier to join the “conditional extension? program. Also, the
          asset threshold for compulsory certification of SCIs was increased to UDI15 6.5 million
          (equivalent to about USD 2.0 million),16 which automatically reduced the number of SCIs
          needing certification. This reduced the urgency for a large number of SCIs to get certified, even
          though these had benefited from project TA and were indeed ready for certification. This
          extension was introduced to provide an opportunity to dissenting cooperatives to operate within
          the ambit of the existing LACP. The CNBV had hoped that this extension, with restrictions and
          disincentives for non-certified entities, would spur the cooperatives to adopt the provisions of
          LACP (which did not happen). The cooperatives continued to press for a new (and perhaps, a
          more pliant and flexible law) which would be applicable only to financial cooperatives. The
          group received considerable political support.
      (d) In August 2009, a final and profound change took place. A new law was passed (as a
          compromise) specifically for financial cooperatives – Ley para Regular las Actividades de las
          Sociedades Cooperativas de Ahorro y Préstamo (LRASCAP) – thus reducing the scope of the
          LACP to the SCIs with legal status of partnership (SOFIPO).17 All existing financial
          cooperatives faced the same deadline of December 2012 to get certified under the LRASCAP. A
15
     UDI is an index unit of funds used in Mexico. It can be traded in many currency markets because its value changes with
     respect to currencies. Unlike currencies, it is designed to retain its purchasing power and not be subject to inflation. The
     Mexican credit system (especially mortgages) uses the UDI rather than the peso because of its stability.
16
     The LACP recognizes the heterogeneity of the SCI sector by providing for four levels of authorization for SCIs
     and one “basic level? which does not require authorization but only registration. The level of authorization
     depends on a number of criteria (scale and type of liabilities and assets, number of shareholders or clients,
     number of branches, geographic coverage and technical operating capacity). More developed institutions are
     granted authorization to provide a greater range of services and products, while being subject to stricter
     regulation and supervision standards than less developed ones. Basic level entities can only perform a very
     limited range of services.
17
     Two additional legal status were also created on that occasion under the purview of LACP: Sociedad Financiera
     Comunitaria (SOFINCO) and Organismo de Integración Financiera Rural (OIFR).

                                                               42
           related change is that supervision of financial cooperatives became the responsibility of a new
           Auxiliary Supervision Committee (Comité Único de Supervisión Auxiliar) which was also to be
           in charge of semi-annual classification of the cooperatives18. At the same time, the asset
           threshold for compulsory certification for all SCIs was reduced to UDI 2.5 million (equivalent to
           about USD 600 thousand), which automatically increased the number of SCIs subject to
           certification. The CNBV took this initiative, acceding to the demands of the financial
           cooperatives, extending the coverage of the regulation and supervision requirements to this
           segment of the rural financial sector too.

The repeated postponement of the deadline for SCIs to comply with the Law (LACP), and now
LRASCAP, has affected the implementation of Component 1 and, in particular, achievement of its
quantitative targets in terms of number of certified SCIs. Some entities were basically ready for
certification but postponed their application in view of its costs; some others postponed their adjustment
process in a “wait and see? attitude; and yet some others were legally required to get certified at some
point in time, and operated within the law without certification during other times due to certification
threshold changes.




18
     The Supervision Committee has already been established and is operational, reporting to CNBV which has
      established the rate structure and the cooperatives have started paying the committee. This committee was to
      have been established within 18 months from the date of the LRASCAP, or about February 2011. Since the
      committee was established towards the end of the deadline, its functions vis-à-vis the cooperative entities have
      been somewhat delayed.
