PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL: XAVANTES HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(Loan 404-BR)
Preface
This report presents a performance audit of the
Xavantes Hydroelectric Project for which Loan 404-BR of
US$22.5 million was signed in March 1965. A part of the
loan, US$2.7 million was cancelled in February 1972, and the
balance was fully disbursed and closed in June 1975.
The audit memorandum is mainly based on the attached
Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office, the appraisal and the President's
reports, legal documents, the transcript of the meeting of the
Board of Executive Directors which considered the loan, and dis-
cussions with Bank staff. Under OED's abbreviated procedures, the
audit accepts the analysis and conclusions of the PCR which has
been revised following comments by OED on an earlier version.
The audit memorandum summarizes the main findings of the
PCR and expands on the questions of project cost and justification.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL: XAVANTES HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(Loan 404-BR)
Highlights
Construction of this project had started some four
years before the Bank made the loan. The project was successfully
implemented but with substantial time and cost overruns. It was
justified in terms of additional capacity requirements. In 1960
or earlier when the original decision was made by the borrower
to initiate the project, there was seemingly little to choose
between Xavantes and a thermal alternative. Despite the subse-
quent steep fuel price increases for the thermal alternative,
the ex-post economic justification for Xavantes has improved
only marginally because of the cost and time overruns - unlike
several other contemporary hydro projects which, in retrospect,
became economically much more attractive than their thermal
alternatives. The Bank decision in 1965 to support Xavantes,
then already under construction, was however justified both at
the time and in retrospect in view of the sunk costs involved.
In recent years, the financial performance of the
borrower has been good, and the project's incremental financial
rate of return, not calculated at appraisal, is now estimated
at 10%.
The following points may be of particular interest:
Delays in project implementation (para. 4 and
PCR para. 24 ).
Reasons for cost overrun (paras. 5 and 6, and
PCR para. 25).
Economic justification of the project and deter-
mination of least cost solution between alter-
native projects (paras. 8-11, and PCR paras. 21-23).






PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
BRAZIL: XAVANTES HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(Loan 404-BR)
Background
1.        Usinas Eletricas do Paranapanema (USELPA) was organized in
1953 as an autonomous power agency of the State of Sao Paulo, under a
Federal Government concession. The objective was to develop and to
operate the hydroelectric potential of the Paranapanema River, and to
serve customers in the area. USELPA sold its power in bulk to small
distribution companies, and to Sao Paulo Light Company, a large re-
tailer serving the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. In 1965, 94% of
USELPA's share capital was owned by the State of Sao Paulo, and the
remaining 6% by the State of Parana and the small private distribution
companies which purchased its power. In December 1966, a new entity,
Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP) was created by merging USELPA
and 10 other power companies in the State of Sao Paulo. The appraisal
report had indicated that rationalization of the power sector was a
possibility.
2.        Loan 404-BR for US$22.5 million was the third Bank loan to
USELPA and the eleventh to the Brazilian Power Sector 1/. Following
the merger, CESP assumed the loan obligations of the erstwhile USELPA.
The purpose of iye loan was mainly to cover the foreign exchange cost
of the project - , which had been under construction for about four
years before Bank appraisal in 1964.
The Project, its Implementation and Costs
3.        The project, as appraised, consisted of:    an earth fill dam
90 meters high, and ancillary works; a 4 x 100 MW power station; and
a 220 KV, 180 km transmission line. It was estimated to cost a total
of US$69.5 million equivalent 3/ and had a foreign cost component of
US$22.5 million. The total cost included US$14.1 million equivalent
1/  The three loans to USELPA amounted tu US$45.9 million while the
11 loans to the Power Se-tor a"'oanted to US$343.6 million.
2/ The Brazilian manufacturers were to receive the standard 15% price
preference on Bank financed equipment.
3/ Including the cost of consulting services and the interest during
constr-ct-i-n (IDC) on Bank loan.



already spent on diversion tunnels and on spillways. It did not include
the expenditure of US$13.7 million equivalent on infrastructure and reser-
voir, identified by the PCR as having been incurred before the appraisal
(PCR para. 25 and Annex 1). The project was scheduled for completion in
1968 and expected to generate 1,200 GWh annually. In 1969, with Bank
approval, the transmission component of the project was increased by 155 km.
4.        The project, including the transmission extension, was implemented
with substantial delays and cost overruns. The appraised project was com-
pleted in 1971 (the power plant was commissioned in December 1970), some 3
years behind schedule. The time overrun was mainly due to: 1) delay, by
about a year, in making the loan effective 1/; 2) problems arising from the
change in organization, from standardization of equipment, etc., following
the merger of USELPA into CESP; and 3) CESP's engineering and managerial
resources being extended by the large construction program, on-going at
the time I/. The transmission extension was completed in 1975, also some
3 years behind schedule. No clear reasons for the delay are however avail-
able.
5.        The cost overrun on the project amounted to about 76% in current
US$ equivalent. This was mainly caused by a 105% increase in the estimated
local cost of civil works, from $23.05 million to $47.24 million. Other
contributory factors were increases in: 1) cost of administration and
overhead from $0.85 million to $9.14 million; 2) unit cost of transmission
lines from $0.019 million/km to $0.031 million/km; 3) scope of transmission
lines from 180 km to 355 km; and 4) IDC and other costs from $2.50
million to $28.82 million. (Appendix 1, PCR para.25 and Annex 1).
6.        The PCR attributes the increase in local cost overrun to 'the
combined effect of construction delays and extremely rapid domestic price
increases during the period (1964-1971) not fully compensated by adjust-
ments in the foreign exchange rate'. Implementation delays certainly would
have contributed to the project's local cost overrun. The large increase in
IDC and in administration and overhead costs is a reflection of implementation
delays.  On the question of the 105% increase in local costs of civil works
(which is exclusive of IDC and administrative,'overhead costs), only about
25% of this increase can be accounted for by the fact that between 1965 and
1/ Administrative delays on the part of the Government of the State of
Sao Paulo were mainly responsible. These in turn, prevented the
borrower from placing contracts for Bank financed equipment.
2/ The program included hydroelectric projects Jupia (1,400 MW) and
Ilha Solteira (3,200 MW).

1970 construction wholesale price index increased by an average of 28%
p.a. in contrast to a 21% p.a. increase in foreign exchange rate Appendix 2.
Therefore, there must have been ether reasons for the remaining 75%
of the local cost increase such as quantity increases, underestimation
of costs at appraisal, inaccuracy in recording actual costs or a combina-
tion of all three. Unfortunately, information on these possibilities is
not available. And little will be gained by pursuing, at this stage, the
reasons for cost increases on the project whose implementation had started
at the beginning of the last decade.
Proiect Justification
7.        The appraisal report stated that additional generating capacity
was required to meet growing electricity demand in the area. It provided
a fairly detailed forecast of energy demand from USELPA's customers in
support of this conclusion. The report also stated that the Xavantes
project, already under construction, was economically justified against
the only other alternative available at the time, a thermal plant. No
working data nor the equalizing discount rate was provided in the report;
but, in support of the above conclusion, thf report quoted: a) that the
estimated cost o the project at US$159/KW -/ was low; and b) that the
CANaYDRA study zI had placed Xavantes project on the priority list of
projects already under construction.
8.        The merger of USELPA into CESP, and the consequent integration
of the Xavantes' operation into the much larger CESP system precludes the
assessment of: a) the envisaged role of Xavantes in meeting the projected
electricity demand; and b) the extent to which the projected demand may
have been affected by the two-year delay in completion of the original
project. CESP's 1973 annual report indicates that Xavantes had generated
slightly over 1,200 GWh in 1972 and 1973, and in addition, CESP had pur-
chased from other sources some 200 GWh in each one of the two years. The
audit, therefore, accepts the justification for installing additional
generating capacity.
9.        In examining ex-ante and ex-post least cost project solutions,
the PCR has correctly taken only the project's incremental costs (i.e.,
additional costs required to complete Xavantes. from the 3ime of appraisal)
for comparison with the costs of a thermal alternative 3 . The ex-ante

costs, the unit cost would have increased to US$195.

and ex-post equalizing discount rates of 32% and 14% respectively, confirm
the project's economic superiority over Fhe thermal alternative at the time
of the appraisal and on its completion 1. (PCR para. 22 and Annex III).
10.       The PCR has examined the least cost solution from the time of
appraisal. But substantial costs had already been incurred on the project
before its appraisal. Therefore, this memorandum attempts also to examine
the least cost solutions between Xavantes and thermal alternatives at the
time the borrower made the decision to go ahead with Xavantes (probably in
1960), and on its completion in 1971.
11.        Appendix 3 provides the data used in arriving at the least cost
solutions. The audit was not able to trace the original (i.e.,pre-appraisal)
estimates on project cost and completion time. It has therefore assumed
that they were the same as the Bank appraisal estimates, plus the infra-
structure and other costs which had been incurred before the appraisal, all
costs in US$ equivalent. It will be seen that the equalizing discount rate
betweq pre-construction (1960) Xavantes and a thermal alternative is about
8.0% R. Therefore, from a purely economic standpoint, there was little to
choose between Xavantes and a thermal plant; in3fact, based on the stated
assumptions, the latter had an edge on Xavantes- . Owing to heavy time and
cost overruns, however, the equalizini discount rate improves only marginally
to about 9% on completion of Xavantes_/, even after allowing for steep fuel
,Price increases in the interim for a thermal alternative.
Financial Performance
12.       The incremental financial rate of return on the actual project,
as calculated for the audit, is around 10% (Appendix 4). The rate of
return was not calculated in the appraisal report nor in the PCR.
13.       Separate accounts were not maintained for USELPA after its merger
into CESP. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the compliance of cove-
nants nor to make a comparison of the actual financial performance with
that estimated in the appraisal report. A comparison of (USELPA's) esti-
mated performance with CESP's actual performance would be meaningless; in
1967, CESP had assets several times those of USELPA and a huge investment
program underway. However, CESP had an indifferent financial performance
1/ The equalizing discount rates would have been only marginally lower
had the thermal alternative been a combination of base load steam
plant and gas turbines, say 200 MW steam plant and 200 MW gas turbines.
2/ The equalizing discount rate would increase to only about 9.0% if the
assumed pre-appraisal estimates on project cost and construction time
were reduced by 10%.
3/  According to CANAMBRA study, the opportunity cost of capital in the
the mid-1960 was between 8-10%.
4/ The equalizing discount rate could drop by a percentage point if the
pre-1970 inflation of the US dollar were taken into account.



_ 5 -
in FY8 1967-1971: the rate of return on net revalued fixed assets in
operation was well below the 10% stipulated in the loan agreement;
through 1970, the gross cash generation from operations was short of
debt service; and in FYs 1967-69 the gross revenue from energy sales was
less than the interest payments. Since 1971, partly reflecting the in-
crease in energy sales from the investment program, CESP's performance
has improved substantially, and the rate of return in FYs 1974 and 1975
was respectively 16. 9 and 15. 9. Other financial indicators are sat-
isfactory (Appendix 5, PCR paras. 31-33, and Annex VI).
Conclusion
14.           The project was successfully implemented but with substan-
tial cost and time overruns. As was expected, it provided additional
generating capacity to meet the growing demand in the area. However, in
1960 or earlier, when the borrower made the original decision in terms
of the least cost solution, there was seemingly little to choose between
Xavantes and a thermal alternative; the equalizing discount rate between
the two was about 8% while the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil
was about 8-10%. Despite the recent steep increase in fuel prices
for the thermal alternative, the ex-post economic justification for
Xavantes has improved only marginally (the equalizing discount rate
is about 9%) because of the cost and time overruns - unlike several
contemporary hydro projects which, in retrospect, became economically
much more attractive than their thermal alternatives. The Bank decis-
ion in 1965 to support the then on-going project was based on a
comparison between the incremental cost required to complete Xavantes
and the cost of a thermal alternative; it was thus justified both at
the time and in retrospect. The experience from this project neverthe-
less highlights the effect cost overruns and construction delays can
have on the economic comparison with alternative projects.

Sector Background
15.       At the time of the preparation of the Xavantes project in 1964,
the Braailian Power sector was just emerging from a five-year (1959-63)
period of rampant inflation during which tariff adjustments lagged substantially
behind other price increases. In 1964, the first of a series of decrees to
improve the sector's performance was issued;  it allowed utilities to cover
their operating expenses, reversion (or amortization of the total investment
in the concession at annual rates determined by DNAEE, the sector's regulating
agency) and a minimum 10% return on investment. However, the rapid continuing
deterioration of the Brazilian currency at the time, coupled with inadequate
implementation of the regulations, delays in obtaining permitted adjustments
and a basic shortcoming in the 1964 decree - the use of historic values of
assets to compute the tariff base instead of revalued values - resulted in the
deterioration of the utilities' earnings and their inability to generate funds
internally towards new projects.
16.       The introduction of mandatory revaluation of assets beginning
January 1, 1965 (using official co-efficients) to determine tariff levels
helped to arrest the deterioration and provided the statutory leverage for
mobilizing the financial resources necessary for the sector's expansion.
This, together with later refinements, and steps to improve sector planning,
have contributed to the sector's impressive achievement of 10.1% average
annual growth in installed capacity over the last decade to keep abreast of
growth in gross national electricity consumption of 9.2% over the period.
By far, the most important step taken in the mid-1960s in terms of the sector's
rational development, was the initiation of studies carried out by a consortium
of three consulting forms known as CANAMBRA. The studies were financed by UNDP
and the Bank acted as executing agency. Two separate studies covering the power
market and energy resources of the Southeast and South, completed by CANAMBRA
in 1966 and 1969 respectively, identified and made feasibility studies of potential
hydroelectric sites, assessed costs of development in relation to thermal and
nuclear alternatives and laid down the order of priority for implementation on
regional and economic considerations. The Government accepted the findings as
a basis for the expansion of power supply in those regions. It further decreed
that the sector's expansion strictly adhere to these development plans, with
proper justification for departures. By and large, the concessionaires in the
Southeast and South regions adhered to the CANAMBRA plans.
Project Preparation
17.       The Xavantes loan was in the nature of an after-thought.   The loan
had originally been processed for a State power company in Rio Grande do Sul
in the early 1960s.  However, before the processing was completed, the organiza-
tion (State) gave up the loan. This was followed by a period of mere or less
dormant lending activity by the Bank for about two years. About 1964, the
Bank began becoming active again in Brazil in response to an urgent request
by the Brazilian Government to provide assistance to the new economic
programs. The Xavantes project had been under construction for four years
at the time, but it was considered as an immediate vehicle for the transfer
of resources because the new borrower, USELPA, was a recognized borrower
with demonstrated satisfactory performance from the 1950's. Given that the
project was well under construction the appraisal process was to a considerable



A3
extent dealing with a fact rather than a prospect. Its focus, was oriented
more to providing financing for the physical construction of the project rather
than to institution-building of the borrower. The loan itself was one of the
smaller of a number of more important., institutionally, and larger loans for
projects in the power sector under consideration at that time. Loan 404 was
the Bank's third loan to- the borrower. The two previous Bank loans of US$10
million in 1953 (Loan 93-BR) and US$13.4 million in 1958 (Loan 187-BR) had
financed the borrower's Salto Grande (60 MW) and Jurumirim (85MW) hydro projects
respectively.
Project Description
18.       The project originally consisted of:
(a) the Xavantes dam and ancilliary works on the Paranapanema river;
(b) the Xavantes power station, with a capacity of 4-100 MW generating
units;
(c) 180 km of 220 kV transmission line; and
(d) utilization of consulting services in the borrower's operations
and training of technical personnel.
The Xavantes plant is on the Paranapanema river near to its confluence with
the Itarare river. The 180 km of transmission line connects the Jurumirim
and the Salto Grande hydroelectric stations   (both financed by the Bank -
see para. 17 above) to the Xavantes station and a substation at the city of
Assis. In December of 1969, the Bank approved the addition of 155 km of 220
kV transmission line between Assis and Apucarana to enable CESP-to link its
230 kV system with that of Companhia Paranaense de Eletricidade (COPEL), another
borrower of the Bank. The modified project was constructed substantially as
envisaged.

20.       The total amount of the loan proceeds applied to the expanded project
was US$19.8 million;  the remaining US$2.7 million of the loan proceeds was can-
celled in February 1972. The utility proposed to utilize this balance
to fiEance Liansrission lines outside the scope of the original project.
However, since the project had been completed; the closing date had already
been extended several times; two additional years would have probably



A4
been required to disburse the balance, as proposed by CESP; and the economic
justification of the lines had not been completed, the Bank did not agree to
CESP's request, and the remaining balance was cancelled. The reduced
Bank financing of the project, in spite of its expanded scope, appears
to have been largely the result of overestimation at appraisal of the cost of
turbines, generators and other equipment for the power plant. The actual
foreign cost of equipment for the power station was about 31% less than esti-
mated at appraisal in spite of a 1 to 2-year delay in the procurement. On the
other hand, the appraisal estimate of the cost of the transmission equipment
had put the foreign cost of transmission equipment at US$9,444 per circuit-km
while the actual foreign cost, based on the total 335 circuit-km, was about
US$16,656 per circuit-km, or about 76% more than the appraisal unit cost esti-
mate. Altogether, the saving resulting from the lower actual cost of the power
station equipment more than offset the foreign cost overrun encountered in the
transmission equipment category.
Objective and Justification
21.       The main objective of the Xavantes project was to help meet part of
the increasing electric power requirements of the rapidly growing industrial
state of Sao Paulo, and the agriculturally-rich state of Parana, at the least
possible cost. The plant was expected to be commissioned in 1968. Appraisal
forecasts of market requirements in USELPA's service area had been estimated
to grow at an annual rate of 15% beginning 1968-69. Consumption during the
past 10 years in the Southeastern region of Brazil where Sao Paulo state is
located and is serviced by CESP has grown at an average annual rate of about
12%; the growth rate in the Southern region, the area in which Parana is
located, has averaged about 15%. The Southeastern region with 43% of Brazil's
population currently accounts for 76% of total national power consumption, with
the state of Sao Paulo responsible for the major share. The Southern region,
with 18% of the country's population, accounts for 12% of the national con-
sumption, with Parana state accounting for a substantial share. Because of the
vastly changed organization of the power systems in the area, and the assumption
of USELPA's obligations and assets by the much larger CESP, it was not possible
during supervision nor is it possible now to measure the extent to which power
from Xavantes contributed to meeting the growth of power requirements in the
original borrower's area. However, from a regional point of view, it is clear
that the output of the Xavantes project was needed to meet the energy growth
requirements, since no surpluses have occurred in the South-Southeast market.
22..      The power plant of the Xavantes project was completed in 1970, about
two years behind schedule. The appraisal report stated that the plant was a
least-cost solution although it did not provide data to support this conclusion.
The project was, as a result of the CANAMBRA study, in the list of projects
identified as least-cost solutions for meeting the market requirements of the
Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. An important consideration,
mentioned by the appraisal report was that a substantial portion'of the invest-
ment had already been sunk at the time of the appraisal, and therefore, com-
pletion of the project was, a fortiori, justified. An ex-post analysis shows
that, at the time of appraisal, the Xavantes plant, when compared with a thermal
alternative of equivalent capacity, was the least-cost solution for discount
rates below 32%. A similar calculation, made after completion of the project in
1970 would have given an equalizing disc'ount rate of only 5% due to substantial



A5
overruns on investment costs (see para. 25); however, when recent large in-
creases in fuel prices are taken into account, the Xavantes power plant is
shown as the least-cost solution for all discount rates below 14%, and is
therefore justified a posteriori. (See Annex III).
23.       Regarding the transmission component of the project, the CANAMBRA and
subsequent studies, which have since become the basis for transmission facilities
development in the two regions, provide justification for the 220 kV system
being the least-cost solution for transmitting (within the erstwhile USELPA
service area) amounts of energy equivalent to the Xavantes plant's capability,
and providing compatibility with the standardized voltage for the interconnection
of the borrower's system with those of other powar utilities in the Southern and
Southeastern regions.
Construction Schedule
24.       The appraisal report estimated that the Xavantes project would be
completed by the end of 1968. Actual completion of the project in its original
scope was not until 1971 - about 3 years behind schedule. In 1969, CESP, which
had absorbed USELPA in 1966 and assumed the latter's obligations with the Bank
in 1967 requested and received from the Bank, permission to modify the project
to include the additional transmission line and substation facilities indicated
in para. 19. The expanded project was not completed until 1975. The slippages
in construction schedule were caused initially by a one-year delay on the part
of the Brazilian authorities in making the loan effective, and later by the
combination of the original borrower's weak management, the integration diffi-
culties resulting from the absorption of USELPA into CESP and the impact of
these on the project, including the fact that CESP also had under construction
the large Jupia and Ilha Solteira projects. Also the integration of Xavantes plant
into CESP's svstem required the redefinition of the electrical system of Xavantes
in order to integrate it into CESP's; the resulting changes in the specifications
of Xavantes' electrical equipment caus'ed delays in procurement. A review of the
supervision summaries indicates that CESP's energetic. management and the close
supervision by the Bank of the physical progress, helped substantially to limit
the delays.
Project Cost Estimates
25.       The cost estimate for the project (including interest during construction
but excluding the additional 155 circuit-km transmission line included in 1969)
was US$69.5 million. If the cost of the 1969 addition (about US$7 million) and
other expenses originally not included in the appraisal estimate ,(about US$13.7
million) are excluded, the actual cost of the project in its original form was
US$125.3 million, resulting in a cost overrun of US$55.8 million or 80% above
the appraisal estimates. The cost overrun appears to have been in the foreign
component of the transmission equipment and in the local component of the entire
project. The large local cost overruns appear to have resulted from the combined
effect of construction delays and extremely rapid domestic price increases during
the period (1964-71) not fully compensated by adjustments in the foreign exchange
rate (Annex II). For example, within a year after the loan was signed and just
about the time that it became effective, the local cost which had been estimated
at US$47 million at appraisal had jumped to US$88 million.   Over the period 1966-
74 the local cost steadily increased from US$88.0 million to US$126.2 million



A6
(see Annex II for a summary of price indices in Brazil during 1960-75). CESP was
able to absorb the local cost increases without difficulty. The cost overrun in
the foreign component of the transmission category was covered by the savings
resulting from the cost underrun in the power plant equipment category (see para. 6).
Detailed comparison of the estimated appraisal cost and actual cost is shown in Annex I.
Main Contractors
26.         A list of the main contractors is attached as Annex VII.
Consultants
27.       The planning and design of the Xavantes project was executed by the
Brazilian engineering-construction firm of Servix Engenharia S.A. Servix had
been both designer and constructor for the first two projects of the borrower
financed by the Bank, and had done a satisfactory job. Engevix, another
qualified Brazilian firm, was involved satisfactorily with the project super-
vision. Specialized studies were also prepared satisfactorily by SOFRELEC on
the high tension equipment for the transmission system of Xavantes. The
selection of the firms was done by the borrower following Bank procedures.
Studies of broad scope on the analysis and planning of the transmission system
were awarded to Commonwealth Associates and Inter-America and prepared to the
satisfaction of the borrower.
Procurement
28.       Procurement of Bank financed equipment was done by means of inter-
national competitive bidding and in accordance with Bank guidelines and was
satisfactory. An important issue in procurement appeared to have been the
selection of an appropriate currency exchange rate for conversion of the bids
into dollars under the prevailing Brazilian situation of high and continuous
inflation. The formula agreed upon was the commercial bank rate plus the
official surcharge in effect at the time, but subject to the proviso that
the Bank would have the right to reconsider the formula if there should be
any increase in the then existing rate of surcharge which would further widen
the gap between the import and export rates. The formula appears to have
worked satisfactorily.
Organization and Management
29.       CESP resulted from the merging of eleven power companies (one of
them being USELPA, the original borrower) in December 1966. This merger
although foreseen at appraisal, caused some disruptions in organization that
slowed project administration for several months. The assumption of the
loan by the new entity (CESP) became effective on May 31, 1967. The incorpora-
tion of USELPA and several similar entities in the state of Sao Paulo'into
CESP was of major importance in rationalizing the sector, a move to which the
Bank enthusiastically had given its agreement. The creation of CESP
enabled the sector to mobilize larger financial resources for larger hydro-
electric projects, and provided economies of scale in the carrying out of
objectives to meet market requirements in the Southeastern region.
30.       The first concern of CESP after its incorporation, was to reorganize
its structure and minimize the interference of political considerations in the
administration of the entity, a situation that seemed to have plagued many of
the entities merged into CESP. CESP carried out a reorganization of its
Accounting, Budgeting and Management Departments and made rapid progress in
overcoming the difficult problems it inherited from the predecessor companies.



A7
The company expanded rapidly and today is one of the best-run utilities in
Brazil.
Operating Results and Financial Covenants
31.       It is ilot possible to make a comparison between appraisal forecasts
and actual results because the appraisal forecasts were prepared for USELPA
which ceased to exist less than one year after the loan became effective.
Although the financial covenants binding the original borrower, were reproduced
in the Loan Agreement for CESP, no apparent recognition was given to the fact
that CESP was an entirely different entity in terms of structure, size and
operations. At the time of CESP's assumption of the loan, it had assets of
15 times those of USELPA and was in a state of great expansion, with the
Jupia and Ilha Solteira projects under construction and was sDending about
US$1 billion a year on capital expansion. Therefore, while the rate covenants
were still commendable, nevertheless it was not surprising that they turned
out to be off the mark in the evaluation of CESP's performance under the loan
agreement.
32.       Section 5.14 of the Loan Agreement required that the borrower's
operations produce a return of not less than 10% on the total net revalued
fixed plant in operation. No data are available to measure USELPAts com-
pliance with this covenant during 1965-66. However, comparable figures for
CESP, which assumed USELPA's obligations in 1967, were 7% in 1968, 8.7% in
1969, 7.8% in 1970, 8.3% in 1971, 11.2% in 1972, 12.9% in 1973, 16.9% in 1974
and 16.5% in 1975. As can be seen, CESP was not able to comply with this
covenant until 1972. Section 5.14 also required the borrower to have a depreci-
ation rate of not less than 2.5% of gross fixed assets in operation. Except for
1968 and 1975, CESP's depreciation rate throughout the period was less than the
covenant requirement (see Annex VI).
33.       The provisions of the Brazilian power tariff legislation: during the
project implementation period, and the increasing competence of the sector's
regulatory authorities, provided a sound financial basis for many of the
utilities, thus enabling the sector to finance substantial portions of expan-
sion from internal resources. Over the period 1971-75, for example, the power
sector financed 55% of its large investment program through charges on its
custcmers - a performance unmatched by any major developed or developing country.
This feature of the Brazilian tariff regulation enabled CESP to readily meet
the other major financial covenant of the loan agreement, i.e. Section 5.15 of
the Loan Agreement. This covenant required the borrower not to "incur any
long-term debt if by incurring such debt the long-term debt of the borrower shall
exceed 66-2/3% of the net fixed assets of the borrower".    CESP's actual long-
term debt/net fixed assets ratio for the period 1967-75 fluctuated between
11:89 and 27:73.
Financing Plan
34.       Because the Bank did not request, at the time of the merger with
USELPA into CESP, a separate and continuous reporting of the activities of
the USELPA facilities after CESP's creation, an evaluation of the project's
financing plan cannot be made. In any event, given the host of problems CESP
had, this would Drobably have been low in the order of priorities even if
possible.  The oversighL therefore appears to have been conscious.    However, as
indicated in para. 20, the foreign financing requirements (except for the trans-
mission equipiDent) were less than estimated at appraisal, while the local financing
was substantially larger. CES? was able to absorb the increases in local costs
without difficulty.

Le,... to be 1olmol
35.       There is not much to be learned from this project that is specific
to it. The difficulties experienced were not serious and were resolved
satisfactorily. This is a case where while the appraisal did not focus in
depth on institution-building, mainly due to the circumstances of-the loan,
the institutions in question elected to build themselves up on their own
initiative. The absorption of USELPA's operations by CESP did not facilitate
strict financial supervision of the project proper but this had no adverse
effects since CESP evolved into an efficient and well-managed utility and
its creation has been an important step forward in the improvement of
sector operations.
36.       It is recognized that the establishment of proper cost estimates
is one of the key tasks during appraisal. In the case of Xavantes, the
extremely rapid increase of domestic prices at that time, which were not
fully compensated by adjustments in the foreign exchange rate made it very
difficult to establish a reasonable forecast of local costs. The serious
underestimation of the (local) cost could have led to difficulties if CESP
had not been able to finance the cost overrun.
