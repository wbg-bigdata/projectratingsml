APPRAISAL OF XAVANTES POWER PROJECT
USINAS ELETRICAS DO PARA1NJAPANENA (USELPA)
BRAZIL
SUIWIMARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of Usinas
Eletricas do Paranapanema (USELPA), comprising the construction of the
Xavantes hydroelectric power station and associated transmission
facilities.   A Bank loan of US$22.5 million equivalent has been
requested to finance the cost of equipment and interest during
construction of US$2.5 million.    Total cost of the project is estimated
to be the equivalent of US$69.5 million including interest during
construction on the Bank loan.
ii.       The borrower would be USELPA, an autonomous State Corporation
in the State of Sao Paulo.    It would be the third loan made to
USELPA by the Bank.
iii.      The Xavantes hydroelectric station, which is under construction,
would comprise 4 - 100 MW units.    The transmission phase of the project
would comprise 180 kilometers of 220 kv circuit.
iv.       The project is technically sound and is economically justified.
There is reasonable assurance of a market for the output of the
project.
v.        The capital structure of USELPA is satisfactory.   IVThile
recent earnings have been poorptariff increases will enable USELPA to
achieve and maintain a rate of return of not less than 10% on net
revalued fixed assets, as provided for by federal decrees.    Loan
covenants have been agreed upon to assure that a proper level of
earnings will be maintained in the future and a tariff increase is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
vi.       In addition to the funds obtained from internal cash generation
and the proposed Bank loan, there is to be an equity contribution by
the Companhia Paranaese de Energia Eletrica (COPEL) and the State of
Sao Paulo is to provide all of the remainder of the funds necessary.
vii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of USd$22.5 million
equivalent for a period of 25 years including 5 years grace.



APPRAISAL OF XAVANTES POWER PROJECT
USINAS ELETRICAS DO PARANIAPANENA (USELPA)
BRAZIL
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.        Usinas Eletricas do Paranapanema (USELPA) has asked the Bank
for a loan to finance the completion of the Xavantes hydroelectric
power project, which is now under construction.   The project would
comprise the construction of the power station of four 100 Nl units
on the Paranapanema River and of associated transmission facilities.
The total cost is estimated at the equivalent of US$6905 million,
including interest during construction on the Bank loan.   A loan of
US$22.5 million equivalent has been requested of the Bank to cover
the cost of equipment and of interest during construction of
US$2.5 million.   This would be the third loan made to USELPA by the
Bank.   This report covers the appraisal of the project based on
information provided by USELPA and on an appraisal mission from the
Bank which visited Brazil in July - August 1964, and again by a short
visit to Brazil in November 1964.
II.   THE BORRO-WER
2,        USELPA was organized in 1953 as an autonomous power agency
of the State of Sao Paulo to develop and operate the hydroelectric
potential of the Paranapanema River under a Federal Government con-
cession.   Statutes provide that US3LPA may serve customers within the
area which can be economically supplied by power generated on the
Paranapanema River, which along a course of 300 kilometers has a
potential of 1 million kw.
3.        USELPA was incorporated as a 'mixed econony1 company for which
ownership is part public and part private but in which public ownership
must be the majority.   The State of Sao Paulo owns about 9h% of the share
capital with the balance owmed mostly by the State of Parana.    Private
participation, by the small private distribution companies which
purchase poTwer from USELPA, is insignificant.
4.        USELPA has two hydro plants in operation, both. financed in
part by Bank loans.   The Salto Grande (60 NW) project which began
operation in 1958 was the object of a $10 million loan in 1953; the
Jurumirim hydro plant (85 MTV) which began operation in 1962 was the
object of a loan of US$13.4 million in 1958.   In 1963 sales were 800
million kwh.   The company sells power wholesale and has no distribution
facilities.
5.        USFLPA is administered by a five man Board of Directors, in-
cluding the President;  all are full-time jobs.   Each Director has a cer-
tain sphere of activity, respectively, economic aspects and budgets,
planning and generation, construction, administration and purchasing, and
liason with the Government.   The State of Sao Paulo appoints four of the
Directors and that of Parana one.   Four, including the President, were
appointed two years ago when a new Government took power in the State of



- 2 -
Sao Paulo. The fifth Director has been with USELPA for eleven years in
various positions.
6.        USELPA is organized into a number of Departments on conventional
lines. The number of employees is about 475, of whom three quarters are
located in the hydro plants and field offices, with 125 people located in
the Head Office in Sao Paulo. The operation, while perhaps slightly over-
staffed in the field, is reasonably trim.
7.        Technical activities are handled by the Department of Construc-
tion with ten engineers. One section supervises construction, another
technical maintenance and a small group is responsible for planning and
studies. USELPA is weak from the engineering planning standpoint, lack-
ing personnel with appropriate experience. However, design work is carried
out by a consulting firm, which Drovides the necessary strength in this
branch of the organization.
8.        USELPA does a reasonably good job, even though its management,
with limited experience, is on the weak side. It has been strengthened,
however, by the appointment of the present Chairman.
9.        As the result of Government policies over a period of many
years the evolution of the electric utility industry was not well organized
and this has led to a proliferation of Federal and State owned utilities,
In the State of Sao Paulo there are three State owned companies, large
distribution properties (formerly parts of the American and Foreign Power
systems) under Federal ownership, Sao Paulo Light (which is a subsidiary
of Brazilian Traction) and numerous small privately owned distribution
companies. In view of the number, coordination is difficult and the new
Federal Government has initiated consideration of the problem. It is
possible that USELPA and several other publicly owned utilities would be
combined in one state owned entity. In return for Federal properties, the
State would transfer certain of its properties to Federal jurisdiction.
The present corporate form of USELPA may therefore change. Assurrnces
have been obtaired that the Bank will be consulted in connection with
any industry reorganization scheme affecting USELPAo
10.       Inflation in Brazil has had a disastrous effect on utility earnings
and operations. It has also made past operating results difficult to inter-
pret and made necessary the continuing review of construction estimates.
For this reason the following measures are used in this report. Forecasts
of operating results are given in cruzeiros based on an estimated 1964
average exchange rate of Cr$1,500 to US$1.00. Past operating statements
have not been adjusted and are not therefore, directly comparable with future
estimates because of change in value of the currency. The project cost
estimate is given in U.S. dollars equivalent in order to simplify its use.
Continued inflation is expected, although the Government aims to reduce it,
and this must be taken into account in future use of the estimates.

III. POWER I4PRKET
11.       USELPA supplies electricity in a well populated area in which
power demand can be expected to grow rapidly. In 1960 the annual per
capita consumption in the area was 240 kwh, contrasting with a use of
300-900 kwh for areas in the State served by other utilities. A sizeable
increase in electricity consumption should be realized in the next several
years especially as electric service is extended to areas in USELPAts
territory not now served.
12.       In principle, the purpose of USELPA is to generate power which
will be distributed by the small retailers located in its service area,
and approximately 50% of its production is now sold to such small distri-
bution companies. The remainder is sold to Sao Paulo Light Company, a
subsidiary of Brazilian Traction, serving the metropolitan area of Sao
Paulo. As the load of the small distribution companies increases, the
amount sold to Sao Paulo Light will decrease, as reflected by sales
statistics given in Annex 1, unless there is an increase in generating
capacity. For this reason sales to Sao Paulo Light will generally de-
crease until 1968 when, with the placing in service of Xavantes, they
will again increase substantially.
13.       One of these distribution companies is COPEL which serves an
area in the State of Parana and is owned by that State. The State of
Parana has a 5% interest in USELPA, which was arranged to give COPEL the
right to purchase a portion of USELPA's output. In 1963 COPEL purchased
45 million kwh. The State of Parana has agreed to contribute 6% of the
cost of Xavantes for the privilege of purchasing part of its output.
COPEL plans to take 120 MW (500 million kwh) of the output of Xavantes
when it is completed.
14.       USELPA has reviewed with the other distribution companies their
future requirements. Indications are that these companies will have a
growth rate of the order of 15%, entailing a consumption of about 600
million kwhs in 1969 and representing about one-third of USELPA's produc-
tion when Xavantes is conmmissioned.
15.       USELPA expects to sell about 150 MW of the   Xavantes output
to Sao Paulo Light, which has agreed in principle to this purchase sub-
ject to "the requisite authorization of the Government authorities and to
the permission for the Company to recover the corresponding charges not
covered by its rates."
16.      This stipulation refers to the problem of the Brazilian Traction
Company electric subsidiaries. The Government has not allowed the rates of
Brazilian Tractionts subsidiaries to be maintained at the levels necessary
to produce adequate revenue to provide funds for expansion. The company
has had to practically suspend the expansion required to meet load growth.
For this reason the Brazilian Traction systems in Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro are now fully loaded. Future electricity growth will not be
possible without considerable expansion of the distribution and subtrans-
mission system and Brazilian Traction proposes a three-year US$90 million



program of capital expenditures, beginning immediately, for this purpose.
The expected sale of Xavantes power to Sao Paulo Light depends there-
fore on this program being carried out in tmie.   On the basis of tariff
regulations recently issued (see paragraph3/-   the Government has
agreed to grant to the distribution companies increases in tariffs which
would enable them to finance a substantial portion of the cost of the
expansion of the facilities.   Specific arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank for the expansion of the distribution facilities in the Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo areasarea condition of effectiveness in the
proposed Loan Agreement.
17.       The small distribution companies to which USELPA sells pow^rer
are also faced with expansion programs to provide for anticipated growth.
Financing for these programs will be provided for in part by the additional
revenue to be realized from prospective tariff increases.    In additions
the Federal Government is aware of the problem and has indicated its
support in its solution.
18.       On the basis of forecasts of growth of the small distribution
companies and of COPELts requirements, the load growth curve for USELPA
is shown in Annex 2.   Annex 1 tabulates past and estimated future sales
to the individual customers.   A satisfactory market for the power to
be produced by Xavantes is indicated.
IV.   THE PROJECT
19.       The Xavantes project comprises the construction of a generating
station on the Paranapanema River, with a capacity of 400 MW, and the
construction of associated transmission facilities.   Annual production
is estimated at 1.2 billion kwh, giving a plant factor of 35%.   The
plant will operate at a head of 74 meters and will be equipped with
four 100,000 kw generators producing power at 13 kv, which will be
stepped up to 220,000 volts for transmission.
20.       Transmission included in the project will consist of the con-
struction of 180 kilometers of 220 kv line to extend the 220 kv system
and to connect Xavantes to it.   This will provide mainly for the
transmission of Xavantes power towards the Sao Paulo area and a substantial
transmission expansion in other directions will be necessary in 1966-68
in order to transmit the increased amount of power USELPA will sell to
the small distribution companies, especially when Xavantes begins
operation.   This additional program will involve an expenditure of
about US$20 million equivalent in the period 1966-72.   The program is,
in principle, already defined.   USELPA realizes, however, that because
of its importance and priority it will require careful planning and
organization.   USELPA is, therefore, in the process of hiring competent
consultants to assist in the planning of the program and its coordination.
The cost of the consultants' services is included in the proposed loan.
Assurances have been obtained as to the firm intention of proceeding with
a suitable program.



21.       The main engineering features of Xavantes are the diversion
and intalce tunnels and dam.  The latter will be 90 meters high, 430 meters
wide, 10 meters thick at the top and 450 meters at the foundation.
It is an earth fill dam, with substantial rock ballast on the down-stream
side.   Sandstone will underlie the earth fill and filter portions;
basalt will underlie the rock section.   Soil investigations and design
studies were carried out under the direction of Professor Arthur
Casagrande of Harvard University, an eminent soil mechanics expert.
A sound design, suited to the geology of the site, has been established.
22.       A summary of the project's cost estimate is given below.   (A
more detailed estimate is given in Annex 3).

- 6 -
development, that is, excluding transmission and excluding interest during
construction, is USW63.5 million, or $159 per kw.
23,       The estimate of foreign financing of the project, excluding
interest during construction, is US$20 million. This is for the purchase
of all equipment not already bought. Until awards have been made it is
not possible to determine the foreign exchange component of the project.
US$1.5 million is included for contingencies to cover the possible increase
in cost of equipment which might be purchased in Brazil, above the imported
cost of such equipment, on which equipment cost estimates ere based. (See
paragraph 29). It will also provide for any increase in the actual cost
of equipment over the estimated prices obtained during the past year. The
equivalent of US$3.4 million has been provided for contingencies on the
civil construction, and other local costs amounting to the equivalent of
US$W7 million. This represents 11% on the portion of the project re-
maining to be completed. This is deemed adequate in view of the progress
of construction and the fact that the estimate used was the result of a
recent review by the consulting and contracting firms.
Status of Engineering and Construction
24.        Xavantes has been under construction since 1960..  The amount
spent as of the end of 1964 is equivalent to US$14.1 million, mainly on
the diversion tunnels, which are complete, and on the spillway, which is
partly built. The two diversion tunnels have been drilled through the
basalt rock hill on the left bank of the river; they are 480 meters in
length with a diameter of 9.5 meters. Coffer dams have been built adjacent
to the entrance and exit of the tunnels and the river is bypassed through
the tunnels to permit the dam to be built on the river bed which is now
exposed to rock. About two-thirds of the length (downstream) of the
diversion tunnels will be used as part of the intake tunnel to supply
water to the turbines. The vertical intake tunnels have been started and
will be drilled to meet the diversion tunnels. The unused portion of
the diversion tunnels will be sealed off ultimately.
25.       Planning and design of   Xavantes is the responsibility of the
Brazilian engineering-construction firm of Servix Engenharia S.A. Con-
struction is being carried out by Companhia Brasileira de Pavimentacao e
Obras. Servix was both designer and constructor for the first two projects
financed by the Bank, and did a satisfactory job. This arrangement was
continued when Xavantes was begun, with the change that Servix engaged
Brasileira as sub-contractor to do the civil work since it had had ex-
perience with large earth moving operations. Subsequently, at the suggestion
of the Bank, responsibility for design was separated from that for construc-
tion; in 1963, Servix was made responsible for design and electrical/mech-
anical erection, and Brasileira was made responsible for civil construction.
Inspection of the civil works is being undertaken jointly by staff of
USELPA and Servix; assurances have been obtained that USELPA will continue
to use consultants satisfactory to the Bank for this purpose.

V.   PROCUISMENT AND DISBURSaIENT
26.       Local firms will compete for many of the contracts covering
materials and equipment to be financed by the proposed loan.   While
Government-owned power companies are exempt from customs duties and the
exchange surcharge and compulsory deposits mentioned below, current
Brazilian legislation (Law of Similares) as interpreted by the
Superintendency of Money and Credits (SuitOC), prohibits generally the
importation of capital goods which can be produced locally.   This
matter has been discussed and the Government and USELPA have agreed to
international competitive bidding on goods to be financed under the
proposed loan; and the Government has agreed to take all such measures
as necessary to facilitate the importation of goods by USELPA free from
all legal and administrative restrictions or limitations in accordance
with the arrangements described below.
27.       In comparing bids by foreign and local suppliers it will be
necessary to determine the exchange rate which is to be used.   At the
present time the cost of exchange to importers is generally determined by
the following: (1) the commercial bank rate of exchange which is close
to the official rate of exchange of the Banco do Brasil, (2) the pre-
vailing exchange surcharge, presently 10%, and (3) compulsory deposits.
presently 50% of the transaction for 7 months.   The Bank and the Govern-
ment have agreed that the exchange rate to be used for evaluating bids
and calculating the amount to be disbursed from the loan would be the
prevailing commercial rate plus the exchange surcharge (not to exceed
30%).   The exchange rate derived from this formula would roughly
approximate the average between the effective import and export rates,
and thus should provide a reasonably fair basis for bid comparisons.
In the event of significant changes in the exchange system, the parties
would reconsider this formula.
28.       A further matter raised by the Government concerns the protection
which should be afforded to local industry.   On this point, discussions
led to the agreement that the maximum protection would be 15%.
29.       On the basis described above, the procedure for comnaring local
and foreign bids and making disbursements covering contracts obtained
by local bidders would be as follows: (1) a local bid in cruzeiros will
be converted into dollars at the rate of exchange described in paragraph 27
above; (2) the lowest local bidder will be awarded the contract if his
evaluated bid is less than the lowest evaluated foreign bid, plus
15%; and (3) dollar reimbursements from the loan for such local ex-
penditures will in principle be computed at the rate described in
paragraph 27 above.   Howrever, inasmuch as such reimbursements will have
to be converted into cruzeiros at the prevailing Banco do Brasil rate
of exchange, this may cause a shortage of cruzeiros to the Borrower
approximately equal to the amount of the exchange surcharge.   Any such
shortage would be made up by the State under the Project Funds Agreement
(paragraph 57).   For administrative convenience in making disbursements
from the loan in respect of cruzeiro expenditures the Bank has agreed to
establish from time to time a common disbursement percentage based on
the relationship between the Banco do Brasil rate at which loan funds can



- 8 -
be converted (presently Cr$1825 = US$ 1), and the exchange rate used
for bid comparisons (presently Cr$2035 = US$ 1).    Accordingly, a 90%
rate has been established for the time being.
VI.   ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
30.       The Xavantes power station, estimated to cost US$159 per kw,
is typical of the low cost hydroelectric resources remaining to be
developed in South Central Brazil.    The only alternative is thermal
power, the cost of which would not approach the low cost of hydroelectric
power.   Canambra, a consortium of foreign engineering firms studying
the electric utility industry in this region, places Xavantes on the
priority list of the projects which are already under construction or
planned for early execution, and whose economic justification is
clearly established.
31.       Much of the hydro development in the South Central region
has been undertaken as part of a plan for the economic development of
specific areas, and the development of the Paranapanema River by the
State of Sao Paulo is an instance of this.    The preceding projects
built on this river were of smaller size and of characteristics suited
to the early electricity growth requirements of the region.    Xavantes
is much larger and its capacity will be suited to the growing regional
demand.
VII.   THE FUTURE EXPAANSION PROGRAM
32.       USELPA proposes to construct the Piraju hydro station on the
Paranapanema River, with a capacity of 100 MW, as the next step in develop-
ment of the river.    In this connection, the future provision of power
for USELPA will have to be considered in terms of developments which may
occur in South Central Brazil.    The possible reorganization of utilities
(paragraph 9) would have a substantial effect on progress of development.
Another factor is that since much of IJSELPA's production is to be sold
to Sao Paulo Light, a member of the Brazilian Traction group, construction
of other hydro stations to supply the latter could result in additional
USELPA power becoming available for sale to the small)distribution
companies it supplies.   There may not be economic justification for
the early development of small sites in South Central Brazil, such as
Piraju.   Plans for expansion of USELPA's resources should consequently
be considered tentative.   Assurances have been obtained that during
the construction of Xavantes, USELPA will not undertake any major
expansion project, other than the transmission associated wvith Xavantes,
without the agreement of the Bank.

VIII. FINANCLIL ASPECTS
Tariffs
33.       The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are
contained in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees,
including in particular a decree of February 26, 1957 and three decrees
dated November 4, 196h. The Water Division of the Ministry of Mines and
Energy is responsible for implementation of the Water Code, including
the granting and supervision of concession contracts and the review and
approval of tariff applications.
34.       Under the regulations which have applied until recently, tariffs
were to be reviewed every three years to yield revenues which would cover:
(a)   all operating costs;
(b)   straight-line depreciation on the historic value of gross
plant in service, at annual rates prescribed by the Water
Division, presently up to 8% for thermal plants and up to
5% for all other facilities, including hydro plants;
(c)   amortization of the total investment in the concession at
annual rates, determined in the concession contracts approved
by the Water Division, not to exceed 3%;
(d)   a cumulative return of 10% on the historic value of the re-
munerable investment. Remunerable investment is defined as
depreciated plant in service at year-end, plus an allowance
for working capital consisting of actual cash, up to the
amount of the depreciation reserve, two months' billings and
operating inventories.
35.       In addition, adjustments in the form of surcharges on the
original three-year tariff were permitted, subject to approval by the
Water Division: (a) semi-annually for increases in foreign debt service
due to changes in foreign exchange rates, (b) monthly for increases in
wages, social benefits, cost of fuel and purchased power.
36.       The rapid depreciation of the currency in recent years resulted
in the deterioration of the earnings and finances of utilities. Due to
inadequate implementation of the regulations and to delays in obtaining
the permitted adjustments, utilities have seldom been able to charge
depreciation and investment amortization at the rates prescribed, let
alone to earn the permitted 10% return on investment.   However, the
fundamental shortcoming of this policy was the use of historic values
for computing the tariff base as these were a fraction of what they
would have been had the currency remained stable. Thus, in real terms,
returns on investment have been decreasing gradually and returns on
equity have become negligible; as a result, utilities have been unable
to generate funds internally towards financing expansion, or to raise
outside funds, except from the Federal or State Governments.



- 10 -
37.       The revaluation of assets for tariff making purposes has thus
become an essential condition of the financial soundness of utilities.
This measure, which had been expected to take place within months after
the signing of Loan 211-BR in late 1958, but failed at the time to obtain
Parliamentary approval, has recently been enacted by two decrees defining
the methods for revaluing assets and amending the Water Code to allow
tariffs to be determined on the basis of corrected rather than historic
values, starting January 1, 1965.
38.       The decree covering revaluation of assets is patterned after
the provisions of the existing legislation governing the revaluation of
balance sheets for all corporations other than utilities and government-
controlled corporations. It provides for the revaluation of balance
sheet accounts, using official annual correction factors, based on cost
of living indices published by the National Economic Council. These
factors are applied to plant in service, depreciation and amortization
reserves, foreign currency loans and, specifically, local currency loans
from the National Development Bank (BNDE) and Zletrobras. Foreign
currency components of the balance sheet accounts are converted into
local currency at the rate of exchange at the time of acquisition of such
funds. The amount by which the revaluation of assets exceeds the revalua-
tion of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve. This
reserve, which is subject to a 5% tax, has to be converted into share
capital within a four-month period.
39.       The decree governing tariffs allows the use of revalued fixed
assets as the basis for determining tariffs. In the future, revaluation
of fixed assets and corresponding tariff adjustments can be made every
year as official correction factors are issued but this annual provision
is not mandatory. These adjustments will be subject to approval by the
Water Division. The adjustments for increases in operating costs as
described in paragraph 35 will be automatic. The other provisions of
the Water Code will be maintained. Thus, in principle, depreciation
and amortization of the concession investment could be charged at the
maximum rates that have been permissible until now, partly to offset
inflation. This, however, would result in a combined allocation which
would exceed substantially the usually accepted level of depreciation
charges; it would thus call for a considerable increase in USELPA's
future tariff structure.
40.       Because a final decision has not yet been made by USELPA as to
the tariff increase it will seek under the new regulations, the financial
projections in this report have been based on a minimum tariff that would
result in a reasonable level of earnings and would maintain the company
in a sound financial condition. This tariff is predicated on the assump-
tion of a 10% return on average, rather than year-end, revalued plant in
service, after providing for depreciation at a rate of 2k%, and omitting
the charge for amortization of the concession investment. On this basis
it is estimated that USELPA's tariff would have to be increased from
Cr$6.76 per kwh (4.5 mills US), the September 1964 level, to Cr$15.59
(10.4 mills US).



- 11 -
41.       USELPA is preparing an application for a tariff increase with
the expectation it will be granted by May 1965. 5Jhile it does not expect
to ask for the maximum permitted, which might result in a prohibitive in-
crease, it does intend to seek a level of rates which would result in a
return of at least 10% as described in the preceding paragraph. Assurances
have been received that tariffs will be set and maintained at such levels
as to provide revenues sufficient to cover all operating expenses in-
cluding depreciation at a rate of 2-k% and a return of not less than 10%
on average net revalued fixed assets. An increase in tariffs to bring
revenues to this level would be a condition of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan.
Audit
42.       USELPAts accounts have been audited and certified annually by
Ratio S/C, Contadores Auditores, a local firm composed of former govern-
ment accountants. Detailed audit reports have, however, never been
issued. These arrangements are inadequate, especially in view of USELPA's
expansion and of the difficult accounting problems which will confront it,
including revaluation of assets. Assurances were received that auditors
acceptable to the Bank would be appointed.
Insurance
43.       USELPA's insurance program was reviewed. It was noted that
adequate insurance coverage had been maintained up to the point when pro-
jects under construction were completed and placed in operation. USELPA
has no insurance protection against losses resulting from accidents or
damages to plant or equipment occurring during operations, because of the
difficulties in obtaining such insurance in view of the effects of in-
flation. It was agreed during negotiations that USELPA would investigate
the possibility of obtaining such insurance protection through the State
of Sao Paulo or make other satisfactory arrangements that would fulfill
the requirements of the Loan Agreement.
Past Earnings
44.       Actual income statements for the three years through December
31, 1963, and estimated results for 1964 are shown in Annex 4. Although
an analysis of the results is made difficult by the continuing depre-
ciation of the cruzeiro, it is clear that the results were poor. Partly
due to a decline in power sales, reflecting unfavorable water conditions,
and a further expected increase in the cost of foreign exchange, fiscal
year 1964 will end with an estimated operating loss of Cr$ 905 million
before interest charges of Cr$ 331 million. Prior to 1964 USELPA failed
to earn even the return on nominal historic values permitted by the
tariff regulations. This was due partly to serious delays in obtaining
adjustments and partly to USELPA's own policies of applying for lower
tariffs than permitted by regulations. Prior to 1964, USELPA based
its tariff applications on a return of 6%, instead of 10%, on the historic



- 12 -
value of investment, after straight-line depreciation at 3%, rather than
the maximum 5% permiszible, and omitting any charge for amortization of
the concession investment. This was changed in 1964, when USELPA applied
for and obtained in June, tariffs intended to yield the permitted 10%
nominal return, after charging depreciation and amortization of the con-
cession investment at the maximum rates permitted. This new tariff repre-
sents an increase of about 174% over the average rate for 1963.
45.       Brazilian law requires electric utilities, during the construc-
tion period, to charge the related work in progress account with amounts
which represent capitalized interest at the rate of 10% per annum, on
equity funds utilized for such construction (paragraph 22). The general
practice is to credit corresponding amounts to the income statement as
an offset against interest expense. In the case of USELPA, however,
because of the large proportion of equity funds to be used for the ex-
pansion program, and because of the 10% rate required for computing
capitalized interest, this practice results in distorted and misleading
annual amounts transferred to surplus. To show a clearer financial
projection an alternative method has been used whereby su^h interest is
credited to a special account entitled, "Reserve for Capitalized Interest
on Equity Funds."   After construction work has been completed and the
assets are put into operation, this reserve account is written down
annually. The rate of the write-down is the same rate used to record
depreciation. This accounting procedure results in more realistic
annual amounts transferred to surplus and does not affect the net operating
income, tariff base or debt/equity ratio.
Present Financial Position
46.       The balance sheet as of December 31, 1964 has been estimated on
the basis of data available in September 1964. The proposed revaluation
was computed on the basis of official correction factors through 1963
and an estimated correction factor of 1.6 for 1964, which resulted in an
equivalent of Cr$1,500 to US$1. The financial projections have been
maintained at this fixed level because the future purchasing power of the
cruzeiro is unpredictable. Most of the effects of the decreasing purchasing
power of the cruzeiro have been provided for under existing regulations
by revaluations and tariff adjustments.
47.       The net assets of USELPA before and after revaluation as of
December 31, 1964 are shown in the following table:

48.       Fixed assets in operation, 90% of which are depreciable assets,
would increase to more than six times to Cr$90.1 billion.    The reserve for
depreciation would increase from Cr$1.3 billion to Cr$3.6 billion.   As
a result, net fixed assets in operation, which represent most of the basis
for computing returns on investment, would increase to about seven times
to Cr$86.5 billion.
49.       After revaluation long-term debt would total Cr$32.9 billion
and equity would be Cr$81.6 billion resulting in a debt/equity ratio.

50.       Based on current estimates of the capital contributions still
to be made before the end of the year, share capital would amount to
Cr$22.0 billion, as compared with Cr$14.3 billion at the end of 1963.
About 94% would be held by the State. Share capital will be increased
shortly, by conversion of the revaluation reserve estimated at Cr$h7.0
billion, to a total of Cr$69.0 billion. No cash dividends have been
paid in the past.
51.       As of December 31, 196h, the outstanding balance of the US$10.0
million Bank Loan No. 93-BR is estimated to be US$60.5 million, or Cr$9.8
billion equivalent after revaluation. The outstanding balance of the
US$13.4 million Bank Loan No. 187-BR is estimated to be US$11.8 million,
or Cr$17.7 billion equivalent. The agreements covering these two loans
included a debt limitation covenant limiting incurrence of long-term
debt to an amount equivalent to the total of share capital and surplus.
In reference to the proposed Bank loan, a debt limitation covenant based
on an assets test would be more efficient and easier to apply under pre-
sent circumstances. USELPA has agreed to such a covenant whereby long-
term debt outstanding at the end of any given year would be limited to a
maximum of two-thirds of the net revalued fixed assets including revalued
work in progress. In calculating debt outstanding, account will be taken
of actual cash drawdowns rather than the face amount of the loan contracts.
It has been agreed that the Borrower would be released from the debt limi-
tation covenants in previous Bank loans No. 93-BR and No. 187-BR.
52,       In accordance with the new revaluation legislation the BNDE
loan would be revalued from Cr$0.5 billion to Cr$5.1 billion, The Caixa
Economica do Estado de Sao Paulo (CESP) loan, amounting to Cr$0.3 billion,
is not subject to revaluation. This amount is offset by an equivalent in-
vestment in loans to private distribution utilities for the expansion
of their distribution systems.
Proposed Financing Plan
53.       A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the six-year
period through 1970 is shown in Annex 5. In the four-year period through
1968, construction expenditures are expected to total Cr$106.7 billion
equivalent, consisting of CrjP79.5 billion, the estimated cost to complete
the Xavantes project, Cr$23.5 billion, the estimated expenditure during
the period on the transmission expansion described in paragraph 20 and
Cr$3.7 billion, the estimated interest during construction. A Cr$8.5
billion increase in working capital would bring total requirements to
Cr$115.2 billion, as shown in the following summary statement for the
four-year period:

54.       The proposed IBRD loan of US$22.5 million, or Crp33.8 billion
equivalent, would represent about 29% of USELPA's requirements for the
period.   It was assumed to have a term of 25 years, including a five-year
grace period, and to carry interest at 512%.
55.       The statement shows that Cr2p8l.4 billion would be provided
from local sources.   This amiount, which is related to September 1964
price levels, is expected to increase as a result of inflation.    This
increase would be compensated by corresponding increases in USELPAts cash
generation, due to tariff adjustments reflecting periodic revaluation of
assets, and in State Governnment capital contributions, USELPA's main
source of funds, as a result of proposed arrangements described in
paragraph§ 
56.       The proportion in which the local currency requirements
described above would be contributed from internal cash generation and
from State Government appropriations can only be determined when the new
tariffs of USELPA are established.   Based on the minimum tariff assumptions
followed in this report and described in paragraph go it is expected that
cash generation, after deduction of the revaluation tax and debt service,
would be about Cr$34.1 billion, or about 30% of requiremnents.   No deduction
would be made for income taxes, to which USELPA is not subject, or for



- 16 -
dividends, which in accordance with past practice, would not be paid as
long as substantial cash contributions are required from the State.
57.       State Government appropriation would amount to about Cr$46.0
billion over the four years, which USELPA indicated, would be provided
in the form of share capital as has been the case for the Salto Grande
and Jurumirim Projects. Six per cent of the cost of the project would
be contributed by COPEL, an agency of the State of Parana. All of the
balance would be contributed by the State of Sao Paulo. In connection
with the two earlier IBRD loans, separate Project Funds Agreements were
entered into between the State of Sao Paulo and the Bank, by which the
State undertook to make available all funds necessary to carry out the
projects. The State of Sao Paulo has agreed to enter into a similar
Project Funds Agreement for the Xavantes Project.
Future Earnings
58.       Estimated income statements for the six years through 1970 are
shown in Annex 4. They are predicated on the tariff assumptions outlined
in paragraph 41 and thus show annual returns of 10% on the average re-
valuated net fixed assets in operation. Interest would be covered by
net income at least 3.2 times, rising to 7.7 times in 1970. Debt service
would be covered by internal cash generation at least 2.1 times during
the construction period and as much as 4.0 times in 1970, the year in
which the proposed loan would start being amortized. These coverages
are more than ample and reflect the large proportion of equity financing
involved in USELPA's present plans. There should be no objections for
USELPA to revise these plans and substitute long-term loans for part of
the contributions expected from the State, provided these plans conform
with the proposed debt limitation covenant (paragraph 51).
Future Financial Position
59.       Forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1964 through 1970 are
shown in Annex 6. They show debt/equity ratios changing gradually from
29/71 as of December 31, 1964 to 18/82 at the end of 1970, reflecting the
large equity financing presently contemplated for the period. After a
slow rise, of Cr$8.8 billion in the 1965-1968 construction period, current
and additional assets would increase by Cr$36.4 billion to Cr$47.3 billion
in the two years through 1970. Most of the latter increase would be
free cash, in excess of estimated working capital requirements, and available
for either new construction, as already contemplated, or for dividends on
share capital.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
60.       The project consisting of the Xavantes hydroelectric power station
and related transmission facilities is technically sound. The estimated
cost and the proposed completion schedule are reasonable. Adequate funds to
complete the project, in addition to those to be made available by the proposed
Bank loan, are to be provided by the State of Sao Paulo.



- 17 -
61.       The project is economically justified and there is a reasonable
market for the power it will produce.
62.       USELPA should be able to achieve and maintain a sound financial
position by setting tariffs to produce at least a 10% return on average net
fixed revalued assets in operation, as permitted under tariff regulations.
63.       The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$22.5
million equivalent with a term of 25 years, including a grace period of
five years.
