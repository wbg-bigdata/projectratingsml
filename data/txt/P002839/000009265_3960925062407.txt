FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1139-TO)
PREFACE
1.        This report presents a project completion report of Togo's Fourth
Highway Project. The project was completed in March 1988, and about US$166,000
in the credit account was cancelled effective July 15. 1988.
2.        The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office. It is based
on a review of the correspondence files, a project completion mission in
October 1988, and discussions with Bank staff assigned to the project.
3.        The Borrower has submitted a completion report which provided useful
cost data which has been included in the PCR. The Borrower's report emphasized
the progress made under the project in financing maintenance personnel and
included a list of recommendations for further training under a follow-on road
project.
4.        This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and a Cofinancier for comments and
they are attached to the Report as Attachment I.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1139-TO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The  Fourth Highway Project was conceived as a means to continue and
expand on the results of the Third Highway Project (para 1.02).
Cbjectives
2.        The main objectives were to (a) increase DTP's capacity to maintain
and improve the road network, in part by reducing the shortage of trained
personnel through the hiring of qualified medium-level staff; (b) prevent the
increase of road transport costs and costly road reconstruction by timely
strengthening of sections of the paved roads; (c) promote the improvement of
selected east-west road liks to open new agricultural areas; and (d) improve
transport planning and coordination (para 2.08).
Imolementation Experience
3.        The  Government  was  strongly  opposed  to badly  needed  technical
assistance.   Its cumbersome administrative procedures,  slowness  in making
decisions, and delayed budgetary allocations all hampered project execution
(paras 5.01 and 8.01).
4.        The diversion of project-financed equipment to work outside the project
is a direct result of insufficient funding. This could have been remedied by
the establishment of a Road Fund which became a controversial issue within the
Association (para 5.06).
Results
5.        The work of the consultants was generally properly executed, but they
were handicapped by delays in signing their contracts and slow payment for their
services (para 6.01).
6.        The combined ERR for the project is 14? compared to 56? at appraisal.
This sharp drop is due to a decline in traffic growth by almost one half caused
by the severe macro-economic problems in the country (para 4.08).
7.        The overall performance of the GOT was poor.  There was a shortage of
funds for the project, and administrative decisions were delayed (para 5.01).



- vi
Sustainability
8.        The  project  is  sustainable  on  the  assumption  that  appropriate
arrangements for the timely availability of funds for road maintenance will be
established.
Findings and Lessons
9.        The performance of the Association in preparing and supervising the
project was generally adequate, and it closely coordinated its operations with
those of the co-lender.   However,  there was internal disagreement  in the
Association regarding the establishment of a Road Fund, and it gave contradic-
tory advice to the Borrower on this matter (paras 7.01-7.02).  Lessons to be
learned by the Association include the need to (a) speed up the Government's
decision making capability; (b) establish a better way of assuring prompt funding
of road maintenance in the local budget to avoid further diversion of equipment
to non-project use; (c) develop a proi. . to encourage small- and medium-size
contractors to bid on road works; and (di restrict departmental forces to works
of a type that is either unsuitable for execution by contract, or not of interest
to private industry (para 8.10).

I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Association first started financing the road sub-sector in Togo
in 1968 with a Highway Maintenance Project (USS2.7 H).  This was followed by
the Second Highway Project in 1973 (US$8.7 M). the Third Highway Project in 1977
(US$10.0 M), and the Fourth Highway Project in 1981 (USS20.0 M). A Feeder Road
*           Project (Credit 810-TO) was e-.roved in 1978 for US$5.8 M. The audit and projecr
completion reports prepared on the first three highway and feeder roads projects
noted that Bank-financed equipment had been diverted from the First Highway
Maintenance Project to work outside the project, that the civil works were
generally satisfactorily executed, and that results on training were disap-
pointing.
1.02      The Fourth Highwav Project was conceived as a means to continue and
expand on the results of the Third Highway Project.   It was prepared by the
Togolese Administration with the help of technical assistance provided under
the Third Highway Project. Implementation of the Third Highway Project started
in mid-1977. It consisted mainly of reconstruction of paved and gravel roads,
and provision of technical assistance to the Directorate of Public Works (DTP)
for improving its organizational capacity to program and carry out road
maintenance works, and to the Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT) for
overall transport planning and coordination.   Works under the project were
completed in DTP in early 1981, but in MCT, which started very late, they
continued until the end of 1982, after the Fourth Highway Project became
effective.
1.03      The responsibility for carrying out the road works in the Fourth
Highway Project was entrusted to the Ministry of Public Works, Mines, Power and
*-Water Resources (MPWMP). 1/ The MCT was responsible for the transport planning
and coordination component.
1.04      This report is based on a review of the correspondence files including
supervision reports, a project completion mission in October 1988, and
discussions with Bank staff assigned to the project.
IX. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01      During implementation af the Third Highway Project, the Government of
Togo (GOT) carried out several studies to define the content of a follow-on
project. The main objectives v-ere to improve its capability to maintain the
road network,  and to develop an administrative  capacity for planning and
coordinating the transport sector. With financing from the project and other
donors, consultants were appointed to:  (a) conduct feasib'lity and engineering

studies for construction or rehabilitation of selected roads: (b) analyze the
Togolese Railway Company (CFT) and propose an action plan to improve its
operations; and (c) evaluate the needs for recruiting specialized staff and for
training all personnel in charge of roads or equipment maintenance.  In late
1979, these studies were sufficiently advanced to enable the scope of a possible
Fourth Highway Project to be defined and a preliminary cost estimate prepared.
2.02      The proposed project was noted as being a continuation of the efforts
undertaken under previous projects. It originally included the construction of
the Bassar-Mango Road (!.35 km), but a recently completed feasibility study showed
that it was difficult to justify at this stage becaase no firm investment program
existed for the road zone. It was agreed with the Government that part of the
road should be considered for inclusion in a proposed Rural Development Project.
2.03      In view of the Government's stringent budgetary constraints,  the
Association considered it necessary to limit to a minimuo the rogolese financial
contribution to the project.   It also considered reducing the scale of the
project and, if necessary, financing part of the recurrent expenditures of
periodic maintenance.   At a briefing meeting, held on April 9, 1980 before
departure of the appraisal mission, the mission was requested to advise the
Gcvernmert that the following would be considered by the Association as
conditions of negotiation of the project:   (a) the creation of a Transport
Planning and Coordination Unit (TPCU) in the MCT. which had been called for
under the Third Highway Project; and (b) the preparation of an action plan to
improve operations of the CFT.
Appraisal
2.04      The project was appraised in Hay 1980.  The main issue was the GOT's
difficult financial situation, which resulted in a lack of capacity to finance
its part of the project, as well as the recurrent costs of highway maintenance.
The mission evaluated two different project sizes amounting, respectively, to
US$30 and US$21 M. As the IDA lending program was limited to US$12 M for this
project, even the lower cost solution left a financing gap of about US$11 M.
2.05      The Association contacted potential donors to find a co-financier for
the project, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund
expressed interest. At the same time, the European Development Fund (EDF) was
preparing a four-year program of heavy repairs and periodic maintenance on about
250 km of paved roads, and construction of about 10 km of new roads to replace
a stretch of the international road from Lome to Cotonou, which was threatened
by coastal erosion. However, EDP did not wish to participate in the IDA project.
Although there was still a possibility that OPEC might be interested in the
project, IDA later decided to increase its contribution from US$12 M to US$20 M
to avoid delays in project processing. Shortly thereafter, the OPEC Fund decided
to participate in the project, which permitted proceeding with the full size
project as originally envisaged, and reduce the GOT's financial participation.
2.06      Negotiations were held from March 9 to 11, although the action plan
for improving CFT operations (para 2.01) was not yet ready. The GOT had given
prior assurance that this action plan and its implementation would be the highest
priority in the work program of the newly created TPCU. An additional component
consisting of technical assistance to MCT to help start the TPCU program was
included in the project.

2.07      The credit was approved by the Board on May 7, 1981; it contained one
special effectiveness condition. i.e., the fulfillment of all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the OPEC loan agreement.  The latter was signed
on July 28, 1981 and the IDA Credit Agreement was signed on October 28.  The
remaining conditions of credit effectiveness were not fulfilled until Septem-
ber 2. 1982. nearly one year after signature of the credit.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.08      The main objectives were to (a) increase DTP's capacity to maintain
and improve the road network. in part by reducing the shortage of trained
personnel through the hiring of qualified medium-level staff; (b) prevent the
increase of road transport costs and costly road reconstruction by timely
strengthening of sections of the paved roads; (c) promote the improvement of
selected east-west road links to open new agricultural areas: and (d) improve
transport planning and coordination.
2.09      To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project included:
(a)  a three-year training program for road maintenance
personnel,   including   technical   assistance
(120 man-months) and fellowships;
(b)  procurement of road maintenance equipment and
spare parts;
(c)  pavement strengthening of the Lomd-Nots4-Atakpamd
road (157 km);
(d)  preinvestment studies of the Notse-Tohoun road
(57 km); and
(e)  technical assistance to MCT including its General
Directorate of Transport (60 man-months) and CFT
(46 man-months).
The total cost of the project was estimated at US$31.2 M. OPEC participated in
the financing of the project with a loan of US$7.4 M. The project was expected
to be completed by June 30, 1985.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Proiect Start-uo
3.01      Implementation of the project got off to a good start as the documents
had been prepared under an earlier project. However, several delays occurred
in the initial stages of project execution, often for reasons of slow procure-
ment procedures.
3.02      The tender procedure for procurement of technical assistance and
consultant's  services was initiated by DTP soon after negotiations.   The
Government's proposals were submitted to the Association in November 1981.  The



evaluations of consultant's proposals were based on cost as the only selection
criteria.
3.03      It took more than 15 months for the first contract for the training
component to be signed and the consultant to be notified to proceed. Further-
more, it took more than two years after the decision to award a contract for
the Notse-Tohoun preinvestment and feasibility study before a contract was
signed. By this time, the first stage of the study had been completed by the
consultant. Due to these long delays, the teams of experts proposed at the time
of tendering were no longer available.   It took several additional months to
assemble new teams acceptable to the Government. However, these delays did not
significantly affect project execution since the consultants agreed to start the
works before formal authorization.
Training Program
3.04      According to their terms of reference, the consultants responsible for
the training program were to assist in the selection of about 180 new technical
staff, and to train them after their appointment. The recruitment of technical
staff for DTP had to be cancelled as a result of the subsequent Government
freeze on hiring. To make matters worse, many of the best skilled people were
obliged to leave the service in 1985 in observance of a new law which required
immediate retirement of all civil servants who had reached the age of 55, or
had 30 years of service.   As a consequence,  this program was restricted to
existing DTP personnel whose technical levels and aptitudes were low.
3.05      In the DTP's opinion, the need for a training program was not evident
and it was reluctant to accept that all personnel, including high level
managers, need training.   As a consequence,  these managers were not well
informed of the training activities financed under the project, and they were
not in a good position to support and cooperate with the consultant's program.
For these reasons, and also due to a large turnover of personnel, the results
of the training program were rather disappointing. At the end of the project,
only 53 trained, lower level technicians (mechanics, overseers, storekeepers,
etc.) remained in place in DTP. The indispensable mid-level staff had not been
recruited, and no training program had been arranged for high level staff.
Preinvestment Studies of the Notse-Tohoun Road (57 km)
3.06      Although very reluctant to do so, the consultant felt obliged to start
this work before finalization of his contract. The TOR for the study specified
that a state-owned consulting firm would be associated in the work for an amount
representing about ZOZ 'f the contract value.  The Association disagreed with
the principle of an imposed joint venture and required that the national
consulting firm be associated with the study only as a sub-contractor of the
selected consultant, who would remain entirely responsible for the conclusions
of the study.   The national sub-contractor was given the responsibility for
implementing the land surveys under the control of the responsible consultant.
Before beginning the second phase of the study, the lead consultant had to send
a special mission to Togo to correct the poor topographical work executed by
its sub-contractor.
3.07      The first phase of the study was completed long before the contract
was signed. The consultant was not willing to start the second phase until his
contract had been signed.   This resulted in long delays.   The second phase



consisted mainly of the engineering study of the road and establishment of the
tender documents for execution of the works.  The final report of the study was
sent to the Bank about six years after agreement to award the study.
3.08      The  studies were  successfully  carried  out,  and because  of  the
availability of surplus credit funds (para 3.18). the rehabilitation of the road
was added to the project.   These works were satisfactorily executed by DTP
forces without use of any technical assistance.
Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.09      Road maintenance equipment and spare parts were procured through ICB
within reasonable time limits. However, some difficulties occurred after the
contracts were awarded because the larger suppliers would not place orders with
their manufacturers until they received down payments. As a result, the terms
of delivery had to be extended, and delivery was not substantially completed
until 1984.  In the meantime, the Government diverted the equipment to other
areas. It was not until the Association agreed to finance the Nots4-Tohoun Road
(para 3.20) that the equipment was returned to its normal use.
Pavement Strengthenina of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road
3.10      On December 4, 1981, the GOT invited bids for the rehabilitation of
the above road. The works were divided in three lots and the prequalification
documents specified that not more than two lots would be awarded to a single
contractor.   Nevertheless,  some bidders submitted optional offers  for the
execution of all three lots. The tender evaluation commission proposed to award
all three lots to the lowest priced bidder. The bidder for Lot 1 objected to
the proposed award and the Association concluded that the protest was justified.
The Government agreed, and awarded only Lots 2 and 3. Certain design changes
were made in Lot 1 which led to a retendering for that lot.  The Association
raised no objection to this procedure. As a consequence of this retendering,
the three lots were awarded to the same single bidder. No time was lost since
the contractor had started work on the lots previously awarded.
3.11      In order to counter the road deterioration which happened after the
initial engineering study until execution of the works, and also in order to
enable the most trafficked sections of the road to be widened from 6 to
7 meters, the Association and OPEC Fund agreed to increase by 15? the quantities
of work to be included in the contract.   The supervision of the works was
entrusted to consultants.   They reevaluated section by section the volume of
work needed for satisfactory rehabilitation.   As a result of the low prices
tendered, the additional works were accommodated within the allotted financing.
The works were executed within the time limits without any problem.   During
implementation, the team of expatriate inspectors were asked to develop a
training program for their Togolese counterparts.   This program was executed
satisfactorily.
3.12      In his tender, the contractor proposed to execute Lot No. 2 with a
base course composed of crushed stone instead of standard stabilized laterite
cement usually used in Togo. This proposal was accepted by DTP. The contrac-
tor did not entirely master the production of crushed stone, and the final
quality of the road appears to be lower than on the other lots. After four
years of use, this part of the road needs substantial repairs. This is one of



the priority works to be conducted under the follow-on Transport Rehabilitation
Project (TRP) now underway.
Technical Assistance to MCT
3.13      These services were procured through a negotiated contract with the
consulting firm already in charge of the same activity under the Third Highway
Project, in line with Bank guidelines for selection of consultants. Further,
the GOT requested and the Association agreed to a one-year extension of their
services in order to permit the implementation of the action plan for improve-
ment of CFT operations. However, in line with Government regulations, a new
contract had to be awarded for this extension. It took more than two years for
the Government to sign this contract.   By that time, the services had been
completed for more than one year.
3.14      The technical assistance to t;CT continued the work _nitiated under
the Third Highway Project.  The work program focussed mainly on the railways
operations. At the conclusion of the Third Highway Project, the action plan,
which was a condition of effectiveness of the Fourth Highway Project, was sent
to the Bank for review.  Its main proposals were to assist CFT management by
introducing a computerized system including analytical accountancy, rehabilita-
tion of some tracks and rolling equipment, increase of tariffs and closing down
of several workshops and uneconomic services, including the Lome-Andho line.
To execute this action plan, 56 man-months of technical assistance to CFT and
80 man-months to MCT were spent.
3.15      The MCT team analyzed the closure of the Lome-Andho line and ways to
minimize the consequences. The creation of a regular bus line service between
Lome and An4ho was considered necessary.   Private transport operators were
consulted, but they did not manifest an interest in operating such a service.
The closure was then made without any compensatory measures and no disruptions
appeared, as the existing road transport capacity on a parallel road was
sufficient to avoid any difficulty.
Road Fund
3.16      Because of its difficult financial situation, the GOT was unable to
allocate the funds called for in the Credit Agreement, to the road maintenance
budget.  The Association reminded the Government of its commitment under the
Credit Agreement and. finally, the GOT met this condition. Subsequent super-
vision missions discussed with the concerned Ministries a way to establish an
acceptable mechanism for assuring adequate and timely funding for road main-
tenance. including feeder roads. It was concluded that the best way would be
to modify the existing legislation relative to a Road Fund to ensure that
(a) the Fund would have financial and managerial autonomy; and (b) its revenues
would be directly provided by earmarked taxes or levies. The Association agreed
and assured the GOT that it would make available all unallocated funds from the
project to help in establishing a Road Fund.
3.17      While the GOT was preparing new legislation for a Road Fund, some
opposition arose in the Bank against the earmarking of funds as proposed in
para 3.16. This opposition was communicated to the GOT, and, consequently, the
expected action for improving road maintenance financing did not materialize.
(See also paras 7.01-7.02.)



-7-
Surplus Funds
3.18      By 1985, the project as originally envisioned had been substantially
completed. However. as a result of a strong US dollar to the CFA franc, it was
expected that surplus funds amounting to about US$6.5 M would be available for
additional studies and works. The Association agreed to include the following:
(a)  a feasibility study for the follow-on project;
(b)  a 3 km spur linking Lomd-Atakpam6 to the center of the city of
Atakpame;
(c)  to extend the rehabilitation works on the main north-south paved
road (para 3.10) to include the Sokod6-Kara section; and
(d)  rehabilitation of the Notse-Tohoun Road.
3.19      Schedule 2 of the Credit Agreement was amended on July 22, 1985 by
adding a new project component for *urgent repairs and periodic maintenance."
At the same time, the closing date was extended by 18 months to June 31, 1987.
OPEC restricted its agreement only to the paved road section Sokod6-Kara and
had to prepare a new loan agreement for the use of its uncommitted funds. This
was signed on August 1986 and amounted to US$2.4 H. IDA also agreed to finance
1002 of the feasibility study for the follow-up project on which negotiations
were already underway (para 3.05).
3.20      The GOT also requested that IDA and OPEC increase their disbursement
percentages for civil works from 791 to at least 852. Both IDA and OPEC agreed,
and, in order to accelerate their disbursements, and to stimulate the economy.
they brought their combined disbursements percentage for the civil works up to
932.
The Feasibility Study
3.21      In 1983 and in line with Association guidelines which allow the
Borrower to select a single consultant acceptable to IDA, a consultant was
selected without competition by the DTP to carry out the feasibility study for
an IDA follow-up project (para 3.12). Negotiations started in August 1983, but
a year later, this arrangement was rejected by the Government for lack of
conformity with its own regulations that demanded some form of competition, and
it was decided to proceed by competitive proposals from a short list of consul-
tants. The invitations to bid were sent in March 1985, the contract award was
proposed in October 1985 and the final signature and the authorization was given
on September 9. 1986, over three years after the process was initiated. and six
months after completion of the feasibility study. This study provided the basis
for the preparation of the TRP which was approved in January 1988.
Spur Road to Atakoame
3.22      At the request of the GOT, IDA and OPEC agreed to finance a spur of
about 3 km, linking the road with the center of the city of Atakpame. The cost
of these additional works was about US$0.5 H. The final cost for rehabilitation
of the Lome-Atakpame road, including this additional spur and all supervision
fees, amounted to about US$135,000 per kilometer, which was reasonable.



Sokod6-Kara Road
3.23      In 1986. GOT invited bids for the works to be executed on the above
road. The engineering study and the preparation of the tender documents had
been financed by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC).   Several
bidders made an alternative offer for the execution of the pavement course with
bituminous concrete instead of the more usual surface treatment as was called
for in the tender documents. The cost of this alternative was about 30t higher
than the specified solution. The DTP and the highest levels of the Government
were in favor of this proposal. however, and sought the agreement of the
Association. After an in-depth review by the consulting firm which had carried
out the engineering study using the HDM Model, and by the Association, and upon
the Government's offer to finance itself the difference in cost, the Association
and OPEC finally agreed to the Government's proposal in December 1986.  The
contract was finalized and the contractor was notified to proceed in July 1987.
3.24      The contractor started work in February 1987, before his contract was
signed. As it is normal in Togo, he stopped during the heaviest portion of the
rainy season. During this period, many failures appeared in the pavement. The
Government and the contractor each called in their own experts to evaluate the
financial responsibilities, propose remedies for the already completed part of
the works, and recommend improvements of the working methods for the continua-
tion of the work. The experts agreed that improved resistance against surface
water penetration was required, and the corresponding design changes were
introduced.  The works were completed within the contractual ceiling, and at
the time of the last supervision mission, the pavement had remained in good
condition after a second rainy season.
3.25      Supervision of the works was financed by FAC, and the laboratory
control was financed under the project.   The final cost, including estimated
cost of supervision was about US$140,000 per kilometer, which was reasonable
for this type of work.
Nots6-Tohoun Road
3.26      The works on the Notsd-Tohoun road were carried out by force account
with DTP mechanized brigades. No quality controls were observed, and the final
quality is by far inferior to what could be expected if they had been carried
out by an experienced contractor and overseen by qualified inspectors using a
soils laboratory. However, the final costs are much lower than what would have
been the case of execution by contractor, although the amortization of equip-
ment. overhead and salary costs of DTP personnel and organization were not
charged to the out-of-.-ocket costs. The results should be checked during the
next several years to evaluate the possible benefits of doing works by force
account.    The  final cost  for rehabilitating  this  gravel  road was  about
US$15,000 per kilometer. This is considered a reasonable cost for a feeder road
which, of course, will have to be properly maintained.
Costs
3.27      Table 1 shows the estimated costs at appraisal as compared to the
costs at completion.  Table 2 shows the sources of financing, mainly IDA and
OPEC. As cost records are not complete, particularly of the Government's
contribution, the figures in the tables should be treated with some caution.

Disbursements
3.28     By the original Closing Date of December 31, 1985, the original
project had been fully completed but only about 70Z of the credit funds had been
disbursed. The Closing Date was extended to June 31, 1987. At the same time,
the Credit Agreement was amended to provide for a new project component
(para 3.18) for urgent repairs and periodic maintenance. This work was delayed
by exceptionally heavy rains, and a nine-month extension for final disbursements
was granted by the Association.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01     The economic  reevaluation reviews the:   (a) assistance  to road
maintenance; (b) strengthening and rehabilitation of the Lome-Atakpame Road
(160 km), including the spur road to Atakpame (3 km); and (c) use of surplus
funds for additional works: the Sokode-Kara Road (72 km); and the Notse-Tohoun
Road (57 km).
Assistance to Road Maintenance
4.02     The combined ERR for the paved and gravel roads, assuming good
maintenance. is estimated to be about 80? compared to the 902 estimated at ap-
praisal due to lower traffic on all roads as shown by the comparison of traffic
volumes on the road network. However, due to the less than adequate maintenance
being afforded the roads, this ERR is more realistically estimated to be about
40Z.

Road Strengthening and Rehabilitation
4.03     Works were accepted by the Government on the Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road
(157 km) in August 1984, approximately one year later than estimated in the
appraisal. Overall economic growth after 1984 declined sharply beginning with
the severe financial crisis in the late 1970s and the subsequent stringent



- 10 -
fiscal measures taken by the Government between 1979 and 1983 followed by a near
collapse of the world markets for phosphate and cotton in 1986.   This had a
profound effect on traffic growth, particularly near Lome. In 1983, before the
full impact of the crisis and compared to appraisal estimates, actual traffic
volumes were slightly higher for Lomd-Ts4vid (32 kcm), 21 lover by more than half
for Ts6vit-Notsd (60 km), and about the same for Notse-Atakpame (65 km, see
below). However, by 1986, the actual traffic from Lom4-Ts4vi* had dropped by
more than half that estimated for 1984.  The traffic from Tsdvi6 to Atakpame
remained fairly constant even showing a slight increase (about 3.SZ p.a.). This
traffic apparently was less dependent on export commodities. but not able to
sustain the growth (8Z p.a.) expected at appraisal.

(Rovi ed March 1907).
/c Estimated; 1983 traftic not available.
2I   The appraisal report broke this section up into two sections:  (a) Lomie-
AgouOv6 (9.8 km) with 1983 traffic estimated at 8,325 vpd; and (b) AgouOv4-
Tsdvie (22.2 km) with 1983 traffic at 5,345 vpd. The estimated weighted
average traffic for the two sections in 1983 would be 6,258 vpd or some 152
below the actual 1983 traffic for the entire section.

4.04      The rate of road deterioration on the Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road played
a significant role in the appraisal report's estimates of benefits.   The
deterioration problem from initial engineering until execution of works led to
an increase in quantities of work (but not in price) to be contracted. However.
it is difficult to assume the same rate of deterioration expected at appraisal
with less traffic than estimated.  Therefore, no additional deterioration is
assumed for the sections Tsevie to Atakpam4 due to the light traffic.   Some
deterioration is assumed for the Lome-Tsevie section due to the heavier traffic,
but instead of completely breaking up by 1985-87, as assumed in the appraisal
report. a slower deterioration is used with complete breaking up after 1994.
For these reasons, the reevaluation is conservative.
4.05      The reevaluation shows the works are justified with first year returns
ranging from 14? to 16?, with an overall ERR of 142 compared to that at
appraisal of 56? (Table 3).  Based on a ten-year economic life for the road
strengthening and revised lower annual growth rates of traffic between 5.02 to
6.5?, the combined ERR for the Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road is 15Z.  Assuming no
deterioration for the Lome-Tsevie section (32 km), its ERR would be 11? and the
combined ERR would then be 131, which is acceptable.
4.06      The evaluation of the Notse-Tohoun Road (57 km) is based on a total
final cost of CFAP 348,609,385. Maintenance costs are assumed to be CFAF 8 mil-
lion for the first three years and CFAY 13 million for subsequent years. Actual
traffic for 1986 is 193 vpd and is expected to grow at 10.1? p.a. The life of
the works is estimated to be 10 years. Using these costs, traffic and useful
life, the FYR is 152 and the ERR is 17?.
4.07      The evaluation of the Sokodd-Kara Road (72 km) made in 1986 gave an
ERR of 26?.  The road was accepted by the Government in April 1988.  Actual
traffic on opening year was 580 vpd, of which 35? are heavy vehicles. Traffic
growth is estimated at 6.0? p.a.. and the useful life of the works is estimated
to be 10 years. The reevaluation, based on this, gives a first year benefit of
21? and an ERR of 19S.
Overall Proiect
4.08      The combined ERR for the project is 14? compared to 56? at appraisal.
This sharp drop is due to a decline in traffic growth by almost one half caused
by the severe macro-economic problems in the country.
V. PERFORMANCE OF TEE BORROWER
5.01      The overall performance of the GOT was poor.   The very difficult
financial situation of the country during this period had resulted in a
concentration of all decisions at the Presidency.   This greatly slowed down
administrative decisions and, in particular, the awards of new contracts. All
decisions involving expenditures over US$30,000 were solely the responsibility
of the Chief of State. Below this threshold, any decision had to be counter-
signed by the Minister responsible and the Minister of Finance.  High level
authorities were so dominated by the numerous administrative controls that they
would not exercise any initiative.   Due to the lack of cash flow in the



- 12 -
Treasury, the budgetary allocations were rarely made available. The Ministers
responsible were told to minimize their expenditures with the result that even
the most essential expenditures were not made. The lack of motivation extended
to all administrative levels.
5.02      At appraisal of the Fourth Highway Project, it was agreed that the
training technical assistance team would be located at key positions within DTP
offices so that they could assist management in their specific tasks. Citing
the lack of office space, the DTP assigned the team to the attic of an old
workshop of the Equipment Division far from any other offices, cutting all
contacts between the expatriate experts and their Togolese counterparts.   In
1984, fearing the failure of the whole training program, an IDA supervision
mission insisted that the training program be revised entirely, and that it
receive better support from the DTP.  The one exception to the above was the
training received by local staff on supervision work (para 3.11).
5.03      Delays were caused by a lack of initiative on the part of the DTP in
finalizing contracts, authorizing payments from the national budget for supplies
and services, or forwarding applications to the Bank for disbursements.   In
spite of the numerous reminders from supervision missions, the DTP failed
regularly to meet its obligations in matters of reporting on project implemen-
tation. The 37 months needed to finalize the contract for the feasibility study
for the follow-on project delayed the beginning of the new project by three
years.   This delayed the start of the IDA toad rehabilitation program which
coincided with the start of the EDF-financed road program, thus confronting DTP
with bunching of its workload.
5.04      Three different Hinisters headed MCT during project implementation
which created confusion and uncertainty in GDT and the TPCU. The ministers did
not have sufficient time to become well informed of the objectives and work
program of the technical assistance team assisting the TPCU.  They gave more
attention to other activities, and were reluctant to support the project since
it included the closing down of several operations of the CFT.
5.05      Because of the lack of a budget allocation for the operations of GDT,
the project had to directly finance salaries and travel allowances for the
Togolese counterparts. Only one of these was recruited into the Civil Service
and, finally, he left the GDT to follow a two-year educational program. He left
the service without any staff to continue the work.
5.06      At the time of appraisal of the Fourth Highway Project, due to the
lack of operating funds, the mechanized brigades had been diverted from their
normal road maintenance use and used extensively to build rural roads financed
under the Bank-financed Feeder Roads Project.   The operating costs did not
include amortization of DTP's equipment which had depreciated above what was
expected, and it was decided during negotiations for the Feeder Road Project
(Credit 810-TO), that US$0.8 M would be allocated to replenish its equipment.
However, during the period of project implementation, the shortage of funds
continued. Thus, DTP continued to use its equipment on other works financed by
foreign aid such as the Bank's financed SOTOCO Rural Development and the
Manabeto Dam.   It is only when the Association agreed to finance the Notse-
Tohoun Road under the Project (para 3.18) that the DTP brigades were returned
to their normal use.

VI. THE CONSULTANTS' PERFORMANCE
6.01      Most of the consultants were engaged on the basis of the lowest price
tendered (para 3.02) and this probably had some influence on the quality of
their services.  Generally, their work was properly executed, even during the
long initial periods when they were awaiting the signing nf their contracts, and
remained uncertain as to what would be the finally accepted contractual prices
for their work.
6.02      The training technical assistance team prepared a final report which
provided an excellent source of data concerning the personnel of DTP and the
national road network.   This report was helpful in the preparation and the
appraisal of the follow-on project.
6.03      The team assisting the MCT performed well, but, due to the reasons
previously noted (paras 3.13 and 6.01), they failed to fully achieve their
institutional building objectives.
6.04      The consultants in charge of the road rehabilitation works performed
well and they trained Togolese inspectors with excellent results. Some of these
were later appointed to supervise the construction works of the new east-west
Natchamba-Kara-Ketao paved road financed by the African Development Fund and the
Kuwait Fund.
VII. THE ASSOCIATION'S PERFORMANCE
7.01      In the early stage of project implementation, the Association proposed
that the GOT earmark taxes or levies in order to assure a permanent and
sufficient source of revenue for the road maintenance budget (para 3.16). From
1982 to 1985 this proposal was raised frequently, and the Association committed
itself to assist in the establishment of a Road Fund. the creation of which was
a condition of negotiation of the proposed follow-on project. At the briefing
meeting before the departure of the follow-on project appraisal mission,
however, strong opposition arose in the Association against the creation of a
Road Fund.
7.02      The diversion of project-financed equipment to work outside the
project (para 5.06) where financing was available for its operation, is a direct
result of insufficient road maintenance funding. This could have been remedied
by the establishment of a Road Fund which, as noted above, became a controver-
sial issue within the Association.
7.03      In the matter of project processing, the Association's performance
was varied. In light of the extreme slowness of the GOT to negotiate contracts,
the decision to include in the original contract for road rehabilitation works
a provision of 15Z to cover physical contingencies (para 3.15) was wise.
However, IDA's judgment in approving the retendering of Lot 1 is questionable.
The Association concluded that the protest of the low bidder was justified, yet
allowed the Goverrment to re-tender the lot on the basis of a need for redesign.
Also, the exceptional agreement to award consultants' contracts on the basis of
price only was not wise.



- 14 _
7.04      IDA staff coordinated closely with its co-donor partner, the OPEC
Fund.   The Fund was promptly informed of the problems related to project
implementation and cooperated with IDA regarding decisions and loan agreement
amendments.
7.05      IDA's monitoring of the project was adequate and careful, so that most
of the problems could be quickly resolved. Unfortunately, even good supervision
cannot substitute for a borrower who was either unwilling or unable to take the
organizational and administrative steps needed to improve its own capability.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The Association faced strong opposition throughout project design and
implementation from local implementing agencies against any form of technical
assistance. The main causes of administrative slowness were the concentration
of decision making authority at the top (para 5.01). a lack of delegation and
unnecessary controls at each administrative level. While technical assistance
could have strengthened management and planning capacity, it could not have done
much about the problem of concentration of decision making authority at the top,
unless the Government was willing to change its internal procedures.
8.02      The inability of the Association to agree on the establishment of a
Road Fund or other suitable financial mechanism impaired proper road maintenance
works and ultimately led to a diversion of equipment.   There was internal
disagreement in the Association as to an appropriate formula to help the
Government recover adequate and timely resources for highway maintenance. This
disagreement was reflected in the Association's relationship with the Borrower
which led to contradictory advice to the latter. The issue, which existed over
much of the life of the project, should have been promptly resolved internally
by the Association.
8.03      Apart from the Road Fund issue, the Association performed adequately
in preparing and overseeing the project, and in enabling the borrower to carry
out a much larger share of works than originally envisaged.
8.04      The practice of consultants and contractors working in Togo of
starting work before their contracts are signed would indicate that they must
have allowed for this extra cost and risk in their prices.   This procedure
limits opportunities for work to wealthy expatriate firms, to the detriment of
small firms.   The practice should be discouraged, and the Borrower should
realize that prompt award of contracts will ultimately result in lower costs.
8.05      The combined ERR for the project is 14K compared to 56Z at appraisal.
This sharp drop is due to a decline in traffic growth by almost one half caused
by the severe macro-economic problems in the country.
8.06      The preparation of the follow-on project was based on the assumption
that an appropriate arrangement for the timely availability of sufficient funds
for road maintenance would be established.   This remains one of the most
important points unsolved at the end of the Fourth Highway Project. The case
for a Road Fund in that experience has shown that Governments are incapable of
mobilizing resources for road maintenance without some form of earmarking. It
is advisable that a Road Fund be established as long as the funds are used



- 15 -
exclusively for maintenance with appropriate provision for annual revision.
This issue should be carefully reviewed by the Association in order to give
guidance for further monitoring of the ongoing TRP. The road system is the only
sector whose operations are not assured liquidity throug.i earmarked revenues or
tariffs.
8.07      The development of a program to encourage small and medium-scale
contractors to bid on road maintenance and rehabilitation is handicapped by a
continuing shortage of local funds. This development is one of the objectives
of the follow-on project. but its implementation should be deferred until a
secure source of financing has been created to ensure that these contractors
are promptly paid, otherwise they will either avoid bidding on Government works
or run the risk of financial failure.
8.08      The  project  is  sustainable  on  the  assumption  that  appropriate
arrangements for the timely availability of funds for road maintenance will be
established.
8.09      The project demonstrated that while works carried out by departmental
forces are generally cheaper than works executed by contract. they tend to be
built to lower standards with little or no quality control because of the lack
of on site supervision. It is thus concluded that departmental forces should,
in general, be restricted to smaller works of a type that are either unsuitable
for execution by contract or not of interest to private industry.
8.10      Lessons to be learned by the Association include the need to (a) speed
up the Government's decision making capability; (b) establish a better way of
assuring prompt funding of road maintenance in the local budget to avoid further
diversion of equipment to non-project use; (c) develop a program to encourage
small- and medium-size contractors to bid on road works; and (d) restrict
departmental forces to works of a type that is either unsuitable for execution
by contract, or not of interest to private industry.
