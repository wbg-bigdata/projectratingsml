I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has requested Bank
financing to assist in the implementation of a project consisting of the
improvement and modernization of the paper mills of National Paper Company
(NATIONAL) and General Company for Paper Industry (RAKTA). These are the
largest two pulp and paper companies in Egypt and together account for over
70% of domestic paper production. Both are in the public sector; NATIONAL is
100% Government-owned, while some 16% of RAKTA's shares are in private hands.
The principal mills of the two companies are located almost adjacent to each
other at Tabia, some 30 km east of Alexandria (Map IBRD 14107). Total finan-
cing required for the entire Project (including interest during construction)
is estimated at US$76 million of which US$62 million (or 82%) will be foreign
exchange. A Bank loan totalling US$50 million is proposed (US$23 million for
NATIONAL and US$27 million for RAKTA), covering 95% of the estimated foreign
exchange requirements excluding interest during construction and working
capital. In addition to this proposed loan, the Bank has agreed that the
Government will on-lend US$0.8 million each to the companies from proceeds of
the Industrial Imports Credit/Loan (Cr-524/Ln-1062, Ln-1456) to finance the
preliminary studies required before the proposed Bank loan becomes effective
(para 1.05). The remaining financing required will be provided by the Govern-
ment and local financial institutions.
1.02      The major objective of the Project, which is the Bank's first
lending operation in Egypt's pulp and paper industry, is the provision of
facilities and technical assistance to NATIONAL and RAKTA in order to (i)
increase capacity; (ii) enable them to make full use of existing capacity
and thereby increase production to meet the growing demand for paper in
Egypt; (iii) improve quality to be better able to compete with imports; and
(iv) improve efficiency and reduce operating costs.
1.03      Bank involvement in the sector commenced in 1976 when the Govern-
ment requested financing of a nationwide pulp and paper sector study under
the Bank's First Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project to Egypt. 1/
The sector study, which was carried out in 1976-77 by the consultants Stadler
Hurter of Canada with the participation of Government and industry represen-
tatives, identified a number of potentially viable projects in the pulp and
paper industry, and recommended specifically that priority be given, inter
alia, to improvements at NATIONAL and RAKTA. Both companies have seen their
financial position deteriorate in recent years, primarily due to the inabil-
ity of their facilities to consistently produce marketable grades of paper
and board in the face of competition from imports. In mid-1978, Stadler
Hurter was awarded a further contract to undertake the detailed feasibility
studies required for those projects, which are also being financed under the
above mentioned Imports Project. Field work was completed by Stadler Hurter
in November 1978, and the project scope and its main components finalized
during December. Detailed technical specifications have been developed by
the consultants and capital cost estimates were completed in March 1979, and
revised in February 1980.

1.04      A preappraisal mission examined a number of aspects of the Project
in Egypt during October 1978. An appraisal mission consisting of Messrs.
Ewing, Wipplinger and Ichishifma of the Industrial Projects Department visited
Egypt in January, 1979, and subsequently met with representatives of the
Government, the companies and the consultants in Montreal in March, to review
project details and project costs.
1.05      To increase the ro]e of the private sector in industry, the Govern-
ment, in May 1979, expressed its preference to raise the funds necessary for
the Project, other than the flank loan, from non-government sources, and to
change the companies' legal status to Law 43. 1/ This legal change will free
the companies from the restrictive regulations of the public sector, particu-
larly those relating to compensation of skilled workers, engineers and
managers, to product pricing, and to profit retention policies. Since then
the Bank has been working closely together with the Government, the companies
and Egyptian financial institutions to effect this transfer which is one of
the first being applied to an operating public sector company in its entirety,
and which would be used as an example for others. In July, 1979 a Bank
mission determ'ned the steps and the timing of this transfer and a number
of important actions have already been completed, (approvals of the Ministry
of Industry, and of the companies Board of Directors and General Assemblies).
The companies have also retained the Arab Investment Bank (AIB), Cairo, an
Egyptian investment bank with an authorized capital of US$50 million equiva-
lent, established under Law 43, to manage their financing operations and
assist them in evaluating the companies' net worth which is one of the most
important aspects in determining the return on the new investors equity. A
preliminary evaluation of this net worth was carried out jointly by the
companies and AIB with the assistance of the Bank 2/. The necessary applica-
tion to the Investment Authority for establishment of the successor companies
under Law 43 was made in February, 1980, and the Investment Authority's review
of the evaluation of the successor companies' net worth, is expected to be
completed by July 15, 1980. Agreement has been reached with the Government
and the companies that the remaining legal steps required for establishment of
two successor companies under Law 43 shall be completed by February 28, 1981.
To avoid delaying the Project during these legal proceedings, the Bank has
agreed that the Government on-lends US$0.8 million each to each of the companies
from the proceeds of the Industrial Imports Credit/Loan I and II (Cr-524/Ln-1062,
Ln-1456), to finance the preliminary engineering studies required before the
proposed Bank loan becomes effective.
1/   Egyptian Law 43, which was promulgated in 1974 to attract private invest-
ment, gives company management the authority to manage their companies
along private enterprise lines notably by allowing them to set prices,
and establish compensation packages, which will attract and retain
qualified personnel, as well as by providing them greater freedom in
investment and profit distribution policies.
2/   To assist in evaluating the net worth of the companies, the Bank prepared
a paper entitled "Framework for Evaluation of NATIONAL and RAKTA Paper
Companies" - August 24, 1979.

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. The Industrial Setting
2.01      Industry has become an important sector of the Egyptian economy.
The share of manufacturing and mining (excluding petroleum) in GDP increased
from around 8-10% in 1946 to an estimated 17% in 1979. Industry employed 1.3
million persons, or nearly 13% of the civilian labor force, and was responsible
for about 30% of commodity exports in 1979. Industrial growth averaged about
8-9% during 1975-79 despite periods of stagnation due to severe foreign ex-
change constraints and dislocation from military conflicts. Industrialization
in Egypt has traditionally been inward looking. Emphasis on import substitu-
tion favored industrial productions of basic consumer goods and intermediate
goods. Capital goods industries have remained relatively insignificant,
accounting for only about 8% of total industrial value added in 1977.
2.02      With the nationalization of almost all large and medium-scale
industrial enterprises in the early 1960's, industry has become dominated
by the public sector. Enterprises of the public sector provided for about
two-thirds of industrial value added and half of the total industrial employ-
ment in 1977. These enterprises operate primarily in textiles, cement, food
products, basic metals, chemicals and engineering. However, private industry,
mostly small establishments producing basic consumer goods, still plays an
important role.
2.03      In the past, many industrial enterprises were established or taken
over by the public sector to support objectives of national self-sufficiency
in basic industrial goods. These enterprises were shielded against market
forces by a system of central allocations of raw materials and targeted
production volumes for which they were assured of a market. With prices
being fixed at both ends and strict regulations governing the allocation
of net profits, in effect little incentive was given to manage and operate
these enterprises efficiently. In addition, public sector enterprises were
used as a source of employment generation, which over time has led to sub-
stantial overstaffing and labor inefficiencies.
2.04      The re-orientation in industrial policies, which began in 1973 with
the announcement of liberalized import policies ("open-door policy"), was
accompanied by some relaxation of direct Government controls on industrial
investment, production and prices. However, the effect of this move on the
overall situation of public sector industrial companies has been quite limited
thus far. This is because the industrial environment is still riddled with
Government regulations that act against an efficient utilization of factors
of production, curtail management functions and often continue to provide no
incentives to labor to improve work efficiency and discipline. Therefore,
the process of introducing market mechanisms in industrial decision-making
is still slow and uneven, and affects some branches of industry more strongly
than others. Moreover, Government control over public sector enterprises
continues to be diffuse and cumbersome, and coordination among and within
industrial subsectors is difficult to achieve. Currently, the Ministry
of Industry is in charge of little more than 60% of the government-owned
industrial capacities, while the Ministries of Housing and Reconstruction,
Agriculture, Defense, Health and even Trade control other important parts
of the sector.



-4-
2.05      In the Ministry of Industry, the responsibilities for subsectoral
planning and project development rest with the General Organization for
Industrialization (GOFI). This organization of over 1,000 employees approves
all projects falling under the Ministry of Industry that exceed LE 750,000
(US$1.1 million) in value or require foreign currency from Government sources.
However, GOFI lacks the qualified staff necessary to establish proper criteria
and guidelines for project selection and the setting of investment. priorities
and cannot adequately screen project proposals made by public sector companies
under its jurisdiction.
2.06      The institutional constraints in industrial management and planning
in Egypt are reflected in the! country's 1978-82 Plan. 1/ This Plan calls for
Egypt's rapid industrialization as a means to stimulate the growth of the
economy, create productive euLployment, cater to basic consumer needs, and
to achieve some "export surplus". About LE 3 billion or a quarter of the
total investment volume of the Plan is allocated to industry. However, since
subsector issues and opportunities are not assessed in the Plan, it is
difficuA& to bring the proposed projects under any common denominators and
to give 'them specific priorities.
2.07      Evidently, many industry issues have been identified in general
terms and the Government is aware of them. These issues relate to the high
cost of operations of enterprises, many of which are operated by the public
sector under a protectionist shield. Other prevailing issues center around
the continued employment of obsolete and poorly maintained equipment, low labor
productivity because of overstaffing, insufficient training and inadequate
incentives, the shortage of technical and management skills, particularly in
the public sector, and distorted product pricing.
2.08      With the proposed Project it is hoped to address major issues
affecting the performance of the pulp and paper subsector. The Project aims
at introducing structural improvements and cost competitiveness (particularly
under the provisions of Law 43 with respect to setting prices, compensation
packages, and investment policies) into two of the major producers in the
industry. It is seen as a first logical step towards a long-term development
program not only for the pulp and paper industry but also for other public
sector companies in Egypt. The specific objectives pursued with the proposed
Project would supplement the work done by the Bank Group in other subsectors
of Egypt's industry.
B. The Egyptian Pulp and Paper Industry
1.   History of the Industry
2.09      Although the first mechanized paper mill of Egypt started operat-
ing at the beginning of this century, larger-scale pulp and paper making
was not introduced until the 1940's. In 1940, private investors established
the first major paper manufacturing company (NATIONAL, i.e. the predecessor
of one of the two loan beneficiaries) near Alexandria to produce paper from
locally available rice straw and imported pulp. In 1945, an additional
private company, Societe Industrielle du Moyen Orient (SIMO), was set up near
Cairo, with facilities for the production of low grade papers from waste
1/   A 1980-84 Plan is now in the process of preparation.



paper and rice straw. The third and largest of the industrial paper mills
(RAKTA) was established by the public sector in 1958 near Alexandria and
began operating in 1961 as an essentially rice straw based mill. Nationali-
zation of NATIONAL and SIMO in 1961 extended the responsibilities of the
public sector over most of the subsector, leaving only nine very small and
primitive mills, representing less than 10% of the country's papermaking
capacity, with the private sector.
2.10      Under the public sector, production capacities at NATIONAL and RAKTA
have been increased and modernized over the past two decades by adding new
pulp, paper and board lines and reconditioning older equipment. As a result
of this, the combined rated capacity of the public sector mills has risen to
about 140,000 tons per year (tpy) in 1978; however, capacity utilization is
currently only about 70% due in part to the technical problems associated with
the continuing use of poorly maintained and obsolete equipment at the NATIONAL
and SIMO mills, and in part to the problems of marketing the often poor
quality grades of paper produced by this equipment. Most of the increase in
paper and board production capacity in recent years has been accounted for
by RAKTA, whose rice straw pulping mill has become one of the largest of
its kind in the world. In addition to the investments made in these mills,
in 1965 the public sector set up the country's first bagasse based market
pulp mill located at Edfu in Upper Egypt, with a design capacity of 20,000
tpy. Despite this continuing development, Egypt's pulp and paper industry
has remained one of the smaller branches of the manufacturing sector. Its
contribution to total manufacturing value added was less than 3% in 1979,
and its share in total employment of the manufacturing sector was about 1%.
2.11      Mill output of paper and paper board which had grown rapidly during
most of the 1960's and early 1970's, declined over the past several years,
from over 140,000 tons in 1973 to less than 120,000 tpy during 1976-79, to
which the public sector mills contributed between 85 and 90%. This unfavor-
able overall performance of the industry is explained by the prevailing
acute operational problems of most mills (paras 2.13-2.15) and, particularly
since 1974/75, by the effects of competing paper and board imports of better
quality. As long as imports of paper and board were restricted due to foreign
exchange constraints, the domestic mills could sell whatever they produced in
the domestic market while still leaving part of domestic demand unsatisfied;
thus in 1973, when paper imports were still kept at an essential, rationed
minimum (60,000 tons, most of which was newsprint and other indispensable
papers and board), the domestic mills supplied over 75% of the paper and
board consumed in Egypt. This situation, however, changed drastically with
the liberalization of imports. By 1975, paper and board imports had tripled,
in part catching up with latent demand, to 186,000 tons, while the mills'
contribution to total apparent domestic consumption dropped to 42%. Import
levels remained high during 1976-79, averaging about 190,000 tpy or US$100
million equivalent a year, as for many grades, paper imports were comparable
in cost and were of a higher quality than domestic products. Competition
from imports added to the already existing mill problems and contributed
significantly to the overall decline in mill output in recent years, during
which Egypt's average self-sufficiency in paper and board fell further to
below 40%. Only those few small mills producing very low grade paper and
board, for which there are no equivalent or competitive imports, remained
essentially unaffected.



- 6 -
2.12      The development described above also had some structural impact
on Egypt's paper and board CDnverters, which in recent years have relied
increasingly on imports. In the production of corrugating board, for
example, the utilization of domestic corrugating medium and imitation kraft
declined as the two major pulblic sector converters, Verta and Moharrem Press,
set up new capacities to process imported kraft.
2.   Problems of the Industry
2.13      The principal constraints to improving the operating performance
of Egypt's pulp and paper industry relate to varying degrees of managerial
and operational problems at all mills (described for NATIONAL and RAKTA in
greater detail in Chapter III below), the strong influence of the Government
on the public sector companies' financial and investment decisions, which
effectively curtails required flexibilities in plant management, and a
general lack of overall policy guidance and common direction. The latter was
exacerbated by the temporary division of supervisory responsibilities of the
Government over the subsector between 1975 and 1978, when the Ministry of
Culture and Information assumed control over the three large public sector
mills (NATIONAL, RAKTA and SIMO), with the Ministry of Industry retaining
its supervisory responsibilities over the bagasse pulp mill at Edfu and the
converting companies. This anomaly was rectified in September 1978 when
NATIONAL, RAKTA and SIMO were reincorporated in the Ministry of Industry.
2.14      Other problems that continue to exist in the public sector pulp
and paper industry resemble the problems common to public sector industries
in Egypt in general, including:  (a) inadequate coordination with domestic
suppliers of chemicals and bagasse pulp as well as converters; (b) employment
policies that contribute to plant overstaffing with unskilled labor; (c) a
persistent shortage of skilled labor, managers and technicians, many of whom
continue to be lured away to higher paid jobs in the private sector and
neighboring oil-rich Arab countries; and (d) a still inadequate wage and
incentive system, particularLy compared to the private sector.
2.15      By bringing pulp and paper companies under Egyptian Law 43, mills
could be enabled to enjoy some of the advantages accruing to joint venture
or private sector companies in areas such as profit retention, investment
decisions, hiring, termination, remuneration and incentive policies. Through
such decision many of the problems noted above could be remedied to the benefit
of the companies concerned and the Egyptian economy as a whole. NATIONAL and
RAKTA, the sponsoring companies of the proposed Project, would in particular
be enabled by such a step to attract and retain competent management and
skilled staff, to stimulate productivity with meaningful incentive schemes and
generally, to achieve the flexibility of plant management necessary for the
effective implementation and operation of the proposed Project. Agreement has
been reached with the Government and the companies that they will establish
the two respective successor companies under the provisions of Law 43. These
successor companies will take over all of the operating and management respon-
sibilities of the existing companies, and assume all of their assets except
for NATIONAL's ALPA mill which is expected to be closed down in the mid-
eighties, and some of the land. The existing companies will remain as holding
companies participating in the equity of successor companies with most of
their net worth. The ALPA mill and the land necessary for operation which
will remain with the holding companies will be leased to the successor
companies on conditions acceptable to the Bank. The Government and the



-7-
companies have agreed to complete the necessary legal steps for establishment
of such companies no later than February 28, 1981. The timetable and legal
instruments are given in Annex 2. Founder's Agreements providing for the
basic structure of the successor companies will be approved by the Bank before
their execution.
3.   Resource Base
2.16      In the absence of any forest resources in Egypt, the country's pulp
and paper industry depends on rice straw, waste paper and bagasse as its
principal domestic raw materials. These materials yield only shortfibered
pulps thus limiting the range and grades of papers that can be produced
entirely from local resources. However, by adding imported long-fibered pulp
to the paper furnish, the physical properties of the product can be improved
and the number of grades of paper which can be successfully produced can be
expanded substantially. Egyptian paper mills have in this way been able to
produce a relatively wide assortment of printing and writing papers, wrapping
papers and. board, and to substitute for imports of these grades. Although
newsprint and specialty papers as well as papers and board of high strength
characteristics are still outside current capabilities of the industry and
need to be imported, improved technologies now being developed for making
paper from bagasse may open new opportunities for Egypt's pulp and paper
industry in the future.
2.17      Depending on the availability of imported long-fibered pulp and the
product mix of the industry, the share of domestic fibers in Egypt's paper and
board production has been about 70% in recent years. With the introduction of
new technologies leading to an increase in the use of bagasse for grades of
paper which are now imported, this share may rise significantly during the
next decade.
2.18      Rice straw is the leading domestic fibrous material used in Egypt's
pulp and paper industry. Of the approximately 2 million tons of rice straw
(air dry) harvested annually in the Nile Delta, the mills have in recent
years used around 100,000 tpy for pulping (5%). Including other industrial
users (primarily the glass and ceramics industry where rice straw serves
as packaging material) approximately 200,000 tpy or 10% of total rice straw
output are currently required outside agriculture. The balance is used by
farmers for fuel and for fodder and bedding of animals. Of waste paper, the
pulp and paper industry uses in total about 70-90,000 tons annually. These
quantities indicate that around 30% of the country's present paper supply is
actually being recycled. This is high by international standards and can
probably not significantly be expanded. Bagasse is still a largely untapped
fibre for paper-making in Egypt. The country's bagasse output reached
860,000 dry tons in 1978 and is expected to rise to 1.4 million dry tons in
1983. Presently only about 30,000 tpy (3%) is being pulped while an additional
35,000 tpy is used in the manufacture of particle board. The rest is used by
the sugar mills as fuel. In order to release greater quantities of bagasse
for the pulp and paper industry, alternative sources of fuel (most logically
oil) would have to be found for the sugar industry. However, this procedure
is common practice in many countries and even at prevailing international
oil prices, bagasse can be a competitively priced fiber for the manufacture
of pulp and paper.
4.   Future Development Strategy for the Industry
2.19      The nationwide pulp and paper study, referred to in para 1.03,
defined in broad terms a logical path for the modernization and future



- 8 -
development of the industry. It identified a number of priority projects for
immediate consideration, including those now proposed for NATIONAL and RAKTA,
and it reviewed the long-term opportunities for developing the pulp and paper
sector in the light of projected markets and available domestic fibrous raw
materials.
2.20      The current development phase of the industry is essentially one
of rehabilitating and expanding existing mills and of phasing out old un-
economical plant equipment. Relevant programs at NATIONAL and RAKTA are
supported by the proposed Project, whereas the SIMO mill is currently setting
up a new board machine intended to replace its old paper mill which is nearing
the end of its useful economic life. After completion of the ongoing and
planned rehabilitation and expansion programs of the public sector mills,
expected by 1984, there will be a need to review and rationalize the converting
industry, the primary consumers of paper and board, and for setting up new pro-
duction capacities, particularly for printing and writing papers. The main raw
material bases for this additional production would be rice straw and bagasse.
2.21      Rice straw has been the main factor in the profitable operation of
the RAKTA mill, and will continue to be attractive in comparison to imported
short-fibered raw materials even with moderate price increases which may be
necessary to obtain larger volumes. In the eastern part of the Nile Delta,
supplies of rice straw are as yet largely untapped and could be drawn upon by
a future mill which, to minimize transportation costs, would have to be set
up in this region, possibly at Ismailia, where water supplies are adequate
for such an operation. Bagasse is the other major possible base for new pulp
and paper projects in the longer run. Under preliminary consideration are a
bagasse pulp and paper mill in Upper Egypt and a bagasse-based newsprint mill,
both of which were identified in the nationwide study. To assist in the
further investigation of specific project opportunities in these areas, the
proposed Project will contain a component to carry out some of the necessary
studies (para 5.12).
III. THE SPONSORS
A.   National Paper Company - NATIONAL
1. Ownership
3.01      As noted in para 2.09, NATIONAL was established as a private
sector company in 1940, but was nationalized in 1961. Its equity capital
of LE 6.9 million is fully paid in and held by the Government. The company's
headquarters and main and original mill are located at Tabia, some 30 kilo-
meters east of Alexandria. The Alexandria Paper Company (ALPA), also
nationalized in 1961, was merged with NATIONAL in 1971 providing the company
with additional production facilities in the industrial zone of the City of
Alexandria. The ALPA mill, currently also called Moharrem Paper Mill, is
Egypt's oldest mechanical paper mill and probably the first of its kind
established in the entire Middle East.
2. Management and Employment
3.02      NATIONAL employs a total labor force of some 2,500 of which about
730 are with the ALPA mill. The company is directed by a Chairman and an
eight-member Board of Directors; the Chairman reports to the Minister of
Industry. Four of the Board members and the Chairman, are government
aDDointees for indefinite terms, the remaining four are elected from within



the company's staff for two-year terms. At least two of the elected Board
members are normally workers' representatives. Mr. Abu Sekina, a former
Technical Director of RAKTA, became Chairman of the Board of NATIONAL in
December 1975.   Mr. Sekina, who had been ill for about a year, died in
February, 1980. Mr. El Ebiary, RAKTA's Chairman, has been appointed Acting
Chairman until a suitable replacement is found. Mr. El Ebiary has bee" an
effective and dynamic manager and one who is fully familiar with NATIONAL,
having served on previous occasions as Acting Chairman. Since he is also
conversant with, and sympathetic to, the transfer of the two companies, his
choice is thus appropriate until NATIONAL's transfer under Law 43 will enable
a qualified Chairman to be selected. The Chairman of NATIONAL had been
assisted by the General Mill Manager, the Chief Engineer and the Financial
and Commercial Managers (the four appointed Board members) and six other top
management and legal staff, including the Production Manager of the ALPA mill.
In effectively carrying out its management functions, NATIONAL's directorate
has in recent years been faced with increasing difficulties of attracting and
retaining qualified management and supervisory staff. Top level personnel
have left the mill to take up more lucrative positions elsewhere in Egypt and
abroad, and arising vacancies have had to be filled with less qualified staff
drawn from within the mill or left open. As a result, the overall management
at NATIONAL has been weakened to a critical point. The technical assistance
component of the project and specific provisions for project implementation
have been designed to address these problems (para 5.07). NATIONAL's organiza-
tional structure is shown in Annex 3-1.
3.03      The Government's influence on the company's financial and investment
planning is strong and exercised through the annual programming and budget
approval process and the guidelines ruling the allocation of net profits.
However, there is virtually no interference in day-to-day operational matters
and somewhat more freedom than in the past is being given, in the allocation
of material and financial incentives to workers within the established limits,
and in the setting of paper and board prices. Since the company produces
mainly low grade papers with limited market acceptance, this latter freedom
involves, however, only very limited flexibilities in product pricing.
3. Plant Facilities and Past Production
3.04     The following table gives NATIONAL's production during the period
1975-79 for each of its two mills, Tabia and ALPA:

- 10 -
3.05      The Tabia mill of NATIONAL has an old rice straw pulp mill, commis-
sioned in 1940, and several waste paper pulping systems of more recent origin,
which, however, do not operate very efficiently because of the low-grade
waste paper available in Egypt. During 1976-78, rice straw and waste paper
provided an average of 62% of the paper furnish used in the mill 1/, while
34% was imported pulp and less than 4% bagasse pulp from the pulp mill owned
by Societe des Sucreries et de Distillerie d'Egypte at Edfu. 2/ The relatively
large proportion of imported pulp used at Tabia is a result of the mill's con-
centration on industrial papers and boards, which require high admixtures of
long-fibered pulp to achieve desirable strength characteristics of the products.
3.06      The six paper machines at NATIONAL's Tabia mill include three (PM's
1-3) which are old (installed in the 1940's), narrow and in part rebuilt. The
other three (PM's 4-6) are relatively new machines and should be capable of
producing quality papers. PM 6 has been commissioned only recently; the
machine was until 1967 installed at a now defunct paper mill in Suez. The
mill produces a wide range of types and grades of papers and boards, involving
no less than nine lines of stDck preparation. Due to frequent grade changes,
high broke and trim losses, and the technical problems associated with operat-
ing the older machines, machine efficiencies are low. Additional operational
problems are caused by the poor plant layout and generally poor housekeeping.
3.07      Since 1973, there has been a steady decline of production in the
Tabia mill, notably in the papers produced on the newer paper machines, which
comprise mainly kraft wrapping papers, manifold and printing papers. This has
been mainly due to competition from imported paper which is often of better
quality and comparable cost. As a result, the financial situation of NATIONAL
has deteriorated in recent years, as discussed in greater detail in paras
3.17-19 below.
3.08      The situation at NATIONAL's ALPA mill is different.  This mill has
three very old paper machines, bought second-hand and installed in 1902, 1922
and 1935, respectively, that use mainly waste paper pulp. Only low grade,
coarse wrapping papers and board can be produced which have their established
markets and little competition from imports. As a result of this, the mill
output has declined to a lesser extent than at the Tabia mill and is still
reasonably close to the technically feasible capacity permitted by the aging
paper machines. Several price increases of ALPA products have maintained
the marginal profitability of operations at this mill. Despite this and the
obviously good craftmanship employed in keeping the equipment in running
conditions, the useful life oi- this mill is limited and alternative uses of
the mill site will eventually have to be considered.
B.   General Company for Paper Industries - RAKTA
1. Ownership
3.09      RAKTA was established in 1958 and its headquarters and mill are
located at Tabia, almost adjacent to the corporate site of NATIONAL. Since
1960, the Government has held a controlling majority of the LE 6.0 million
1/   Rice straw fibers (3%), waste paper (59%).
2/   NATIONAL and RAKTA between them consume all of the bagasse pulp produced
at Edfu. Most of it goes to RAKTA.



- 11 -
share capital. At present, the Government holds 64%, other public sector
organizations, notably insurance companies, hold about 20% of the share
capital, while the remainder (about 16%) is owned by some 12,000 private
Egyptian shareholders.
2. Management and Employment
3.10      RAKTA's Board of Directors, like that of NATIONAL, consists of a
Chairman and eight other members. The Chairman and three of the Board members
are appointed by the Government for indefinite periods, four are elected by
the mill's staff for two-year terms, and one is elected by the private share-
holders, also for a two-year term. Mr. El Ebiary, a former Chief Engineer at
RAKTA, was appointed Chairman in December 1975. The organizational structure
of RAKTA is shown in Annex 3-2.  RAKTA is operated by a total staff of about
2,400, of which about 200 are graduate technicians and other professional
employees, 800 skilled workers, and about 1,400 unskilled and semi-skilled
workers. At RAKTA, the drain on qualified managerial and technical staff has
not been as serious as for NATIONAL (para 3.02), because much of its effect
has been mitigated thus far by this company's comparatively stronger management
team.
3.11      Although a part of RAKTA's shareholding is in private hands, the
relations between the Government and the company adhere to the same pattern
as described for NATIONAL (para 3.03 above). However, there is one important
difference in that as an indirect subsidy to education, the Government until
recently subsidized RAKTA's prices for printing and writing papers used for
school note books (over 20% of total 1979 mill output). This practice has
now been discontinued but RAKTA's prices for printing and writing grades are
still closely controlled and are kept at a low level which, with the rising
costs of inputs, is affecting the company's profitability. However, the
Government has confirmed that it is the Government's policy not to interfere
in the companies' ability to determine their product mix and set their prices
after the establishment of the successor companies under Law 43, and agreement
was reached with the Government and the companies that the companies shall
determine their product mix and prices on a competitive basis with due regard
to market conditions (para 7.03).
3. Plant Facilities and Past Production
3.12     The following table gives RAKTA's production during the period
1975-79:
RAKTA - Production by Major Grade Group
(thousand tons)
1975     1976     1977      1978      1979
Paper                      38.6      37.2     40.5      41.7     38.8
Board                      14.3      12.6     11.8      11.5     12.8

- 12 -
3.13      RAKTA's pulping facilities consists of a 70 tons per day (tpd) rice
straw pulp mill and a waste paper pulp line. There is also a bleach plant for
bleaching the straw pulp produced together with the bagasse pulp purchased
from Edfu. Both the pulping and bleaching facilities are operating below
capacity on account of techni.cal problems, principally due to the absence of
a reliable supply of chlorine from the Misr Chemical Company in Alexandria.
Chlorine shortages mean that the pulp is improperly bleached and of poor
quality. In an effort to compensate for this, RAKTA has been tending to
overcook the pulp which in ttLrn has led to capacity problems due to poor
pulp drainage as well as to excessive consumption of other chemicals. RAKTA
is currently expanding its straw pulp capacity which would allow bleached
straw pulp production to rise to about 150 tpd by early 1981, but this
expansion will be of limited value unless supplies of bleaching chemicals
can be assured; this deficiency will be corrected by the project.
3.14      The bleached rice straw/bagasse pulp mixtures, with imported
bleached wood pulp, supply the furnish for RAKTA's main production lines
of printing and writing papers; waste paper pulp is used only for the
production of duplex board. There are three paper machines (PM's 1-3) for
the manufacture of printing and writing papers, which together account for
about three-quarters of the mill's total output. These three machines are
of good width and are relatively modern. Two of them (PM's 1-2) were
modified in 1976 to utilize t:heir full potential. Through improvements
to PM 3, which currently has some mechanical problems, capacity could be
further increased. Also the board machine (PM 4) requires modifications
to make the quality of the produced duplex board competitive with imports.
3.15      Machine efficiencies at RAKTA are significantly higher than those
at NATIONAL. This is largely attributable to the fact that RAKTA's product
range is small and machine st:oppages for grade changes are consequently less
frequent. Also, general housekeeping is better at RAKTA. As noted, however,
there are major difficulties in attaining regular production because of
erratic supplies of chlorine.. In addition to capacity reduction and off-grade
production, this problem contributes to a high consumption of imported pulp
and, on occasions, to the cormplete shut-down of production lines.
3.16      As shown in the above table (para 3.12), mill output at RAKTA has
shown virtually no growth during 1973-79.   For 1979, production decreased
by 3% from the previous year, due mainly to the above mentioned shortage of
chlorine supplies, and to the difficulty of marketing board of poor quality.
C.   Financial Condition of i:he Companies
3.17      As has been shown, the volume of production and sales at NATIONAL
have declined over the past several years due to loss of markets to competing
imports while those at RAKTA have been more or less constant. With the
rising costs of all factors of production, profitability ratios have declined
for both companies. Income Statements, Balance Sheets and key financial
indicators for both companies for the period 1975-79 are contained in Annexes
3-3 and 3-4 and summarized in the following table.

a/  Audited data for 1975-78, unaudited data for 1979.
3.18      NATIONAL's gross profit margins deteriorated until 1978.  The
recovery in 1979 was mainly due to considerable product price increases and
utilization of low priced stockpiles of imported pulp. The improvement in
results is thus considered only temporary. With current prices for imported
pulp, it is estimated that the company would have had a loss of LE 0.5 million
in 1979. The basic problem is that the company is relying on high quality
(and high cost) imported pulp for a significant proportion of its output, but
with the present state of its equipment and with inadequate quality control,
it is unable to produce paper of a high enough quality to attract a major
share of the domestic market for these grades even at prices competitive with
imports. The proposed project would address these problems by expanding
production, improving quality (and thus product marketability) and reducing
unit operating costs to the point where the company should be reasonably
profitable.



- 14 -
3.19      Another noteworthy factor in NATIONAL's recent financial history is
the sharp increase in curreni: assets following a major pulp purchase in 1976.
This purchase was financed through a bank overdraft resulting in a correspond-
ing increase in current liabilities, and is also evident in the exceptionally
high inventory of raw material (13.4 months) at the end of 1976. Since then,
the company has wor'-ed its inventory down (together with the overdraft) to
normal levels. Other points of interest are (i) the long period of accounts
receivable (average 3.2 months, compared to RAKTA's 1.9 months) which is
primarily a reflection of marketing difficulties and the kind of terms
NATIONAL has to offer in order to market its products; and (ii) the absence
of any contractual long-term debt in the company's financial structure.
However, this is somewhat misleading in that NATIONAL's overdraft, which it
rolls over from year to year, is a consistent feature of its financial
structure.
3.20      RAKTA's financial situation until recently was more stable, primarily
because the company has had no serious marketing difficulties and its principal
raw material is rice straw, available at substantially lower cost than
imported pulp. Another significant factor is the Government subsidy granted
to RAKTA to compensate for the losses in revenue as a result of the fixed
price for much of its paper destined for educational purposes. This subsidy
was approximately LE 1.4 million in 1977 and LE 1.7 million in 1978. As
noted in para 3.11, the subsidy was discontinued at the end of 1978, and, as
a result, the company's net income was almost halved in 1979. An increase
in paper prices will be necessary if the company is to continue to maintain
reasonable financial health.
3.21      As in the case of NATIONAL, RAKrA also made a major pulp purchase
in 1976 and also financed it primarily by bank overdrafts, leading to similar
increases in current assets, current liabilities and raw material inventories.
Although this inventory has been worked down, current liabilities (and par-
ticularly the company's bank overdraft) have not decreased. This situation
has arisen because RAKTA is currently implementing a LE 12 million project
to expand its rice straw pulping capacity which it has financed through
suppliers' credits of LE 7 million, together with self-generated funds and
local bank overdrafts. The project will be completed late 1980 (about two
years behind schedule) but has left the company in an even tighter liquidity
position than NATIONAL.
D.   Future of the Companies Without the Project
3.22      If the projects were not to proceed at the present time as envis-
aged, the companies would probably attempt to implement some of the project
components in a piecemeal fashion over an extended period, as funds become
available. In the case of NATIONAL, the future is not promising. If steps
are not taken to rehabilitate the company, rationalize the product mix,
improve product quality and regain lost markets, further serious deterioration
is inevitable and would necessitate direct Government assistance to prevent
bankruptcy.

3.23        In the case of RAKTA, the company's immediate financial problems
would largely be overcome if its request for a price increase for printing
and writing paper (para. 3.11) is granted, although it would still require
short-term financial support to meet its immediate debt-service obligations.
Subsequently, when the pulp mill addition (para. 3.21) comes on stream in
1981, the company would use more rice straw and rely to a lesser extent on
imported pulp, with a markedly positive effect on profitability. Thus,
while the proposed project would increase production, improve quality and
reduce costs, even without it the company would continue to be a viable
commercial enterprise.

P - Domestic production; Im - Imports; C - Apparent consumption
I/ Exports of paper and board have been negligible
4.02        After considerable grovwth during most of the 1960's and early
1970's, domestic production of paper and paper board has declined over the
past several years owing to the problems referred to earlier in this report
(Chapters II and III). Between 1973 and 1979 total mill output fell from over
140,000 tons to less than 120,000 tons. As a result of this and the prevail-
ing high levels of paper imports following import liberalization, Egypt's
paper industry has seen its contribution to the country's paper supply de-
cline from 70% in 1973 to around 40% in recent years. Meanwhile, liberalized
paper imports have permitted total apparent paper consumption to grow sharply,



- 16 -
from 234,000 tons or 6.4 kg per capita in 1974 to a peak of over 340,000 tons
or 9.1 kg per capita in 1976.. However, this involved the building up of
inventories as the 1976 leve:L of imports exceeded current requirements by a
substantial margin with several major consumers of Industrial paper grades,
notably the Egyptian cement industry, importing quantities far in excess of
their annual needs.  As a result, imports and overall apparent consum,tion
of paper and paperboard in 1977 and 1978 remained below the level reached in
1976.
4.03      At current levels of consumption, Egypt appears to consume
substantially more paper per capita than would normally be expected of a
country of comparable per capita income and literacy levels (Annex 4-2).
However, this is misleading because: (i) Egypt, as against other countries,
produces paper grades that are in many instances substantially heavier than
normal paper weights to compensate for poor and variable quality; (ii) a
significant proportion of domestic mill output (up to 30% in the case of
wrapping papers and common board) is lost and returned by the converting
companies as waste paper due to the exceedingly high cutting and trimming
losses and product irregularities; and (iii) additional losses occur due to
inadequate warehousing facildities and damage from improper manual handling
of paper affecting both domestically produced and imported supplies. It is
evident that to a large extent these quality-related factors, which affect in
particular industrial grades,, contribute to inflate apparent consumption data
in Egypt, possibly by as much as 20%. To address the problem of warehousing
and paper handling, the proposed Project will also contain a component to
carry out a relevant study in the context of the proposed review of the
Egyptian converting industry (para 5.12).
4.04      The principal features of paper consumption by grades, origin
(domestic or imported) and main users during 1975-78 are reflected in
Annex 4-3. The following paragraphs provide some detail.
1. Printing and Writing Paper
4.05      Total apparent consumption of printing and writing paper has
doubled since 1973, reaching an annual volume of over 100,000 tons in 1977
and 1978. Since the domestic production of these papers, which is primarily
from RAKTA, has been stagnating at about 40,000 tpy during that period, this
consumption growth was essentially the result of higher imports. Import
demand has been particularly stimulated by the shift of many domestic printers
and publishers to high efficiency equipment, such as offset and webletter
presses, which require paper qualities that are beyond the production capabi-
lities of the domestic mills. There has also been an increasing demand for
coated papers which could not be met by local manufacturers. Unevenness,
insufficient whiteness due tc the shortage of bleaching agents (para 3.15)
and other quality deficiencies of locally produced printing and writing paper
have been additional factors in increasing import demand. The proposed
Project will help to overcome: these deficiencies.
4.06      Close to 60,000 tpy or about 60% of the printing and writing paper
supplies are used by governmental printers, publishers and stationers;
the remainder is distributed among public sector industrial enterprises



- 17 -
(about 20%), which use them in part for wrappings, and the fast growing
private printing and stationery industry (also about 20%). The largest
single consumer of printing and writing paper in Egypt is the Central Book
Organization (Central Agency for University and School Books and Educational
Aids). In 1978 this agency currently consumed about 27,000 tons of these
grades to produce some 90 million books, obtaining about 60% domestically,
virtually all from RAKTA and importing the rest. The Egyptian Company for
Paper and Stationery, another public sector agency, uses currently some
17,000 tons of printing and writing paper annually, of which about 11,000
tons (65%) are supplied by RAKTA for school notebooks and the remainder
imported, predominantly used for conversion into stationery. The third-
largest consumer of printing and writing paper, Ameria Press 1/, has an
annual consumption of close to 14,000 tons, mostly for school books. Employ-
ing modern presses, it is now largely dependent on imported papers. RAKTA's
sales of printing and writing paper to Ameria Press were only 3,700 tons in
1978, as compared to almost 10,000 tons in 1976.
2. Industrial Grades of Paper and Board
4.07      The apparent consumption of industrial grades of paper and board
increased from about 130,000 tons in 1973 to an average of over 170,000
tons a year during 1975-77. This growth reflects the considerable recent
market penetration of imported paper grades of higher quality against which
domestic mills found it hard to compete despite the comparatively higher
price levels of such imports. Production from domestic mills, consisting
largely of common and duplex board and wrapping papers, actually declined from
about 100,000 tons in 1973 (i.e. prior to the import liberalization) to about
70,000 tons in 1978. Production declines were most pronounced in wrapping
papers and common board produced at NATIONAL. In very low grade wrappers and
board, for which there has been no competition from imports, and duplex board
produced at RAKTA, output levels remained essentially unchanged. Changing
technological needs of the major consumers of industrial grades, notably
converters and manufacturing industry, as a result of the use of new machinery
and equipment, explain to a larger part the recent increases in import reliance.
Moreover, a number of previously important users of domestic industrial papers
have shifted to substitute packaging materials such as plastics and foils.
4.08      The main Egyptian consumers of industrial grades of paper and
board are the public sector converting companies, which during 1975-77
required close to 80,000 tons annually (47% of total apparent consumption
of industrial grades) for the manufacture of boxes and other packaging mate-
rials as well as for textile cones. Most of their requirements were met
by imports of kraft paper, kraft liner and fluting and consequently their
use of domestically produced common and duplex board has declined sharply as
a result of plant modernization. Other public sector industries required
during 1975-77 on average some 60,000 tpy (35%) in industrial paper grades.
Common wrappers and board were purchased predominantly from domestic paper
mills but kraft papers, chromo papers and other high quality packaging
1/   General Organization for Government Printing.



- 18 -
grades were mostly imported. The cement industry is the most important
single user in this group, with sack kraft requirements of some 16,000 tons
a year in the recent past. I'he remaining share of consumption of industrial
grades, some 30,000 tons a year during 1975-77, is held by the large number
of small private industrial aLnd trading firms, which still rely mainly on
domestic supplies of relatively low grade wrappers and board.
3. Newsprint
4.09        Egypt imports all cf its newsprint.   Imports increased from an
average annual level of 40,OCO tons prior to 1976 to over 60,000 tons
during 1976-78, reflecting bcth the higher newsprint consumption of the
large public sector publishers but also some replenishment of stocks.

a/ With the propos2d Project which ia assumed to stare operating fromn mid-1983
arnd reach full production in 1985. It has further beer. assumed that ALPA
and the old SIMO mill will have been shut down by the end of 1983. Pro&ected
domestic production also refleczs anticipated outputs from SIMO's new board
machine.
1.   Supply
4.11       The above production forecasts are based on the successful imple-
mentation of the proposed Project which would increase paper output at RAKTA
from currently about 52,000 tpy to 95,000 tpy by 1985 and at NATIONAL from
about 33,000 tpy to about 77,000 tpy, also by 1985. Outputs at SIMO is
expected to increase temporarily to 24,000 tpy by 1983 as its new board
machine will come on stream. However, by the end of 1983 the old SIMO mill



- 19 -
is exected to be shut down, reducing SIMO's output to a level of about 12,000
tpy thereafter. Private sector companies are assumed to maintain their current
production levels.
4.12      On the basis of the above assumptions, projected domestic production
will remain inadequ-te to meet expected domestic demand. After reaching the
anticipated, sustained production levels at NATIONAL, RAKTA and SIMO in 1985,
domestic paper production will still cover only approximately 44% of total
demand, with self-sufficiency in printing and writing paper reaching a sig-
nificantly higher level (68%) than in industrial paper grades (32%). No
domestic production of newsprint is anticipated during the period under
review. Egypt will thus remain a significant importer of paper, and paper
exports are unlikely.
4.13      In printing and writing paper, there would appear to be no tech-
nological or fiber constraints to add economical capacity by the mid-1980's
to help meet the growing demand and to maintain a reasonably high level of
self-sufficiency. In industrial paper grades, the degree of self-sufficiency
that can be achieved is much more limited. Bank projections actually imply
a decline in self-sufficiency as compared to present levels. This will
increasingly require high strength products which could not be produced using
local short fibered raw materials. Bagasse admixtures to imported long-
fibered pulps could, in theory, give domestic paper mills an opportunity to
share in this rapidly expanding market; in practice, however, there are no
firm plans for expanding bagasse pulp production capacity and available
bagasse pulp supplies will not be sufficient to allow a move in this direction
before the mid 1980's.
2.   Demand
4.14      Due to the erratic pattern of past paper consumption in Egypt, it
is not possible to establish historic trend characteristics that could serve
to project future demand. Demand projections have, therefore, been made
using: (i) the results of a cross-section analysis for selected groups of
countries, classified by per capita income levels, for which long-term income
elasticity patterns of demand (covering the period 1961-76) were determined;l/
and (ii) an analysis of end-use factors which is to give some greater reliabi-
lity to the projections by major paper grades in the medium run. The latter
is based on information obtained from converting companies and other major
user groups in Egypt and has been found to be quite consistent with the demand
projections derived from income elasticity parameters.
4.15      As a base for estimating future paper demand, the average annual
consumption level of 1975-78 has been chosen. During this period, overall
paper consumption had become more stabilized, as a result of import liberali-
zation, and may be considered to be representative for demand projections.
Moreover, averaging over this period has the effect of reducing the impact
of fluctuations in apparent demand of major paper grades caused by changes
in inventories.
1/   Background Papers and Tables on Markets, April 1979 (Project File
ref. C4).



- 20 -
4.16      Demand projections are based on an assumed real average annual
growth of the economy of 6.5% during 1977-85 (Bank projection), a population
growth rate of 2.3% per year and a resulting real per capita income growth
of 4.1% per year during this period. The implied income elasticity of demand
for all paper grades combined is about 1.3 for the period 1977-85 and is
the result of the projections made for major paper grades. This rate is in
line with the demand pattern observed in other developing countries of com-
parable income and literacy levels. The assumptions also take into account
that after 1981, quality improvements at the major paper mills will allow
some reduction in paper weights and in processing losses as a result of which
actual consumption will be smaller by volume than would be the case if the
present output quality and mix were maintained. The assumptions made in this
context are considered realistic.
4.17      On the basis of the assumptions made, total paper demand in Egypt
(as shown in the table in para 4.10) can be expected to rise from an average
of 310,000 tpy in 1975-78, to about 350,000 tons in 1980 and about 450,000
tons in 1985, in which year paper consumption per capita would be about 10 kg
as against approximately 7 kig at present. This per capita consumption level,
as well as that for major paper grades, is approximately in line with other
developing countries at similar income levels. The following paragraphs
discuss briefly the underlying demand projections for the three major groups
of paper: printing and writing paper; industrial grades; and newsprint.
4.18      For printing and writing paper, demand projections assume an income
elasticity of 1.5, which takes into account the still comparatively low adult
literacy rate of Egypt (about: 40%) and a historic role of the country as a
cultural and educational center of the Arabic World. Total demand of printing
and writing paper is expected to increase from almost 110,000 tons in 1980 to
144,000 tons in 1985. These projections are consistent with the results of
the more detailed analysis of' end-use factors, as derived from user company
information. Despite the increasing supply of printing and writing paper as
a result of the Project, the above demand projections imply continued import
dependence. After completion of the Project, import requirements are expected
to rise again, reaching about 46,000 tons by 1985, and rising to about over
80,000 tons by the end of the decade, indicating the need to prepare for
additional production capacities in Egypt by not later than the mid-1980's.
4.19      For industrial paper and board, the implied income elasticity of
demand is about 1.5 for the period 1977-85; this assumes a reduction of
average paper weights and processing wastes after 1982, primarily as a result
of the planned mill modernizations supported by the proposed Project. The
projected demand for industrial paper grades is expected to reach about
180,000 tons in 1980 and 240,000 tons by 1985. Demand would thus grow faster
than projected increases in domestic mill output, involving a growing supply
deficit to be met by imports. Import needs, comprising mainly kraft papers
but also quality wrapping papers and board, are expected to increase to almost
140,000 tons by 1985. In couLmon board and duplex and standard wrapping
papers, domestic mills can be expected to cover most of the domestic demand.
In sack kraft, domestic supplies (from NATIONAL) may meet up to 40% of total



- 21 -
requirements 1/ in 1985 provided satisfactory quality standards are estab-
lished and maintained. However, for industrial paper grades, in particular,
active marketing policies and plans will be imperative if the domestic mills
are to maintain and increase their market shares in the light of changing
consumer requirements (para 4.25).
4.20      Newsprint demand is projected to increase from currently (1979)
about 60,000 tons to about 75,000 tons by 1985, all of which will continue
to be met by imports. The implied income elasticity of demand is 0.8 for
the period under review and is larger than comparable rates observed in
other countries. This is justified by the comparatively high degree of
urbanization in Egypt and the anticipated progress made in improving the
literacy of the population.
3. Demand Prospects for NATIONAL's and RAKTA's Output
4.21      For the major paper grades produced by NATIONAL and RAKTA, the
market prospects have also been assessed by end-use analyses covering the
next 3-4 years. In printing and writing paper it was found for a sample
group of seven major users (representing almost 70% of total apparent domestic
consumption) that their requirements were expected to increase from currently
about 65,000 tons (1978) to about 87,000 tons in 1982. Total anticipated
demand for printing and writing papers should exceed 140,000 tons in 1985
whereas anticipated output from RAKTA and NATIONAL will total only 98,000
tons; marketing such quantities should, consequently, not be difficult. In
duplex board, market requirements of existing users are expected to grow only
slowly, from about 23,000 tons in 1978 to probably no more than 29,000 tons in
1985. The main reason for this is substitution of duplex by other packaging
materials. The tobacco companies, for example, which account for well over
40% of total duplex consumption are gradually shifting to soft packs for cig-
arettes. RAKTA's anticipated duplex output at full production would be 20,000
tons, well within the expected market potential. Actually, the market poten-
tial for duplex may be increased through active marketing support and the fact
that RAKTA will be in a position to offer coated duplex board which to-date
has to be imported. In common board and other packaging grades, produced on
PM's 1-4 of NATIONAL, the anticipated market growth is in the order of 3-4%
per year which should provide NATIONAL with adequate scope for increasing its
sales volume in these grades and to regain outlets lost. However, due to the
effects of substitution and the existence of a large number of relatively
small consumers, both existing and potential ones, active marketing policies
and consumer relations need to be developed by NATIONAL to utilize this
potential.
C.   Prices
4.22      With the exception of printing and writing papers for educational
purposes, the prices of which are currently controlled by the Government,
paper prices in Egypt are determined by market forces and have closely followed
1/   The anticipated requirements of the cement industry alone could be as
much as 56,000 tons in 1985 although a shift to some bulk handling may
reduce this requirement to some extent.

the rising international price trend of the recent past. The following table
shows current paper prices for selected paper grades of domestic and foreign
origin, which suggest a reasonable alignment between domestic ex-factory
prices and landed costs of imports for most internationally traded grades. In
a number of paper grades, however, a premium is paid for the generally higher
quality of imported paper. Details of current ex-factory prices of the public
sector mills are shown in Annex 4-5.

4.23      Customs duties on imported paper range from 5% for printing and
writing paper to 30% for board and packaging grades in grammages of less than
200 g/sqm. Including the consolidation, statistical and other duties payable,
total duty charges are between 12% and 43% of the C & F value of imported
papers, thus providing some moderate protection to local mills, particularly
to those producing lighter industrial grades. Newsprint and sack kraft
(including bags) for the cement industry are imported duty-free.

D.   Marketing and Distribution
4.24      As a result of years of selling in a protected and under-supplied
market, domestic paper mills in the past had little difficulty in selling
whatever they produced and no particular marketing skills needed to be devel-
oped. Paper consum'ers normally bought available quantities directly at the
mill site and mills were neither required to keep a transport fleet of their
own for deliveries nor to assume warehousing duties.
4.25      Although domestic mills have been exposed to rapidly changing
market conditions as a result of import liberalization, little has changed in
the way they market and distribute their products. Sales are made, as before,
directly to established customers and on the basis of frequently long-time
personal contacts, and little if any effort is made to regain customers that
shifted to imports, to actively seek new customers or, generally, to respond
to the changing technological needs of Egyptian paper consumers. Overcoming
these serious marketing deficiencies is crucial to the success of the proposed
Project, particularly in the case of NATIONAL where the 50 largest customers
account for less than two-thirds of total mill output. In the case of RAKTA,
fewer than ten major customers account for over 90% of production and the
marketing problems are not nearly so severe.
4.26      Under present circumstances, it is clear that an increased output
of better quality paper does not automatically find its market, but requires
active marketing support and for this reason, the technical assistance
package proposed for NATIONAL (para 5.07) includes the provision of technical
marketing expertise. The effort that is required would need to combine an
outgoing approach, notably close contacts to major existing and potential
customers and the provision--at least for a temporary period of time--of
customer incentives such as rebates, favorable payment terms and providing
warehousing facilities. Moreover, the mills need to establish specific
marketing plans against which performance can continuously be measured.
4.27      The prevailing sales terms of the domestic mills are cash before
delivery to all private sector customers. Public sector enterprises and
government agencies are expected to pay within 15 days after billing (at
the end of the month), but the due date may be extended by up to 60 days.
No quantity rebates have been offered for any domestic paper grades since
the beginning of 1979.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept
5.01      The Project consists of the provision of physical facilities and
technical assistance to two established pulp and paper companies to:
(i) Increase capacity by revamping existing machines, which
will improve the financial viability of the companies as
well as lessen the country's requirements for imported paper;



- 24 -
(ii) Improve product quality, which will enhance both the market-
ability and to some extent the price obtainable for domestic
paper and board grades facing competition from imports; and
(iii)  Reduce operating costs, through a technically-assisted pro-
gram of reducing raw-material consumption, minimizing waste
and improving operating efficiency through the introduction
of improved maintenance and operating practices.
5.02      The net effect of these improvements can be summarized in the
following table:

B. Project Description
5.03      The Project consists of two distinctly different components for
the NATIONAL and RAKTA companies, and a third component for studies to assist
the further rational development of the sector.
1.   NATIONAL
5.04      For NATIONAL, the project will:  (i) add a modern waste paper sorting
and treating facility of Tab:ia to improve the quality of the furnish to PM's
1-3 and to allow the admixture of some waste paper in the higher quality
grades now produced primarily from imported pulp on PM's 4-6; (ii) improve
PM's 4-6 (also at Tabia) together with their associated stock preparation
systems; (iii) add a 7-MW turbo-generator unit to utilize the high pressure
steam; and (iv) provide experienced maintenance, operating, training and
marketing personnel to ensure that the new, revamped and existing facilities
will be maintained and operaled in an appropriate fashion, and that the
improved products are effectiLvely introduced to the Egyptian market.



- 25 -
5.05      NATIONAL is the country's largest consumer of waste paper yet its
present facilities for handling and sorting this material, in order to obtain
the maximum benefits from its use, are totally inadequate. A waste paper
sorting and treating facility will not only enable a substantial improvement
in the marketable quantity of paper and board now produced on PM's 1-3
(from 13,000 to 20,000 tpy), but will also allow the admixture of selezted
waste paper to the primarily virgin pulp furnishes used on PM's 4-6. Moreover,
NATIONAL has a longer term plan to eventually shut down PM's 1-3 and replace
them with a single modern machine. The new waste paper facility provided
under this project is an essential part of the stock preparation system
for that machine.
5.06      PM's 4-6 at NATIONAL's Tabia mill are basically sound paper machines
requiring relatively minor additional investments to make them capable of pro-
ducing good quality paper and board which, from a technical point of view,
should be marketable at prices comparable to those of competing imports. The
specific modifications to be incorporated as part of the project are:
(i) For PM 4: Grinding of the cylinder dryer; reconditioning
the machine hood; reconditioning the cutter and winder;
rebuilding the stock preparation system, including pumps,
pulpers and refiners; and installing new vacuum pumps.
These modifications will allow a production increase
from about 5,000 to 9,000 tpy. Fiber furnish will be a
mixture of imported pulp, clean white waste paper for
bleached grades, and selected kraft waste for unbleached
grades.
(ii)  For PM 5:  Modification and simplification of the press section;
addition of a saveall for fiber recovery; improvements to
the stock preparation system, including installation of a
hardwood pulp line, addition of a stock proportioning system,
improvements to the cleaning system and fan pumps; addition
of a dry-end repulper; and reinstrumentation of the whole
machine. These modifications will allow the machine to
produce 23,000 tpy of good quality printing, writing and
other bleached grades (compared with about 8,000 tpy of
uneven quality at present). Fiber furnish will be a
mixture of imported pulp and clean white waste paper.
(iii)  For PM 6:  Installation of a pressure headbox; addition of
a saveall for fiber recovery; and improvements to the stock
preparation system, screens, steam and condensate system,
reel, winder and finishing equipment, and broke system.
These improvements will allow this machine to produce up
to 25,000 tpy of good quality sack and other kraft paper
compared with about 10,000 tpy of poor quality paper which
it is capable of producing at present. Furnish will be
primarily imported unbleached pulp together with selected
waste paper and bagasse pulp.



- 26 -
(iv) For Power: Installation of a 7-MW turbo-generator unit to
utilize the high pressure steam generated in the boilers.
This component will replace the existing 30-year-old 2-MW
turbo-generator, and add capacity to meet the increased
requirement for power.
5.07      The Technical Assistance proposed for NATIONAL is designed to pro-
vide the company with production and maintenance guidance, during and after
project implementation so that the proper expertise is developed within the
company.  In addition, expatriate marketing and technical sales assistance
will be provided to assist the company to become sensitized to the needs of
its customers and to take the necessary in-plant actions to ensure that it
is producing paper and board of a quality suited to their needs. This com-
ponent of the project will therefore provide an operations manager, a technical
supervisor, an electrical engineer, an instrumentation engineer, a mechanical
engineer, paper makers, stock preparation supervisors, a technical marketing
specialist and a training adviser, for periods of time varying from 6 months
to 2 years. The company and the Bank have agreed to the terms of reference
for these specialists. The company has also agreed to appoint these special-
ists no later than December 31, 1980, and has in February 1980 requested
proposals from competent operating companies.
2.   RAKTA
5.08      As previously noted, RAKTA's most serious difficulty in recent years
has been in obtaining an adequate allocation of chlorine in the face of break-
downs of chemical plant in Egypt and increasing competing needs for water
purification and for the textile industry. Thus, a major project component
insofar as the RAKTA mill is concerned will be the provision of an inplant
chloralkali plant to supply current and projected future requirements of this
chemical. In the absence of chlorine, unbleached pulp can be produced but
the number of paper grades where this quality pulp can be used is restricted
and production has to be curtailed. The current expansion program in the
pulp mill, which will double the production of rice straw pulp, will also
double the demand for chlorine and caustic soda. As new capacity will have
to be installed to meet this increased demand, RAKTA's proposal to add a
chloralkali plant at its millsite and thereby avoid production and delivery
problems which have seriously disrupted mill operations in the past, appears
to be reasonable. Total demand for chlorine in the expanded pulp mill will be
about 8 tons per day and the capacity of the proposed new chlor-alkali plant
will be sufficient to ensure that the company will no longer have to rely on
outside purchases of chlorine. The production of chlorine on such a scale is
economically viable. The company will continue to purchase calcium hypochlorite
from Misr Chemicals located to the west of Alexandria some 45 km from RAKTA.
This is a waste product of that chemical company and supply problems in the
past have been minimal.
5.09      The second project component of RAKTA will correct some deficiencies
in the original design of the board machine (PM 4) which has never produced a
high quality duplex board. As a result, converters have had to import board
in order to get the uniformity of quality necessary to operate their box-
making and other converting equipment. The revamping of PM 4, incorporated in



- 27 -
the project, will include the replacement of vats and formers, a rebuild of
the press section, and a restoration of the stock preparation system, including
an expansion of the cleaning system for the top liner. These changes will
also increase the production capacity of the machine from about 12,000 tpy to
about 20,000 tpy, but, more importantly, will raise the quality of the board
to that of competirg imports. The principal fiber furnish will be waste
paper although imported virgin pulp will continue to be used as a top-liner
on most grades. In addition to improvements to the board machine itself, the
project will provide for the installation of an off-machine coater so that a
portion of the board can be coated and thereby match the quality of competing
imports where this specification is required. The coater will also have the
facility to process a relatively small quantity of paper so that domestically-
produced coated paper will be available for the first time to the Egyptian
market.
5.10      As noted in para 3.14, PM's 1, 2 and 3 at RAKTA are all used for
the production of printing and writing paper. These three machines operate
quite well most of the time but do have difficulty in meeting quality specifi-
cations and have a tendency to suffer from high levels of fiber loss. The
project will therefore incorporate some improvements to the instrumentation,
the stock preparation systems and the fiber recovery systems for all these
machines and also, in the case of PM 3, provide for a major rebuild of the
machine drive to increase its effective production capacity from about 20,000
tpy to about 40,000 tpy.
5.11      As described above for NATIONAL (para 5.07), the RAKTA mill needs
and has agreed to seek technical assistance now, during and after implementa-
tion of the proposed project. For RAKTA, the project will provide a technical
supervisor, an electrical engineer, an instrumentation engineer, paper makers,
stock preparation supervisors and a training adviser for periods of time vary-
ings from 6 months to 2 years. RAKTA has agreed to the broad terms of reference
for these specialists, and that by October 31, 1980, it will prepare and submit
to the Bank, terms of reference and a specific program for the appointment of
these specialists and that by June 30, 1981, suitable specialists will be
appointed.
3.   Studies
5.12      As previously noted (paras 2.19-2.21), the proposed projects at
NATIONAL and RAKTA are part of a long-term program to rehabilitate and ex-
pand Egypt's pulp and paper sector. The outline for the program is contained
in the nationwide pulp and paper study (para 1.03) but additional specific
information is needed in order to formulate logical plans for the next steps
in the implementation of such a program. Specifically, the studies included
under the Project cover:
(i) Review the paper and board converting subsector with a
view to establishing the linkages between the primary
paper consumers and the paper production subsector, and
to identify possible projects or subprojects in the
converting industry; and



- 28 -
(ii) Conduct an in-depth evaluation of the fiber resources in
Egypt, their long-t:erm availability and cost, with a view
to determining the detailed priorities for further additions
to pulp, paper and board manufacturing capacity in the country.
5.13      The project cost estimate includes a sum of US$700,000 for these
studies which the Government will be asked to finance. Agreement has been
reached with GOFI that steps to implement them would be initiated immediately
following project approval by the Bank's Executive Directors. The Government
has agreed to the terms of reference and timetable for the studies, to provide
funds and facilities to carry them out, and to exchange views with the Bank on
their results and the actions deriving therefrom. Moreover in order not to
pre-empt the results of these studies, and to ensure that the raw material
supply and markets projected for the proposed expansion at NATIONAL and RAKTA
are preserved, the Government will consult with the Bank prior to initiating
or allowing any further major expansions in paper and board manufacturing
capacity until completion of the study.
C.   Availability of Raw Matesrials and Utilities
5.14      The principal raw materials required both now and following imple-
mentation of the Project are shown in the following table:
Annual Raw Material Requirements of NATIONAL and RAKTA
(tons)

b/ Purchased from the National Grid.
5.15      As noted in para 2.18, total rice straw production in the Nile
delta is currently of the order of 2 million tons and per year thus even the
projected requirements after project implementation represent less than 10%
of the available supply. RAKTA is currently implementing a program for the
major expansion of rice straw collection which will be required, including
the preparation of a large storage yard in the eastern Delta region. Bagasse
pulp is produced at Edfu in a mill owned by Societe des Sucreries et de
Distillerie d'Egypte and although the plant is designed to produce about
20,000 tpy, this capacity has never been achieved. A project to increase
bagasse pulp production (and also produce printing and writing paper) is
presently being studied by the sugar company with the support of USAID but
in the absence of any assured increase in supply, no major increase in the
availability of bagasse pulp has been assumed.   However, with any increased



- 29 -
supply of bagasse pulp beyond the 2,000 tpy assumed here, the economics of
processing bagasse at both NATIONAL and RAKTA would be considerably enhanced.
A modest increase in imported pulp will be required for the Project. High
quality waste paper will be imported by NATIONAL to replace virgin pulp to
some extent for PM 4, PM 5 and PM 6. A 50% increase in local waste paper
requirement is reasonable, since paper consumption in Egypt is projected to
increase by 40% by 1985, and some price increase for waste paper is being
seriously considered by the companies to satisfy their requirements of better
quality waste paper. As noted in para 5.05, the Project incorporates facili-
ties at NATIONAL (the major consumer of waste paper) to clean the waste prior
to delivery to the paper machines to ensure that the rather poor quality of
the raw material does not adversely affect finished paper quality.
5.16      Adequate fuel and power supplies are available to support the
proposed expansion although power supplies in the recent past have been the
subject of intermittent and aggravating outages. Two major new thermal
power stations in the Alexandria area which will burn natural gas from the
Abu Qir Bay resources together with the installation of 7-MW turbo-generator
for National should alleviate these problems.
D.   Environmental Impact
5.17      At the present time, both the NATIONAL and RAKTA mills are discharg-
ing untreated effluent into the Mediterranean Sea. The principal components
of this effluent are: (i) Fibers from the pulp mills and the paper and board
machines in both companies; and (ii) Dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals
from the NATIONAL pulp mill and from the RAKTA pulp mill and bleach plant.
5.18      By generally improving mill operations and stability, by taking
steps to recover usable fiber from the existing paper machines, and by improv-
ing stock preparation systems, the Project will reduce fiber losses from the
mills from their present high levels of approximately 10%, to about 5%,
considered normal for plants of this type; in this respect the Project has
a beneficial effect on the environment.
5.19      The major current pollution problem is however the result of the
discharges from the RAKTA pulp mill and bleach plant which are high in BOD,
color, and dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals. The effluents are
not toxic except insofar as the BOD component may deplete oxygen in the
vicinity of the effluent outfall, but they are unpleasant, unsightly and
occasionally odorous. In other types of pulp mills, the normal method for
minimizing pulping effluent discharges is to install a chemical recovery
system; to date, however, no system has been devised which is capable of
dealing effectively with the pulping liquors from rice straw which are very
high in silica. Other potential treatment possibilities include concentration
and incineration, utilization for irrigation, and secondary aeration before
discharge. All of these processes would be expensive and the benefits not
clearly identifiable.
5.20      Nevertheless, RAKTA has initiated a program of experimentation to
develop methods which are technically feasible and could be economically
viable and has negotiated with the Government of the Federal Republic of



- 30 -
Germany, for grant funds to carry out pilot-scale trials of a system which
would initially desilisize and subsequently incinerate the liquor to recover
chemicals. While these activities are still in a preliminary stage they may
eventually lead to full-scale implementation. RAKTA has agreed that it will
carry out these studies and keep the Bank fully informed on the progress of
these investigations. Moreover, both NATIONAL and RAKTA have agreed that
they will maintain and operate existing pollution control facilities, and
those to be provided under the Project, to minimize pollution to the maximum
extent possible under existing technology.
E.   Project Implementation and Management
5.21      As public sector companies, both NATIONAL and RAKTA are rather
restricted insofar as their ability to make investment decisions and enter
into contractual arrangements for the supply of services or equipment is
concerned. At the same time, technical expertise in the pulp and paper
industry which exists in the country is largely in the hands of the staff of
these two companies. For this reason, Project Implementation Units have been
established within each of the companies, each headed by a Project Manager
and, as further discussed below, these units will be responsible for day-to-
day implementation of the projects. In addition, the personnel provided under
the engineering and technical assistance components of the projects (paras
5.07 and 5.11) will be available to the Project Implementation Units to
provide additional advice and support as required.
5.22      The Project Implementation Units will receive direct technical
support from engineering consultants for the detailed design engineering and
construction supervision of the projects. To minimize any delays in project
implementation while the companies are taking the steps necessary to estab-
lish the successor companies under Law 43, the Bank has agreed to make a
total of up to US$1.6 million available from Imports Credit/Loan I and II
(Cr-524/Ln-1062, Ln-1456) to finance preliminary detailed engineering work
until the Bank loan becomes effective. Engineering consultants have already
been appointed and the contracts for their services were reviewed by the Bank
in February, 1980. The companies will continue to retain the engineering
consultants under the terms of their contract.
5.23      As previously noted (para 2.05), the responsibility for project
development within the Ministry of Industry rests with GOFI. GOFI is
concerned with all investments in public sector industrial companies over
LE 750,000 and also with all expenditures of Government funds in such enter-
prises. GOFI has approved the projects and now its concern is primarily with
the procurement aspects during project implementation 1/. It does have the
power to delegate the detailed aspects of procurement to the sponsoring
enterprise and its advisers, and to monitor procurement activities in a
manner similar to that adopted by the Bank. In the case of the proposed
Project, the Government has agreed that the companies will have exclusive
authority for the procurement of all goods and services and implementation
of the Project.
1/   GOFI's responsibilities will be terminated upon establishment of the
new companies under the provisions of Law 43.

the engineering service contracts (para 5.22) and is illustrated below in

F.  Employment and Training
5.24     As with many of the public sector companies in Egypt, both NATIONAL
and RAKTA have a substantially larger number of employees than are neces-
sary for efficient production, and company management is restricted in the
extent to which it can tailor its staffing to meet its needs. Bringing the
companies under Egyptian Law 43 (para 2.15) will provide management with
the flexibility to fully address the problem of over-staffing. The Project
also contains a number of specific elements which should lead to a gradual
improvement in manpower utilization. In particular:



- 32 -
(i) The technical assistance component of the Project includes
"Training and Manpower Advisers" for both NATIONAL and
RAKTA. It is enviSaged that an essential part of the terms of
reference for these positions will be to determine efficient
levels of manning, to identify positions where surplus manpower
can be used at least usefully if not efficiently, and to identify
any additional surplus manning over and above these levels. This
information will at: least enable the problem to be quantified;
(ii) The companies are already adopting a policy of staff reduction
through attrition whereby employees who leave or retire are
not replaced. This policy will continue, and will be able to
be more efficiently administered as a result of the informa-
tion to be gathered from the manpower inventory referred
to above; and
(iii)  Opportunities exisi: for a substantial increase in the useful
utilization of labor for waste paper sorting and upgrading.
The physical facil:Lties incorporated in the projects for both
mills include, as noted, an upgrading of the stock preparation
systems, including waste paper, and this is basically a manual
operation. Improved waste paper sorting would lead to improved
product quality anci a lessening of the requirements for imported
pulp.
5.26      In addition to quantifying and improving the efficiency of manpower
utilization, the Training ancd Manpower Advisers will each revitalize training
programs for operators and tradesmen which have been established in both the
NATIONAL and RAKTA mills but which are now more or less ignored. Training now
is entirely on-the-job and aLthough this will continue to be the principal
thrust of training in the future, some supplementary formal training will be
introduced to improve job uncderstanding and work satisfaction. Both NATIONAL
and RAKTA have agreed that by December 31, 1981, they will provide the Bank
with detailed reports of the Training and Manpower Advisers concerning present
staffing levels, their impact: on plant efficiency, and proposals for more
effective manpower utilization.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Costs
6.01      Estimates of capital costs of the Project have been prepared by the
consultants, reviewed by the project sponsors, and are believed by the Bank
to be realistic. Total financing required for the Project (excluding US$0.7
million equivalent for studies) is estimated at US$75.9 million of which
US$62.0 million (or 82%) is foreign exchange. Details of the capital cost
estimate are given in Annex 6-1 and are summarized below:

6.02      Equipment cost estimates for major items are based on quotations
received from equipment suppliers. Freight costs to the site have been
estimated on the basis of current experience. Civil works costs, which are
minor in this Project as most equipment will be installed in existing build-
ings, have been estimated on the basis of building sizes and quantities



- 34 -
determined by the consultants, and current costs for similar types of con-
struction in Egypt. No allowance for import duties has been included, as
all of the machinery and equipment to be purchased will be imported by the
successor companies under the provisions of Law 43, which provides for duty
exemption. Physical contingencies of 7% on equipment and 10% on all other
cost estimates have been added. Price escalation on local costs has been
computed at 18% for 1980, 15% for 1981, and 12% for 1982. Price escalation on
foreign costs, which would mostly be for imported equipment, has been computed
at 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981 and 8% for 1982. Total price contingencies
thus represent 14.2% of the base cost estimates plus physical contingencies
which is considered reasonable in view of the relatively short period of
project implementation. The Technical Assistance for NATIONAL and RAKTA is
estimated at about 26 and 18 expatriate man-years respectively as presented
in Annex 6-2. The average cost is estimated at about US$100,000 per man-year
including expenditures for international travel, subsistence as well as local
transportation and miscellaneous items.
6.03      Current levels of working capital in both companies are somewhat
high: the new investment in working capital to be financed by the Project has
been determined as the difference between the level considered appropriate now
for the companies under efficient operation, and the level determined under
the same assumptions after the projects have been implemented. Interest has
been capitalized through 1982, by which time it is anticipated that all
facilities to be provided under the Project will be erected.
B. Financing Plan
6.04      The following table gives the financing plan for the Project and for
each of its three sub-components.

a/   IDA credit 524 and Bank loans 1062 and 1456.
On this basis, financing for NATIONAL would be on a 27/73 debt/equity ratio
and for RAKTA on a 28/72 ratio. In view of the present low levels of out-
standing debt of the two companies these ratios are satisfactory. The US$50.0
million Bank loan will be made to the Government at the standard interest rate
for a period of 15 years including 4.5 years of grace. US$23 and 27 million
will be on-lent to NATIONAL and RAKTA respectively at 10% interest rate and
at the same maturity as the Bank loan to the Government. The companies will



- 35 -
assume the foreign exchange risk. These terms are in line with commercial
rates in Egypt. In addition to the Bank loan, US$0.8 million from Import
Credit/Loan I and II (Cr-524/Ln-1062, Ln-1456) have been made available to
each of the companies by the Government under the on-lending terms of these
credit/loan agreements. No retroactive financing is required.
6.05      At the request of the Government which is striving to increase pri-
vate sector participation in industrial development, the remaining financing
required for both equity and debt will be raised from local and foreign finan-
cial institutions. The terms of the loans are expected to be 8 years including
a 3-year grace period at 12% interest rate. The companies have retained the
Arab Investment Bank (AIB) to manage their financing operations, and about 10
financial institutions (investment and commercial Banks, insurance companies
and pension funds) have already expressed their interest in participating in
the Project. The extent of their participation will be determined by the
valuation of the companies' existing net worth. This evaluation will be
carried out by the Investment Authority which is the sole Government agent
for handling and approving investments under Law 43, and is expected to be
completed by about July 15, 1980. To facilitate its task, the companies and
the AIB have jointly completed, with Bank assistance, a preliminary evaluation
of the companies' net worth on the basis of both the companies' future profit-
ability and the value of the companies' productive capacity. These studies
indicate that it is possible to simultaneously attract new investors as well
as protect the interest of the existing ones, i.e. the Government and, in the
case of RAKTA other public sector organizations and some private shareholders.
Nevertheless, agreement has been reached with the Government that, as the
major shareholder, it will provide and cause the other major shareholders or
share-subscribers to provide any funds required to complete the Project on
terms satisfactory to the Bank. For this purpose, Project completion is
defined as the attainment of 80% of the production levels for each company as
projected in para 5.02.1/
C. Procurement
6.06      All machinery and equipment supply contracts to be financed by the
Bank loans will be awarded on the basis of International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) consistent with Bank procurement guidelines, with the following exceptions:
(i)  Where it can be clearly demonstrated that modifications to
existing machinery requires purchases from the original
supplier for reasons of compatability, and where alter-
native suppliers have been considered and rejected on
grounds which the Bank finds reasonable, direct purchases
from original suppliers may be permitted. Procurement
based on this procedure is not expected to exceed US$4 mil-
lion equivalent in the case of NATIONAL, and US$5 million
equivalent in the case of RAKTA.
(ii) Items costing less than US$100,000 each, to a total of
not more than US$2,000,000 equivalent for each company,
may be procured through international shopping on the
basis of suitability, availability and price.
1/ NATIONAL, 77,000 tpy and RAKTA 95,000 tpy of paper and board.



- 36 -
6.07      For contracts awarded through ICB, for the purpose of bid evalua-
tion, a 15% margin of preference or the actual tariff on equivalent imported
goods, whichever is the lower, will be accorded to qualified local manufac-
turers who participate in IC]3. Contracts for technical assistance and studies
to be financed by the Bank will follow the Bank's guidelines for these types
of services. The remaining items not financed by the Bank will also be pro-
cured on a competitive basis.
D.   Allocation and Disbursemnent of Bank Loan
6.08      Allocation of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan is shown
below. Bank funds will be utilized only for foreign expenditures, CIF,
except in the unexpected case where a local manufacturer is awarded a con-
tract under ICB; then all local ex-factory costs relating to such a contract
may also be financed.

The anticipated disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is presented in Annex
6-3. Any undisbursed savings from the loan will be cancelled if the funds
cannot be utilized in meeting the Project objectives. The proportion of the
Bank loan to be used for local currency is not expected to exceed 2%.
VII.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A.   Basis of Projections
7.01      Details of the assumptions used in the financial analysis are
contained in Annex 7-1. Increases in production and improvements in quality
as a result of the Project are expected at both NATIONAL and RAKTA from
mid-1983, with full benefits being obtained by 1985. Cost and revenue pro-
jections have been prepared in current terms through 1983, and in constant
terms thereafter. Price escalation on local costs has been computed at 18%
for 1980, 15% for 1981 and 12% for 1982; escalation on foreign costs has been
computed at 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981 and 8% for 1982. Projections for the
rate of return analysis have been made in real terms through 1998, or at 15
years after completion of the projects. Adequate allowances for additional



- 37 -
capital inputs through the life of the Project to achieve this objective have
been incorporated. The following table shows projected production in each
mill compared with current production levels:

a/   It is projected that with or without the project, NATIONAL's production
of cheap wrapper from its ALPA mill will cease from 1984.
B.   Prices
7.02      Prices used for financial analysis are based on current prices in
Egypt for the various paper grades which, as previously noted (para 4.22) are
in reasonable agreement with world prices. The current Egyptian prices are
shown in Annex 4-6 and the general assumptions used to develop them for use
in the projections are as follows:
(i)  Prices have been escalated from January 1980 levels through
1983 at projected international rates of escalation for all
grades except the packaging grades and cheap wrapper at
NATIONAL, where domestic escalation rates have been used 1/;
(ii)  For lower grade printing and writing paper produced at RAKTA
(the only grade for which the Government is currently control-
ling the price) the ex-factory price is now set at LE 360 per
ton for school note books, and LE 400 per ton for others. It
has been assumed (para 3.11) that this price will be increased
to LE 425 in mid-1980, and escalated at the foreign escalation
rate through 1983; and
1/   This distinction has been made because the low-quality grades produced
at NATIONAL are a distinctly local product with no parallel in interna-
tional markets. They are also priced very cheaply at present.



- 38 -
(iii)  The prices of the printing and writing paper as well as
packaging grades produced at NATIONAL have been assumed to
increase in real te!rms by 5% and 20% respectively in 1982,
reflecting the expe!Ctation that the improvements in quality
brought about by the project will lead to substantially
lower wastage in stLbsequent converting operations and enable
converters to pay a. higher price without any actual increase
in their costs.
7.03      As noted previously, and except for printing and writing paper,
paper prices in Egypt are determined by free international competition. On
the basis of such international prices as general yardsticks for domestic
prices, NATIONAL and RAKTA are expected to be in a good competitive position
vis-a-vis imports once they have executed their respective projects. As
mentioned in para 3.11, the Government has confirmed that it will allow the
new companies under the provisions of Law 43 to set their product prices
competitively without any Government intervention.
C.   Production Costs
7.04      Production costs have been calculated on the basis of raw material
consumption data and prices supplied by the companies, and reviewed by the
consultants and the Bank. Data have been developed both for the "without
project" and "with project" cases to facilitate subsequent rate of return
analyses. For cost projection purposes, prices for domestic raw materials
and inputs (rice straw, waste paper, bagasse pulp, fuel oil, electric power,
chemicals and labor) have been escalated from current 1980 levels at pro-
jected domestic rates of inflation through 1983, and held at constant 1983
levels thereafter. Labor costs have been assumed to increase by 60% in 1981
in addition to local escalation due to the companies' freedom with regard to
remuneration policy obtained under Law 43. Similarly, prices for oil, power
and bagasse pulp will be set at international price levels after 1982 when
the companies are given full benefit from Law 43. Prices for imported raw
materials such as pulp, paper-making chemicals and operating and maintenance
supplies have been similarly escalated through 1983 using projected interna-
tional rates of inflation. The companies will enjoy a 5-year tax-holiday
starting from the establishment of the successor companies under the provisions
of Law 43, and the corporate taxes (42% on retained earnings for the companies)
are calculated accordingly. Further details are given in Annex 7-1.
7.05      With the Project, the cost of production for paper and board pro-
duced at NATIONAL and RAKTA will decline by an average of almost 10% as a
result of: (i) increased capacity utilization; (ii) self-production of
bleaching chemicals at RAKTA; (iii) decrease in fibre losses from an average
of 10% to an average of 5% of fibre inputs; and (iv) increased use of selected
and cleaned waste paper in the premium grades at NATIONAL, from zero levels
at present to up to 10%.
D.   Financial Projections
7.06      Projected Income Statements, Funds Flow Statements, and Balance

7.07      Although in the long run, the financial situation of both companies
appears to be satisfactory, it is evident that they are going to face finan-
cial difficulties during their project implementation periods.  For NATIONAL,
the problem is directly related to its losses from operations in 1980 and
1981. The cash requirements due to its losses is expected to amount to about
LE 3 million during 1980 and 81. Upon project completion, the situation
would be remedied. RAKTA will have the most critical period in 1980, due to
the combination of its losses from operations, repayment of long-term debt and
payment for the pulp mill construction currently undertaken. The shortages of
funds would amount to LE 6 million for RAKTA in 1980: LE 2.6 million to cover
the cash requirement for the operations, LE 1.4 million to repay the long-term
debt, and LE 2.0 million to complete the pulp mill. From 1981 competitive
prices for its printing and writing paper, and the start-up of operations of
new straw pulp mill is expected to turn the company into profitable condition,
and the internal cash generation would be sufficient to cover the debt-services
and the cash requirement for investments.
7.08      In view of the relatively short period of the financial stringency,
the companies intend to borrow medium-term working capital funds, repayable
over three years from 1983. The Government has agreed to provide and cause
the other shareholders to provide funds to meet any cash requirements due to



- 40 -
operating losses during project implementation, and to maintain until Project
completion a current ratio of at least 1.2 and a debt/equity ratio of at least
60/40. Medium-term loans of LE 3 million and 6 million to NATIONAL and RAKTA
respectively would change the projected financial performance of the companies
as follows:

7.09      In order to safeguard the financial soundness of the two companies
and in addition to the pricin.g policy agreement referred to above (paras
3.11 and 7.03), both NATIONAI and RAKTA have agreed that, without having
otherwise received the prior consent of the Bank, they:
(i)  Will maintain after Project completion a current ratio of
at least 1.2 and a debt/equity ratio of 60/40;
(ii)  Will limit any pre-payment of debt, including any repayment
of the Government loans, any dividend or distribution with
respect to share capital if, as a result, the current ratio
would fall below 1.4;
(iii)  Will not incur any long-term debt if any future debt-service
ratios would be estimated to fall below 1.5 and if the
debt/equity ratio would exceed 60/40; and
(iv)  Will not embark on any other modernization or long-term invest-
ment program requiring investments in excess of US$5 million
equivalent each in any one year before completion of each project.
Furthermore, the Government has confirmed that the successor companies will be
able to purchase the foreign exchange required for their operations and debt
service at the prevailing exchange rate declared by the Central Bank.

E.   Financial Rate of Return
7.10      Cost and benefit streams for financial rate of return analysis,
based on the assumptions described above, are contained in Annexes 7-8 and
7-9. The project life has been assumed to be 15 years following the attain-
ment of the new production levels after project implementation. The returns
respectively before and after taxes are 20% and 19% for NATIONAL, and 23% and
20% for RAKTA. The sensitivity of these rates of return (before taxes) to
changes in major assumptions is presented in the following table.

a/  That is, only 70% of the increase in output as targetted by each project
(para 7.01).
It will be recognized that the financial returns shown above under various
sensitivity assumptions are unusually high for industrial projects. The
reason is that both projects have predominantly the character of rationaliza-
tion and are expected to achieve increases in volume and quality of production
and decreases in operating costs against relatively low capital investment,
most of which is in "productive" equipment and very little in civil works.
Therefore even under very severe adverse circumstances the financial rates of
returns are still expected to be adequate.
F. Risks
7.11      While the financial rates of return of the two projects are expected
to be very satisfactory and equally their economic returns as will be discussed
in the following Chapter VIII, they rest on the fulfillment of two basic



- 42 -
assumptions: (i) that the Pro;ject will not only provide the means for improving
the quality of domestically produced grades of paper and board but that
potential consumers of these products, who are now forced to import in order
to get the quality they require for their converting operations, will in fact
buy the companies' paper; and (ii) that the managements of the two companies
will be able to implement and operate the new facilities efficiently. There
is clearly some risk that these objectives may not be fully reached. The
specific measures which have been taken to address these risks are firstly to
provide adequate outside quali'fied technical assistance to ensure that the
Project is implemented and subsequently operated as designed and that proper
marketing measures are taken t:o effectively introduce the upgraded products
to the consumers, and secondly to bring the companies under the provisions of
Egyptian Law 43 as soon as feasible so that they are able to attract, retain
and adequately compensate qualified staff to continue to operate the plants
efficiently after the conclusion of the technical assistance. In addition,
the Government will consult with the Bank before initiating or allowing any
major increases in production capacity which could compete with NATIONAL and
RAKTA in the projected local markets or could limit the availability of raw
materials for the companies betfore completion of the studies (para 5.13).
With these provisions the probability is reasonably good that the expected
benefits will accrue to the companies and the Egyptian economy.
G.   Auditing and Reporting
7.12      All public sector enterprises in Egypt are audited by the Central
Agency for Auditing, which is a governmental organization, and acceptable to
the Bank. Both NATIONAL and RAKTA have agreed to submit to the Bank their
annual financial accounts and statements, audited by the Central Auditing
Agency or an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank within six months of
the end of each year. The comLpanies will submit quarterly project progress
and procurement status reports, together with financial statements, within
45 days after each quarter. F'inally, after completion of the Project, the
companies will prepare and furnish to the Bank a comprehensive report on the
Project, its implementation, initial operation, and the updated costs and
benefits expected to be derived therefrom.
VIII.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Project Cost
8.01      In the financial analysis, it has already been assumed that the
materials and equipment required for the Project will be imported free from
customs duties. The financial costs of other minor materials used in the
construction will in some case be subsidized (such as fuel and cement) and in
other cases incorporate indirect taxes. The overall effect of adjusting the
financial cost of implementing the Project to incorporate these minor and
partly offsetting adjustments would be minimal and thus the economic capital
cost of the Project has been considered equal to its financial cost.



- 43 -
B.   Economic Costs  of Inputs
8.02      The economic costs and benefits of the Project are expressed in
constant 1980 prices and the tradeable items have been valued at their
respective border prices as discussed below in para 8.06. A comparison
between financial a-d economic costs is contained in Annex 8-1.  Non-tradeable
items include labor, rice straw, bagasse pulp, waste paper and power.
8.03      Labor costs for economic calculations have been taken as identical
to the financial costs. Bagasse pulp is purchased from the pulp mill at Edfu
at prices which are negotiated directly between NATIONAL and RAKTA on the one
hand, and Societe des Sucreries et de Distillerie d'Egypte, which owns the
pulp mill, on the other. The current price is LE 125 per ton (US$181).
Bagasse pulp is not traded internationally but in many respects it is similar
to and could be substituted by short-fibred wood pulps. It is therefore
possible to construct an equivalent international price for bagasse pulp
which would be a realistic estimate of its economic value. The calculation
below indicates that a figure of LE 330 per ton (US$478), or 95% higher than
the financial price, is a reasonable estimate of the economic value of
bagasse pulp.

a/   Based on 1st quarter 1980 prices.
b/   Edfu's bagasse pulp is relatively dirty and also contains mold as
it is shipped wet.
8.04      Rice straw is used for pulp and paper production, fiber board
production, packing in the ceramics and glassware industries, and by farmers
for fuel and for fodder and bedding of animals. Recent changes in both the
varieties of rice cultivated and in the methods of cultivation have led
to shortages in supply in the areas immediately adjacent to RAKTA, the
principal consumer. These shortages have forced the price to increase from
LE 8 per ton in 1976, to LE 12 per ton (US$20.3) at present. By expanding
the area of collection, installing large satellite storage yards and improving
transportation systems, RAKTA expects to be able to continue to obtain at
this same price the increasing supplies necessary for its newly expanded pulp
mill. Since this financial price appears to represent the price at which
farmers will sell, and contractors will collect and bale rice straw, the
economic price has been assumed to be equivalent to the financial price.



- 44 -
8.05      The economic price for waste paper has been taken to be the same as
the financial price. Prices in Egypt vary from LE 20 per ton (US$28) for the
cheapest grades of mixed wasl:e to LE 60 per ton (US$85) for clean white waste.
Although waste paper is not traded internationally to any great extent, these
figures are comparable to domestic prices in other waste paper consuming
countries. In the United States, for example, recent quotations for mixed
waste ranged from US$20-30 per ton, and for clean white waste, from US$100-350
per ton. For power, the economic cost has been taken to be LE 0.017 per kWh
(US$0.025) 1/ which is 70% h:Lgher than the financial cost of LE 0.010 (US$0.014).
8.06      Principal tradeable items are imported pulp, fuel oil, imported
chemicals, and operating and maintenance supplies. Imported pulp carries
various types of duty which total 17%. This duty has been eliminated in
the economic calculations. For fuel oil, the economic cost has been taken
to be LE 96.0 per ton (US$140, or equivalent to US$35 per barrel of crude
oil), which is about nine times higher than the financial cost. Operating and
maintenance supplies are botlh imported and procured locally. Some of the
imported supplies attract customs duty and taxes at rates ranging from about
10 to 20%. Thus in determinLng the economic cost, the financial costs of
supplies have been reduced by 8% to adjust for these indirect taxes.
C.   Economic Product Values
8.07      The Bank has undertaken a preliminary analysis 2/ of the prices for
various grades of pulp and paper which would allow efficient producers in
traditional producing regions (Scandinavia, Canada and the US) to add new
capacity and to continue to achieve customary profit levels on their invest-
ment. Actual prices in most markets exceeded these theoretical calculated
long-term prices by a considerable margin in 1974 and 1975, but dropped as
much as 20% below the long-term prices in 1976 through mid-1978. During the
past 12-18 months, prices for most grades have risen to the extent that in
most cases the calculated real long-term prices have been achieved. For
economic analysis, the current import prices have been used except that in the
case of the packaging grades and cheap wrapper produced by NATIONAL, which are
not traded internationally, the current domestic prices have been used. In
the case of the printing and writing paper produced primarily from rice straw
at RAKTA, a discount of 10% below the long-term price for imported paper
produced from wood pulp has been assumed.

D.   Economic Rate of Return
8.08      Summaries of economic costs and benefits for NATIONAL and for RAKTA,
determined on the basis of the foregoing assumptions both with and without the
Project, are shown in Annexes 8-2 and 8-3. The economic rate of return is 20%
for NATIONAL and 32% for RAKTA, compared with 20% and 23% financial rates of
return, respectively. In effect, higher economic costs for energy are largely
offset by reductions in duty on imported raw materials, and selling price
differentials between the financial and economic analyses are minimal. The
rate of return is higher for RAKTA than for NATIONAL because the economics of
producing paper with a large component of domestically available rice-straw
are inevitably better than production with a larger component of imported
pulp. For this reason, RAKTA is likely to continue to be the more profitable
operation. The sensitivity of these rates of return to changes in key assump-
tions is shown in the following table:

For NATIONAL, the rate of return drops to unacceptable levels if a 15% reduc-
tion in product prices is assumed. However, international paper prices (from
which the base case analysis has been computed) have in fact been increasing
from depressed levels during the past year and further increases are expected.
A drop in world paper prices to the extent where NATIONAL's economic viability
is called into question is extremely unlikely. For RAKTA, the economic rate
of return is consistently good within the range of variables examined. As
noted previously, the rates of return are considerably higher than could be
expected for investments in new projects in the pulp and paper sector in Egypt
or in any other country. This merely reflects the fact that most of the
components of the Project are designed to improve and expand existing facili-
ties and thus obtain benefits which are partially due to investments which
have been made in the past.
E.  Other Benefits
8.10      The Project is the first in Egypt's pulp and paper sector to be
implemented with the Bank's assistance, and the first out of a number recom-
mended in the nationwide study of the pulp and paper sector which was com-
pleted in 1978. It will lead to significant savings in foreign exchange.
When the facilities provided by the Project are in full operation, the net
foreign exchange savings will amount to approximately US$30 million annually;
this compares to the Project's estimated foreign exchange requirements
(excluding studies) of US$62 million. In addition, the technical assistance
to be provided under the Project will expand paper-making technology in Egypt,
improve the efficiency of operation of existing as well as new facilities,
and serve as a training ground for other pulp and paper operations in Egypt.

1/  Reduction of paper weights and process waste ratios have been assumed as a result of mill modernization,
equivalent to 3% of total apparent demand volume in 1982, 5% in 1983, and 8% in 1984 and 1985.
2/  Including the proposed project.  Production increases as a result of the project beginning in 1982.  Full
production is reached in 1985.  It has further been assumed that ALPA and the old SIMO mill will have been
shut down by the end of 1983.  Projected domestic production volumes aiso reflect anticipated outputs from
SIMO's new board machine.
