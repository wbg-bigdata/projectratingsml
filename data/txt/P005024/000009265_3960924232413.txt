PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT - PULP AND PAPER PROJECT
(LOAN 1849-EGT)
PREFACE
Loan 1849-EGT for the Egypt Pulp and Paper Project for
US$50 million was signed on June 4, 1980, and closed on February 5,
1987, at which time US$49.9 million of the loan had been disbursed.
The main objective of the loan was to help reduce the cost of
importing paper and paperboard into Egypt by financing improvements to
the country's two largest pulp and paper mills, both Government-owned,
in order to increase effective capacity, improve quality, and reduce
production costs.
This Project Completion Report has been prepared by the
Industry Department based on drafts prepared by the beneficiaries, and
the findings of an Industry Department mission in February 1987. Comments
were received from one of the beneficiaries in May 1988, and are attached
to this report as Annex 7.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT - PULP AND PAPER PROJECT
(LOAN 1849-EGT)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.        The project was conceived following studies under an
Industrial Imports Project, and was specifically designed to reduce
Egypt's requirements for imported paper by increasing the quantity,
improving the quality, and reducing the production costs of paper from
the country's two largest paper mills (para 1.01).
ii.       These companies, the National Paper Company and the Rakta
paper company are Government-owned mills operating at Tabia, near
Alexandria. National uses waste paper, imported pulp and a small amount
of rice-straw pulp to produce a wide range of grades of paper and
paperboard on six paper machines. Rakta uses a substantial proportion
of rice straw pulp together with bagasse pulp (from Upper Egypt),
imported pulp, and waste paper to produce printing and writing paper and
folding boxboard. Both companies were producing paper of rather poor
and variable quality, and had excess capacity in existing machines which
could be utilized with relatively minor additional expenditures
(para 2.01).
iii.      A second important objective of the project was to utilize
Egyptian Law 43 to initiate a privatization process for the two
beneficiary companies, and this was a condition of effectiveness of the
loan. It was hoped that this would improve the efficiency of project
implementation and operation of the companies, and serve as a useful
precedent for modernizing and expanding other public sector enterprises.
In the event, after the signing of the loan, a change in Government led
to a change in policy and the Government requested that this requirement
be waived. Eventually the Bank agreed, and the loan was declared effective
on May 12, 1982, nearly two years after signing (paras 2.02-2.04).
iv.       In technical terms, the project was reasonably well prepared,
although in the case of National, when machines were shut down for
rehabilitation, it was found that considerably more work had to be done
than had at first been envisaged and this contributed to over-runs in both
cost and implementation time. Implementation of the project differed
markedly between the two companies. During the period of delay due to the
negotiations over the issue of Law 43, Rakta proceeded with detailed
engineering so that implementation began almost immediately the loan was
declared effective. In the case of National, almost a year elapsed before
the first disbursement. Rakta essentially completed project implementation
in a period of 39 months, which was the implementation time estimated at
appraisal (paras 3.18-3.19). The implementation at National lasted some 54



-v -
months, and would probably not yet have been concluded had not the Bank
insisted on the company hiring an outside projecl: management team to get
the project moving.  The differences between the performances of the two
companies can clearly be traced to differences in the managements, and
particular the Chairmen of the companies.
v.        Capital costs were significantly higher than the appraisal
estimates (para 3.22).   Considering the two-year delay, foreign costs were
reasonably in line (11% over budget at National, and 1% over budget at
Rakta). However, local costs were substantially higher than the appraisal
estimate: about 335% over budget in each of the mills. The principal
reasons for over-budget local expenditures were unanticipated customs
duties charges (which accounted for about 31% of the overrun), and higher
costs than anticipated for erection (29%), localLy-purchased equipment
(18%), and civil works (11%) (para 3.23).  In general, the additional costs
were financed from Government sources.
vi.        In terms of production, the performance of the two mills has
been rather disappointing to date, with National achieving about 40% of
the additional output anticipated at appraisal, and Rakta achieving 70%.
The mills have reached appraisal expectations during acceptance trials
and on a short-term basis, and further increases on a sustained basis
are expected (para 4.01). However, the availabiLity of local supplies of
fiber for paper-making (rice straw pulp, bagasse pulp and waste paper) are
substantially less than projected at appraisal, and under these
circumstances, increased production of paper requires corresponding
increases in imports of pulp for paper-making. This is especially critical
in the case of National, which must purchase almost all of its fibrous raw
material (see comments from National on this report, Annex 7). A major
priority for the sector is therefore the installation of more domestic
pulping capacity as without this capacity, the present project cannot
achieve its potential (paras 4.05-4.06).
vii.       In other respects, the project has achieved at least some of
the benefits claimed during appraisal. Quality of all grades has
improved significantly, and realJ average production costs are somewhat
lower, although the increased use of imported pulp has limited the
improvements in this area. Financial internal rates of return are lower
than at appraisal (6% instead of 20% for National, and 15% instead of
23% for Rakta), but that is at least partly becauise domestic prices are
controlled by the Government at less than import parity, while pulp is
imported at the full international price (para 5.09). In economic terms,
the returns are somewhat higher (14% compared with 20% at appraisal for
National, and 17% compared with 32% for Rakta). The reasons for the lower
economic rates of return are primarily the increased capital costs, and the
longer implementation period (paras 6.01-6.02).
viii.      The principal lessons for the Bank in this project are (a) the
recurring problem of underestimating local costs (para 7.02); (b) the
importance of individual managers in determining the level of success in
project implementation (para 7.03); and (c) the lack of adequate attention
paid to ensuring the availability of critical non-project inputs (in this
case pulp) (para 7.04).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Although Egypt's first mechanized paper mill started operations
at the beginning of the century, and a number of relatively large-scale
operations have been built since World War II, the country's demand for
paper has consistently far exceeded domestic supply, and imports of paper
(together with pulp to produce paper) have averaged around US$ 200 million
annually over the past decade. Following a study of the pulp and paper
sector financed under the Bank's Industrial Imports Project to Egypt
(Credit 1062-EGT of 1974), the Government, with Bank assistance, proposed a
project to help expand the domestic supply of paper by introducing
improvements at the publicly-owned National and Rakta Paper Companies, both
of which are located near Alexandria.
1.02      National and Rakta are the largest pulp and paper companies in
Egypt, and even prior to the project, accounted for over 70% of domestic
paper production. However both companies had seen their financial
positions deteriorate, partly due to shortcomings in mill design which did
not permit operations at reasonable levels of capacity utilization, and
partly because of their inability to produce marketable grades of paper and
board in the face of competition from better-quality imports.
1.03      The major objective of the project was to attempt to deal with
these problems by providing a package of equipment and technical assistance
which would: (i) increase capacity, and allow the full use of existing
capacity; (ii) improve quality to better be able to compete with imports;
and (iii) improve efficiency and reduce operating costs.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      Detailed project preparation began in mid-1978 with a feasibility
study undertaken by Canadian consultants. This study was also financed
under the previously-referenced Imports Project (para 1.01). Field work
was undertaken during September-November 1978, and a preappraisal mission
also visited Egypt during this period. The project scope and its main
components were finalized during December 1978. Technical elements of the
Project were appraised on the basis of this work with visits to Egypt in
January 1979, and subsequently at the consultant's offices in Canada where
representatives of the companies and Government were also in attendance.
2.02      During appraisal, it became increasingly clear that in National
and Rakta, as with other public sector companies in Egypt, at least some of



-2-
I
the probletfs of maintaining reasonable rates of capacity utilization and
operating efficiency could be attributed to the restrictive regulations
which were applied to public sector companies. In this environment, company
management was limited in its scope to implement effective policies for
manning, compensation, pricing, profit retention and new investment. In
recognition of these problems, in 1974 the Government had promulgated a new
law (Egyptian Law 43) to attract private investment by giving company
management the authority to set prices, establish compensation packages
which would attract and retain qualified personnel, and to provide greater
freedom in investment and profit distribution policies. It was agreed that
the proposed projects at National and Rakta provided a good opportunity to
introduce the structural improvements envisaged under Law 43 to the pulp
and paper sub-sector. Further, since this was one of the first of such
transfers proposed for a large operating public sector company in its
entirety, it would provide a useful example for other similar operations.
Thus, during 1979, internal project processing was delayed while the
Government and the Bank worked jointly to develop a strategy and a
timetable for the evolution of National and Rakta into successor companies
under Egyptian Law 43.
2.03      By the end of 1979, this work had been completed. In view of the
time which had passed, capital costs were updated by the consultants in
February 1980, and the appraisal report finalized on this basis.
Negotiations between Egyptian representatives and the Bank took place
during March, 1980, during which time it was agreed that the Government
would complete the necessary steps to establish the two successor companies
to be operated under the provisions of Law 43 by no later than February 28,
1981. On May 20, 1980, the Bank's Executive Directors approved a loan of
US$50 million to the Government for a period of fifteen years, including
four-and-one-half years of grace. The Government agreed that the proceeds
of the Bank Loan would be on-lent to National (US$23 million), and Rakta
(US$27 million), with the same loan and grace period, and at an interest
rate of 10%. The foreign exchange risk was to be borne by the companies.
The loan was signed on June 4, 1980.
2.04      After signing the loan, the companies completed all of the
preliminary steps required for their conversion under Law 43. However, a
change of Government and a new Minister of Industry had led to a. change in
policy, and a decree that Law 43 could not be used for the conversion of
existing public sector companies. Convinced that the success of the
project would be considerably enhanced if National and Rakta were in (or at
least able to operate as if in) the private sector, the Bank continued to
press for the implementation of the necessary changes as called for in the
Loan Agreement. It became clear, how&ver, that the Government was adamant
in its revised position. Eventually, since the benefits of the project
were seen as being adequate to cover any risk in proceeding with the
companies under their existing public sector status, the Bank accepted this
situation. The Loan Agreement was modified, and on May 12, 1982, nearly
two years after signing of the loan, it was declared effective.

B. Project Description and Objectives
2.05      The two project components consist of assistance to National and
Rakta respectively, each aimed at increasing production, improving quality,
and reducing production costs.
2.06      For National, the project included: (i) the addition of modern
waste paper sorting and treating facilities; (ii) improving Paper Machines
Nos. 4 through 6 (PMs 4-6), together with their associated stock
preparation equipment; (iii) the addition of a turbo-generator unit; and
(iv) the provision of technical assistance for project implementation and
start-up.
2.07      For Rakta, the project included: (i) the addition of a
chloralkali plant to eliminate one of the major production bottlenecks;
(ii) a complete rebuild of a board machine (PM-4), including provision of
an off-machine coater; (iii) improvements of instrumentation, stock
preparation and fibre-recover systems on PMs 1-3; (iv) a complete rebuild
of the drive of PM 3; and (v) the provision of technical assistance for
project implementation and start-up.
1II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
1. Production
3.01      All project facilities have not yet operated for a complete year
but at current budget (and actual) levels of operation, about 60% of
projected production improvement has been achieved at National and 50% at
Rakta. However based on operations projected from performance trials and
current "best" experience, National has the capability to exceed the
increase projected at appraisal by about 12%, although Rakta will reach
only 88% of this figure. Overall, the paper machines improved under the
project have the capacity to achieve close to 100% of the projected
increase in production.
3.02      Despite this apparent technical success, it is unlikely that
either National or Rakta will operate at these levels in the forseeable
future, because of a shortage of fibrous raw material from domestic
sources, and consequently, the high proportion of expensive imported pulp
required for marginal increases in paper production. At the time of
appraisal it was understood that domestic fiber supplies--rice straw pulp,
bagasse pulp and waste paper--would increase during the period of project
implementation. However as further detailed below (Chapter IV), such
increases have been less than anticipated.
2. Quality Improvement
3.03      Both mills have achieved significant quality improvement, partly
in terms of the production of more sophisticated grades that could not be



-4-
produced with the machines in their previous condition, and partly because
of improved (and particularly reduced variations in) quality of other
grades. This is confirmed by major consumers of the mills' output.
3.04      At National, a rebuilt water treatment plant, the new wastepaper
treatment facility and improvements to the stock preparation systems on PMs
1-3 have all led to improved product sheet formation and cleanliness.
Moreover, since most of the increase in capacity is on PMs 4-6 which
produce higher quality grades, the average quality of all of the output has
been improved. At Rakta, the main quality improvement is on the board
machine (PM 4) the product of which, because of quality defects and
variations, was difficult to sell at any price in the past, but which now
is capable of producing duplex board of international quality. When the
coater installation is complete (para 3.06), average quality will be even
further improved. On PMs 1-3, automatic controls for basis weight and
moisture content have also led to improved product uniformity.
3.  Production Costs
3.05      The third principal objective of the Project, reduction in
operating costs, was to have been achieved through a combination of reduced
imported raw material per ton of paper, and greater capacity utilization
giving lower fixed costs per ton of paper. As noted above, increases in
domestic sources of fiber have been less than anticipated, so that this
benefit is lower than the appraisal estimate. However, as further detailed
in Chapter V, some of the anticipated benefit from the reduction of unit
fixed costs has been achieved.
B. Changes in Project Scope
3.06      There were no major changes in project scope during
implementation. Some minor changes at National included: increasing the
size of the turbogenerator (from 7 MW to 11.6 MW); adding a component for
improvements to the mill water treatment system; eliminating the minor
works proposed for rehabilitation of PM-6; and appointing foreign
consultants to assist with project implementation.
l
3.07      At Rakta, early cost estimates indicated a serious cost overrun
so that the proposed off-machine coating unit for PM-4 was dropped from the
Project. Subsequently, however (mainly due to the appreciation of the US
dollar), sufficient funds were found to be available to finance most of the
cost of a lower-cost on-machine coater. With other funds from Government,
this unit has been purchased, will shortly be installed, and should be in
operation by year-end.
C. Project Management
3.08      Although foreign engineering consultants were appointed to
undertake the detailed engineering and equipment specification for the
proposed activities at both National and Rakta, it was decided at appraisal
that each company would manage the project with, its own staff. Project



-5-
Implementation Units were formed, and it was agreed that personnel provided
under the engineering and technical assistance components of the Project
would provide additional advice and support as required.
3.09      These arrangements worked well at Rakta.  Within six months of
loan effectiveness, Rakta had entered into contracts for most of the major
pieces of equipment required under the Project. Within eighteen months,
more than two-thirds of the Bank Loan had been disbursed. The situation
was not nearly so satisfactory at National. Decisions on equipment
selection were made very slowly. The first disbursement was not made until
almost a year after the loan was made effective.
3.10      There appear to be several reasons for this significant
difference in performance. First, Rakta has had strong and continuous
management under the same chairman since 1975. The staff is well
disciplined and motivated, the mill is clean and tidy, responsibilities are
clearly defined and accepted. It is noteworthy that this has been achieved
in spite of the constraints on hiring and remuneration policies in public
sector companies. The situation at National is very different. There has
been a succession of chairmen with various degrees of aptitude and
commitment for rather short terms and (probably as a result) there is a
distinct lack of cohesiveness among management personnel. With a lack of
strong guidance and clear definition of responsibility, decision-making has
been painfully slow.
3.11      Second, the National mill is more complex than Rakta in that it
incorporates more machines of more disparate type and age, and produces a
wider range of grades. Since the project was attempting to address
bottlenecks and other major problems on a mill-wide basis, it necessarily
was also more complicated.
3.12      Bank supervision missions identified the lack of direction at
National fairly early during project implementation and strongly
recommended ameliorating measures. In May 1984, a Bank supervision mission
and National management agreed to hire foreign consultants and establish a
Project Management Unit (PMU), staffed with a resident engineer, a
mechanical engineer, a scheduler and a cost estimator. While this took some
six months to implement, the PMU was operational from early 1985 and
project implementation proceeded at a satisfactory rate from that point.
D. Training
3.13      The project included overseas training tours for 27 Egyptian
technical personnel (21 from National and 6 from Rakta), and training
assistance within the scope of the operational assistance package provided
to each of the companies. At Rakta, on-the-job training by operations
specialists supplied by a Canadian consulting company proceeded
satisfactorily. Between 1983 and 1985, 167 employees received training
related to the start-up and operation of the new facilities, and Rakta has
continued with the training with its own staff and resources. At National,
the same Canadian company provided a technical assistance team who gave



-6-
training for about 1,000 employees during the same time period as at
Rakta. However, since this period did not coincide with the delayed
installation and start-up of the new equipment, much of the potential
benefit was lost.
E. Use and Performance of Consultants
3.14      Consultants were involved in the entire project cycle, from
project identification, preparation, preliminary and detailed engineering,
project implementation and management (at Natiornal), and technical
assistance for start-up and initial operations. The same consulting
companies were used by both Rakta and National, but the effectiveness of
their contribution must be evaluated separately for the two companies.
3.15      At Rakta, about US$4.5 million (10% of the total project cost)
was spent on consultants for foreign technical assistance. The
consultants' performance was judged to be good by both Rakta management and
the Bank. To a significant extent, this reflects the capabilities of the
Rakta management, which knew exactly what it wanted from consultants, when
they should be on the site, what they should contribute and when they
should leave. At National, although'considerabLy more was spent on
consultants (US$8.7 million--17% of total project cost) there was, at
times, a considerable degree of resentment and mistrust between the
consultants and National management which adversely affected the working
relationships. Although at the end of the project National management
judged the performance of the consultants "satisfactory," this clearly did
not reflect the view throughout the period of project implementation.  The
long delays at the start of the project (para 3,09), the lack of consistent
management direction (para 3.10) and the mis-timed contribution of the
technical assistance team (para 3.13), all contributed to the differences
which arose and the apparent inefficiencies in the consultants'
contribution.
F. Procurement
3.16      Major machinery and equipment was procured under international
competitive bidding (ICB) using Bank guidelines. Neither National nor
Rakta reported any particular difficulties following these guidelines. Some
reallocation of categories occurred during the project, primarily due to
shifts in currency values. Details are contained in Annex 3-1. About
$100,000 of the $50 million loan was not disbursed and was cancelled.
3.17      Procurement with Bank funds was spread among seven countries,
with the Federal Republic of Germany receiving ithe bulk of the proceeds of
the Bank loan (64%). Austrian, United States' and Canadian firms supplied
17%, 9% and 8% of Bank-financed procurement reslpectively. Full procurement
details by country of origin are contained in Annex 3-2.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.18      A comparison of actual implementation with the schedule prepared
at the time of project appraisal is given in Annex 3-3.  At the time of
I



-7-
appraisal, it was anticipated that implementation activities would start on
April 1, 1980, and that all construction and erection activities would be
complete 39 months later, on June 30, 1983. In fact, the delay occasioned
by the prolonged discussions regarding Law 43 (para 2.04), delayed all but
the preliminary engineering activities by more than two years, and the
first disbursements under the loan were not made until September 1982
(Rakta) and June 1983 (National). From the time of the first disbursement
at Rakta, the project proceeded rapidly and was essentially completed
within the time schedule envisioned in the original appraisal. At
National, however, completion of major activities was not achieved until
November 1986, some 54 months after the loan was declared effective.
3.19      Overall, therefore, the completion date at Rakta was delayed by
24 months from the original schedule, all of which can be attributed to the
delay by the Bank and the Government in resolving the issue of Law 43. The
completion date at National was 41 months behind the original schedule, of
which 26 months can be attributed to the Law 43 issue, and the remaining 15
months to: (i) a delay in initiating any project activity (about 8 months);
and (ii) unanticipated additional rehabilitation work which was required in
some areas of the mill. In retrospect, it appears that additional
allowances should have been made for such eventualities in the more complex
National component of the Project.
H.  Environmental Impact
3.20      It was toted at the time of the appraisal, that both National and
Rakta were significant dischargers of fiber and dissolved organic and
inorganic chemicals into the Mediterranean Sea, and that the Project would
have some impact on these discharges, particularly by incorporating
improved fibre-recovery systems on existing paper machines. These systems
are installed and operating. Between the time of appraisal and the
present, a much greater awareness of environmental effects of mill
operations is evident and technical staff in both mills are working to
further reduce water consumption and the discharge of fibers and chemicals.
3.21      At appraisal it was also noted that Rakta was experimenting with
a system to remove silica from the straw pulp mill process liquors so that
they could be recovered using the same systems as are common for wood-based
pulp mills. As agreed during negotiations, Rakta kept the Bank fully
informed as to the progress of this work, and it now appears that a
commercially viable system has been developed. Interest in the system is
evident in a number of projects outside Egypt, and Rakta has proposed a
full-scale recovery system in its capital budget for the next five-year
plan. The cost of the system is significant (about LE 18 million, or
US$13 million equivalent), but the system would pay for itself through heat
and chemical recovery, as well as having a substantial impact on the level
and impact of Rakta's effluent discharges.
I. Capital Costs, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.22      The actual total financing required for the Project was US$96.3
million equivalent, of which US$65.7 million was foreign exchange, compared



-8-
with the appraisal estimate of US$75.9 million, of which US$62.0 million
was foreign exchange. In dollar terms, the overall project cost thus
over-ran by 27%, made up of a 6% overrun in foreign costs and a 335%
overrun in local costs. In terms of Egyptian pounds, the project cost
exceeded the appraisal estimate by 151%. Cost reporting and comparisons
are complicated by the impact of exchange rates, both between the US$ and
the Egyptian currency, and the US$ and the European currencies where the
major expenditures occurred. A further complication arises because after
onlending most of the proceeds of the loan at a fixed exchange rate of LE
0.70 per US$, the Egyptian Government retroactively changed the exchange
rate to LE 1.374 per US$. Because of these complications, project costs
have been estimated in both LE and US$. A year by year profile of project
expenditures, and a summary of total project cosls, in local and foreign
currencies is provided in Annex 3-4. Capital costs are compared with the
appraisal estimate in Annex 3-5. A summary of this comparison in dollar
terms is presented in the following table.

3.23      The major source of the US$20 million cost over-run is an
increase in local costs, and particularly the increase in the local costs
of machinery and equipment. The biggest single contributor factor to the
over-run is customs duties, equivalent to US$7.3 million, which were not
included in the appraisal estimate because the provisions of Law 43
included duty exemption. The companies have applied for a rebate of this
duty but it is not at all sure that they will get it, and it is therefore
included in the project costs.  Other significant contributions to the
over-run are inflationary increases in the costs of equipment and purchased
services due to the delay in beginning implementation of the project (about
US$5 million); actual purchases of local equipment which were not foreseen
at appraisal (about US$4 million); increased interest during construction
because of a longer capitalization period (about US$3 million); and
additional civil works and erection expenses US$7 million). Working
capital increases as a result of the project are about US$5 million less
than anticipated at appraisal, partly because the! full anticipated
production increase has not been achieved, but also because the
improvements in quality have allowed significant reductions in mill
inventories.



-9-
3.24      It was originally envisaged that the Project would be financed
primarily by a World bank loan, and by private equity which would be raised
as the companies converted to operation under Law 43. Because the proposal
to convert the companies under Law 43 did not eventuate, the anticipated
private equity was not available and the Government loaned these funds to
the companies. The Government also financed about three-quarters of the
$20 million cost over-run, the balance being financed through the
companies' own resources, import credits and local Bank loans. A
comparison between the appraisal proposal and the actual financing plan is
shown in the following table.

J. Studies
3.27      The Government agreed to undertake studies with respect to the
project concerning: (i) the converting industry, and (ii) fiber resources
for the expansion of pulp production. Both of these studies were
completed, are of good quality, and should serve their intended purpose of
assisting in planning for the further development of Egypt's pulp and paper
sector.
IV.   OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      As previously noted (para 3.01), all production facilities have
not yet operated for a full year and, particularly at National, the actual
operating experience to date is inadequate in itself to use as a base for
projecting future performance. Moreover, shortages of domestic fibrous raw
materials are such that production on some machines must be constrained at
less than the potential because it is not economic to produce some grades
with a high proportion of expensive imported pulp. However the guarantee
tests which were performed by the suppliers of each machine after
modification, and short-run actual operating experience, allow reasonable
assessments to be made of the potential production from each machine.
Details are presented in Annex 4-1, and summarized in the following table.

a/  "Actual output" is based on best three months' operation in past 12
months. 'Assessed potential' is an assessmenl: of the sustainable
output from each machine. 'Achievement' is the increase achieved (or
projected) compared with the increase projected at appraisal.

4.02      To date, the project has achieved 54% of its production
objectives (70% at Rakta, which has been operating for longer since project
completion, and 38% for National). Although there are differences from
machine to machine and mill to mill, overall the potential production from
the project is equal to that projected at the time of appraisal.
B. Fibrous Raw Material Constraint
4.03      Despite this potential, budget (and actual) production for the
year 1986/87 is significantly lower--57,000 tons at National and 72,000
tons at Rakta. According to the management of both mills, this is not a
function of the capacity of the refurbished machines, but of a shortage of
fibrous raw materials, both of lower-cost domestic sources, and (because of
a lack of foreign exchange) from imports. This situation-- the lack of the
anticipated development of domestic sources of fiber--is the single biggest
problem with the project, and likely to have the largest negative impact on
projected benefits.

- at full production                  -               76%          50%
4.04      The 26,000 ton short-fall in domestic pulp production must be met
from imports. More importantly, any additional paper production requires
matching imports of pulp: if the plants were to operate at the appraisal
production rates, the available domestic sources of fiber would supply only
50% of fiber requirements, at which point operations are uneconomic.
4.05      The reasons why domestic pulp production is less than anticipated
are first, the continuing deterioration of the #1 pulping line at Rakta,
the semi-chemical rice straw pulping line at National and the bagasse pulp
mill at Edfu; and second, the failure of Rakta's new #2 line to meet
production expectations. Rakta's original pulp mill dates back to the
1960s, and maintenance has fallen behind, largely due to a lack of foreign
exchange for spare parts. Production, which was around 18,000 tons
annually in the late 1970s, has fallen to around 14,000 tons today.
Similarly at National, the 10 ton-per-day semi-chemical pulping line has
not averaged more than 2-3 tons per day over the past several years. At



- 12 -
Edfu (owned by the Egyptian Sugar Company) a mocdest increase in projected
output (from 75% to 85% of capacity) did not eventuate. Finally, the #2
pulping line at Rakta, which started in 1980 with a design capacity of
30,000 tons annually, has never been able to sustain a production of more
than about 60% of this level, at least partly because of a lack of capacity
in some of the facilities common to the #1 and #2 lines. While the issue
of a shortage of domestic fiber resources was addressed at appraisal,
apparently too much f?aith was put in the assertions that ongoing activities
would successfully overcome this problem.
4.06      Plans to increase the supply of domestic pulp include projects to
refurbish the Rakta pulp mill, build a new bagasse-based pulp mill at Qus,
and build a new straw pulp mill in the delta area. All of these should be
feasible, and for the Rakta refurbishment in particular, would generate
high rates of return.
C. Market Developments
4.07      Overall, the Bank appraisal projected that the demand for paper
and paperboard in Egypt would grow at about 5.52% annually through the
1980s. Detailed projections by grade were prepared through 1985 and in the
following table, these projections are compared with actual demand in that
year.

Total                           330            454       492
4.08      With some variation from grade to grade, the appraisal apparently
rather under-estimated growth in demand, which has in fact averaged some
6.9% annually. As anticipated at the time of appraisal, the companies have
no difficulty in marketing all of their output.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Basis of Projections
5.01      The assumptions used for preparing financial projections for the
two mills are discussed in the following paragraphs. The basic projections
have been prepared at first-quarter 1987 prices.



- 13 -
1. Production Volume
5.02      As discussed above (paras 4.01-4.06), production is limited to
lower levels than anticipated at appraisal, because of inadequate supplies
of domestically produced pulp. However, particularly in the case of
National, actual output achieved to date is less than potential production,
because some of the machines have run for only a few months. Moreover, the
coating installation at Rakta, most of which was financed under the project
when it became clear that sufficient funds would be available (para 3.07)
will not come into operation until the end of 1987. Taking all of these
factors into account, the following production figures have been developed
and used as the basis for the financial projections in this report.

Total                74,000             76,000              76,000
2. Prices
5.03      Prices for most grades are set by the Government on a "cost plus"
basis, although authorized price increases frequently lag significantly
behind increases in costs. Recent sharp increases in the costs of imported
production materials, partly because of declining exchange rates, and
partly because of real (about 30%) increases in the international price of
the most important raw material, pulp, have led to a need for significant
increases in the paper prices to generate customary margins. It is
anticipated that these increases will be in effect by the beginning of
1986/87, and this assumption has been used in this analysis. Average
prices used are shown in the following table. Import parity prices,
converted to LE at the current cost of non-allocated foreign exchange to
public sector companies (LE 2.00 per US$ in March, 1987), are shown for
comparison and for subsequent use in economic analysis.

3. Production Costs
5.04      Average production costs for each grade in each mill are
presented in Annex 5-1. The summary presented in the following table shows
that in real terms, average production costs are somewhat lower than before
the project was implemented, but that because of the nonavailability of
domestic pulp, a considerable part of the anticipated reduction in
operating costs has been off-set by the necessity to use more imported
pulp.
B. Financial Results
1. National
5.05     Annex 5-2, Tables 1 through 3, show historical figures and
projections of income, funds flow and balance sheets. National has never
been very sound financially, and the project cannot, of itself, change this
situation. So long as the company must buy pulp at full international
prices on world markets, and sell paper domestically at prices which are
fixed lower than international prices, it will not be profitable.  Even
based on anticipated new prices (para 5.03) which have been used in the
projections, the mill will continue to operate with moderate losses,
inadequate debt-service coverage and a current ratio of less than 1. The
situation has been exacerbated by the necessity for National to borrow
short-term (through an overdraft facility) to f:Lnance as much as 25% of the
project cost. The situation requires first, an infusion of capital to
allow the company to reduce its short-term debt and attendant high interest
costs, and second, a market-controlled pricing policy which would require
the company to compete with imports, but within a price structure which
adequately reflects changing costs. The situation could also be markedly
improved if National had a reasonably-sized pulping line, and could reduce
its reliance on imported pulp.



- 15 -
2. Rakta
5.06      Annex 5-3, Tables 1 through 3, contains projections of income,
funds flow and balance sheets for Rakta. The company, which had been
operating more-or-less under break-even conditions for the past several
years, made a profit of LE4.5 million on sales of LE66 million in 1985/86,
the first year in which significant additional output was obtained as a
result of the project. Similar results are projected for the current year,
1986/87. Costs are projected to rise rather sharply in subsequent years,
but the anticipated price increases will more than offset these higher
costs and the company should remain profitable in the future.
5.07      Because of a relatively high level of accounts payable, and low
receivables, the company has been operating consistently with a current
ratio of less than 1, despite a covenant in the loan agreement that a
minimum ratio of 1.2 would be maintained. The ratio of debt:equity peaked
at 66:34 in 1984/85, (compared with 57:43 projected at appraisal), but has
subsequently dropped and will continue to decline. Debt-service coverage
has remained satisfactory through the period of project implementation.
5.08      Although to a lesser extent than National, Rakta's financial
position is primarily determined by the relationship between the prices of
its products, which are administered by the Government, and the cost of its
raw materials, many of which are imported. Provided the relationship
continues as at present, the financial future of the company appears to be
secure.
C. Financial Rate of Return
5.09      Streams of project costs and benefits at financial prices are
shown for National in Annex 5-4, and for Rakta in Annex 5-5. The
calculated rates of return compared with the base-case estimates at the
time of appraisal are tabulated below.
National and Rakta
Financial Rates of Return
(percent)
Projected at      Current
Appraisal     Estimate
National             20              6
Rakta                23             15
5.10       The rates are significantly lower than appraisal estimates.
Among the reasons for this are higher capital costs, delays in project
implementation, and increases in production costs. Although price
increases have compensated for some of these factors, the adjustments have
been inadequate, particularly in the case of National.



- 16 -
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      Financial costs and benefits have been adjusted to economic
values by (i) removing customs duties from the capital costs; (ii)
increasing energy costs to comparable international levels; (iii) adjusting
the price of all tradeable inputs to border values, using an exchange rate
of LE 2 per US$; (iv) and adjusting product prices to border values (para
5.03) at the same exchange rates. Cost and benefit streams adjusted in
this way are presented in Annexes 6-1 and 6-2 for National and Rakta
respectively. Economic rates of return are compared with the appraisal
estimates below.
National and Rakta
Economic Rates of Return
(percent)
Projected at      Current
Appraisal      Estimate
National             20             15
Rakta                32             17
6.02      Once again the rates are lower than at appraisal (because of
capital cost overruns, extended implementation (at: National) and the
reduced availability of lower cost domestic pulps., However the results are
satisfactory, and for National, provide confirmation that removing
distortions in the structure of costs and prices would allow a significant
portion of the anticipated project benefits to be realized.
VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Through its Imports Project, and subsequently through project
preparation, the Bank provided active encouragement for the Egypt Pulp and
Paper Project. During implementation, when it became clear that the local
management staff at National were not capable of keeping implementation
activities going at a reasonable pace, the Bank insisted that a competent
foreign engineering company be appointed to supplement the local project
staff. Because of these close involvements, the Bank must share some of
the responsibility for the problems which have emetrged during
implementation and start-up of the project, as well as any credit for the
extent to which the project has succeeded. It is thus important to try to
identify the specific reasons for some of the morie important problems which
have developed during project implementation so that they may be avoided in
the future.
7.02      First, as has occurred in a number of other Bank projects, the
local costs were seriously underestimated. This may partly have been due
to an overvalued currency (the consultants estimated local costs in dollar
terms, and converting to pounds at the then prevailing exchange rate would
give low estimates). Other contributing factors include the low efficiency
of the domestic contractors for civil works and erection, and the much



-17 -
greater requirement for (and availability of) domestic equipment than had
been anticipated. More careful analysis during appraisal could have
provided more information about this situation and more realistic estimates
could have been made.
7.03      Second, the effect of different management strengths in the two
companies was not adequately addressed in designing the appropriate
mechanisms for project implementation. The situation was recognized at
appraisal, and provision was made for additional engineering and technical
assistance at National. However without adequate guidance from the top
management in the company, implementation was very much delayed and only
the belated insistence by the Bank that further and specific outside
assistance be retained saved the project from even more serious delays.
7.04      Finally, and perhaps most importantly, to a significant extent
the success of the project and of sustained operations at both Rakta and
National depended on the success of ongoing efforts to expand domestic pulp
production and these proved less than adequate. The assumptions concerning
expanded domestic pulp supply should have been more carefully evaluated at
the time of appraisal. If the inadequacies had been identified, the
project design could have been modified to address this critical issue.

Uith the current shortage of domestic pulp and waste paper,and the current relaetionship
between inported pulp and Egyptian paper prices, production at these rates nay riot be
financially sensible.

Re, your letter dated, MARCH 3, I988
Dear Sir,       Our tlx dated,April 12, I988 .
I have recived your letter of March 3,1988 with which is enclosed the
PCR about Egypt Pulp and Paper Project loan 1849 EGT.
I joined the National Paper'Company as a chairman starting Nov.1987
I went through the POR;realy it is giving a true evaluation for the
project
If we take the statement ( The main objective of the loan was to help
reduce the cost of importing paper and paperboard into Egypt by financing
improvements to the country's two largest pulp and paper mill),in the pre-
face of the report, we can guide that the best way was to install) chemi-
cal pulp unit at National Paper Factories to minimize bleached short fiber
imports a case which did not happen .
Our critical situation now at National is that we depend on imported
pulp which you know is very expensive

The other alternative to import waste paper is also with the same
dificulty , it is not available and too expensive.
You can see that for this reason beside the other reasons mentioned
in the report National Paper Company is facing major problems
