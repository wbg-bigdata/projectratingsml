MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION 3F THE  ESENT
OF   INTRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSMRUCTION AND DVOPM13NT
TOIY)TE EXFCtJTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSE LOAN TO THIE RSPUBLC OF PERU
POR A TRANSPORT IIEHABAIIATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following  mrandum anid ecom ation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$150 million to help finance a Trnsport Rehabilitation
Project. ITe loan would be at the Bank's standad variale rate, with a matuty of 20 years, including
5 years of grace.
2.    Ba      ud.  Peru's tmsport infiaruce ficed virtual collapse m the late 1980s due to
prolonged   ect of maitenance and rebabilitation. Ths resuted m high transport costs and serious
botdenecks in the  asport sytem. When Peru launched its sweeping economic stabilization and
strcul adjustmat program in 1991, it ws clearly recognized that removig transport botlenecks and
improving transport efficiency were crucial in susning the economic reorms program.  The
Government has undertakn a program of emergency repas  and phased rebabilitaion of transport
inastructue, and has initiaed sound and pragmatic policy refrms; however, additnal steps are needed
to consolidate the reform, stregthen institutions, and improve ransport infr cture and srvices.
3.    Th rtation of adequae transpor capacity, pariadacly for the road system, and the rebuilding
of deicient sector instuions wil require sustained effort. The proposed Trasport Rehabilittion Project
is an imortat step owards completing the phased resoraton program for the tansport sector.
4.    Rationae for Bank JIvolvemeaL In March 1993, Peru successfully completed a debt workout
program and deared its arrears with the Bank and the IMF. ITis allowed a resumption of lending, based
on the Baks country assistance struegy for Peru which was discussed by the Board on April 20, 1993,
together with the $250 million Privatzation Adjustnt Loan. Ihe ste  has four main objectives:
(i to susin stabilization and consoldate stuctua refrms; () to foster private sector development and
public sector reform; (Iii) to alleviate povety and promote human resource development; and (iv) to
rehabilitate key infrastrucue  and rdorm reated policies.         instonal capaiy is
funda_mW to all four strategic objectives. This project will, in padcular, assist the Govenment in
addreing the core iuure defciencies  rough rehabiliaion compoentsin the roads, railway,
and arport subsecrs.   e project also supot policy refrms ftough pvatto of trst sector
enities and sre  ng of the restuctured public sector agencies remaining after pritizatoL Ihe
proposed project would be one of the first investment loans to Peru since 1986.
5.    Project Objecives. The project aims to address urgent transport  auume needs critical to
renewed economic and socid developmeLt.  The transport finstuu  is in various stages of
disintegation due to neglect over the last 10 yeas and requires a large amount of immediat iements
to reduce the bacldog. Overstaffing, a common feature of many public sector agencies, has been
drastically reduced following a deliberate government policy to reduce the size of the civil service as well
as liquidtion or sale of state-owned enterprises to the priva sector. Some govrenmnte agencs are now
baely able to conduct day-t-da operaions becuse of a death of capable staff. Bank support is
necessary to rebuild and strenghe institutonal capabilities of core transport agencies so that they can



-2-
effectively utilize the large infusion of financial resources needed for the restoration of transport
infrastructe and services. The project wil also lay the ground work for future projects, focussing on
strengtiened road management, increased private secoor participation in the transport sector, and
improved mobility of the poor.
6.    Project Dlcriptl. The proposed project consists of five components: (a) road rehablUtaton
and malmnance, including (i) rehabilitation of six roads totalling 725 kn, which are vital connections
betwee the agricult  areas of central Peru and the coast; (ii) a bridge program involving the
acquisition and recovery of Bailey bridges and the reconstruction of derelict old bridges; (iii) a pilot
mai_tenam program focussing on 620 km of road in a specified corridor; (iv) a traffic safety program;
and (v) support to govement effots to rebuild an institutional stncture capable of maintig the road
system; (b) rllry prMivzadon nd rehbltaon which aims to ensure early privatization of the
railways by (i) reducing staff redundancy; (Ji) rationalizing railway debt; (iii) closing down or receiving
budgetary trasfes from Government for unprofitable services; and (ho) urgent rehabilitation to keep the
railway in operatig condition while the privatztion process is underway; (c) runway rehabiation at
Lima aipon which is in urgent need of repair, before it becomes a danger to domestic and intermational
aviation; (d) a plot project for non-motod  tranport in lma which will test methods of promoting
the use of bicycles among low-icome residents; and (e) techiel assiance and rainng whih aims to
(f) strengthen the institudonal capacity for managing roads and bndges, and support the creaion and
fering of an autonomous agency responsible for planning, operating, financing, and admitering the
highway network; (i) build capacity in MTCC to manage environmental issues; and (iii) assist the railway
in its privaization and imroving its management.
7.    Ihe totl project cost i8 estmated at US$242 million (including taxes), of which US$43.6 are
physcl and price contingencies. The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at US$98
million (41 percen). The Bank, through this loan, wil finance US$150 million, Germany will fiance
US$38 million for road rehabilitation, while the Governmens contribution will be US$54 million The
project will complement a US$210 million loan approved by the Inter-American Development Bank in
Januar 1992 for a Highway Repair and Maitenance Project. A breakdoin of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement  d disbseme, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A tinetable of key project processing events and the
Status of Bank Group Operations im Peru are given in Schedles C and D, respectively. Two maps,
showing the national tranwsport system and the Lima bicycle componen, are also attaced. The Staf
Appraisal Report No. 12309-PE, dated February 17, 1994 is being distributed separately.
8.    Ieo  Lamed from Past Bank Projects. The design of the Transport Rehabilitation Project
reflects lessons learned from the Bank's itenional experience in the transport sector as well as from
the prewious transport projects in Peru. KeW lessons include the need to: (1) set up an efficient project
maagement and coordinating unit usig local profssionas engaged under private sector terms to ensure
timely impleion and adeque monitoring of the project; and (ii) increase the Bank's cost sharing
percentages on key compnen  such as project design, supervision, and monitoring in order to ensure
that lack of matching funds does not affect the implementtion of these cri  elements.
9.    Projec  I                 The Ministry of Transport, Communications, Housing and
Constucon (MTCC) will have overall responsibiity for project coordination, and will also be the
implemeing agency for more ta three-qarters of project investments (rebabilitation and maintnane
of roads, runway rehabilitation at Lima airport, and for a large part of the technicd assiste and
tring cmpoe). The railway componen will be implemened by the national railway compan



-3-
IIAFER) and the pilot non-motorized transport project will be implemented by the Municipality of
M topolitan Lima (MLM). All project activities will be coordinated by the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) reporting to MTCC. The PCU is incorporated into a "Special Project" under govermnt
procedur  ensring operional autonomy and private sector employment practices.
10.   Project          .   Efftive   n         is key to the sustainabiity of infastructure
rehabiitation orks. During project prepaion, Goverment has taken de   action to reorganize and
stengte road maintenance atd to accelerat the retrcring of the railway compay. In addition, the
project futer supports fUture maintae tbrough (a) a pilot road mantnac program, (b) studies on
road adminstration and finance, and on airport maintenance, (c) technical assistance to the road
agency in MTCC, and (d) a qunified condition that sufficient road maintece funds be
included in the government budget.
11.   Agred Asfifns Prior to negotiations, the Goverment confirmed that' (a) coutrpat funding
will be made available for this project, (b) sufficient resources will be provided for routine maince
of the entire nadona road network, and (c) it wil continue the policy of taxing road users at least he
amount spent on road mainnce. Moreover, MTCC (d) formally established the Project Coordination
Unit (PCM) and appointed its Diector; (e) established a unit responsible for environment aspects of the
tansport sector; and (i) assisted the ENAFER Privatization Commiee in defining a privatizaon scheme
and in establishing a saegy which mntans the railway operational durmg the transitional phase. The
Goverment also submited a detailed schedule on the staffing of the PCU. During the negotiations,
agreem   was reached on the following:
A. Meet M
(a)    The afrangemen for project implenion, including the functions of the PCu, the
stafing reqired for the adequate implemenion of railway and NMT componens, and
the fctions and adequate stafling of the transport-envionmentl office in MTCC.
(b)   Observance of the Environmental Mamnu for Road Designers and Contractors will be
stipulated in all bidding ard contract documes let under the road componem of the
project.
(c)    Key indicators and targets for monitonng project performance and achievement of project
objectives.
(d)    Annual reviews will be carried out to assess progress; representatives of cofinancing
agencies will be invited to participate in the annual reviews.
(e)    A mid-term project review will be carried out no later than 30 months after loan
approval, involving the Bank and the relevant Government and cofinancing agencies, to:
fi) assess the overall progress made in project implementation with respect to the
monitoring indicators mentioned above; and (ii) consider proposals for restructuring or
reorienting the project, responding to relevant sector and project issues, and taking
account of agreed action plans for policy and/or instutional reforms.

(i)    An annual allocation of not less than US$50 million equivalent, to be agreed by October
31 each year, will be made in the budget for the maintnance of aional roads other tlmn
those covered direcdy under the project, dtese funds wil be released in a timely manner.
In addition, the Government confrmed the assurance given prior to loan negoations that
it will condmte its policy of levying road user charges in emess of road maintenance
(j)    ENAFER will ins        proper accunting practices and, stating with fis  yer 1994,
submit the auditor's report and audited finan    saments of its operations for each
year, within 6 months from the end of that year, audxited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank.
(k)   Establishment of a coordination committee in MTCC, hiring of consultants for
constcion supervision, and engagement of an independent expert to advise the Minister
or Vice-Mmister of Trsport are prereusites for signing a contract with a constuction
firm to rehablitate the runway at Lima's airport.
(a)    Ihe Govermnent will assume ENAFER's debt (including f#ture arrears pealties and
intre  due), clear ENAFER's arrears with utility companies, and provide the funds
needed for the staff restrucring program.
(m)   ENAFER will be divided into at least three operating companies.
(n)   ENAFER will not undertake any investments over US$5 million per year without the
prior agreement of the World Bank.
(o)    ENAFER will prepare, by December 31, 1994, a staff training program designed to

(r)    For railway works, equipment and maerials: (I) the Government will submit a timed
action plan acceptable to the Bank, to restructre and privatize ENAFER; (ii) the
Government and ENAFER will sign a subsidiay loan agreemen satisactory to the Bank,

(s)    For the NMT component: the Governen and MLM will sign a subsidiary loan
agreament satisfactory to the Bank.
(t)    For bicycles under subloans: the Lima Municipal Bank for Popular Credit (CMCPL) wiUl
issue operating  structions for its staff acceptable to the Bank.
12.      If roIel Impaet The project is rated B for environment assessment. It is not likely
to have scant adverse effects on the ewionment as it would ivolve prmariy m        and
rehabilitation operations, without major constuction of new infzaacre facilities. The use of an
Environmental Manual for Road Conaors and the establishment of a tranportt    ooffce
in MTCC reprsent a signifant advance in this area. Other positive e   Impacts would be
aciieved due to improved trafflic safety on the project roads. By enabling the railway to provide cost-
effcdve servie in  onm y  senstve areas, including the Cuzco-Machu Picchu conridor, the
project would contrain the growth of motor vehicles and the need to constuct highwys. The pilot NMT
progm  provi   specid emphasis on environmental improv     through n     ing  e use of
bicyles among the low-inoome popuation in Limt
13.   Poety Category. Not applicable.
14.   Poject Bef The main project benefit would be a more efildent and cost effective transport
system that wl stimulate ahigher level of economic activity in the country. The project would conine
to remove physical constait in trsport infrastrucue, reduce transport cost for goods and pasengers,
and would support exports, farm producion, and the mobility of people. t would help allte rural
poverty in the poorest areas of Peru, through provision of improved roads and emploVyment generation
through laborbased road works. The internal economic rate of return from the overall project is 27
percent, rangin between 22 and 39 peet  for the road rehabilitation schemes, 15 percent for the
railway rehabilitation, and 25 percent for the runway rehabilitation at Lima airport.
15.   Risks.  Possible risks include: (*) widquate provision of counterpart funids for project
implemeation; (ii) insuffcient budgetary resources for road mamce durig and ater the projet;
(1l) ineffective project management, especialy arising from a lack of intituonal capacity of the
implemenlting agencies; (Iv) insufflici nt absorptive capacity of the domesic construction industry; (v) lack
of sustained com ent in reorming the railway; and (vi) mishaps or inordinate dels in the high-
vislity aiport runway rehabilitation. Finally, the possibility of seurity risks for th contraco during
the xecution of the works cannot be discoued.



16.   Rcm n n  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
