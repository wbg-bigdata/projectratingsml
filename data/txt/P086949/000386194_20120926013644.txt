                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
Project restructuring is proposed for the Romania, Modernizing Agricultural Knowledge and
Information Systems Project (MAKIS), Loan no. 4758 RO to (i) drop two activities from
Component 2 and correspondingly, cancel €6.7 million from the loan, (ii) modify one intermediate
results indicator, and (iii) extend the current Closing Date by six months, from September 25, 2012
to March 25, 2013, resulting in a cumulative extension of 30 months from the original closing date
of September 30, 2010. This would be the third restructuring of the Project and in line with BP
13.30, seeks RVP approval given the cumulative extension exceeding 24 months beyond the
original closing date.

B. PROJECT STATUS
The Project was approved on November 16, 2004 and became effective on June 24, 2005.
Since February 2009, progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective has
been rated Moderately Satisfactory, and in June 2011, Implementation Progress was
upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory from a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory. In part,
the Moderately Satisfactory ratings are due to the risk that the original investment program
for rehabilitation of the national institutes for research and development in agriculture
under Component 2 would not be implemented on time. To date, most Project activities
have been completed and in some areas, Project results have exceeded initial expectations.
The Project was restructured two times. The first restructuring (level 1) was conducted in
September 2010 to (i) align the Project Development Objective (PDO) to more precisely
reflect the current post-accession EU integration challenges facing the Borrower; (ii)
discontinue the Food Safety Component 1 (whose unsatisfactory performance was a risk to
achievement of PDOs); (iii) revise Project activities; (iv) revise the Results Framework and
Monitoring; and (v) extend the Project closing date by 12 months to September 30, 2011.
In addition, an amount of €0.8 million was cancelled from the Loan and the Loan amount
became €40.6 million.
The second restructuring (level 2) was conducted in September 2011 to (i) extend the
current Closing Date by about 12 months, from September 30, 2011 to September 25, 2012;
(ii) cancel an amount of €3.5 million from the loan; and (iii) introduce required changes to
project costs and implementation schedule resulting from the restructuring.
The project has progressed since the second extension, albeit at a slower pace than expected
mainly because of the slow decision making process in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development (MARD) triggered by frequent changes of high-level management
(ministers and deputies). In addition, the continued financial crisis prevented the allocation
of sufficient budget funds to the Project in the first half of 2012, slowing down payments
and thus implementation of ongoing contracts and procurement of new contracts. However,
following budget adjustments, MARD has provided all funds required for completion of the
ongoing contracts.


                                                 1
The financial management arrangements are moderately satisfactory because of the
insufficient funds allocated to the project in the first half of 2012. All audits have been
prepared on time, with a clean audit opinion and no internal control issues mentioned.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
       Components
One change is proposed under Component 2 “Support for Agricultural Research?: to drop the
construction of a new insect-proof greenhouse at the National Research and Development
Institute for Potatoes and Sugar Beet (INCDCSZ) after two unsuccessful attempts to procure the
civil works. The other activities supported under Component 2 remain unchanged, and these
changes will not prevent the Project from achieving its PDO.

       Financing
             o Cancellation
As a result of the proposed changes to Component 2 above, it is proposed to cancel €6.7 million
from the loan, reducing the total component allocation from €18.97 million to €12.27. €6,700,000
would be cancelled from Category (5)(b). This change is reflected in the revised allocation of loan
funds by category of expenditure presented below (Table 1).

        Closing date
The team proposes an extension of the Closing Date from September 25, 2012 to March 25, 2013
to enable completion of the rehabilitation of the laboratory/institutes buildings under Component
2. The limited extension would enable the Borrower to complete the rehabilitation of selected
research institutes and procurement of essential IT equipment for the Agricultural Payment and
Intervention Agency (APIA). While these are important to achieving the PDO, more importantly,
the server procurement and installation for APIA is a core element of a reform action plan for the

                                                         4
Integrated Administration and Control System for EU CAP funds, and represents an activity in
support of an EC-GOR agreed action plan towards improving the administration of EU rural funds.
This critical procurement was completed but delivery and installation would not be completed
without an extension. At the same time, given insufficient time to initiate and complete new
activities (e.g procurement of new equipment for the institutes for research and development in
agriculture), despite the proposed closing date extension, the team will remind the Borrower that
the loan will finance only the good and services delivered and accepted, and works completed
before the closing date, while any such deliverables received after the closing date will remain to
be financed by the Borrower.

       Implementation schedule
The implementation schedule for rehabilitation of the national laboratories and institutes under
component 2 is proposed to be extended by six months to March 25, 2013. The Procurement Plan
has been revised to fit the new extended implementation schedule.



       Results Framework and Monitoring
One modification of the results framework is proposed to be change the final target of the
intermediate results indicator (for component 2) regarding the number of laboratories able to
carry out the required analyses for soils (for compliance with the nitrates and sludge EU directives)
and GMO testing. Because the construction of a new building and procurement of the required
equipment to establish the national reference laboratory for soil testing (to confirm compliance
with the EU directives on nitrates and sludge) at the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agro-
chemistry (RISSA) were dropped from the project, the target indicator cannot be met. Therefore,
only one national reference laboratory (for GMO testing) will be the target value for this indicator.
The indicators dropped at previous restructuring have been removed from the table.
All other indicators will remain unchanged.
The table of Results Framework and Monitoring is attached as Annex 1.
