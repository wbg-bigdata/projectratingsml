                         environmental impacts and contribute to a steady increase of the share of agri-food exports in the total Romania's exports to EU-member countries and not only.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured in September 2012 to (i) extend the closing date until March 25, 2013, (ii) cancel an amount of Euro 6.7 million from the Loan and (iii) slightly amend the
                         results framework and monitoring. The Government allocated sufficient funds for the ongoing contracts until the project's closing.
