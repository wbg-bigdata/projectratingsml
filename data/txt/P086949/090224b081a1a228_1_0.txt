                         The revised development objective of the project is to help Romania comply with the agricultural acquis communautaire and to help the agro-food sector take advantage
                         of the benefits and opportunities arising from EU membership.

                         meant to support Romania in meeting the requirements of the "acquis communautaire" have been implemented and the (revised) targets met. The project supported Romania's

                         New equipment was installed in two regional laboratories of the National Sanitary-Veterinary and Food Safety Agency (ANSVSA) to make them operate also as reference laboratories

                         for food safety control, while the establishment of the national network of phytosanitary control was supported through the equipment procured and installed in two national reference
                         laboratories and three regional laboratories, in line with the EU requirements. The Project also supported Romania in complying with the obligations regarding the monitoring of food
                         quality and movement of animals in and out of the EU through the construction and equipping three border inspection points located at the Otopeni International Airport and two on
                         Black Sea at Constanta. The Project also supported Romania in meeting the EU requirements with respect to the control of GMO production through the equipment installed at the
                         national reference laboratory (in Stefanesti). The compliance with the EU directives on nitrates and sludge management is controlled through the reference laboratory established at
                         the National Institute for Research and Development for Soil Science and Agro-chemistry Bucharest (RISSA) which benefited of equipment financed under the Project (and other
                         sources). Although not directly, the improved food safety and phytosanitary controls enforced with Project support contributed to the increase of Romania agri-food exports to EU
                         countries as the products complied with the EU market requirements.

                         The Project provided substantive support in reforming the activities for research and development (R&D) in agriculture through development of a new legal framework for agriculture
                         R&D, as well as development and implementation of reform programs in the four research institutes (National Research Institute for Animal Biology and Nutrition Balotesti - IBNA -,
                         National Agricultural Research and Development Institute Fundulea - NARDI -, National Research and Development Institute for Potato and Sugar Beet Brasov - NIRDPSB, and
                         RISSA mentioned above).

                         The Law on Agricultural Research (covering agriculture, forestry and agri-food industry) was a significant achievement in clarifying the official status the agricultural research and
                         development system in Romania as well as the relationship among the institutions comprised. It provided the conducive environment for reforming the entire system and enabled
                         development and implementation of reform programs system-wide.

                         The reform programs implemented in the four institutes selected for Project support contributed to their transformation into well-performing entities and, thus, to their certification
                         (following an evaluation process conducted by independent international experts) as top level research and development institutes in Romania in general and in agriculture in
                         particular (of the five agricultural R&D institutes certified, four benefited of project support). The investment program (including rehabilitation and modernization of critical buildings and
                         procurement of selected laboratory equipment) also contributed to enhancing the performance of the respective institutes. Following the reform of their research programs, the
                         institutes were able to develop new technologies, new varieties of plants, develop the staff skills and enlarge the networking (through training and study tours, most financed from the
                         Project) leveraging additional financial resources (e.g. European/international research grants). Over 30 new varieties of plants (cereals, potato, sugar beet, sunflower) more
                         resistant to adverse climate conditions (drought, rainstorms, late freeze, etc,) and specific diseases have been developed and tested; over 25 new technologies for bio-control of
                         insects, reduce use of pesticides and fertilizers new tillage practices for different agro-eco regions have been developed; codes for good agricultural practices, technologies for
                         remediation of lands polluted with heavy metals, oil and mining activities, nutrient management plans in Nitrate vulnerable zones have also been developed to contribute to
                         compliance with the Romanian and EU environment requirements. All of these have been subject to transfer to regular farming through transfer programs implemented by each
                         institute.

                         The CGS projects financed under the project generated positive economic, social and environmental impacts and contributed to a steady increase of the absorption of EU funds for

                         rural development. Many of these new technologies (89) have been disseminated to other farmers in the project areas contributing to improving of their practices and welfare. The
                         positive results achieved let to streamlining it into the Pillar II of the Common Agriculture Policy.

                         The project supported the increase of EU funds absorption also through the training and information activities implemented by the four Training and Information Centers established
                         in Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara and Iasi which provided dedicated training programs to over 2,040 extension staff, 460 food inspectors, 5,300 agro-processors, and 250 researchers.
                         Information of large interest on the access to EU financing under the Common Agricultural Policy was delivered to over 1.3 million farmers through the 11 information campaigns
                         implemented by the Project.
