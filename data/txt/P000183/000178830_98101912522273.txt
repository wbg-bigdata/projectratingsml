BURUNDI
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Structure on Transport
It.01     Burundi is a small landlocked country situated just south of the
equator in eastern Africa between Zaire and Tanzania on the northern tip of
Lake Tanganyika (see Map 1). It covers only 27,820 km and is about 1,400 km
from the Indian Ocean. The terrain is varied but is dominated by a hilly
central plateau giving way to marshy valleys in the north and east and a
Low-lying plain in the west. The climate is equatorial with sufficient
rainfall in most areas to support rainfed agriculture. The generally rugged
terrain of the country, the scattered settlement patterns as well as its
landlocked position have contributed to shaping its transport infrastructure.
1.02      With approximately 4 million inhabitants, growing at a rate which may
be as high as 2.7% p.a., Burundi 2s one of the most densely populated countries
in the world (142 persons per km ). Ninety-five percent of the population is
dispersed throughout the rural areas as small farmers who depend mainly on
subsistence farming and on one principal cash crop, coffee, which provides
the major source of foreign exchange for the country. Almost half the -
population is concentrated in the Bujumbura-Ngozi-'Muyinga-Gitega area which
produces most of the country's roughly 20,000 tons of coffee. Although there
is scope to diversify agriculture and to increase agricultural production,
the type of terrain and the settlement pattern preclude any significant
change in the short and medium term, so that coffee will remain the country's
main export for some time to come.
1.03      GNP per capita, estimated at US$180 in 1979, is among the world's
lowest. GDP increased at about 4.8% from 1975 to 1979, but growth in the
agricultural sector was much slower (2.5%) than growth in the industrial,
construction and service sectors (9.8%). Mining and industrial activity is
very limited (about 10% of GDP), although a nickel exploitation project
using the country's peat resources as fuel is being studied. Burundi's
export earnings are insufficient to cover the foreign exchange requirements
of the economy and have to be supplemented by substantial external aid
flows.
External Transport
1.04      Burundi's trading partners are primarily the industrial countries
and to a much lesser extent its neighbors. Although the country's external
trade has grown quite rapidly in recent years, it is still comparatively
small, and during 1976-78 imports averaged 109,000 tons p.a. while exports
(mainly coffee) averaged 27,000 tons p.a. The marked imbalance between import
and export flows is made worse from the point of view of transport by the



-2-
highly seasonal nature of coffee exports. External trade is expected to grow
at about 4.5% p.a., with volume remaining low and trade flows unbalanced. In
the longer term, however, should a nickel mining project be brought on stream,
traffic flows would increase substantially and the imbalance between import
and export flows would be reduced.
1.05      For its external trade, Burundi is crucially dependent on transport
through neighboring countries to Indian Ocean ports. Two main transport
corridors are now used: the northern all road or road/rail route via Kigali/
Kampala to Mombasa (1,740 km by road or 1,925 km by road/rail); and the
southern lake/rail connection via Bujumbura and Kigoma to Dar es Salaam (1,428
km) (Map 1). The southern route is the more economical and has tradition-
ally carried most of Burundi's traffic (some 78% in 1977). However, because
of capacity problems and bottlenecks on the Tanzanian Railways and at the Port
of Dar es Salaam, the bulk of Burundi's oil imports now comes from Nairobi, and
a greater proportion of general cargo imports is also being routed through
Mombasa. But even the northern route has its problems. Efficient operations
are constrained by cumbersome administrative procedures. The situation in
Uganda has also created difficulties. For example, in 1979 Burundi suffered
from the disruptive effects of the closing of the Uganda border during the
hostilities in that country. As an alternative to the existing routes,
another road/rail route connecting north-eastern Burundi to the railhead at
Isaka in Tanzania is now being developed, and paving of various road sections
of this route is either underway or planned. The proposed project would
assist in this development by helping to finance construction of one section
of the road link (para. 3.03).
1.06      The bottlenecks on the external access routes serving Burundi
have increased both the time and cost of transport, but Burundi itself cannot
appreciably improve the efficiency of either route since (a) only a small
portion of the transport facilities are within Burundi's control; and (b) the
volume of Burundi's traffic is quite low in both absolute terms and relative
to the total traffic using the same routes, so that Burundi has very little
leverage over transport decisions made by the transit countries. Burundi has,
however, attempted to improve transport on the northern route by constructing
a paved road to the Rwandese border and by expanding its vehicle fleet for
road transport; on the southern route, it is considering improvements to
Bujumbura Port and modernization of lake transport facilities. In order to
further assist Burundi as well as Rwanda in assessing the relative advantages
of existing and potential external transport routes and in identifying the
actions and investments required to improve the efficiency of these routes,
the Bank Group prepared a study on the external transport connections of the
two landlocked countries. 1/ The conclusions of the study were that: (a) the
two existing surface routes now serving Rwanda and Burundi will continue to
offer these countries the least-cost access to Indian Ocean ports, at least in
the medium term; and (b) transport on these routes would be markedly improved
by a number of measures (e.g., simplified customs and border regulations)
and by projects which either have recently begun or are about to begin. The
Governments of Rwanda and Burundi as well as some of the transit countries
khave reviewed the report a-m a sssed its ViniLngs wiLth the Saw& Gtop-  P
more extensive study, to be completed in early 1981, is also being carried out
by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the
1/ "A Report on the International Transportation Bottlenecks Affecting
Rwanda and Burundi," December 1980, No. 3224-EAF.

international transport connections of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and eastern
Zaire. These studies should assist the countries involved and the donor
agencies to agree on a plan of action and priority investments for the medium
and longer term. The parties involved are considering holding a conference
under the auspices of UNCTAD to follow up on the recommendations of these
studies.
B. The Transport System
1.07      Burundi's transport infrastructure is limited to a network of
5,500 km of roads and tracks; Bujumbura Port on Lake Tanganyika; and an
international airport at Bujumbura. There are no railways or navigable
rivers. Internal transport is therefore entirely dependent on the highway
network which is discussed in more detail in Chapter II.
Lake Transport
1.08      Lake transport links Bujumbura to ports in Tanzania, Zaire and
Zambia. Transport operations are handled by ARNOLAC, a private company in
wlich Government is an important shareholder. The fleet, consisting of three
self-propelled barges and eight tow barges, is old and unsuited to modern
transport and handling methods. Although Government-set tariffs would not be
sufficient to cover major overhauls or replacement of the fleet, Government is
nevertheless considering investments in new barges to prevent any possible
loss of capacity or higher costs on the external transport route to Dar es
Salaam. The transport planning expert to be provided under the proposed
project (para. 3.17) will develop a clear policy to promote efficient lake
transport operations.
]..09     Fixed installations at Bujumbura Port are state-owned, while the
lhandling facilities and most of the warehouses are privately owned by the
"Fxploitation du Port de Bujumbura," which Government will gradually take over
by 1997. The port's fixed installations have an estimated capacity of 300,000
to 400,000 tons p.a. and are more than adequate for current (about 150,000
tons p.a.) and projected traffic levels. For the immediate future, the port
quays are scheduled to be resurfaced with financing from Government, and
improvement of the container-handling capacity and the installation of a
ship-repairing capacity are now being studied. In view of the proposed
transfer of port operations from private to public ownership and the past
poor performance of public sector companies, there is a risk that port opera-
tions will deteriorate during the transfer period and thereafter. The Govern-
ment is aware of the weaknesses in the public sector companies and requested
Bank assistance to help it design and carry out the necessary reforms. With
support provided under the Second Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 917-BU),
work has begun on preparing reforms affecting the public sector companies.
In view of the importance of the port of Bujumbura for the country's external
transport, it is expected that the formulation of a suitable institutional
and operational framework for the port will be addressed on a priority basis
in the following stages of the program for reform.
Air Transport
1.10      Buztndi has an international airport located near Bujumbura, c.apwble
of handling aircraft of the B-707 and B-727 type. Another small airport
serves Gitega but does not provide scheduled flights. Bujumbura airport is



-4-
equipped for 24-hour operations, and provides service to Europe and the
capitals of neighboring African countries. Passenger traffic amounts to some
15,000 to 20,000 arrivals and departures per year. Freight traffic increased
sharply from about 500 tons p.a. during 1974-77 to 3,200 tons in 1979, but in
absolute terms the volume remains small. Air Burundi, the national airline
company, operates flights to Nairobi via Kigali and to Kigoma and Bukavu.
1.11      In view of the small size of the country, air transport primarily
serves Burundi's external transport needs, and in times of crisis offers the
only alternative to the two dominant surface routes. In mid-1979, for example,
Government organized a.special.airlift for much of its essential imports,
which were caught in a.severe backlog of freight at Dar es Salaam Port. The
Government plans to expand the airport's storage and handling facilities and
to strengthen the runways in order to receive the much heavier wide-bodied
aircraft and to handle increased traffic over the coming years. The report
on the international transportation problems of Rwanda and Burundi (para.
1.06) concluded that an all-air route to Europe would be economical for
only a small proportion of Burundi's total traffic, so that the planned
investments in air transport infrastructure might be questionable from a
strictly economic point of view. The expanded facilities are, however, in
line with Government's policy of developing alternative external transport
connections in order to reduce dependence on the existing routes (para. 1.13).
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.12      Three ministries have responsibilities in the transport sector:  (a)
the Ministry of Public Works (Ministere des Travaux Publics, de l'Equipement
et du Logement - MTP) for roads; (b) the Ministry of Transport and Communica-
tions (Ministere des Transports, Postes et Telecommunications - MTPT) for the
other modes and for transport operations; and (c) the Ministry of Planning
(Ministere du Plan), the central planning body responsible for the coordination
of all investments. The Ministries of Public Works and Transport have in the
past been closely involved in the preparation of transport sector policies and
planning, but neither Ministry has a formal planning unit. Overall planning
responsibility is vested with the Ministry of Planning which also coordinates
all external financing. The Ministry is currently being helped in overall
planning activities by a technical assistance team provided under the Second
Technical Assistance Credit; however, no transport planner was included in
the team.
1.13      The current Third National Plan (1978-82) was based more firmly on
economic criteria and on extensive cooperation between the Ministry of
Planning and the technical ministries than were the previous plans. The Plan
has two particular socioeconomic goals: (a) the reduction of the economy's
dependence on coffee production by diversifying the agricultural sector and
developing mining and industry; and (b) the decentralization of economic and
social activity away from Bujumbura by promoting the development of regional
economic centetrs. U3nderlying these obojectives are the counttxy's lanilocked
'positio-l  a-nd its  natated  exort-ipoQtttXows. Ovear alA, GovexnmTert' s
transport investments and policies respond to the objecti-ves of the five-year
plan and generally to the needs of the economy by aiming at:  (a) improving



-5
the existing internal road network to support the productive sectors and to
facilitate decentralization; (b) improving alternative external connections
to reduce the country-s dependence on the unreliable lake/rail connection to
Dar es Salaam; and (c) building up a road transport industry for domestic and
international transport.
1.14      Under the current five-year plan, US$103 million in constant 1976
prices (25% of the public sector investment program) was allocated during the
1978-82 period for improvement of the road infrastructure, and another US$31
million was earmarked for road, lake and air transport operations (see Table
1.1). In line with the Government-s aim to improve road connections, the plan
placed strong emphasis on road paving--some 550 km over the five-year period.

1.15      Implementation of the transport plan is dependent on the availability
of external financing. The Government has, however, been able to obtain
financing for most of the road infrastructure investments. Implementation is
progressing relatively well although delays and cost increases have inevitably
occurred, to a large extent due to the disruption in international transport
ito and from Burundi during 1979.
L.16      Investments in transport operations have thus far been directed
toward road transport through the creation in January 1978 of a semi-public
International Transport Company (INTRACO) for road transport to and from
Mombasa to help reduce Burundi's dependence on the transport route through
Tanzania. A parastatal domestic transport company, Office des Transports du
Burundi (OTRABU), was also established in May 1978. The Bank Group assisted
INTRACO under an Industrial Development Finance Credit (Cr. 731-BU, US$3.4
million, 1978), which provided funds to purchase trucks. Both companies
expanded their vehicle fleets rapidly and experienced difficulties in running
their operations and in covering operating expenses from revenues. INTRACO
became insolvent in late 1980 due to difficulties with transit through Uganda
and weak management. The Government decided to liquidate the company and
established a new international transport division within OTRABU which acquired
part of INTRACO's assets.



-6-
1.17      Although Government's limited transport planning and coordination
capacity and arrangements were largely adequate in the past, serious planning
questions and policy issues are beginning to arise with regard to the external
supply and evacuation routes as well as the development of the domestic road
infrastructure. Disruptions of flow on the external routes have demonstrated
the need for a capacity to formulate policies for the development and utiliza-
tion of existing and potential routes to gain relatively secure access to
export markets and import sources at minimum cost. As regards further develop-
ment of the road infrastructure, the current road investment program will
provide the country with a basic network of national and interregional roads.
Thereafter, road investments should be carefully prepared with a view to the
hierarchy of different road sections in the network, the timing and level of
proposed improvements, and the network implications. Furthermore, programs
developed on this basis should be periodically updated. Responding to these
needs, the Government has requested technical assistance under the proposed
project to establish a planning capability for the transport sector within the
MTPT and for the highway subsector at the MTP (para. 3.17). During negotia-
tions agreement was reached with Government that by March 31, 1982 planning
units will be created within these two-ministries (para. 5.01 (a)).
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Highways Subsector
1.18      The Association's two previous road projects in Burundi have assisted
Government in training Roads Department staff, in.stitution building parti-
cularly for maintenance activities, and improving the road network. The
Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 467-BU, US$5.0 million, 1974) had its
origin in a 1970 engineering credit (Sll-BU) which financed consultants to
carry out a study of Burundi's highway maintenance needs. The project helped
finance the preparation and implementation of a four-year maintenance program,
including the establishment of a manual road maintenance organization and one
mechanized maintenance brigade, and the provision of technical assistance for
these activities and for the training of local staff. The project also
included studies for future highway development which was carried out under
the Second Highway Project. The Maintenance Project, completed in September
1980, significantly improved the manual road maintenance organization. The
project's objectives in mechanical maintenance and technical assistance were
satisfactorily achieved to the extent that the project initiated actions in
these areas. Support for these activities was continued in the Second Highway
Project and results will be consolidated under the proposed project. The
Maintenance Project also provided an impetus to the Government to allocate
adequate funds for maintenance. A project completion report for this project
is being prepared.
1.19      The Second Highway Project (Credit 773-BU, US$14 million, 1978)
provided for the paving of a major national road, Bujumbura-Rugombo (65 km),
(    the start-up phase of an improvement program for selected secondary roads and
bridges, the construction of a new central laboratory, strengthening of the
mec.kianizec maintenance brigade and tne provision ot tecbnical assistance
and equipment for the ongoing maintenance program. The quality of the road
construction works is good, but progress has been seriously affected by the



-7-
disruption in international transport through neighboring countries in 1979
(para. 1.11) which caused a six-month halt in construction. Final costs are
expected to be 50% higher than estimated. The maintenance and technical
asEsistance components are generally meeting their institution-building objec-
tives; however, due to a lack of local counterparts and problems in retaining
local staff in service once they are trained, it has not beea possible to
reduce technical assistance as expected. Measures to avoid the latter problem
will be taken under the proposed project (para. 3.13). Government's compliance
with major covenants agreed under the previous Credits is satisfactory (Annex
1).
1.20      As mentioned in para. 1.16, the Government's goal of diversifying
its supply routes was also assisted with funds made available under an
Industrial Development Finance Credit, part of which was onlent to INTRACO
which was established as an international trucking company.
1b21      Finally, Burundi's problems with supply and evacuation routes were
the subject of a Bank Group study (para. 1.06). It is expected that the
recommendations of the study on measures to eliminate transport constraints
and its analysis of the relative costs and advantages of the various access
routes should assist future donors in identifying uwat assistance is needed.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01      The classified road network totals about 3,000 km (Table 2.1),
of which 280 km (9.5%) are paved, and 90 km are of engineered low gravel
standard; the rest are earth roads and tracks. In addition, there are about
2,500 km of unclassified earth tracks. Some 160 km of paved roads are under
construction, and detailed engineering has been 2completed or is under way for
another 400 km. Road density is about 200 m/km or 1.4 km per 1,000 inhabit-
ants, the latter being below the average for East African countries.

2.02      The network is adequate in length for the country's current needs,
but its condition is not satisfactory. The network consists mainly of
unengineered earth roads and tracks which have a poor alignment and are
narrow, with widths ranging from 4 to 7 m. Due to the country's difficult
terrain and heavy rains, maintenance costs are high. Better engineered roads
and the paving of steeply graded road sections are therefore required to
prevent maintenance costs and/or vehicle operating costs from rising exces-
sively. In addition, the network is dependent on a large number of small
bridges, many of which are in very poor condition. These problems are cur-
rently being addressed under a road improvement and bridge replacement
progtam, which was initiated under the Second Highway Project.with financing
from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and IDA. The program would be
continued under the proposed project (paras. 3.07 and 3.13).
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.03      Traffic volumes are light throughout the country.  In 1976 only 10%
of the entire 5,500 km road network carried more than 50 vehicles per day
(vpd). The highest traffic levels (150 vpd and above) are found on the
principal roads radiating from Bujumbura. Since detailed countrywide counts
were taken in 1976 as part of the highway development study under the Highway
Maintenance Project, only a few selective traffic counts have been carried
out, mostly for road feasibility studies. One of the major tasks of the
planning unit to be created in MTP (para. 1.17) will be to introduce system-
atic traffic counts.
2.04      The composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is shown in Table
2.2. In 1978, the fleet totalled about 10,150 (of which some 1,400 were in the
public sector) or 2.5 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants. The private vehicle
fleet includes about 5,300 passenger cars, mainly in Bujumbura, 1,900 pickups,
925 trucks and 95 buses, with the balance made up of four-wheel drive vehicles,
station wagons and trailers. Over the period 1974-78, the growth in pickups
and trucks has been. fastet than. tn. te ethexr vwicle catego-izres (L 5.5°. and

2.05      During 1974-78 fuel consumption increased at a rate of 6.6% for
gasoline and 8.7% for diesel fuel (see Table 2.3). The cost of fuel per liter
in mid-1980 was FBu 75.6 (US$0.84) for premium gasoline, FBu 71.2 (US$0.79)
for regular gasoline and FBu 67.2-(US$0.75) for diesel; this includes taxes of
FBu 8.2 (US$0.09) for gasoline and FBu 6.4 (US$0.07) for diesel.

Road Transport
2.06      Burundi's road transport industry is dominated by a large number
of trader/truckers owning one vehicle and mainly engaged in trading rather
than trucking. The number of operators engaged principally in transport



- 10 -
and owning more than one vehicle is estimated to be very small although exact
data are not available. OTRABU, which was created in 1978 for passenger
transport, acquired 15 trucks for domestic goods transport in 1979 and plans
to expand activities further in this area. For the time being, however, in
view of its rapid growth and its need to consolidate its domestic transport
operations and strengthen its financial situation, OTRABU should not expand.
Furthermore, because the demand for domestic transport is scattered in small
pockets over the country and is highly seasonal, the continued use of trader/
truckers who normally have substantial spare transport capacity is probably
the most flexible and cost effective arrangement.
2.07      International road transport services are provided by a few small,
privately owned companies and, until recently, by the Government-owned
trucking company, INTRACO, which has been taken over by OTRABU. Despite
Burundi's recent expansion in the field, truckers from the transit countries
dominate international road transport operations. In view of the small share
of Burundi truckers involved in these operations (about 20%), in the medium
and long term there is scope for increasing Burundi's international trucking
fleet, subject to agreement with the transit countries, with the aim of
sharing more equally the transport volume.
2.08      Passenger transport is also mainly undertaken by traders owning
pickups, light and heavy trucks and mini-buses, usually carrying mixed loads
of goods and passengers. Although OTRABU operates some 40 buses for passenger
transport services in the cities of Bujumbura and Gitega and between the
regional centers, it is expected that the mixed transport by traders, which
offers considerable flexibility and helps to increase capacity utilization of
the vehicle fleet, will continue to take a major share of total passenger
transport for some time to come.
2.09      The only conditions for entry into the road transport industry are
registration at the trade register and possession of a trader's license.
For passenger transport, inspection of the vehicle by the vehicle inspection
administration is also required. Transport routes are not regulated, and
competition appears to be stronger on improved roads where transport flows are
higher. It is therefore expected that road upgrading will contribute to
increasing competition in transport operations. Although tariffs for goods
transport are decreed on a uniform basis by Government 1/, the regulations do
not provide sanctions for non-compliance, and actual prices agreed between
operators and shippers can differ from the official rates according to supply
and demand and road conditions for a particular route. Government is beginning
to recognize that the setting of uniform tariffs, even if they could be
enforced, would not achieve its principal objective - to help the rural areas
by lowering their transport costs, and that road improvements are a much more
1/   In April 1980 the uniform rate for transport within the country was
increased from FBu 15/ton/km of capacity offered to FBu 22 ton/km.
The uniform tariffs per km for transport in Bujumbura and around
'Jumkoata veme also sim-i.ari.y increased.



- 11 -
effective instrument for that objective. It is likely therefore that uniform
tariff setting will be abandoned and replaced by a more appropriate system of
maximum and minimum tariffs. The transport economist to be provided to MTPT
will look into this and make suitable recommendations.
Vehicle Regulations
2.10      Because trucks tend to be small (para. 2.04), there are currently
no problems with overloaded vehicles causing damage to the road network
except on the Bujumbura-Kigali road (RN1). MTP therefore plans to build a
weighing station on the road at the Rwandese border in 1981.
Road User Revenue
2.11      Road users contribute to Government revenues through import duties
and taxes on vehicles, spare parts, and lubricants, through registration
and licensing fees, and a special surtax on fuel (Table 2.4). Duties on
vehicles range from 10% for buses and trucks up to 25% for high value cars.
Total revenues collected in 1978 are estimated to have amounted to some US$3.8
million equivalent. Since expenditures for road administration and maintenance
amounted to about US$2.3 million in 1978 and to US$3.3 million in 1979, road
user revenues covered maintenance expenditures and also made a small contribu-
tion to budgetary expenditures on road construction and on urban roads.

2.12      The special surtax on gasoline and diesel fuel was introduced in
1969 to finance road investments, and the proceeds of the tax were paid into a



- 12 -
special account (Road Fund) directly available to the Directorate General of
Roads for road expenditures. In May 1978 this mechanism was abolished mainly
on the grounds that irregularities in fuel supplies and significant price
movements preclude an orderly functioning of the Fund. Although the proceeds
of the special surtax are now channelled, together with other revenues, into
the general government budget, allocations for roads have been adequate
since the Fund was discontinued.
C. Administration, Staffing and Training
2.13      The MTP through its Directorate General of Roads (Direction Generale
des Routes - DGR) has full responsibility for design, construction and main-
tenance of the classified road network and the urban roads in Bujumbura. The
DGR has three Technical Directorates (see Chart 1): Xa) the Directorate of
Design and Control (Direction Technique des Etudes et du Controle - DTEC) in
charge of carrying out and supervising feasibility and detailed engineering
studies and supervising construction contracts; (b) the Directorate of Imple-
mentation (Direction Technique de l'Exploitation - DTE) in charge of road
maintenance and bridge improvements; and (c) the Directorate of Administration
(Direction Administrative et Financiere - DAF) in charge of finance and
personnel. The structure of the DGR is sound. Following a recommendation by
the Association and agreements reached under the Second Highway Project, a
position of Director General responsible only for roads was created in March
1979. In addition, responsibility for the urban roads in Bujumbura has been
vested in a separate service under DTE, which has its own budget, personnel
and equipment (para. 2.34).
2.14      The approximately 2,500 km of unclassified earth tracks are the
responsibility of the district authorities. Although the roads are important
for agriculture, the Government allocates very little for their maintenance,
and work on the roads must consequently be carried out by villagers and users
on a voluntary basis, with DGR providing some assistance in critical cases.
These arrangements, although not optimal, are satisfactory for the traffic
levels now carried.
2.15      Although the highest professional positions in DGR are filled
by experienced Burundi engineers and managers, there has been an acute
shortage of qualified local engineers and administrative staff. To fili this
gap in the short term, France is financing three highway engineers at DTEC and
Belgium an administrative expert at DGR. The Government is making long-term
efforts to overcome the general shortage of Burundi nationals for higher level
positions by sending about 300 trainees abroad for further education, but it
seems likely that DGR will continue to depend on expatriate technical and
managerial expertise for a number of years in view of the shortage of qualified
nationals and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff because of
competition from the private sector where compensation is higher.
2.16      The situation for mid-level and technical positions is improving
considerably. Under the Highway Maintenance Project one trainer-advisor
(senior civil engineer) was recruited by the Organization for Rehabilitation



- 13 -
through Training (ORT; Switzerland) to help implement a three-year training
program (1978-81) at the Public Works School in Bujumbura. The school now
trains four to six technicians per year at the superintendent level, and it is
expected that with the expansion of the training program under the proposed
project the school would eventually be able to provide 10 to 12 graduates per
year. This should be sufficient to fill estimated staffing requirements for
the next ten years. In addition, training of three technicians for the
Ministry's soils laboratory is being provided under the Second Highway Project
with French financing.
2.17      The situation for lower level positions is also improving, and
several training programs have already been established. Since 1968 a program
for mechanics and truck drivers has been carried out by four technical experts
provided by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) to the central workshop, and
this is showing good but slow results. Under the Highway Maintenance Project,
two experts were recruited through ORT for a three-year period beginning in
1978: one instructor for the training of overseers and foremen and one
instructor for equipment operators at the training center at Gitega (Centre de
Formation de Gitega), which specializes in training maintenance staff. It is
expected that this training program, which will be extended and completed
tunder the proposed project, will eventually provide a sufficient number of
Burundi instructors to carry on the program. Furthermore, with financing
from IDA and UNDP under the Highway Maintenance and the Second Highway
Projects, a consultant's team, Research and Development (R&D), specializing
in road maintenance operations and consisting of a project manager, an
accountant, a storekeeper and four foremen, is assisting Government in
improving road maintenance operations and in carrying out a bridge replacement
program, while simultaneously providing field experience to trainees from the
training center at Gitega. The proposed project will provide for the
continuation of the technical assistance provided by ORT and R&D (paras. 3.13
and 3.15) so that upon completion of the project in 1984 the training center
at Gitega will be able to provide a total of 15 equipment operators, 30
overseers and 60 foremen per year. This should be sufficient to fill DGR's
staffing requirement at least during the next ten years.
D. Planning
2.18      The foundation of a highway development plan in Burundi was provided
by the comprehensive 1978-87 road improvement program prepared by consultants
Berger/BCEOM in 1977 with financing under the Highway Maintenance Project.
The 10-year program largely adopted Government's existing program for paving
some 550 km of earth/gravel roads which provide links to the external evacua-
tion routes and to the major economic centers, and recommended the upgrading
of about 620 km of existing earth roads and tracks. The improvement program
is being implemented under the 1978-82 National Development Plan which incor-
porated most of the recommendations for the first five years of the program.
The Second Highway Project provided financing for improvements to some 230 km
of these roads, while the proposed project would provide financing for improve-
ments to another 360 km of roads, a high proportion of which were slated for
early implementation under the 10-year program (para. 3.07).



- 14 -
2.19      While the recommendations of the road improvement program are still
valid, changing road conditions and traffic levels have made it necessary to
review the timing of the various projects included under the program. The
need for periodic updating of the highway sector plan is therefore becoming
evident, and this will require systematic traffic counts and the updating of
vehicle operating costs and road inventories. DGR, however, employs no
professional economist/planner and has no planning capability. Government
has recognized the need to institutionalize highway planning and programming,
and intends to create a planning unit within MTP (para. 1.17). The proposed
project would assist in this regard by financing a transport economist to
establish the planning unit and train nationals in highway planning (para.
3.17).
2.20      Table 2.5 gives the road paving projects currently under construc-
tion and preparation (568 km). The timing of some of these projects is not
optimal either because they would provide competing alternatives to existing
roads or because the proposed level of improvement is not appropriate. How-
ever, in view of the heavy dependence of road construction on external
financing, the roads under preparation would be built only if financing
becomes available, and the program should therefore not be considered final.
It is expected that the highway planner to be financed under the project
would help to develop more balanced road construction programs.
E. Financing
2.21      The budgetary process in Burundi proceeds as follows.  Recurrent
budget proposals for the coming fiscal year are prepared by DGR during the
third quarter of the calendar year. When approved by the Minister of Public
Works, the proposals are transmitted to the Finance Minister who can request
revisions. The final decision, however, is taken in late December or early
January by the whole Cabinet. Budget revisions are prepared during the third
quarter of the calendar year to reflect unforeseen changes in revenues and
expenditures, and a revised budget is generally approved before the end of the
quarter.
2.22      Routine maintenance of the classified road network is financed from
the recurrent budget (Budget Ordinaire); maintenance activities are also
supported by the capital budget (Budget Extraordinaire) which provides
funds for periodic road maintenance, construction of workshops and training.
Road-construction is financed through the capital budget, with a very high
proportion of the total cost of new construction covered by external financing.
2.23      Expenditures for highways during 1975-80 are shown in Table 2.6.
Until 1978, recurrent budgetary allocations for highway maintenance were
consistently below requirements, and urban roads received the major share of
the recurrent funds allocated to MTP for roads (more than two-thirds in 1976
and 1977). Since 1979 Government has increased its annual allocation above
the agreed minimua of US$2.5 million equivalent (c.onstant 197T  prices) , a-MC
budget allocations for highway maintenance have been adequate (para. 2.12). To
insure the adequacy of future allocations, during negotiations agreement was

reached with Government on the level of future minimum annual maintenance
budgetary allocations and expenditures in real terms. These are currently
estimated at US$3.0 million equivalent in 1981 prices. It was also
agreed that, in the last quarter of each fiscal year of the Borrower during
project implementation and before the budget is finally approved by the
Cabinet, Government will consult with the Association on the level and
structure of the budget in relation to DGR's work program (para. 3.01 (b)).
The budgetary allocation will take into consideration cost increases and
additional maintenance needs imposed by the extension of the paved and gravel
road networks and changes in traffic patterns and volumes.

F. Engineering
2.24      DTEC is responsible for road design.  Its staff, headed by a Burundi
engineer, consists of three expatriate engineers, provided by French bilateral
technical assistance and about ten Burundi technicians and surveyors. Due to
a shortage of skilled technicians, DTEC's design and supervisory capacity is
limited to small- and medium-scale projects, and design studies for larger
projects as well as supervision of construction are carried out by expatriate
consultants. It is expected that the ongoing training program at the Public
Works School in Bujumbura will eventually provide DTEC with more trained staff
(para. 2.16). There are no local consultants.
2.25      DTEC's laboratory for soils and materials testing is in poor condi-
tion, and most tests are carried out by consultants.  However, a new laboratory
is now being constructed and equipped and is expected to be operational by
mid-1981. Key staff for the laboratory are now being trained in France under
bilateral assistance (para. 2.16).

G. Construction
2.26      Minor road construction projects are carried out by force account,
using DTE's mechanized brigade. For major road construction projects, DTEC
employs coutractors following suitable prequalification and tendering proce-
dures. Contracts are let on a unit-price basis after international competitive
bidding. In the past, one firm, AMSAR, which is 40% Government-owned and 60%
foreign-owned, has had a monopoly on road construction works due to the
relatively limited number of works tendered and the lower overhead and mobili-
zation costs incurred by the firm, which has been established in Burundi since
1963. However, owing to increased construction activities during the past few
years, several foreign contractors have established themselves in Burundi and
are providing more competition. The quality of construction has been satisfac-
tory, but execution of works has often been delayed by frequent shortages of
imported materials due to transport constraints in neighboring countries. To
minimize this risk, tender documents for main road construction under the
proposed project should include provisions for a stock of materials (para.
3.24).
2.27      Supervision of major road construction works is carried out by
consultants due to DTEC-s shortage of experienced staff. The standard of
supervision is satisfactory, and payment procedures are prompt.
2.28      Burundi has no local road construction industry due to a lack of
qualified manpower and managers, the limited financial capacity of local
contractors, and the limited volume and discontinuity of construction works.
Even minor works for drainage and structures are therefore usually carried out
by DGR's force account units. The development potential and needs of the
local contracting industry were assessed in a study issued by the World
Bank/UNIDO Cooperative Program in 1979 1/, which recommended the provision of
financial help (advance payments) and technical assistance to the industry.
Since some improvement works under the proposed project will be carried out by
local contractors, some of that assistance has been included in the project
(paras. 3.08  and 3.12).  Furthermore, IDF is preparing a pilot project to
assist the local construction industry; the project will concentrate mainly
on building activities.
2.29      Government has encouraged the use of labor-intensive work methods
for the improvement of earth and gravel roads and above all for maintenance
(para. 2.31). Use of these methods for road improvement would continue
under the proposed project (para. 3.08). In addition, technical assistance
for a labor-intensive road construction project financed by USAID would be
included under the proposed project (para. 3.16).

H. Maintenance
2.30      Eighty-five percent of the classified network is comprised of earth
roads constructed with low quality soils, and the damage caused by traffic on
these roads often makes them impassable after heavy rains. The proposed
project will address this problem by continuing to assist with the improvement
of some of these roads and of maintenance operations (details follow). It
will finance technical assistance to define a five-year rehabilitation and
maintenance program for the country's rapidly expanding paved road network
(para. 3.14).
2.31      DTE is responsible for maintenance of the classified road network
and the Bujumbura township roads (190 km paved; 200 km earth).
When required, it also provides financial aid, labor and tools to rural
communities maintaining about 2,500 km of local roads which are important for
the evacuation of agricultural products. With the exception of periodic
resurfacing, which is carried out with equipment, most work is done manually
because of the existing unemployment problem and low wages.   Technical
assistance to improve and strengthen DTE's manual road maintenance operations
has been financed under the ongoing Highway Maintenance and Second Highway
Projects. Since mid-1975 consultants R&D have provided on-the-job training
to DTE staff, while the ORT has complemented this effort by conducting train-
ing courses at DTE's training school at Gitega since late 1978. During that
time, the number of maintenance staff has increased from 1,500 to 3,000. In
order to complete the ongoing training effort and increase productivity-,.the
proposed project would provide handtools, vehicles and camp equipment for
manua-l maintenance as well as technical assistance to review and improve
maintenance practices (paras. 3.10, 3.13 and 3.15).
2.32      DTE's mechanized maintenance brigade (headquartered in Bujumbura)
has achieved substantial progress during the last four years. In order to
improve the existing brigade and to allow the creation of a second brigade,
the proposed project would finance the replacement of some key pieces of
equipment as well as some additional equipment (para. 3.09). Technical
assistance to help continue the mechanized maintenance program would also be
provided (para. 3.13). With these improvements, the two brigades would have
the capacity to meet the country's mechanized road maintenance needs in the
medium term.
2.33      Since 1968, the FRG has provided technical assistance to train
mechanics (para. 2.17) and to improve the capacity of DGR's mechanical workshop
in Bujumbura, which maintains DTE's road maintenance equipment. Furthermore,
with the view to decentralizing equipment maintenance, a new workshop is being
built in Gitega and two more will be constructed at Ngozi and Bururi. The FRG
assistance is expected to continue until 1985, when local staff will have
acquired sufficient experience to assume a large part of the responsibility
for training and the operations of the various workshops.
2.34     ta. tthe past, Su1udbuxa' s tio'shWip roads were maintailned at tne
expense of the classified road network; an agreement was therefore reached
under the Second Highway Project on measures to progressively separate the



- 19 -
equipment, personnel, accounting and budgeting for the two services. Govern-
ment has already established a separate recurrent budgetary allocation for the
Bujumbura township roads, as well as a separate staff, but equipment is still
sometimes utilized for both services. The Association will therefore
continue to monitor and enforce this separation, except for equipment repair
which will continue to be done together at the central workshlop.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of the proposed project are to continue to assist
the Government in:
(a)  improving the road network to facilitate decentralization
and to support development efforts in the northeastern
part of the country;
(b)  improving an alternative land connection to the Port of
Dar es Salaam; and
(c)  developing and strengthening the Government's transport
planning and highway maintenance capability.
B. Project Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of:
(a)  construction to two-lane bituminous paved standard of the
first 39.4 km section of the Ngozi-Kobero road (Ngozi-Junction
RIG 14);
(b)  improvement of selected secondary and tertiary roads (totalling
about 360 km), including the replacement of some equipment
for the existing mechanized brigade and the procurement of
equipment for a second mechanized brigade which would help to
carry out this work;
(c)  procurement of tools, vehicles and camp equipment for the
ongoing manual maintenance program; and
(d)  consultant services to:
(i) supervise (a);
(ii) provide technical assistance to: (1) complete
preparation and supervise implementation of (b);
(2) help implement the manual and mechanical maintenance
programs and continue on-thze-job trIan1ng of nationals



- 20 -
in these operations; (3) continue training of equipment
operators, civil works technicians, and manual maintenance
section chiefs; (4) advise on labor-intensive road
construction; and (5) assist the MTP and MTPT with
planning and programming.
(a) Main Road Construction
3.03      The project road, Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 (39.4 km), is part of RN 6
which traverses the country's high northern plateau (Map 2). The area served
by the road seation has the highest population density in Burundi (3002
inhabitants/km as opposed to-an overall average of 142 inhabitants/km ),
besides being a very productive agricultural region, both for subsistence
crops and coffee. The road would also serve as the main extraction route for
the Akanyaru River-Kirundo peat deposits. Although these deposits are not
being commercially exploited, this possibility is being studied, and they
could become an important energy source for the country, which would help to
reduce dependence on oil and wood. In addition, the road is part of the
road/rail route linking Buj=mbura to Dar es Salaam Port via a 598 km road to
Isaka in Tanzania and 980 km of railway to the port (Map 1). After paving of
the project road and the Junction RIG 14 - Muyinga road (to be financed by
the African Development Fund) only 26 km will remain to be paved in Burundi.
The Tanzanian part of the road link to Isaka (Rusumo-Isaka) is also being
upgraded. Detailed engineering has been completed except for the section
across the border linking the road systems of the the two countries (approxi-
mately 30 km); FED will provide financing for the detailed engineering for
this link. Construction to paved standard of the northern section of the
Rusumo-Isaka road is under way and construction of the middle section is
expected to start in late 1981, also with FED financing. This route could
therefore provide a viable alternative to the traditional lake/rail route
between Bujumbura and Dar es Salaam via Kigoma within the next five to seven
years.
3.04      The existing road is in poor condition, with a tortuous alignment,
very poor earth surface and inadequate or non-existent drainage; maintenance
is difficult and costly due to the rugged terrain, occasional sections of
unconsolidated rock, frequent heavy rains and distance to aggregate quarries.
Traffic on the road is currently about 100 vpd and consists of about 30% cars,
45% pickups and 25% trucks.
3.05      The alternative to upgrading the road to an engineered gravel rather
than paved standard was considered (para. 4.09), but because of the rainy
climate, difficult terrain, and lack of suitable materials, maintenance costs
would be excessively high and overall costs would not be less than under the
paved road alternative. Furthermore, DGR would have difficulty in coping with
the frequent maintenance that would be required. In addition, the paved road
will provide an all-weather outlet for Burundi's external trade.
3.06      Detailed engineering for the road construction was financed by the
African Development Fund (Af DFE, c.arteA ourt b  Sef'-r1i Xcic.i t
(I.T.S.; Italy) and is satisfactory. The proposed alignment includes two
bypasses to avoid road stretches with more than 7% gradients and curves



- 21 -
with radii of less than 50 m. The road will be reconstructed to two-lane
bituminous paved standards, and the alignment improvements will shorten the
distance between Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 from the current 42.5 km to 39.4 km.
The proposed design standards for the road improvement (Table 3.1) are consis-
tent with the standards used for other paved roads in Burundi and are appro-
priate for the terrain, climate and forecast traffic.

(b) Improvement of Secondary and Tertiary Road Networks
3.07      The proposed program of selective upgrading of the secondary and
tertiary road networks will continue the road improvement program which was
recommended in a consultant's study carried out under the Highway Maintenance
Project and initiated under the Second Highway Project. Government has
prepared a list of about 500 km of earth roads to be upgraded, of which about
360 km were selected for upgrading to low gravel standard under the proposed
project (Table 3.2). This list includes roads yielding an economic return of
about 20% or urgently needing improvement because of recent agricultural
developments in their zone of influence. Final designs for the Boma du
Chef-Makamba (36 km) and Makamba-Mabanda (20 km) roads are already available.
The program of subsequent improvements will be determined on the basis of
economic criteria by the consultants engaged for engineering and supervision
of improvements (para. 3.12).

3.08      Implementation of the program will be carried out by force account
and by contractor (up to 30%) and is expected to entail a substantial use of
labor-intensive techniques. Force account works, which are justified by the
low capacity of the local construction industry and the scattered location of
works, will include the relatively larger works and will be the responsibility
of DTE-s mechanized brigades, while local contractors will be responsible for
minor earthworks and structures. As this will be the beginning of local
contractor involvement in road works in Burundi, particular attention will be
paid to the conditions of bidding and size of contracts, lending requirements
and payment procedures. Design standards for the roads will be the same as
those established under the ongoing Second Highway Project (Table 3.3), since
they have already proven adequate to accommodate the forecast traffic.

3.09      Most of the equipment currently available to DTE's mechanized brigade
is not adequate for the above road improvement works or for general road
maintenance requirements. The project will therefore provide for the replace-
ment of some worn-out equipment and the procurement of additional equipment to
permit the establishment of a second brigade (Annex 2).
(c) Manual Maintenance Program
3,10      Manual road maintenance, the traditional form of maintenance in
Burundi, has improved during the last few years due to the increase in real
terms of budgetary allocations for road maintenance (para. 2.23) and the
assistance provided by the two ongoing IDA projects. The proposed project
will continue to assist in the efficient utilization of labor for manual road
maintenance operations by continuing technical assistance to help supervise
operations (paras. 3.13 and 3.15) and an adequate supply of handtools, vehicles
and camp equipment for the 3,000-man labor force (Anlnex 2).
(d) Consultant Services
Supervision of Main Road Construction
3.11      In view of staff constraints in DTEC, consultants will be engaged
before signature of the works contract to supervise construction of the
Nigozi-Junction RIG 14 road under terms of reference and conditions of employ-
ment acceptable to the Association.
Preparation and Supervision of Secondary and Tertiary Road Improvements
3.12      Government has requested that the three technical experts already
provided to the DTEC by France (para. 2.15) will assist in .the preparation
and implementation of road improvement works to be carried out under the
proposed project (para. 3.07). Terms and conditions of the experts' employ-
raent are satisfactory to the Association and were agreed during negotiations.
The expatriate experts and their Burundi counterparts will be responsible for
selecting roads to be improved under the program, to carry out basic and, if
necessary, detailed design and to supervise subsequent execution of works.
They will also identify the most appropriate technology for the execution of
these works by force account and local contractors. When and if required,
the expatriate experts will provide technical assistance to the local contrac-
tors. The IDF pilot project (para. 2.28) will provide managerial and adminis-
trative assistance to local contractors.
Technical Assistance
3.13      With financing under the ongoing project and the Project Prepara-
tion Facility (PPF) (para. 3.18), consultants R&D has been providing technical
assistance to help implement the mechanical and manual maintenance programs,
including bridge replacement, and to provide on-the-job training in related
activities. Technical assistance to these programs will continue under the
proposed project to further strengthen DTE's road maintenance capacity by
training counterparts in all levels of maintenance activities (except mechanics
being trained with FRG assistance) until maintenance operations have become
sufficiently well established to no longer require supervision by expatriate
staf£.  This continued need for technical assistance partly results from the



- 24 -
fact that, soon after completing their training, counterparts trained-under
the previous projects have been leaving Government service for the private
sector. To help make up for such a loss of trained staff in the future,
agreement was reached that Government will (i) attach three counterparts
to each technical assistance expert financed under the project with the
exception of the project manager for the maintenance program (R&D) and
the two economists for planning and programming in MTP (DTEC) and MTPT to
whom fewer than three counterparts can be assigned with the approval of the
Association; and (ii) require counterparts to remain in the service of MTP
(DTEC) and MTPT for at least three years (para. 5.01 (c)). The Government
wishes to continue the services of R&D under the proposed project, and terms
and conditions of this assistance were agreed during negotiations (Annex 3).
3.14      The Government is presently carrying out a road paving program, which,
when completed, will increase the paved road network from the present 280 km
to 850 km. To ensure adequate maintenance of this network, the Government has
requested that, in the course of its assignment during the first year of
project implementation, R&D should also carry out a limited study which will
provide DGR with a five-year paved road rehabilitation and maintenance program
for the period 1982-86. The study will also determine the organizational,
staffing, and equipment needs for the works to be carried out by force account,
and will assess the financial implications of the recommended program. Terms
of reference for the study (Annex 3) were agreed at negotiations.
3.15      Consultants ORT has been providing technical assistance to the
School of Public Works in Bujumbura,- the Training Center in Gitega. and the
manual maintenance brigades, with financing under the previous projects and
the PPF. The proposed project will continue this assistance in order to
complete training of the 3,000-man labor force for manual maintenance.
The Government wishes to continue the services of ORT under the proposed
project, and terms and conditions for continuation of this assistance were
agreed during negotiations (Annex 4).
3.16      Two additional technical experts, specialized in labor-intensive
construction methods, are included under the project to assist MTP in carrying
out the construction of the provincial road linking Minago and Tora (58 km),
using labor-intensive methods (para. 2.29). Their terms of reference were
agreed upon at negotiations (Annex 5). Government and USAID, which are
financing this work, are in agreement with this arrangement.
3.17      The proposed project will also provide technical assistance to MTP
(DTEC) and MTPT for transport planning and programming. Terms of reference
for technical assistance to MTP (DTEC) and MTPT were agreed upon at negotiations
(Annex 6). One transport economist will assist the MT? in the planning and
programming of road investments and maintenance operations; another expert
will assist the MTPT in the elaboration of policies for the development and
utilization of external transport routes, including the preparation of the
Government's position vis-a-vis transit countries and overall transport
sector coordination.  It is expected that fitancAn  fr the two empe-ts 'Jt

PPF was approved by IDA to cover the cost of ongoing technical assistance
which was begun under the previous projects and will continue under the
proposed project. The PPF advance will be refunded under the proposed credit.

C. Cost Estimates
3.19      The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
US$35.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$25.9 million or 74%
of total ptoject costs. Excluding taxes and duties, the total cost is
US$32.1 million. A contingency allowance of 10% has been included to cover
increases in quantities usually expected in road projects. Price contingencies
are based on recent estimates of inflation rates, both worldwide and in
Burundi, as follows: 1980 - 12.5% foreign, 20.0% local; 1981 - 9.0% foreign,
15.0% local; 1982 - 8.5% foreign, 12.0% local; 1983 - 7.5% foreign, 12.0%
local; 1984 - 7.5% foreign, 12.0% local. Costs of the various project
components are given in Table 3.4 on page 26.
3.20      The base costs are estimated as of June 1980 and have been derived
as follows:
(a)  Main Road Construction:  The cost estimates for construction
of the Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 road, to be carried out in 1981-83,
were derived from consultants' estimates based on final design
quantities and a survey of unit prices in early 1980 for
construction in Burundi. Estimated costs average US$300,000
per km which appears reasonable in the light of bids recently
received for similar works. The foreign exchange component
of construction costs is estimated at 70% of the total cost
of construction.
(b)  Improvement of Secondary and Tertiary Road Networks:  The costs
of improvements are based on average costs for the ongoing road
improvement program being carried out under the Second Highway
Project. Costs for the force account work (70% of total program)
average US$8,000 per km, excluding equipment amortization.
Costs for the contract work are estimated at US$13,000 per km,
including overhead costs and profits. Costs of the equipment
to be purchased for the two mechanized brigades are based on
recent supplier quotations and bid prices received under the
ongoing Second Highway Project.
(c)  Manual Maintenance Program:  Costs of handtools, vehicles and
camp equipment are based on recent supplier quotations.
(d)  Consultant Services:  Supervision of main road construction
will require about 90 man-months of consulting services at
about US$8,000 per man-month. Preparation and supervision
of road improvements will require about 40 man-months of
consulting services, at about US$8,000 per man-month. The
other technical assistance costs reflect the average yearly
costs of the two consultants' teams and the German technical
assistance team presently working in Burundi. Thirteen
positions would be filled by expatriates totalling about
520 man-months over the project period, at an average rate of
US$10,000 per man-month. The average man-month cost for

consultant services and technical assistance includes salary,
social costs, the firms' overhead and profit, an overseas
allowance and international travel. In addition to these
personnel costs, contract costs include the costs of
accommodation, local transportation, local office operating
expenses and printing of reports.
D. Financing
3.21      The US$32.1 million project cost net of taxes and duties will be
financed by an IDA Credit of SDR 20.5 million (US$25.0 million), an approved
grant (US$1.0 million) for equipment and tools from the Administration
Generale de la Cooperation au Developpement (AGCD; Belgium), an approved
grant (US$2.0 million) for equipment from Japan, an approved grant (US$0.3
million), from France for technical assistance to DTEC and an anticipated UNDP
grant of US$0.5 million for technical assistance for transport planning and
programming. This will cover 90% of the total project cost net of taxes and
duties (100% of the project's foreign exchange and 47% of the local cost net
of taxes and duties). The remaining 53% of the local cost, or US$3.3 million
(US$6.2 million including taxes and duties) will be covered by Government
funds. In addition, Government will have to meet the recurrent cost of road
maintenance amounting to US$13.7 million (FBu 1,23:3 million) for the three-
year period (mid-1981 to mid-1984) of project implementation (Table 3.5).
Ihe financing plan for the capital cost, net of taxes and duties, is outlined
in Table 3.6.
E. Implementation
3.22      MTP will be responsible for the implementation of all project
components with the exception of the technical assistant provided to the MTPT
for planning and programming which would be handled by MTPT itself. Within
the MTP, the DTEC will be responsible for: the main road construction
work carried out by contractors selected after international competitive
bidding (ICB) and supervised by expatriate consultants; the preparation
and supervision of road improvements which will be carried out by force
account and local contractors; and the technical assistant provided to MTP
for planning and programming. DTE will be responsible for the maintenance
program which includes a limited maintenance study. DAF will be responsible
for the procurement of equipment and tools.
3.23      Main road construction and related supervision will start in the
fourth quarter of 1981 and take about 30 months to complete, with about 5%
of the works carried out in 1981, 55% in 1982 and 40% in 1983. Improvement of
the road network will be spread over a period of three years starting in
mid-1981. Procurement of equipment will take about one year, with the bulk
of equipment arriving in mid-1982. The project is expected to be completed
by mid-1984. The implementation schedule shown in Chart 2 was agreed with
Government during negotiations (para. 5.01 (d)).

F. Procurement
3.24      The contract for main road construction (US$12.0 million, excluding
contingencies) will be subject to ICB in accordance with Bank Group guide-
lines. Prequalification of contractors is currently being prepared by
Government following Bank Group guidelines; particular attention is being
given to contractors with experience in areas with similar conditions since
the road crosses relatively difficult terrain. To minimize the risk of
construction delays, tender documents will include provisions for a stock
of materials. During negotiations, prequalification, bidding and contracting
procedures and details were reviewed and agreed with the Government (para.
5.01(e)).
3.25      Improvement of the secondary and tertiary road networks (US$3.5 mil-
lion, excluding contingencies) will be carried out by force account and
local contractors. The two mechanized maintenance brigades will carry out
force account work. In addition, to alleviate possible staff constraints in
the brigades and to encourage participation of the local construction
industry in civil works on roads, it was agreed at negotiations that DTE will
have the authority to let out works to local contractors, following local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association (para. 5.01(f)).
3.26      Equipment financed under the project by the Association (US$1.2 mil-
lion, excluding contingencies) will be grouped into major lots and procured
by ICB in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. This was agreed at nego-
tiations (para. 5.01 (g)).
3.27      Consultant services (US$6.3 million, excluding contingencies) will
be needed for supervision of main road construction (including an expert with
experience in road construction under similar geological conditions) as well
as technical assistance for the preparation and supervision of road improve-
ments, the maintenance program, labor-intensive construction works, and
planning and programming in MTP and MTPT. Terms of reference for the various
services were discussed and agreed during negotiations. It was also agreed
that the qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment
of consultants and technical assistants selected for these assignments will
be satisfactory to the Association (para. 5.01 (h)).
G. Disbursement
3.28      Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 95% of total expenditures for main road construction;
(b) 70% of total expenditures for road improvement works;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures and 40% of local expenditures
for road maintenance equipment; and



- 31 -
(d) 100% of foreign cost and 60% of local expenditures for
consulting services.
Al:L disbursements will be fully documented except for expenditures under force
account for civil works included in Part B (i) of TaLble 3.4. Civil works by
force account will be paid against statements of expenditure and work progress
prepared by the supervising engineers and submitted to IDA by Government. How-
ever, in order to ensure the completion of the improvement program, it was
agreed at negotiations that if at any time during execution of the program by
force account the Association estimates that at the 70% disbursement rate the
remaining funds are insufficient to cover the remaining works, the Association
may reduce the disbursement percentage (para. 5.01(i)).  A disbursement schedule
follows in Table 3.7:

H. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.29      Project accounts, including statements of expenditure, will be
maintained by DGR with separate accounts for each component. Project accounts
will be audited annually by the Auditor General or by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association; during negotiations, Government and IDA agreed
that all project accounts together with the auditor<s report will be submitted
annually to IDA, not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year
(para. 5.01 (j)). Government and rDA also agreed on progress reporting
reiquirements (Annex 7) and the submission of a project completion report, in
a form satisfactory to the Association, not later than six months after the
Closing Date (para. 5.01 (d)).

I. Environmental Aspects
3.30      None of the project's elements will adversely affect the environ-
ment. The planned bypass at the town of Ngozi on RN 6 will not only improve
and shorten the existing tortuous alignment, but will also help decrease
traffic noise, pollution and accidents in the urban area. No land use problem
should arise since the whole bypass goes through nonagricultural state-owned
land. All other project roads generally follow the existing alignment, and no
major disturbance to land use should occur. Furthermore, the new or improved
drainage facilities will benefit adjacent areas, and the new geometric stand-
ards will contribute to road safety.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Evaluation of Project Components
General
4.01      Government's 1978-82 investment plan has as its main socioeconomic
objectives: (a) the development of the country's various regions by decen-
tralizing economic and administrative activities away from Bujumbura and
by promoting agriculture and the development of regional centers; and (b)
the diversification of agricultural production and the development of mining
and industry. The proposed project will help finance transport investments
included in the plan which support these objectives. The construction to
paved standard of the first section of the Ngozi-Kobero road will improve
communications and reduce transport costs between Bujumbura and the provinces
of Ngozi and Muyinga, which are the most populated and the most import-
ant in terms of coffee production. It will also contribute to the creation
of an improved transport connection, either all road or road/rail, to the
Indian Ocean. The project's road improvement component, which will upgrade
some 360 km of roads, will help decentralization and the development of
agriculture in the regions served by the improved roads. The project's manual
maintenance component supports maintenance of the entire classified network
and is a continuation of the maintenance program started under the earlier
Highway MSaintenance Project. The continuation of this program is vital for
the development of the regions and the rural areas.
4.02      The road construction component is economically justified and is
estimated to yield an economic return (ER) of 15%; the investment in replace-
ment and supplementary equipment and the financing of a portion of operating
costs for the road improvement component would yield an ER conservatively
estimated at 27%; the continuation of support to the manual maintenance pro-
gram which was started under the earlier projects will assure that the
benefits of this program will be maintained at the level established under
these projects, with an ER estimated at a minimum of 20%.  Using these con-
servative estimates for the last two components, the overall rate of return
is estimated at about 19%. No ER has been calculated for the various elements
of the technical assistance component, although the services to be provided



- 33 -
by experts in the areas of maintenance administration, training, planning and
studies are expected to result in substantial benefits derived from DGR's
increased capacity to maintain the road network and plan future road improve-
nient and maintenance.
1.   Construction of the First Section of the Ngozi-Kobero Road (39.4 km)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The main benefits to be derived from this investment are reduced
vehicle operating costs (voc). The expected impact of the reduction of
vehicle operating costs on economic activity in the influence area is taken
into account through the benefits assigned to generated traffic which have
been included in the analysis. Benefits from accident reduction are estimated
to be negligible and have not been used in computing the economic return.
4.04      The major direct beneficiaries of the savings in voc will be traders/
truckers. As the road improvement is expected to increase competition and
encourage entry into the local transport market of new traders/truckers (para.
2.09), the benefits are also expected to be passed on to producers and consumers.
Because marketing and distribution is dominated by traders/truckers whose
t:rading and trucking activities are not easily separable, the savings in voc
will be passed on in the form of better farm-gate prices for agricultural
products and/or lower prices for consumer products sold by the traders/truckers.
(b) Area of Influence of the Project Road
4.05      The project road consists of a 39.4 km section of RN6 which extends
toward the regional centers of Muyinga and Kobero in the north. It not only
serves a very densely populated region (300 inhabitants/km2 compared to an
average 142 inhabitants/km for the country), but also provides an outlet for
t:he country's most important coffee-growing area where the Association is
involved in a coffee improvement project (Cr. 593-BU). The road also runs
close to Burundi's most important peat deposits in the Akanyaru River/Kirundo
aLrea. Although these deposits are not exploited commercially, their use is
being studied and they could become a major alternative source of energy.
(c) Economic Analysis
(i) Traffic
4.06      On the basis of an extensive traffic survey carried out by consult-
ants Berger/BCEOM in 1976 and updated by DGR and consultants ITS in 1980,
t:raffic on the road is estimated at 96 vehicles in 1980 and is assumed to
grow at an average 5.9% p.a. By 1985, one year following the opening of the
road, traffic is expected to reach 173 vpd (61 cars, 76 pickups and 36 trucks).
This includes 134 vehicles of normal and 39 vehicles of generated traffic.
(ii) Vehicle Operating Costs
4.07      Vehicle operating costs were estimated by consultants Berger/BCEOM
:Ln 1977 and were reviewed and updated to mid-1980 by IDA staff. Table
41 Yzndzc&te. tehe voc for representzative vehicles on a flat terzrain.  Owing



- 34 -
to the hilly and mountainous terrain in the project area, actual voc savings
are on average 26% higher than would be obtained on flat terrain.

Source:  Derived from Berger/BCEOM, Feasibility Study of the Ngozi-Muyinga-
Kobero Road, 1977.
(iii) Construction and Maintenance Costs
4.08      Costs at mid-1980 prices, excluding taxes but including 10% physical
contingencies, for the Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 section of the Ngozi-Kobero road
are estimated at FBu 950 million for construction and at FBu 69 million for
construction supervision; and the cost of repaving the road after ten years
at FBu 66.5 million. Maintenance cost estimates for the existing and the
proposed paved road are based on those developed by consultants Berger/BCEOM
in their 1977 report. The maintenance cost for the existing road is estimated
to increase with traffic volume, whereas the maintenance cost for the paved
road, given the low traffic levels over the economic life, is assumed to
remain constant during the economic life of the road. (See Annex 8 for more
details.)
(iv) Economic Return
4.09      Assuming a 20-year economic life for the project road, a comparison
of the above costs and benefits indicates that construction of the road
section is well justified with an ER of 15%. Improvement to gravel standard
was also considered and rejected on the following grounds:
(a) the international function of the road will require construc-
tion to the same geometric standards as the paved road
alternative, and construction cost savings under the
gravel alternative are limited to those from the bituminous
surface; and
(b) because of the hilly terrain, the poor soils and the climatic
co-&ditiotms, maintenance costs on such a gravel road will be
very high.



- 35 -
UInder these conditions the gravel road alternative would yield only a marginally
hiigher rate of return against which has to be set the risk of suboptimal
maintenance which would lead to overall higher transport costs for the gravel
alternative.
(v)   Sensitivity
4.10       Based on past experience, some variables could vary significantly
due to external developments, e.g., construction costs could escalate due to
:interruptions in supplies of essential materials or traffic could be lower due
to border closures. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out on these
critical factors. With a cost increase of 30%, the ER would be 12% while with
a 15% decrease in benefits and a 30% increase in costs, the ER would be 10%.
An economic return was also calculated to reflect the benefits of time savings.
C:onsidering that generally at least one occupant of each private vehicle using
the road is expected to be a businessman, government official or expatriate
expert, all of whose time is highly valuable, the ER for the project road was
calculated to include time saving, with time valued at FBu 750/hour (US$8.30)
per private vehicle; the ER was 16%. If all these factors are combined, a 30%
increase in costs, 15% decrease in unit benefits and the inclusion of time
savings, the ER is 11%.
2.   Improvement of Secondary and Tertiary Road Networks
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.11       The ongoing road improvement program would be continued and expanded
under the project with the upgrading of some 360 km of earth tracks to a low
gravel standard. The road sections included in the preliminary list are in
various parts of the country and have been selected on the basis of their
importance to the economy of the area they serve. Some sections will also
support planned agricultural projects. The main benefit derived from the
program will be voc savings, although beneficial effects on institution
building would also result from the training given to DGR staff which should
strengthen the capability of DGR to carry out roacd improvement works. Further-
mnore, since some of the smaller works will be entrusted to local contractors,
it is expected that the experience gained through these activities will help
to build up a local contracting industry capable of carrying out major
construction work.
4.12       The benefits from the reduced voc would accrue to the traders/
truckers, but as indicated above (para. 4.04) these benefits would be passed
an to producers and consumers as a result of.the competitive conditions
generally prevailing on most transport routes.
(b) Economic Analysis
(i) Final Selection of Road Sections for Improvement Program
4.13       Some 60 km of road sections to be included in the program were
already selected and evaluated in detail under the Second Highway Project.
Current traffic on these sections is in the range of 25 to 35 vpd. More
<1etailed data on the costs of the improvement works and on traffic are



- 36 -
being prepared by the DGR with a view to establishing by the end of 1981
a priority list of some 60 km of additional road sections for the first yeal
of the program. The selection criterion derives from a target minimum ER of
12% which, based on average costs of the improvement works and the magnitude
of the voc savings, would require traffic levels of about 21 vpd. Given the
traffic levels on the road sections for which more detailed information is
available, it is expected that an average ER of some 22% will be attained
(requiring traffic of some 30 vpd). The road sections would be upgraded from
earth tracks to a low gravel standard. Voc on flat and mountainous terrain
for these two road conditions is shown in Annex 9.
4.14      For subsequent years, the road sections to be included in the
annual programs would be selected and agreed upon three months prior to the
start up of works. It is expected that it will be possible to identify
some 300 km of additional road sections which by 1983/84 will have traffic
levels of some 30 vpd so that the economic return for subsequent years
of the improvement program will be maintained at the level established for
the first year. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government
on the list of roads to be improved during the first year of project imple-
mentation; thereafter, each year's road improvement program will be agreed
annually three months prior to the start of the year's program (para. 5.01
(k)).
4.15      Implementation of the road improvement program is supported by
the financing of replacement equipment and a portion of operatings costs
for the existing brigade and of the equipment and a portion of operating
costs for an additional brigade. The actual economic analysis is therefore
conducted separately for each brigade. For the existing brigade, the economic
analysis focuses on the incremental output of the brigade obtained from the
equipment replacement and funding of operating costs while for the additional
brigade the analysis focuses on the total output of the brigade.
(ii) Existing Brigade
4.16      The economic analysis of supporting the continuation of this brigade
by financing replacement equipment is based on an incremental analysis of
costs and outputs, i.e., a comparison of the costs and output of the brigade
over the project period, with and without the replacement equipment. Most
of the existing equipment will be obsolete by 1984, so that without replace-
ment equipment, the brigade's output is expected to decrease from 60 km of
improvement works per year in 1981 to six in 1984, while with the replace-
ment, output will be maintained at 60 km/year. In the case of no equipment
replacement, operating costs equivalent to half the total operating costs at
full productivity have been used in the analysis.
4.17      The comparison of the incremental capital and operating costs with
the incremental voc savings obtained in the "with the project" case is shown
in Annex 10. For this calculation it has been assumed that traffic on the
selected road sections will be of the order of 30 vpd and grow at a rate of
6% p.a.  Because of the equipment replacement, the incremental output of
improvement works by the brigade will be 12 km in 1982, 36 km in 1983, and



- 37 -
55 km in 1984. The road sections are assumed to be located in general in
mountainous terrain and the voc savings for the average vehicle on these roads
are estimated at FBu 29/km. The economic life of the works has been assumed
to be 10 years and the improved roads will have an incremental maintenance
cost of FBu 50,000/km/year. Based on the above assumptions, the ER of re-
p:Lacing the equipment is 34%. Since traffic on some road sections may be
h:igher than 30 vpd and the improvement will also generate some traffic, this
eStimate of the ER is conservative.
(iii) Additional Brigade
4.18      The economic analysis of the establishment of an additional brigade
is based on a comparison of the full capital and operating costs of the
brigade with the voc savings obtained from the improvement works. Annex 11
exhibits the cost/benefit streams of these works for mountainous terrain.
Tae additional brigade is expected to have an output of 60 km of improvement
work per year.  Based on previous experience the average cost of the improve-
ment works are estimated at FBu 1.32 million/km in mountainous terrain. This
estimate takes into consideration that through the expansion of the improve-
ment works by force account, there will be a small saving on fixed overhead
costs. The voc savings obtained from the works are also estimated at FBu
29/km and traffic levels are assumed to be of the order of 30 vpd in the year
of completion of the works and grow at 6% p.a. With these assumptions and a
10-year economic life of the works, the ER of establishing the additional
brigade would be 22%.
3.   Manual Maintenance Program
4.19      The project component supporting the recurrent manual maintenance
program through the procurement of tools, vehicles,, camps, etc., will have
beneficial effects on the condition of the whole classified network. Recur-
rent manual maintenance operations on the classified network, which were
reorganized and supported under the two previous projects, have succeeded in
keeping most of the network open throughout the year. Continuation and
strengthening of these operations are essential to maintain the benefits
accruing to the economy and road users in general from reliable and efficient
transport links and from a lowering of voc. As established under the previous
projects, these recurrent maintenance operations have a rate of return in
excess of 20%. Since the small elements included in the project aimed at
supporting these operations cannot be dissociated Erom the program as a whole
and are essential for its success, no ER has been calculated for these
elements.
4. Consultant Services
4.20      Consultant services are provided under the project to (a) supervise
and help implement the road construction and road improvement components;
(b) provide formal and on-the-job training in maintenance operations; and
(c) provide assistance in transport and-highway planning -and programming. The
costs relating to the first category of consultant services have been included
in the costs used for the economic evaluation of tlne respective components.



- 38 -
The funds earmarked for consultants engaged for training will have consider-
able benefits in terms of institution building. As a result of this training,
DGR will be able to adequately meet the maintenance requirements on its road
netwrk and will be able to do so at lower cost since no use will have to be
made of expensive expatriate personnel for supervision and implementation.
The cost of assistance for planning and programming will have a high return in
terms of the introduction of improved planning procedures and periodic
maintenance and investment programs which will better optimize the use of
scarce funds. The nature of the benefits to be derived from the latter
two categories of consultant services and the fact that part of the institution
building benefits will only appear in the longer term, make them difficult to
quantify accurately; therefore no ER has been calculated.
B. Risks
4.21      In assessing possible project risks, particular attention was given
to a source of implementation problems encountered in past highway projects in
Burundi (para. 2.26). While the procurement process itself presents no risk,
past experience indicates that due to events in neighboring countries causing
delays in transport, shortages of fuel and materials like bitumen, steel and
cement have delayed project implementation by one to two years. To minimize
this risk, tender documents for the proposed project should include provisions
for a stock of materials which would help prevent work stoppages in the event
of transport bottlenecks arising in neighboring countries.
4.22      Special attention has been given to another element of risk, the
hazardous geological conditions of some areas of the Ngozl-RIG 14 road. To
avoid landslides and other failures, and also excessive construction costs,
the engineering studies include detailed and complete geological research of
the whole zone. Based on this, the road alignment closely follows the crest
of the mountains (altitude from 1,380 to 1,820 m) avoiding big cuts, areas
with alterated rocks, and difficult and costly drainage works. Furthermore,
the consultant team in charge of works supervision will include at least one
expert with experience in road construction under similar conditions (para.
3.27).
4.23      Some element of risk is also attached to the project's institution
building objectives. In past projects, the departure to the private sector of
many Burundian counterparts to the technical assistance for the maintenance
programs has been a major source of delay in institution building. Under the
proposed project, however, three Burundi counterparts would be attached to
each technical assistance expert and each counterpart would remain in the
service of MTP for at least three years (para. 3.13). These measures are
expected to reduce considerably the risk that substantial technical assistance
will continue to be required in the future.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations, the following issues were discussed and agreed
upon with Government:
(a)  the creation by March 31, 1982 of planning units within the
Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of
Public Works (para. 1.17);
(b)  each year during project implementation, the budgetary allo-
cation for road maintenance will be at least US$3.0 million
equivalent in 1981 prices, and during the last quarter
of each fiscal year of project implementation and before the
budget is finally approved by the Cabinet, Government will
consult with the Association on the level and structure of
the budget in relation to DGR's work program (para. 2.23);
(c)  that Government would (i) attach three counterparts to
each technical assistance expert financed under the
project with the exception of the project manager for
the maintenance program (R&D) and the two economists for
planning and programming in MTP (DTEC) and MTPT to whom
fewer than three counterparts can be assigned with the
approval of the Association, and (ii) require counterparts
to remain in the service of MTP (DTEC) and MTPT for at
least three years (para. 3.13);
(d)  a project implementation schedule (para. 3.23) as well
as progress reporting requirements, and the submission of
a project completion report (para. 3.29);
(e)  prequalification, bidding and contracting procedures for
the construction of the Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 road (para.
3.24);
(f)  road improvement works will be carried out by force account
or under contracts procured on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Association (para. 3.25);
(g)  equipment financed under the project by the Association
will be grouped and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines (para. 3.26);
(h)  qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of
employment of consultants and technical assistants employed
under the project will be acceptable to the Association
(para. 3.27);



- 40 -
(i) if at any time during execution of the improvement program
by force account the Association estimates that at the 70%
disbursement rate the remaining funds are insufficient to
cover the remaining works, the Association may reduce the
disbursement percentage (para. 3.28).
(j) all project accounts together with the auditor's report will
be submitted annually to IDA, not later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.29); and
(k) on the list of roads to be improved during the first year of
project implementation; thereafter, each year's road improve-
ment program will be agreed annually three months prior to the
start of the year's program (para. 4.14).
5.02      Agreement having been reached on these issues, the proposed project
is suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 20.5 million (US$25.0 million equivalent)
to the Government of Burundi on standard terms.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Terms of reference for Consultants R & D (including Terms of
Reference for a Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Study)
I. Background
1.        Based on the recommendations of a study on highway maintenance
in Burundi submitted by the consultants DIWI/SCET in June 1971, IDA signed
a contract for technical assistance for road maintenance with the firm
Research and Development (R & D) on July 8, 1974. This four-year contract
represented the first phase of an eight-to ten-year program recommended in
the study.
2.        The services of consultants R & D for this first phase were
financed by UNDP under the First Highway Project (Credit 467-BU). The
second phase, financed by IDA-UNDP under the Second Highway Project
(Credit 773-BU) and the project preparation advance for the Third Highway
Project (Credit P-102-BU), was also entrusted to R & D and will end on
June 30, 1981. The Government requested that IDA include the third phase
of the program in the Third Highway Project and that it be executed by
R & D. This final phase of the program, to which the attached terms of
reference refer, will run from July 1, 1981 to June 30, 1984. Unlike the
two earlier phases, the third phase has no UNDP financing and the contract
will be concluded between the Government and R & D.
3.        The technical assistance provided by R & D will continue to all
of the operations of the Direction Generale des Routes (DGR) but will be
chiefly concentrated in the Direction Technique d'Exploitation (DTE), which
is the department directly responsible for highway maintenance.
II. Objectives
4.        The long-term objective is to reduce the cost of road transport and
thus foster and improve economic development in Burundi. The short-term
objectives are:
(a) to complete and consolidate the reorganization of DGR and more
particularly of DTE;
(b) to provide full training for all the local counterparts to the
R & D experts;



- 46 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5
(c) to replace the R & D experts by their Burundi counterparts
before or on completion of the contract;
(d) to complete on-the-job training of all mechanized and
manual maintenance personnel; and
(e) to draw up a program for rehabilitation and maintenance of
paved roads, with estimates of the financing required and
the measures to be taken for execution of the work.
III. Duties of the Consultants
5.        R & D will assign to DGR a team of six specialists:
(a) Chief of mission and advisor to DGR;
(b) Accountant;
(c) Programs Supervisor;
(d) Structures and bridges supervisor;
(e) Work brigade supervisor; and
(f) Mechanic.
All the above specialists, with the exception of the mechanic, have already
taken up their duties under the second-phase contract. Their responsibilities
are defined below.
Chief of miesion and Advisor to DGR
6.        The mission chief, Mr. L. Magnin, assumed his duties in January 1977.
His role for the duration of the project will be:
-   to supervise the activities of the mission experts;
-   to coordinate the mission's activities with the Administration;
-   to act as advisor to DGR on highway maintenance;
-   to assist the Administration, as required, in the examination
of documents and specifications for maintenance and construction
equipment;
-   to draw up and submit to DGR for its consideration and approval
proposals for a suitable pay scale for counterpart staff;



- 47 
ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 5
- to direct and submit within the first year of the project a
study outlining a program for repair and maintenance of paved
roads in accordance with the terms of reference set forth in
Attachment 1 of this Annex.
The period of service of this expert will be threte years. During the third
year, his function as coordinator of the R & D team will be performed by
his chief Burundi counterpart. He will continue in his role of advisor to
DGR and will monitor the activity of his counterpart.
Accountant
7.        The public service accountant (comptable d'administration public),
Mr. J. Bakuwel, entered on his duties in May 1975. During the first year of
the project he will continue and complete the setting up of a cost accounting
system, particularly through an index card systerl recording consumption of
fuel and spare parts, which will enable costs per type of work to be identified.
A procedure for financial control of the utilization and production of DGR
equipment will be established at the same time. At the end of the first year
the accountant will be replaced by his chief counterpart who, with his
colleagues, should be capable of carrying on the tasks for which the ground-
work has been done by the accountant. During the second year, the accountant
will serve as Advisor to the Direction Administrative et Financiere (DAF;
Directorate of Administration) of DGR, where he will assist the department
head in his management functions, mainly procurement of stocks and preparation
of budget estimates for DGR, and in streamlining the procedures and operation
of DAF. This technical assistance mission will terminate at the end of these
two years.
Programs Supervisor
8.        The programs supervisor, Mr. P. Rucquoy, assumed his duties in
May 1975. During the first two years he will spend half his time at the labor-
intensive construction site for the Mingo-Tora road (RP 84). He will be
responsible for the preparation and start-up of the works, including procure-
ment of tools, choice of equipment stocks, establishment of laborers' camps,
selection of applicants for jobs as administrative and technical assistants
to the contruction manager, and distribution of foodstuffs to workers as
provided under the World Food Program (WFP). In addition, during these first
two years, he will supervise the formulation of annual mechanized and manual
road maintenance programs for the national highway network. These programs,
including annual equipment and fuel supply requirements and annual budget
estimates for each of the maintenance zones will be prepared by his principal
Burundi counterparts, i.e., the four road maintenance zone chiefs already
assigned to the chief towns in each zone (Bujumbura, Ngozi, Gitega and Bururi).
This technical assistance mission will terminate at the end of two years.
Structures and Bridges Supervisor
9.       ZThe structures and bridges supervisor, Mr. J.!. Bontemps, assumed
his duties in October 1977. His duties will be to complete the training of
the four bridge-building crews already on the job and to train two new crews



-48-
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 5
so that the whole of the country will be covered. One of the two new crews
to be established will be responsible for construction of infrastructure
under the metal bridges program financed by the Federal Republic of Germany
for the period July 1981-June 1983. The expert's main task will be to
supervise his six chief counterparts, four of whom are already in their
jobs as foremen of the bridge-building crews. The technical assistance
mission of the structures and bridges supervisor will terminate at the end
of two years.
Work Brigade Supervisor
10.       The work brigade supervisor, Mr. Baccus, took up his duties in
August 1978. He is responsible for DTE's only mechanized road brigade.
The good progress made in training his counterparts, particularly the
brigade chief and his assistant, will make it possible to limit his current
role in the work of the mechanized brigade to supervision. In addition to
supervising the work of the road brigade his main duties will be:
- to establish a complete program for the resurfacing works;
- to prepare the bidding documents for the supply of vehicles and
road equipment needed to establish a second road resurfacing
brigade and to replace the vehicles and equipment now being used
by the first brigade; and
- to select personnel for the second road resurfacing brigade.
Once these operations have been completed and the equipment ordered has
arrived in Burundi, the road brigades supervisor will begin in-the-field
training of the second road resurfacing brigade and will supervise both
brigades in carrying out the resurfacing works included in the Third Highway
Project. The period of this technical assistance will be three years.
Mechanic
11.       The inclusion of this new function in the consultant team has
become necessary to ensure proper utilization of the equipment belonging to
the road crews. The post will be occupied by a mechanic with experience in
repairing civil construction equipment and trucks. The person selected
should be capable of creating a good working atmosphere among the Burundi
mechanics and of training at least three counterparts capable of replacing
him at the end of his mission. His mission will be for three years. A
more detailed description of the duties of this post will be found in
Attachment 2 to this Annex.

BURUNDI
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Terms of Reference for a Study on Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Paved Roads
I. Goals
1.        The total length of the paved road network in Burundi is only
280 km but under an ambitious asphalting program it will be extended to 850 km.
2.        For Lack of sufficient resources, some current and periodic
maintenance operations on the paved road system have had to be postponed.
Making up these delays and extending the network as planned will put an addi-
tional burden on the maintenance services of DGR. The Government of Burundi
would therefore like to make a study of limited scope (five man-months of
work) on rehabilitation and maintenance of the paved road netwcork. The purposes
of this study are as follows: (i) to prepare, for the use of DGR, a five-year
repair and maintenance program covering the period 1982-86, together with an
indicative program for the following years; (ii) to make recommendations as
to the methods to be adopted to implement the program and in particular to
determine what measures should be taken from the standpoint of organization,
personnel and equipment for work to be carried out by force account; and
(iii) to estimate the financial consequences of the recommended program.
Part of the functions of the Research and Development (R & D) consultants
engaged by the Government will be to assist in carrying out this maintenance
program; they will undertake the proposed study without any increase in
the fees already fixed under the contract.
II. Duties of the consultants
A.        General
3.        Consultants R & D will carry out all the analyses of a technical,
organizational and financial nature involved in pursuit of the objectives
indicated above. They will have total responsibility for analysis and
interpretation of all the data collected and for the conclusions and recom-
mendations included in their report. The nature of this report is specified
in section III below; it should be sufficiently detailed to permit the
calculations to be checked without resource to other documents.

B.        Review of the existing situation
4.        Consultants R & D should make an inventory indicating the condition
of the paved road network and should make due a:Llowance for current and future
road construction programs in establishing the five and ten year maintenance
program. For this purpose, the consultants wil:L undertake the following tasks:
(i)    A study of the existing paved network to identify the sections
requiring major repair works before work can be started on normal routine and
periodic maintenance operations; and
(ii)    A study of the existing organization and mode of operation of
maintenance activities for the paved road network, with particular attention
to the following points:
(a) Present volume of road maintenance work,
(b)  Methods and scheduling of the work,
(c) Personnel and training,
(d) Accounting system and costs, and
(e)  Equipment available and existing workshops
C.        Maintenance program for the paved road  network
5.        In the light of the studies made under section B above and of the
various factors outlined in this section, the consultants will prepare the
repair and maintenance program to be carried out by DTE (Direction technique
de l'exploitation) during the period 1982-86. The program should make a
distinction between rehabilitation operations, on the one hand, and routine
and periodic maintenance on the other. The consultants should also indicate
precisely all the prerequisites for the execution of the program in the
following areas: organization, operation, capital expenditure, budget
appropriations, etc. The report will include:
(a) A timetable of the rehabilitation operations, together with
recommendations on the methods of executing the work (on contract, by force
account or a combination of the two), taking due account of the capability
of the local road construction industry and the already established work
plan for the road crews that carry out force account operations;
(b) A schedule of optimal routi'ne and periodic maintenance of
the paved road network, taking into account the estimated volume of traffic,
with recommendations on methods of execution;
(c) Recommendations concerning methods of work, the degree of
mechanization desirable and personnel pay scales;



- 52 -
ANNEX 3
Attachment 1

(e) An estimate of DTE needs in terms of equipment, spare parts,
and workshops to ensure proper implementation of the proposed program;
(f) An estimate of annual costs (broken down between foreign and
local currency costs) of the proposed road repair program, together with
recommendations with regard to accounting, budgeting and cost analysis; and
(g) Identification of the technical assistance and training needs
implied in the program.
III. Report
6.        Consultants R & D will prepare and submit a draft report describing
the program recommended, the organizational structure, operations, capital
investment and the professional training that will have to be provided.

Terms of Reference for Consultants ORT
I. Background
1.        Following the recommendations of a study of training needs in the
road construction and maintenance sector, the Government of Burundi (Ministry
of Public Works, MTP) on August 2, 1978 signed a technical assistance contract
with the firm that had prepared the study, namely, Organization for Rehab-
ilitation through Training (ORT). This contract, for a period of 18 months
from October 1978 (reduced from the .30 months originally proposed due to a
lack of funds), represented the first phase in a program of training and
retraining of personnel employed in the road construction and maintenance
sector.
2.        The services provided by ORT under this first phase were financed
under the First Highway Project (Credit 467-BU). A second phase financed
under a Project Preparation Advance for the Third Highway Project (Credit
P-102-BU), which was also entrusted to ORT, will end on June 30, 1981. This
second phase, lasting 14 months, will more or less cover the work that had
to be cut out of the original contract. MTP requested that IDA include
the third phase of the program and that it be executed by ORT under the
proposed Third Highway Project. This final phase of the program, to which
the present terms of reference refer, will run from July 1, 1981 to June 30,
1984. As for the two previous phases, the contract will be between the
Government of Burundi and ORT.
3.        The technical assistance given by ORT will continue to be provided
mainly through the following three training centers:
- The School of Public Works in Bujumbura trains intermediate level
public works technicians. The school was founded in 1969 and during phases 1
and 2 of the program was reorganized to graduate 10-12 technicians per year
from 1983 after completion of four training courses.
- The Gitega Training Center, which trains supervisory level road
maintenance personnel, was set up at the end of the first phase of the program.
- The Brigade-Ecole (Road Crew Training School) at Rushubi was
established recently under the second phase of the program to provide
practical training of road equipment mechanics.

Scope of Works and Objectives
1.        The expert will provide assistance to the Direction Technique des
Etudes et du Controle (DTEC) a department of the Direction Generale des Routes
(DGR); he will report directly to the Director. According to the legal documents
establishing the Ministry of Public Works(MTP), DTEC has overall responsibility
for studies in the area of highways and urban roads and for the more specialized
studies described below, and also for supervision of works executed on contract
and for the Soils and Materials Laboratory.
2.   (a)  The Studies Division is responsible for:
- preparing and supervising contracts entered into with engineering
consultants for the study of major roadworks;
- executing directly studies of small or medium-scale works, including
preparation of the bidding documents if the works are let on contract;
- preparing contracts with engineering consultants for supervision of
major roadworks;
- scheduling such studies and works;
- collecting and updating statistical data relating to roads and road
vehicles;
- conducting economic studies or supervising such studies if they are
made by private firms;
- preparing typical specifications, regulations, standards and various
kinds of draft legislation.
The Division includes a drafting office and a topographical team.

Planning Expert at IITPT
Objectives
1.        For a landlocked country such as the Republic of Burundi, access to
safe, efficient and economical external transportation routes is of paramount
importance. The country depends on the transportation infrastructures and
facilities of its neighboring countries for all surface transportation, and
has experienced disruptions of its regular import and export traffic as
the result of political and economic events in those neighboring countries.
At present, Burundi is using two principal transportation routes, but other
alternative routes exist for at least part of its foreign trade. However,
development of both the existing and the alternative routes requires invest-
ment both in Burundi and in its neighboring countries. What is more, the
costs of using the different routes are extremely unequal. Lastly, admin-
istrative measures and regulations in the neighboring countries represent a
considerable hindrance to transit traffic. Burundi should therefore reach
agreement with its partners on policies for the development and use of
external transportation routes that will guarantee access to those routes at
the lowest cost. Up to now, this goal has not been systematically pursued,
and the Republic of Burundi intends to create an international transportation
analysis and planning unit at the Ministry of Transportation and Communica-
tions, for which it will recruit a transportation expert. This expert, who
will be required to train national counterparts, will have, inter alia, the
following principal tasks:
Principal Tasks
2.   Elaboration of policies for the development and utilization of
external transportation routes:
(i)  forecasting of export and import volumes;
(ii)  securing of information on the transportation costs by
different routes and different modes, and preparation of
a system of valuation for the other elements of transportation
service, such as rapidity, safety and regularity, with a
view to forecasting transportation demand by route and mode;
(Mi)  forecasting of transportation flows by route and mode, and
preparation of recommendations on policies for, the develop-
ment and utilization of routes and modes; and
(iv) helping in the preparation of the Government's position for
negotiating with transit countries on the development
and utilizatin of international transport routes.



- 65 -
ASNEX 6
Page 6 of 7
3     Facilitation of international transportation:
(i) obtain information on the measures and regulations in the
transit countries that are hindering international
transportation;
(ii) prepare recommendations, in the light of experience and
procedures existing in other parts of the world, designed to
eliminate or reduce the problems affecting transit traffic; and
(iii)  help in the preparation of the Government s position for
negotiating with transit countries regarding facilitation.
4,    Project appraisal:
(i) prepare the terms of reference for studies and monitor studies
in progress; and
(ii) train counterparts in project appraisal methods on the basis
of specific case studies and by monitoring feasibility
studies carried out by consultants.
5     Programming and coordination for the entire transportation sector:
(i) define selection criteria for the preparation of investment
programs in liaison with the Ministry of Planning;
(ii) work in close cooperation with the Ministry of Planning,
the Ministry of Public Works, and possibly with other
ministries, in the preparation of a transportation sector
plan;
(iii) evaluate the financial and budgetary effects of programs
in course of preparation and ascertain their compatibility
with the objectives and the financial constraints of the Plan
in general and the plan for the transportation sector in
particular; and
(iv) assure coordination of studies financed or prepared by other
agencies, e.g. World Bank, UNCTAD, FED, etc.
6.   Supervision of the sector and monitoring of the projects:
(i) assist with the creation of a system for the supervision
of public companies in the transportation field, and with
the preparation of performance indicators for those companies;
and
(ii) monitor project implementation in the transport field.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project Progress Reporting Requirements
Project Progress Reports
1.        The Borrower will prepare Progress Reports that should be submitted
quarterly in triplicate, no later than one calendar month after the end of the
quarter.  The first report should cover the quarter ending December 31,
1.981.
2.        The Progress Reports should contain the information described
below:
(a)  General Information:  This section should refer to
Project Monitoring Indices (see Attachment) in reporting
the following:
(i) the physical progress accomplished to date
of report and during the reporting period;
(ii)  actual or expected deviations from the project
implementation schedule;
(iii)  actual or expected difficulties or delays and
their effects on the implementation schedule,
and the steps planned or taken to overcome the
difficulties and avoid further delay;
(iv) expected changes in the completion date of the
project;
(v) key personnel changes in DGR's staff, consultants
or contractor;
(vi) matters which may affect the cost of the project;
and
(vii) any development activity likely to affect the
economic viability of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project Implementation
schedule, should show the progress in each project component.
(c)  A financial statement should be set out i'n tabular form and
indicate for each project component:



- 68-
ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3
(i) original estimated cost;
(ii) revised cost, if appropriate;
(iii) actual expenditure;
(iv) projected expenditure; and
(v) actual and projected withdrawals from the
Credit Account.
(d) Finally, Progress Reports should state the status of action
on each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
3.        Progress Reports will be an important input in the preparation of
the Project Completion Report.
Project Completion Report
4.        The Borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to
be submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the
Closing Date.
5.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation
by the Borrower and the Association's Operating Departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project. The PCR will examine
and assess:
(a)  the performance by the Borrower and the Association of
their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement
and whether the Association could have been more helpful;
(b)  the results that can be expected from the project, as
compared with expectations at appraisal, and whether
the original expectations were realistic; and
(c)  whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could
have been done better.
6.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return was
estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculation should be
as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a minor
portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex with the
relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.

7'.       The basic documents to be referred to are:
(a)  Credit application;
(b)  Feasibility studies, preappraisal report and project
brief;
(c)  Appraisal report;
(d)  Credit Agreement document and supplementary letters;
(e)  Supervision reports;
(f)  Quarterly Progress Reports;
(g)  Project correspondence files; and
(h)  Miscellaneous evaluation reports.
8.        The Highways Division, Eastern Africa Projects Department, will
review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs Department.
After approval by the Highway Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the Bank
Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responsible for
conducting an audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exercise. This
audit can lead to suggestions for changes or additiLons in the PCR as OED
prepares the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for submission to the
Bank Group's Board of Directors. Before going to the Board, the draft
PPAR which includes the PCR, is sent to various Bank Group divisions, to
the Government and occasionally to consultants (especially if they have
been criticized).
