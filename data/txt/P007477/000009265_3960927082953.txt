OF TME INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AN  D3VELOPNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A FROPOSED LOAN
TO JANAICA
POR AN  3RG5ECrY RCWNSTRUCTION IMPORT LOAN
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Emergency Reconstruction Import Loan to Jamaica for US$30 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 17 years, including
5 years of grace, at the standard variable rate. It would finance critical
import needs of the Government reconstruction program following the damage
caused by Hurricane Gilbert on September 12, 1988.
2.       Background.  On September 12, Hurricane Gilbert, one of the most
powerful in the Western Hemisphere in this century, struck Jamaica with
winds approaching 140 miles per hour, causing extensive damage to the whole
island. Particularly badly hit weres (i) the housing sector, with half of
the housing stock affected to some extent (mostly roofs), and about
10,000-30,000 houses destroyed; (ii) the agriculture sector with crops in
bananas, coconuts, cocoa, coffee, part of the local food production (yams
and other tree crops) and the whole broiler industry suffering considerable
damage and completely wiped out in some areas; (iii) electricity
distribution, with poles uprooted or snapped throughout the island, causing
serious disruptions in power supply to all economic activities and key
social services such as hospitals and water distribution; and (iv) other
public buildings, with important damage reported to the school and health
service network, already in serious need of rehabilitation prior to the
hurricane.
3.       Although the tourism sector, the most important foreign exchange
earning sector in Jamaica (38X), was also affected, the Government
estimates that about 90S of room capacity will be fully operational by
December 15, i.e at the start of the winter tourism season.
Bauxite/Alumina Production, the second largest foreign exchange earner
(20Z), was not seriously affected, except for a temporary disruption of
production. Hanufacturing suffered some loss of production and damage to
inventories, but should resume production as soon as electricity services
are reestablished. Transport infrastructure was relatively less affected
as the damage from the hurricane was mostly caused by wind.  Fortunately,
and unexpectedly, the hurricane did not cause a strong surge. 'i the sea
level and/or extensive rains.
4.       The damage was the most significant at the eastern and western
ends of the island -- where the hurricane entered and left Jamaica -- but
the whole island was affected to varying degrees. Fortunately, the loss of
life was limited (45 reported deaths) thanks in part to sound prevention
measures by the Government's Office of Disaster Preparedness.
5.       Damage Assessment and Economic Impact:  Preliminary estimates of
damage to the capital stock amount to about US$0.8-1.2 billion; this is
quite substantial for an economy the size of Jamaica, with an annual GDP of
about US$2.9 billion (1987). While it is much too soon to assess fully the



-2-
economic impact of the disaster, it is clear that it will be pervasive and
that it will represent a setback to the Medium Term Economic Framevork
Program (MTFP) agreed with the Bank and the Fund in November 1987, as in
addition to the loss of capital stock, Jamaica will also face significant
revenue and foreign exchange losses until its productive capacity is fully
reestablished.
6.       Before Gilbert, Jamaica was in the process of consolidating a much
needed economic recovery following a long and difficult adjustment process,
with positive growth rates of 5Z registered in the last two years,
accompanied by significant reductions in both the overall public sector
deficit (from around 14S of GDP in 1985 to 6S in 1987) and balance of
payments current account deficit (from about 1SZ in 1985 to 4S in 1987).
The economy was on target for another year of 5Z real growth, and continued
adjustments in the fiscal and external deficits along the agreed levels
(respectively 4? and 5S of GDP). Jamaica also had just completed
negotiations on a new IMF Stand By Arrangement of SDR 82 million. However,
Jamaica's economy was still vulnerable, particularly in view of its high
external debt (US$3.9 billion representing 134? of GDP) and debt service
requirements (46? after rescheduling). Thus, the viability of the NTFP
heavily depended on (i) continued rescheduling of the commercial and Paris
Club debt; and (ii) continued availability of concessional assistance
flows. These were broadly in place at the time of the hurricane.
7.       Preliminary estimates from a recent economic mission indicate that
the growth rate may decline to about 3? in PY88189 (from the 5.5? estimated
before the hurricane) as a result of Gilbert. In addition, the hurricane
will cause further structural changes in the economy. Particularly hard
hit were the low income housing sector and poor farmers. Fortunately, the
medium term prospects appear more favorable, with GDP growth projected to
resume at a 4 to 5? pace in 1Y89190, thanks to a large increase expected in
construction activities, a likely resumption of tourism to pre-hurricane
levels within one year, and resumption of some agricultural production
after the loss of one season's crops. Foreign inflows are expected to
increase substantially to support the reconstruction efforts, thanks to a
most positive donor response (see below) and a large increase expected from
reinsurance flows. Based on very tentative projections, however, the
fiscal and the current account deficits are projected to widen to about -92
and -102 of GDP respectively in FY88/89, causing a setback of about two
years compared to the targets included in the MTFP.
8.       A critical period for the Government will be the next six months.
Traditional foreign exchange cash flow problems in Jmaica will be
exacerbated by the loss in foreign receipts (estimated at US$350 million),
while imports may rise substantially to meet reconstruction needs. In
addition, the budget deficit will increase to meet the emergency needs of
the poor and initiate reconstruction of economic and social infrastructure.
While most of this increase is expected to be financed by external flows,
careful management of the reconstruction program will be needed to avoid
budgetary and foreign exchange pressures over this crucial period.
Negotiations are ongoing with the IMF on these crucial aspects with a view
to finalizing the revisions needed in the recently agreed Stand By.
Moreover, continued adherence by the Government to its reform agenda,
progressive reduction in the debt service -ratio, continued support on
concessional terms by the donor community, and debt rescheduling as



-3
appropriate, will be essential factors over the medium term ln view of the
fragility inherent in a country like Jamaica, with a small, open economy
and a high external debt. Therefore, close monitoring of the economic
situation will const'tute a high priority over the next few months.
9.       Reconstruction Program and Donors Response.  Immediately following
the hurricane, the Bank organized a special Donors Meeting in Berlin,
during the Bank's Annual Meetings. The Prime Minister presented the broad
damage estimates from the hurricane, outlined the Government's proposed
reconstruction program, and presented its financing requirements. Of the
estimated US$1 billion required to meet the emergency reconstruction needs,
he expected about hal- the amount to coni from reinsurance inflows and was
therefore seeking about US$0.5 billion in concessional external assistance
to meet the incremental requirements. In view of the substantial insurance
coverage of the private sector and wealthier homeowners, the Government
reconstruction program would focus on reconstruction of key public social
and economic infrastructure, targeted programs to assist the most affected
low income groups, and incentive programs to revitalize production and
exports, with emphasis on agriculture.
10.      The total cost of the Government's reconstruction program
developed since then amounts to about US$600 million, of which almost half
will be needed to rehabilitate damaged public infrastructure (US$300
million). The rest of the program consists of (i) a targeted assistance
program to repair low income housing units (US$145 million) through the
provision of building certificates, as grants, to purchase construction
materials; actual construction would however be carried out by the
beneficiaries themselves with assistance of supervision teams; (ii) a
comprehensive agricultural program (US$125 million) of grants to poor
subsistence farmers to purchase seeds and other inputs, and lines of credit
at concessional interest rates to commercial farmers, to revitalize
agriculture production; and (iii) various transfers (US$25 million) to
launch a vigorous tourism promotion campaign, provide limited and temporary
food assistance to the poor and finance other small emergency works.
Assistance to manufacturing and tourism will be mainly channelled through
existing credit mechanisms. In addition to these reconstruction
activities, additional food imports, estimated at about US$60 million over
the next six months, will also be needed until the local food production
resumes to its pre-hurricane levels.
11.      The donors' response since the Berlin Meeting has been most
positive. Through reallocations and incremental assistance, it is expected
that about US$450 million should be made available in the near future, on
highly concessional terms. This should be sufficient to cover the bulk of
the reconstruction program, when taking into account local financing by the
banking sector, Government agencies and the beneficiaries of the grant
programs. Further balance of payments support will, however, be necessary
in view of the limited foreign exchange availability in the country due to
the high external debt service burden and the sharp reduction in export
revenues until Jamaica's productive capacity is fully reestablished. In
addition, the reconstruction program is not yet finalized as damage
estimates are still being assembled. A key issue in managing the
reconstruction program will also be the timing required for donors to
finalize their pledges, and the flexibility in the donor flows to meet the
priority reconstruction needs.



-4-
12.      Rationale for Bank luvolvemeut.  In Jamaica, the Bank has
traditionally maintained a leading role among the external financing
agencies through its economic policy dialogue; the joint preparati'n of the
MTFP and the related resource mobilization tour with the Government as well
as a broad Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) review in 1987; a Social
Sectors strategy review in 1988; regular donors meetings in the context of
the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCKD); and
continuous ad hoc assistance on the broad financing program supporting the
MTFP.
13.      While  emergency relief was efficiently coordinated by the
Government, UNDP and other donors in the field in the immediate aftermath
of the hurricane, the Bank sought to complement these efforts by assisting
the Government to prepare a broad reconstruction program for the country
and to mobilize the financing required to support it. An identification/
preparation mission was sent to Jamaica on September 21, 1988, followed by
appraisal work in the month of october. In addition, the Bank provided
assistance in establishing a small team in the Ministry of Finance,
financed by UNDP, to coordinate the reconstruction program; and in
supporting the Bank of Jamaica's request to a syndicate of commercial banks
for a bridge loan to finance critical emergency imports. Contacts with the
major donor agencies were maintained on a continuing basis, following the
Donors Meeting in Berlin.  As a result, it is expected that the proposed
loan will assist the Government in securing further cofinancing on a
parallel basis. In addition to the proposed loan, the Bank is processing
reallocations in two ongoing loans --the Power IV project (Loan 2869-JM),
recently made effective, and the Water and Sewerage project (Loan
2422-JM)-- to meet emergency reconstruction needs in these two sectors. It
is also reviewing possible future lending to help meet the medium term
needs of the reconstruction program in housing and watershed protection.
14.      Despite the setback caused by the hurricane and notwithstanding
the special effort required in the present circumstances, the Bank will
also aim at continuing to support the adjustment process in Jamaica. The
Government has already indicated that it intends to pursue the reform
agenda included in the MTPP. Thus, updating of the MNTFP and the processing
of key policy based operations presently under preparation in agriculture,
and in trade reform and the financial sector, will continue to deserve high
priority as well as acceleration of a broad social sector program presently
under preparation.
15.      Proposed Loan Objectives and Description.  Immediately following
the hurricane, the Government requested the Bank to prepare an emergency
import loan to help finance the country's reconstruction needs, which would
enable the mobilization of additional cofinancing kn concessional terms.
With these objectives in mind, the proposed loan aims not only at financing
urgent import requirements of the Government recon.struction program, but
also at providing a sound framework for its overall coordination and
implementation.
16.      The proposed loan would disburse against a positive list of
imports which has been designed to support the emergency reconstruction
program in low income housing, agriculture and public infrastructure. It
would finance: (i) construction and building materials and equipment; (ii)
selected transport equipment for public agencies; (iii) selected



-5-
agricultural supplies; and (iv) equipment and materials for electric power
restoration. These categories were developed in close coordination with
the financing available from other sources. Loan proceeds will be managed
by the Bank of Jamaica, which will make the foreign exchange available to
public and private importers in line with the priorities and procedures
agreed under the reconstruction program. The proposed loan also includes
appropriate mechanisms and procedures to: (i) ensure that implementation
of the major program components would follow appropriate reconstruction
standards; (ii) review possible mechanisms to mitigate the impact of
similar catastrophes in the future; (iii) establish and monitor iligibility
criteria and supervision mechanisms for the low income assistance programs;
(iv) ensure that rebuilt activities would take place according to sound
economic principles; and (v) coordinate the financing and implementation of
the whole program on a continuing basis. Technical assistance needs to
implement reconstruction activities have been covered by other donors on a
grant basis. In view of the emergency import needs, and the tight foreign
exchange cash flow of the country, the proposed loan would include
retroactive financing of 30Z of the loan amount for expenditures incurred
after September 21, 1988.  A summary of the Government reconstruction
program and of its tentative external financing plan is shown in
Schedule A. Procurement methods, loan disbursement categories and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B.
17.      Actions Agreed Upon.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
on the following: (a) low income housing program? eligibility criteria
for Government grant assistance; implementation arrangements for the
program; study of possible low income housing insurance schemes; and
maintenance of appropriate arrangements for import and distribution of
building materials; (b) agricultural program: eligibility criteria for
Government grant assistance; review of the policy framework for the
reconstruction of the broiler industry; limits on special reconstruction
credit facilities; and study of feasibility of crop and credit insurance
schemes; (c) economic and social infrastructure: study of Government self
insurance policy and of building code and enforcement procedures; and
institutional arrangements for monitoring and integrating the
reconstruction program within the Government's overall investment program;
*          and (d) donor coordination:  establishment and maintenauce of a committee
and secretariat to coordinate the reconstruction program and monitor
external flows available over the reconstruction period. Loan
effectiveness conditions are thatt  (a) the low income household survey
will have been completed; (b) implementation teams will have been set up;
and (c) a committee will have been set up to coordinate the reconstruction
program and monitor the flows of foreign aid available.
18.      Benefits and Risks.  quick implementation of the reconstruction
program is paramount if the economy is to get back on track rapidly. The
emphasis on low income groups in addition to public infrastructure ie also
appropriate as these groups were the most extensively affected by the
hurricane and have little protection or savings to meet their needs. The
proposed loan would provide needed balance of payments support to meet the
import requirements of the recnnstruction program at a crucial time when
export earnings have declined and import requirements have increased
substantially. The major risks associated with the loan are (i) the
adequacy of the Government strategy towards low income groups in the
present emergency and pre-election climate; (ii) adequate implementation of



-6-
the program in view of the limited capacity of the administration,
compounded by the large increase in construction activities expected from
the private sector; and (iii) timing of the loan in relation to the overall
foreign exchange cash flow in Jamaica in view of the reinsurance inflows
expected and the timing of disbursements from other major donors.
19.      Regarding (i), the proposed arrangements on low income programs
are the most appropriate to deal with the present emergency based on
similar experience in other countries; in addition, the agreements reached
on the survey methodology, eligibility criteria and distribution and
monitoring mechaniams provide a good framework for their implementation,
even when taking into account the increased risks associated with an
election climate. Regarding (ii), the proposed assistance programs for low
income housin8 and poor farmers have been specifically designed to li,it
direct public sector involvement as they would mostly rely on self he4p and
existing market mechanisms.   Traditional public agencies are also being
assisted through emergency technical assistance and/or reallocations within
ongoing programs financed externally. Care has also been taken to ensure
that reconstruction activities will take place along hurricane resistant
specifications. Regarding (iii), the economic mission has reviewed the
overall financing plan and the Bank of Jamaica's (BOJ) external cash flow
situation; these indicate a need for continued balance of payments support
for at least the next 18 months. The proposed Bank loan would be
particularly timely as the next three months will constitute a critical
period in view of the need for immediate financing to start the
reconstruction process, while traditional financing agencies process their
loans and aid programs, and insurance companies process their claims.
20.      Recomuendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan of US$30
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
