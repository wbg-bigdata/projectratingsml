PRIVATIZATION ADJUSTMENT LOAN (3595-PE) and
PRIVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN
(3540-PE)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Privatization Adjustment
Loan (PAL) and the Privatization Teclhnical Assistance Loan (PTAL) in Peru. The two
loans are combined into one ICR as they had a common objective and were prepared,
appraised, implemented and supervised primarily by the same project team in Peru and in
the Bank. This approach of a joint IC:R for the two projects was endorsed by the World
Bank's Operations Evaluation Department.
This ICR was prepared by Stephen Ettinger (Consultant) and reviewed by Robert
.R. Taylor and Jyoti Shukla (Task Managers), Susan Goldmark (Sector Leader, LCSFP),
and Maria Victoria Lister (Quality Assurance Unit). The Aide Memoire of the
Completion Mission is included as Appendix A.
The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing separate
'evaluations of both projects' implementation, which are included as Appendices B (for the
PAL) and C (for the PTAL). The Borrower has also reviewed the Bank's contribution to
the ICR.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
PERU
PRVATIZATION ADJUSTMENT LOAN (3595-PE) and
PRIVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (3540-PE)
1.  Introduction. This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL) in the amount of US$250 million equivalent and the
Privatization Technical Assistance Loan (PTAL) in the amount of US$30 million
equivalent. The PTAL was approved on December 10, 1992, and the PAL was approved
four months later on April 20, 1993. The two loans are combined into one ICR because
they had a common objective and strategy, and were prepared, appraised, implemented
and supervised primarily by the same project team in Peru and in the Bank. This approach
was endorsed by the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department.
2.  Project Objectives. The objective of both loans was "to support the privatization
program and related sectoral policy, legal and regulatory reforms," in order to "promote
competition and private investment, and contribute to improved fiscal performance and
economic efficiency." The PAL established targets for both privatization and regulatory
reform. The PTAL provided technical assistance support to achieve these targets by
fiancing consultants and investment banks to assist COPRI, the privatization agency, in
the sale or liquidation of state enterprises and the development of the regulatory systems
for the main sectors involved.
:3.  These loans were made at a critical time in Peru, when it was beginning a profound
economic and political transformation, and reentering the global economic and financial
system. As such, in addition to their specific objectives, they also formed part of the wider
strategy of supporting that broader transformation. Privatization was seen as particularly
critical in the overall program, because it was considered to be one of the more irreversible
of the reforms.
4.  The privatization and sectoral reform objectives were clear, realistic, important and
appropriate for Peru. They were in lirLe both with Peru's own economic strategy and with
trends throughout the region and the world. The projects also correctly called for the
sectoral reforms early in the process. Only in the case of fisheries, however, did the Bank
err in setting sectoral reform as a disbursement condition for two tranches.
5.  Implementation Experience and Results. Overall, the outcome of both loans is
evaluated to be Satisfactory. Peru privatized much more than was required by the PAL
(75% of the agreed agenda, as compared to the third tranche requirements of 30% offered
for sale and 15% actually sold). It has also established sophisticated and relatively well-



iii
functioning regulatory systems for public utilities in the telecommunications, electricity
and water sectors, and management systems for key natural resource industries such as
mining and hydrocarbons. Indeed, Peru's privatization experience ranks with those of
Chile and Argentina as the success stories of Latin America. Not only was the process
speedy and comprehensive, but it was also carried out in a relatively smooth and extremely
transparent manner.
6.  Achievements. The program has already brought major benefits to Peru.
Enterprises which prior to privatization were losing $2.5 billion per year were sold for
$7.5 billion, and mobilized a roughly equivalent amount of additional foreign investment in
the subsequent five years. In only four years, the privatized telephone company has
increased the density of lines from 2.9 to 7.5 per 100 people. Later sales of the
Government's remaining shares in several companies have helped capital market
development, and a program of soft credit for acquiring shares has broadened stock
ownership to poorer Peruvians. Mining privatization has forced a clean-up of existing
pollution, and the new foreign investors are adhering to higher international environmental
standards.
7.  Delays. Both loans did experience substantial delays, for different reasons. In the
case of the PAL, the original timetable was extremely optimistic, given the complexity of
the privatization process, and the many large and small state enterprises involved. This
was anticipated by both the Government and the Bank at the time of loan approval, and
was considered to be one way of maintaining pressure on the many actors involved.
Additionally, there were major delays in two sectors, petroleum and fisheries, because of
disagreements about (a) how to privatize Petroperu, and (b) what fisheries management
system to adopt. The Petroperu issue was eventually agreed and resolved satisfactorily,
but the fisheries dispute required waivers to be granted for the second and third tranches.
8.  In the case of the PTAL, the main delay in disbursement was, ironically, the result of
the program's success. In addition to the PTAL, COPRI's main source of revenue was a
2% share of the net sales proceeds from the privatizations. When the controlling 35%
shares of Peru's two telecommunications enterprises were sold to Telefonica de Espafia
for US$2 billion in February 1994, the immediate need to continue using Bank funds
disappeared (as it was financially advantageous for COPRI to use its non-loan funds first).
Eventually, COPRI was able to make good use of the remaining Bank funds, but on a
much slower schedule.
9.  Sustainability. Privatization is normally a hard reform to reverse. This should be
especially true in Peru given the success of its overall economic reforms and its
privatization program in particular. However, the increasingly negative public perception
of privatization -- public support in Lima has dropped steadily from about 65% in mid-
1992 to 30% in early 1998- - has contributed to slowing down the program and to the
changing of its objective from outright sales to a greater emphasis on concession
contracts. The main reasons for this weakening of public support are the: (i) reduction in
employment in the companies being privatized; (ii) increases in public sector tariffs which



iv
resulted from adopting economic pricing principles; (iii) dominance in the electricity
sector of Chilean companies; and (iv) poor public relations efforts of these companies.
10. At the same time, the Government has failed to counter these criticisms with
adequate publicity in support of privatization and has even issued statements questioning
whether some of the remaining SOEs should be privatized. Government's weakening
support for privatization appears to reflect not only shifting public sentiment but also the
cleparture of key Ministers who were the most active proponents of privatization, the end
of the sense of crisis which made even radical and unpopular economic reforms palatable,
and the absence of clear short-term lincages between privatization and Government's top
priority of poverty reduction, given restrictions under the IMF program on Government's
ability to spend privatization revenues. Continued progress and momentum on the policy
for private participation in infrastructure will require much more pro-active dissemination
of information on the benefits from privatization. If public opinion continues to worsen, it
will significantly affect the pace and commitment to further privatization.
I 1. Government's Performance. Overall, the Government's performance was
extremely good in both of these projects, and is the main reason for their success. It
established an effective and non-bureaucratic institutional structure for privatization, and
showed imagination and flexibility in adding new elements in response to many perceived
shortcomings. That not a single transaLction has been challenged on procedural or
transparency grounds is a remarkable achievement. Sector reforms in hydrocarbons,
telecommunications, mining and water have been equally strong, and effective regulatory
frameworks and institutions are in place and functioning. The only exception to this was
in fisheries, where until the past year, there was virtually no progress. The Ministry of
Fisheries seemed unwilling even to have an open dialogue with the Bank, the industry and
even other parts of the Government. The devastating El Nino of late 1997-early 1998 and
its impact on fisheries contributed to a change in the Ministry's position on this issue. The
Government's decision to use the UNDP's Lima office for disbursement and financial
management also proved to be very wise.
12. World Bank Performance. The Bank's performance in the projects has also been
very good, and this view is shared by almost all of the Peruvian officials. The Bank
provided important technical, and financial support especially during the crucial early stage
of the program, and continually sought solutions to resolve problems. Working
relationships between the Bank and Government were unusually good and the Bank was
appropriately flexible in extending closing dates and granting tranche-release waivers.
13. The Bank's main mistake was including the reform in the fisheries sector as a
conditionality for tranche release. Relorm in this sector was not as clearly a part of the
Government's own reform priorities and was included more at the behest of the Bank.
Moreover, this sector was already in private hands, and reform required the gradual
building of a consensus within the industry, a process inconsistent with trying to meet
tranche-release deadlines. Not only was the inappropriateness of framing such a policy
dialogue in this sector as a tranche condition not recognized at appraisal, but the issue was



v
not revisited during implementation either. Though the Bank did eventually show some
flexibility in addressing the fisheries issue by granting waivers to both the second and the
third tranche release conditions, the discussions on this sectoral reform were long and
complex, took a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of the supervision team
and distracted from the overall objectives of the operation.
14. The Bank also substantially underestimated the cost of the PTAL. Fortunately,
revenues available to COPRI from the privatizations also greatly exceeded estimates.
Finally, the closing dates were set unrealistically, requiring substantial extensions in the
project implementation periods.
15. Future Operations. With almost all of the smaller state enterprises sold or
liquidated, with the telecommunications, fisheries and industrial sectors fully privatized,
and with the mining sector privatization well advanced and on track, the remaining
privatization issues mainly concern hydrocarbons, electricity, railroads and SEDEPAL
(Lima's water and sewerage company). Of these, only hydrocarbons fell under this
project. In addition to this privatization agenda, the Government is also currently
implementing a substantial program of concessions in electricity transmission, telephony,
ports, airports and roads to invite private participation in other infrastructure sectors and
has requested a follow-up technical assistance loan from the Bank to support this process.
Also, in April 1997 the Government requested Bank assistance to introduce private
participation in SEDAPAL and expand its investment program.
16. Lessons Learned about Privatization.
(a)   Move very fast when a window of opportunity exists, because political
opposition is quick to build once the moment of crisis is over.
(b)   Regulatory reform and the creation of a competitive market must go hand
in hand with privatizations to attract investors, protect consumers, and
maximize economic benefits.
(c)   It is easy to underestimate the cost and time needed for such complex
transactions.
(d)   It is very important to pay adequate attention to public information and
education right from the start, lest public resistance impede the process.
(e)   Top-level political support is critical for success.
(f)   It is important to tap into the knowledge and expertise from the private
sector for such transactions and people from the private sector should be
given key roles in the process.
(g)   Concessioning may be a useful compromise where sale is not possible
politically.



vi
(h)   Concessioning may be a useful compromise where sale is not possible
politically.
17.   Lessons Learned About Bank Lending
(a)   Providing a TA loan alongside an adjustment loan is important both for
facilitating information and for increasing other ministries' stake in the
process.
(b)   It is more efficient to have one technical assistance operation that covers all
privatizations rather than several sector-specific technical assistance
operations.
(c)    Continuity in Bank and Government personnel is very beneficial, because,
established relationships tend to be franker, more cooperative, and based
on fuller information.
(d)   When implementation schedules are intentionally set very tight for
motivational reasons, more flexibility should be allowed in setting and
extending closing dates, so as not to create unnecessary work and tension.
(e)    The experience with the fisheries sector shows that adequate attention
needs to be given to: (i) what is the most suitable management regime for
a sector, (ii) who should have the right to decide; and (iii) the political
economy of the initial distributional effects.
(f)    Use of UNDP or another procurement and disbursement agent can be an
efficient way of avoiding bureaucratic delays in making funds available,
especially where there are many small contracts, as in TA projects.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
PRIVATIZATION ADJUJSTMENT LOAN (3595-PE) and
PRIVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (3540-PE)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. BACKGROUND
1.  Economic Crisis. When President: Alberto Fujimori assumed office in August 1990,
Peru was considered the "basket case" of South America. Its economy was in shambles, a
cholera epidemic was threatening, and thwe "Shining Path" terrorist movement was gaining
strength and expanding its grip from rural areas towards the capital. Peru's external debt
was $22 billion, two-thirds of which was in arrears, and it was in default to the IMF, the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Inflation had reached an
annualized rate of 36,000 percent, per capita income had dropped to the level of thirty
years earlier, 75% of the labor force in Lima was unemployed or underemployed, and real
wages had fallen by 60% over five years.
2.  Impact of SOEs. One of the contributing factors to the economic decline was the
performance of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These were largely the products of
nationalizations of foreign-owned firms Iby Peru's military regimes during the 1960s and
1970s, and dominated the banking, telecommunications, water, electric power,
hydrocarbons, mining, steel and other sectors. The SOEs had become increasingly
inefficient and politicized, and were hampered by government regulations and low,
controlled prices. By 1990, they were losing about $2.5 billion/year, much of which had
to be covered by the budget. In addition, their inability to invest in and modernize basic
infrastructure, especially telecommunications and electricity supply, was constraining
development in the rest of the economy.
3.  Economic Reforms. Although President Fujimori was not elected on an economic
reform program, once he assumed office he took strong and comprehensive measures to
reverse his country's slide. A series of stabilization measures in the areas of taxation,
public expenditures, interest rates and exchange rate policy brought inflation down
dramatically. For the longer term, a structural reform package was introduced, initially
emphasizing trade liberalization and finencial sector reform, but quickly spreading to
specific sectoral changes in energy, industry, agriculture, infrastructure and social services.
4.  Motivation for Privatization. Privatization was not part of the initial set of
reforms, but within a year the President was convinced of the need to launch a



2
comprehensive privatization program. Central to this was his recognition that Peru
lacked the resources to make the necessary investments in the SOEs, especially in energy
and telecommunications, where billions of dollars would be needed to bring the country up
to regional standards. While many top Peruvian officials supported privatization on
philosophical grounds related to the proper roles of the public and private sectors, others,
apparently including the President, endorsed it on more pragmatic grounds. This
distinction, however, was not important operationally, at least in the initial phases. The
country was in crisis, radical measures were needed, and all major elements in the
Government were in favor of privatization
5.  Launching the Privatization Program. On September 25, 1991, Legislative
Decree 674, the "Law for Promotion of Private Investment in State Enterprises,"
established the legal and institutional framework for privatization. It created the Minister-
level Committee for Private Sector Investment (COPRI) as the privatization agency, with
a COPRI secretariat, headed by an Executive Secretary in charge of day-to-day
management. COPRI then established Special Privatization Committees (CEPRIs), in
charge of individual enterprises or sectors being privatized. A single CEPRI was in charge
of a sector such as telecommunications, where sectoral coordination was essential, but in
other cases, such as mining, each major enterprise had its own CEPRI.
6. Bank Adjustment Lending. The Bank, the IMF and the IDB developed a joint
strategy to enable Peru to clear its arrears with them and to get new money to support its
ambitious reform agenda. The Bank approved five adjustment loans during 1992-94. The
Trade Policy Reform Loan and Structural Adjustment Loan were disbursed in single
tranches in March 1993, in conjunction with the clearance of arrears. The first tranche of
the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) was also disbursed at that time. The
Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL) was the fourth of these adjustment loans. The PAL,
the FSAL and the Electricity Privatization Adjustment Loan (EPAL) which followed were
conditioned on an ambitious future program of actions--with privatization of state
enterprises a central element in all three operations. The Privatization Technical
Assistance Loan (PTAL) was designed to provide the technical assistance needed to
accomplish reforms supported through the PAL.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
7.  Overall Objectives. The PAL and PTAL had common objectives: "to assist the
Government in the preparation and implementation of its privatization program and related
sectoral policy, legal and regulatory reforms. These measures would promote competition
and private investment (domestic and foreign), and contribute to improved fiscal
performance and economic efficiency."



3
8.  PTAL Design. The PTAL financed consulting and related services in three areas:
(a)   to facilitate the operations of the COPRI secretariat and the CEPRIs, as
these were temporary agencies whose employees were not regular civil
servants;
(b)   to promote privatization amd private investment in Peru (e.g. by road
shows to attract foreign investors), and to develop programs to assist laid-
off workers from state enterprises; and
(c)   to assist with privatizations and related sectoral policy/regulatory reforms.
Although the banking and electricity sectors were left out of the PAL (because
they were being handled by the FSAL and EPAL, respectively), technical assistance for
privatizing these sectors was included in the PTAL, so that COPRI would get its Bank
financing for technical assistance from only one operation.
9.    PTAL Cost and Financing. The Bank loan of $30 million equivalent was to be
supplemented by ongoing and anticipated funds from Japan ($4.5 million project
preparation grants), UNDP ($0.6 million general support and program evaluation), the
Andean Development Fund ($1.0 million for mining and general support) and Canada
($0.5 million for fisheries privatization). Peru's own contribution, conservatively
estimated at $6.8 million, was to come from the 2% of sales revenues allocated to COPRI.
The total cost, estimated at $43.4 million, turned out to be less than half of the actual cost.
Fortunately, COPRI's revenue from the sales also turned out to be way above estimates
and insufficient financing did not become an issue.
10. PAL Conditionality. The $250 riillion equivalent PAL spelled out the privatization
and sectoral reform objectives which this technical assistance was to support. The
disbursement of the three tranches was then linked to progress in this reform program,
summarized as follows:

The laws and regulations were to be acceptable to the Bank.
I1. The privatization objectives were clear, realistic, important and appropriate for
Peru. They were in line both with Peru's own economic strategy and with trends
throughout the region and the world. Privatization was an important part of Peru's fiscal
strategy (both to eliminate SOE losses and to earn revenue), central to its emphasis on
economic efficiency and private sector development, and was considered the most difficult
reform to undo. The specific privatization targets were quite modest when compared to
the Government's target of privatizing all the SOEs before the end of its five-year
electoral mandate in 1995. Out of a privatization agenda totaling $4,135 million (in book
value), which included the SOEs in all sectors except banking (which was already being
handled under the FSAL), electric power (which was to be the subject of the Electricity
Privatization Adjustment Loan -- EPAL) and railroads, only 30% had to be offered for
sale by the third tranche, and only 15% had to be sold. The specific sectoral targets for
mining and telecommunications were similarly low. These low levels reflected concerns
that political, legal or administrative obstacles might delay the auctions, and that there



5
might be few interested buyers. The privatization process was recognized as being very
demanding for a country that was just emerging from economic and political chaos.
12. The special privatization strategy for Petroperu was also appropriate, because at
the time of negotiations, there was major disagreement about how and even whether to
privatize Petroperu. Because this was such an important SOE, the Bank insisted that it be
privatized, but rather than rush the decision about how to privatize it (i.e., whether to sell
it en bloc or split it up in any of a number of ways), the Bank left this decision for the
second tranche.
13. The sector reform objectives, except for that related to fisheries, were also
appropriate. These reforms were necessary to create the sector structures and rules that
would encourage competition and economic efficiency. The widespread recognition of
the inefficiency of these sectors in Peru created the political environment that permitted
comprehensive reforms. It was recognized that sector policies, laws and regulations
should normally be in place before SOEs are privatized, so that private firms will have
enough confidence in the sectoral framework to enter bids, and enough information to
reasonably decide how much to bid. The PAL was therefore correct in calling for these
laws and regulations to be drafted relatively early in the project (in most cases by second
tranche), and in all cases enacted by third tranche. Telecommunications, mining,
hydrocarbons and water were also the four largest sectors being privatized under the loan.
For telecommunications and water, it was necessary to have regulatory frameworks that
determined, inter alia, how prices were set, so as to protect consumers against
monopolistic practices. For mining and hydrocarbons, the need was to establish rules,
procedures and responsibilities for attracting private investment, assigning exploration and
development rights, and ensuring Government a reasonable share of the rents from
discoveries.
14. The case of fisheries, however, was quite different from these other sectors, and in
retrospect the Bank erred in setting fisheries sector reform as tranche conditions. First,
the fishing industry was already entirely in private hands (as was most of the fish
processing industry). Thus, the linkage between privatization and sector reform was
weak--unlike in the other four sectors covered, where reform was a precondition for
efficient privatization. Second, despite the very general fisheries "policy framework"
agreed under the SAL, the extent to which there was a clear and agreed policy direction
was in fact considerably less in fisheries, than in the other sectors. Third, the sectoral data
needed for policy formation were much. weaker. And finally, the main benefits of the
fisheries reform advocated by the Bank--the adoption of an ITQ (individual, tradable
quotas) system--were to accrue to the existing fishing industry itself (by reducing its
fishing costs; prices were set by the world market, and catch limits were set on biological
grounds). Thus, it was necessary, from a practical as well as a political perspective, to
obtain the consent of the industry. And, given the large number of fishing companies, the
differences in perspective and economic interest among them, and the novelty of the ITQ
concept this would necessarily be a long process, quite inconsistent with the anticipated
tranche-release timetable. In the Bank's eagerness to reform this important sector (second



6
to mining in export revenues), these crucial considerations were overlooked. In
retrospect, the Bank should have limited its involvement in fishing to technical assistance
under the PTAL, as a vehicle for initiating a sectoral dialogue.
15. Project Timetables. The first tranche was released upon loan effectiveness, in
recognition of the substantial progress already achieved. Because Peru had set the target
of completing the privatizations and related sectoral reforms before the July 1995
elections, June 30, 1995 was established as the closing date for the PAL. The closing date
for the PTAL was set six months later, because of the lags involved in disbursing on a
large number of consultancy contracts. These timetables were recognized as being tight,
but were considered useful as a way of inducing faster implementation, as well as of
showing confidence in Peru's ability to meet its privatization targets. But more allowance
should have been made for the likelihood of delays. In particular, the PTAL closing date
was quite inconsistent with the PAL tranche-release privatization targets, for if the Bank
and Government were only confident that 30% of the privatization agenda would be
offered for sale by the end of 1994, it was unrealistic to have assumed that the consultancy
costs for all of the privatizations would be incurred by the end of 1995 (especially as 1995
was the election year).
C. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
16. Macroeconomic Reform. Though the adjustment program and Bank financing for
it was conceived in a period of significant fiscal and external deficit, Peru has since
adhered to its macroeconomic reform program, with excellent results. GDP has grown an
average of 7 percent per annum over the past five years, the highest rate in Latin
America, and by 1997 inflation was down to 6.5 percent, the lowest rate in the past
quarter century. The ratio of investment to GDP rose from 18.6% in 1993 to 24.7% in
1997, the second highest in Latin America. The public sector deficit, even excluding
privatization revenues, was reduced to zero, and net international reserves passed $ 10
billion. At the time of the disbursement of the last tranche in December 1997, Peru's
internal and external balances had improved considerably but the last tranche disbursement
assisted it in meeting the large and unanticipated expenditures for prevention activities
related to an unusually strong El Nifio event in 1997-98, and allowed the country to
continue to meet the targets under its Extended Fund Facility with the IMF.
17. Overall Privatization. Peru's privatization experience ranks with Chile, Argentina
and Bolivia as the success stories of Latin America. Whereas the third tranche condition
was for at least 30% (by book value) of the SOEs (excluding banking, electricity and
railroads) to be offered for sale, and at least 15% actually sold, the actual achievement by
end-1994 (the originally-anticipated date for the third tranche) was about 40% on both
counts, and the individual third tranche targets for telecommunications and mining had
also been exceeded. By the actual (early 1998) closing date, 75% of enterprises on the list
had been offered and sold. The only important SOEs on the agenda which have not yet



7
been privatized are SEDAPAL (the Lirma water company), the oil pipeline and Talara
refinery of Petroperu, the hydropower plants and Cerro de Pasco mine of Centromin.
18. Privatization of Petroperu. As anticipated, Petroperu proved to be one of the
most difficult enterprises to privatize. Its initial management was opposed to
p.rivatization, and only after its Presidernt was replaced was progress possible. The
question of whether to sell it en bloc as a "national" (albeit private) oil company, as was
being done, for example, with Argentina's petroleum company YPF, or break it up into
units so as to promote competition, was the next major issue. For the second tranche, the
CGovernment agreed with the Bank that national interests were best protected against
monopolistic abuses by ensuring adequate competition. Accordingly, a privatization plan
was adopted based on open access to storage facilities and separate sale of each major
part of Petroperu, with the purchasers allowed to engage in vertical but not horizontal
integration (so as to ensure competition). With the long-term concessioning of the storage
facilities and the sale of the oil fields and the La Pampilla refinery, the third tranche
conditions (agreed at second tranche) were finally met in December 1997.
19. Overall Sector Reform Prograrn. Peru moved effectively during the
implementation of projects to meet the sector reform conditions in hydrocarbons, mining,
telecommunications and water. It utilized--with PTAL and other resources--leading world
experts to design the basic laws and regulations for these key sectors, carefully studying
the reforms in Chile, Argentina and elsewhere. As in privatization, Peru is now one of the
developing-country models of how to open up the natural resource sectors (hydrocarbons
and mining) to more private sector investment and competition. It also has among the
more advanced independent regulatory systems for public utilities. In the fisheries sector,
hlowever, progress was limited.
20. Hydrocarbons Sector Reform. Peru's wide-ranging reform of this sector had
essentially two parts. One focused on development of private sector oil and gas
production and included the opening the country to private sector exploration and
development, the transfer of the exploration and development concessioning power from
Petroperu to the Government, the establishment of a stable tax regime, and the
transformation of the pipeline into a common carrier. The other part was the shift from
controlled to market prices at the retail and wholesale levels, which has given Peru one of
the most market-determined price sysl:ems in the world. A key to establishing this system
was the requirement of open access tc, and competition between the storage terminals, so
that imported petroleum products could compete with the output of the local refineries.
21. Mining Sector Reform. Reform of the mining sector has been a major success in
Peru, and is now being touted around the world as a model. Among the critical elements
was the geological survey for obtaining, analyzing and presenting basic information to
potentially interested investors, and an efficient system for allocating and adjudicating
mining claims--the massive confusion and backlog of the former system have been
eliminated. Peru has also introduced up-to-date and comprehensive environmental and
safety standards.



8
22. Telecommunications Sector Reform. The reform of this sector involved: (i)
establishing a new tariff structure that ended the cross-subsidization between local and
long distance calls; (ii) rationalizing the sector structure by combining the existing Lima
phone company (ENTEL) with the long-distance and non-Lima local company (CPT); and
(iii) giving the purchaser of the new company controlling shares and a five year monopoly
which ends in 1999. The five year monopoly, which is somewhat shorter than that granted
in other Latin American privatizations (six years in Chile, seven in Venezuela and Mexico,
nine in Argentina), was considered essential to allow time for rate rebalancing, to attract
major operators that would have the experience and resources to operate and improve the
system, and to give them incentives to substantially expand the network. An independent
regulatory agency (OSIPTEL) was created, and has functioned well.
23. Water Sector Reform. In the water and sanitation sector, several antiquated laws
were replaced by a single, comprehensive one. An effective regulatory entity, SUNASS
(the National Superintendency for Water and Sanitation Services), was created, and has
been functioning well. Tariffs in Lima were quadrupled to economic prices. The Bank
has continued assisting this sector under the Lima Water Project. Even though there is
virtually no private sector participation in this sector as yet, the sectoral reforms achieved
in this sector have laid the foundation of such participation in the future. And SEDAPAL
(the Lima water and sewerage company) as well as some municipalities outside of Lima
are now considering the possibility of concessioning of their water companies.
24. Fisheries Sector Reform. Fisheries is the only sector that did not have adequate
progress on sector reform. Although the situation improved markedly during 1997, the
fisheries law and regulations that were enacted in 1992 and in 1994 respectively were not
a substantial improvement and the Ministry continued granting fishing licenses despite the
already excessive size of the fleet and the attendant dangers of over-fishing. Only since
1997 was there significant progress, which included stopping the granting of new licenses,
conducting (by a private firm) a census of fishing boats (which found that actual capacity
was 25% more than had been self-reported) and processing facilities, strengthening the
fisheries research institute (IMARPE), and privatizing the monitoring of fish catches. The
inadequate progress on fisheries reform became a major issue within the Government and
between Peru and the Bank, and eventually required waivers of both the second and third
tranche conditions. Because this was the last outstanding issue, it received inordinate
attention, which may have given some in Peru and the Bank the misleading impression that
the PAL as a whole had been less successful than it actually was. Though the issue
remained difficult throughout project implementation, since 1997, however, a meaningful
dialogue between the Government, industry and international consultants is finally
underway, and this may yet eventually lead to an improved resource management regime
such as ITQs.

D. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECTS
25. Political developments. The privatization program was able to get off to a rapid
start in large part because Congress had given the executive branch the power to
undertake individual sales without Congressional approval. The temporary suspension of
C'ongress in 1992 made COPRI's administration of the program easier, as it did not have
to deal with Congressional oversight during that time. When a new Congress was elected
in 1993, the pro-Government majority strongly supported privatization. Thus, it was not
until 1995, when new presidential elections were held, that privatization was slowed down
for political reasons. In particular, the opposition candidate, Javier Perez de Cuellar, came
out against the privatization of Petroperu, and this was one of the reasons that operation
took so long to get started. The program picked up after the elections, but growing
political criticism has since slowed down the pace. The impact of these political
developments, and the fact that some of the easier enterprises were privatized first, can be
seen in the following table:
Calediar'' Value of Transactions
..%X,00,0'0- . ,

1996          2,669
1997           684
26. Delays in PTAL Disbursements. The PTAL closing date had to be extended for
two years, because the loan was disbuirsing slowly. There was an initial six-month delay in
effectiveness while waiting for Peru to clear its arrears with the Bank, but the main delay
in disbursement was, ironically, the result of the program's success. In addition to the
PTAL, COPRI's main source of revenue was a 2% share of the net sales proceeds from
the privatizations. When a controlling 35% share of Peru's two telecommunications
enterprises was sold to Telefonica de E_spana for US$2 billion on February 28, 1994, the
iimmediate need to continue using Bank funds disappeared as it was financially
advantageous for COPRI to use its non-loan funds first. Eventually, COPRI was able to
make good use of the remaining Bank funds, but on a much slower schedule, and only
because it had to use some of its own revenues for related purposes such as paying
'benefits to displaced workers when the SOEs lacked the resources to do so.
E. PROJE,CT SUSTAINABILITY
27. Difficulty in Reversing Privatizations. One reason that privatization is such a
critical element of economic reform, is that for a variety of legal, economic, political and



10
practical reasons, it is difficult to reverse. Although Latin America suffered waves of
nationalization during earlier decades, repetition of this in the current global context is
hardly imaginable, where country after country is following the same general route of
economic liberalization. Furthermore, the overall economic success of the current
Peruvian administration, especially in contrast with the disastrous results of its "populist"
predecessor, makes any general assault on Peru's economic reforms unlikely. And the fact
that Peru's privatizations were on the whole very successful, in terms of the prices and
investment commitments received, the high-quality firms attracted, and the absence of
even a hint of scandal, should further ensure the sustainability of this program. Finally, the
"Citizens' Participation" program, under which some 40,000 poorer Peruvians have
bought shares in a few privatized companies on soft credit terms, makes reversal even
more unlikely.
28. Growing Public Opposition. Nevertheless, there is cause for concern about the
future, because of the increasingly negative public perception in Peru of privatization.
Public support in Lima, (the only place which is surveyed) has dropped steadily from
about 65% in mid-1992 to 30% now. Even more disturbing is a poll that showed that
72% of Lima residents would like to see their public utilities (electricity and
telecommunications) re-nationalized. The main reasons given for these results are the:
(i) reduction in employment (estimated at 94,000) in the companies that were privatized;
(ii) increases in public sector tariffs in the move to economic pricing which accompanied
the privatizations; (iii) dominance in the electricity sector of Chilean companies, with
whom Peru has had a long, contentious relationship; and (iv) poor public relations efforts
of these companies. This declining popular support for privatization has made that
progran a target for the Government's opponents.
29. Governmental Attitude. At the same time, the Government has failed to counter
these criticisms with adequate publicity in support of privatization, and has even issued
statements questioning whether key remaining SOEs should be privatized. Already, this
has had the effect of slowing down the privatization process, and shifting some enterprises
from sales to concessions. The Government's weakening support for privatization
appears to reflect not only shifting public sentiment but also: (i) the departure of key
Ministers who were the most active proponents of privatization; (ii) the end of the sense
of crisis which made even radical and unpopular economic reforms palatable; and (iii) the
absence of clear short-term linkages between privatization and Government's top priority
of poverty reduction, given restrictions under the IMF program on Government's ability
to spend privatization revenues. This changed public and private attitude towards
privatization, however, has led to considerable slowing down of the privatization program.
Nevertheless, though the Government has withdrawn from an active stance on
privatization per se, it is continuing with its policy to invite private participation in
infrastructure sectors with a parallel program of concessions in electricity transmission,
ports, airports and roads.



I1
F. BANK PERFORMANCE
30. Early Stages. The Bank's overall performance in the projects was very good, and
this view is shared by almost all of the Peruvian officials. The Bank played a particularly
irrmportant role during the crucial early stage of the program, by (a) organizing seminars
that brought in regional and world experts on privatization, (b) being flexible in permitting
the secondment of Bank-group staff, and (c) finding other sources of funds (chiefly
Japanese grants) before arrears with the Bank were cleared. The Bank's support
strengthened key Peruvian officials' cornviction that they were on the right track, made
worldwide expertise available to them on short notice, and increased Peru's credibility vis-
a-vis investment banks and other consultants. With the few exceptions mentioned earlier
(fisheries conditionality and PTAL cost estimates and closing date), overall, the Bank's
project appraisal and negotiations were also sound.
31. Implementation. During project implementation, Bank staff constantly sought
ways to resolve problems and facilitate implementation. Working relationships between
the Bank and Government were unusuedly good, in large part because of the continuity as
well as the expertise of Bank project and sectoral staff involved. The Bank also used first-
rate consultants where it lacked the in-house expertise. Its attention to the need to
restructure and privatize Petroperu, in spite of strong opposition, finally paid off. The
Bank was, in the end, appropriately flexible in extending closing dates and granting
tranche-release waivers (although it could have saved itself a lot of work if these dates and
the fisheries conditions had been better in the first case).
32. Fisheries Sector. But, as at appraisal, the main area in which the Bank did not
perform well during implementation was fisheries. The resource management regime the
Bank advocated, ITQs, was probably appropriate, but despite great effort the Bank was
not able to convince the Peruvian fisheries industry of it, nor demonstrate its practical
applicability in the Peruvian context. There appear to have been several reasons for this:
(i) the Bank never quantified the benefits for Peru of ITQs, which would have made the
issue more concrete and could have become the focus for a sharper dialogue; (ii) the
Bank hedged on the most sensitive issue, the initial allocation of ITQs, and so never came
to grips with the Peruvians' main concern and the inherent political economy of the reform
effort; (iii) Bank consultants, although expert fisheries economists, came primarily from
places where ITQs were accepted, and so did not appear to represent a balanced spectrum
of views; (iv) the Peruvians felt that rather than there being a shared search for the best
system, the Bank was trying to impose its theories on them, and was denigrating Peru's
own experience; (v) the Peruvians resented the use of loan conditionality as a way of
pressuring them to accept a new system; and (vi) the Peruvian fisheries industry was
doing well financially during this period, because of adequate supplies and high prices, and
therefore felt no pressure to enact changes. Although the task manager recognized that
the loan conditionality related to fisheries had "been counterproductive," the Bank never
offered to amend the loan agreement. The Bank also ended up paying inadequate
attention to other reforms (such as privatization of catch monitoring) which were, in fact,
preconditions to applying an ITQ sysl:em successfully. And in pressing the Government to



12
impose a system whose primary objective was to benefit the industry, but which the
industry (wisely or unwisely) opposed, the Bank ended up in the awkward position of
asking the public sector to second-guess the private sector on what was in the latter's
interest.
33. Need for Management Attention. After the Bank had failed to resolve the
fisheries dispute for several years at the task manager level, there was need for higher
management attention to this, but there is no evidence that any such attention was paid.
The task manager did point out in his memos that he believed the conditionality had been
counterproductive, but neither he nor anyone else specifically called for an amendment.
Perhaps the Managing Director's instructions at the time of the waiver for the second
tranche that no such waiver would be authorized for the third tranche inhibited a review
of the appropriateness of the conditionality in the first place and the effectiveness of the
Bank's continued insistence on it.
G. BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE
34. Privatization. Government's performance has been extremely good in both of these
projects, and is the main reason for their success. It established an effective and non-
bureaucratic institutional structure for privatization, consisting of COPRI and the CEPRIs.
The first COPRI President and the Ministers of Economy and Finance worked closely
together to launch the process. Especially in the early years, the COPRI staff were
extremely dedicated and close-knit, and smoothly handled a large number of transactions,
with very few failures. COPRI and most of the CEPRIs made sound decisions to limit
pre-privatization investments, only to require investment commitments where it would be
clearly to the purchaser's advantage, and to downsize the SOEs before sale. Most
importantly, the whole system was so transparent, that not a single transaction has been
challenged for even the appearance of corruption or unfair procedures.
35. Government also showed imagination and flexibility in adding new elements in
response to perceived program shortcomings. In particular, it developed; (i) the Citizens'
Participation (Participation Ciudadana) program, under which over 400,000 Peruvians
bought shares, on credit, in telecommunications and power companies; (ii) the Business
Promotion (Promocion Empresarial) scheme to allow Peruvian companies to purchase
small- and medium-sized SOEs on credit; and (iii) a training program (with IDB
financing) for staff displaced by privatization. In a related area, it is now launching a
program for concessioning of new and existing infrastructure which does not belong to
SOEs (such as ports, airports and roads), and has established PROMCEPRI, modeled
after COPRI, to manage this.
36. However, lately the pace of privatization has slowed. While such weakening in
performance is not unusual once a crisis response is replaced by business as usual, and the
people with original "ownership" of the program have moved on, it is nonetheless
unfortunate, given the important (though few) enterprises still to be privatized (including



13
mtajor ones in the electric power sector, which is being handled by the EPAL rather than
the PAL).
37. Sector Reform. On the sector reform side, Government's overall performance was
equally strong. Sound legislation and regulations were developed for hydrocarbons,
telecommunications, water and mining, and effective regulatory institutions established.
As mentioned above, the only exception to this was in the fisheries sector. Even here,
however, though it is still not clear whether ITQ systems will be adopted for any of Peru's
major fisheries, there has been some progress on biological sustainability, if not yet
economic efficiency, and the issue is finally receiving attention from the sectoral policy
nmakers.
38. Public Information and Dissemination. The other area in which Government's
performance has been weak is in educating the population about the benefits of
privatization and the related sectoral reforms. Opponents of privatization have been able
to turn public opinion against it because Government has not publicized the benefits of the
program. Though the COPRI Secretariat recognized the importance of public relations
and met with unions, church groups, thie press, etc. to explain their program, in retrospect
a, much higher-level and broader Government initiative was required.
39. UNDP Role. The UNDP Lima office played the vital role of managing all of
C:OPRI's funding, including that from ithe PTAL. After the PTAL was effective, the
IJNDP reviewed all the disbursement requests from COPRI and promptly made advances
once it approved them, subject to subsequent review and reimbursement by the Bank.
This system worked very well by avoicling possible delays due to either Government
bureaucracy or the Bank's slow disbursement processes.
H. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
40. Fiscal. Peru's privatization and sectoral reform program has clearly been a success.
The most obvious benefit has been fiscal, as SOEs (including electricity and banks) that
were losing $2.5 billion/year have been sold so far for $7.5 billion (excluding $0.9 billion
in additional capitalization of the companies, as this does not go to the Government). Of
this $7.5 billion, $0.5 billion is in debt paper, $1.0 billion is to be paid over time under the
Citizens' Participation, Business Promotion, and workers' shares programs, or under
concessions/options, and $5.9 billion has been paid in cash. In the vast majority of the
auctions, the bid prices were above the minimum specified; in several cases, most notably
telecommunications, the sales price far exceeded expectations. The $5.9 billion that has
been paid so far represents over half of total foreign investment in Peru over this period.
41. Additional Investment. It is not so straightforward to calculate the additional
investment resulting from the privatization and sectoral reforms, as some investment
would have occurred even without the changes, and some of the investment commitments
(especially in development of new mines) are contingent upon geological findings and



14
world prices. Some $7.7 billion is expected to be invested in the privatized firms over the
first 5 years. Of this, $2.5 billion is to develop the Antamina copper mine; the winning
bidders have until July 1998 to exercise their option to develop this mine.
Telecommunications investments should reach $2.5 billion over 5 years, and another $2
billion is anticipated to be invested in the mining sector. Beyond privatization itself, it is
clear that the sectoral reforms are leading to greater private investment. In the mining
sector, these results are the most obvious: investment in exploration has risen from $10
million per year to $250 million per year, bringing Peru to the level of Chile as the most
attractive developing country in the world for exploration. While most of this has been
from foreign firms (over 100 of them), there is increasing exploration and development by
existing Peruvian mining companies as well. Mining exports are projected to double in the
next 10 years.
42. Improvement in Basic Infrastructure. The most notable infrastructure
improvements have been in telecommunications and electricity supply, (the latter under the
EPAL). The phone density in Peru has increased in only four years from 2.9 to 7.5
lines/100 people, there has been a 5-fold increase in the number of public telephones, and
the waiting time to get a new phone has fallen from nine years to one week. Electric
power shortages have disappeared, and even the poorest parts of Lima now have
electricity. In addition, bus service and gasoline stations in Lima are markedly better in
terms of quality, variety and availability.
43. Capital Market Development. Starting in 1996, Government began selling its
remaining minority shares in privatized companies on the stock markets in Lima and New
York. The sales in New York were valuable for Peru's international reputation, while
those in Peru substantially increased the capitalization of the Lima Stock Exchange.
44. Environment. While environmental improvement was not a specific objective of
the privatization program, it has been an important side benefit of the mining sector
privatization, in two ways. Firstly, when Government first tried to sell CENTROMIN, the
largest mining company in Peru, there were no bidders, in large part because no one was
willing to assume the environmental liabilities that had accumulated (e.g. piles of slag,
from which dangerous chemicals were being leached into rivers). Prior to the second (and
successful) round of sales, a major program of environmental clean-up was announced,
with clear division of responsibility between CENTROMIN (costing $75 million) and the
new purchasers (costing $40 million). Secondly, while foreign mining companies are
legally bound only to the same environmental standards in Peru as the SOEs were, in fact
the former almost universally adhere to stricter international standards, because they are
being monitored by international environmental groups as well as their home governments,
whereas the SOEs did not even adhere to the Peruvian standards.
45. Study of Benefits. Several preliminary and limited studies have been made of
Peru's privatization program--by UNDP, USAID, and the Peruvian research and
consulting firm Apoyo--all of which have been very positive. Within the next few years,
after the program has been completed, a more comprehensive study should be carried out.



15
This would be important both for Pera, where there is substantial and growing opposition
to privatization, and for other developing countries, which could have much to learn from
Peru's experience.
I. OP]ERATIONAL PLAN
46. Remaining Privatizations. With almost all of the smaller state enterprises sold or
liquidated, with the telecommunications, fisheries and industrial sectors fully privatized,
and with the mining sector privatization well advanced and on track (Cerro de Pasco and
some mining properties of CENTROMIN are to be sold this year), the remaining
privatization issues mainly concern energy and railroads. In water, SEDAPAL's
operational performance has improved markedly and the government is interested in
attracting private participation in the company. In electricity, the Mantaro-Restitucion
Hydroelectric complex (the largest power generator in Peru), the regional utility
companies, and the electric generation capacity of the mining company, CENTROMIN,
have yet to be privatized. In petroleum, the remaining operations are the Talara and
Iquitos refineries and the oil pipeline; the pipeline will probably be auctioned as a
concession, which is reasonable givern its limited financial prospects. Privatization of the
railroad company has also not yet started. In addition, Government has remaining
minority shares to sell in a number of enterprises. The Bank still has involvement through
the Electricity Privatization Adjustment Loan (EPAL) and the Energy and Mining
Technical Assistance Loan (EMTAL'). In addition, the Government also has its on-going
program of concessions including the Mantaro-Socabaya transmission pipeline which was
concessioned out earlier in 1998 as well as planned concessions in ports, airports and
roads.
47. Post-privatization Monitoring. Even after SOEs are privatized, Government
needs to monitor the operation of concessions and the amortization payments by Peruvian
purchasers under the various incentive programs. These are still being handled by COPRI,
but as COPRI is a temporary agency whose mandate would soon expire once the
remaining privatizations are carried out, these responsibilities would need to be reassigned.
There are also some investment commitments. However, these should be treated flexibly,
as the economic logic is weak for trying to control such matters by private firms in
competitive industries.
48.   Public Relations. As noted above, Govermment has not yet mounted any serious
effort to educate the population about the benefits of the privatization program. There are
a number of steps which it should now take. Analyses already done of the effects of
privatization (which have all come to positive conclusions) should be disseminated,
seminars organized, and academic institutions (which have been kept at arms' length)
encouraged to do case studies. Some of COPRI's income from the sales could be
allocated for this purpose.

J. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
49.   Lessons Learned about Privatization.
(a)   Privatization programs should move very fast when there is an opportunity,
because afterwards it becomes much harder, once the crisis is gone and
politics-as-usual returns. Although Peru implemented its program much
faster than most countries, privatization proponents there regret not having
gone even faster, before political opposition could build. In addition, the
faster the privatization, the shorter the period of uncertainly and possible
malaise within the enterprise.
(b)   Sector policy and regulatory reform should be well underway before
privatization in the sector, so that bidders can feel that they are entering a
secure environment, and will have a sound basis for calculating their bids.
Much of Peru's success in privatization is due to the progress that was
made beforehand in preparing comprehensive sectoral legislation and rules.
(c)   It is often better to break up large companies, so as to make them more
attractive to a range of buyers and to encourage competition. In the cases
of both Centromin and Petroperu, there was strong pressure to privatize
the companies en bloc, so as to preserve the company ethos and not have
to deal with messy break-ups. The first Centromin auction failed to attract
bidders partly for this reason (along with environmental and social issues),
and it also appeared that there was little private-sector interest in buying
Petroperu as a single company.
(d)   It is easy to underestimate the costs and time needed for such complex
transactions. This mistake was committed by the Bank and the Peruvians,
as both the cost and the time required for the program have been more than
double the appraisal estimates.
(e)   Attention must be paid to public relations, lest public resistance impede the
process or threaten its results. The Peruvian Government apparently
believed that the benefits would "speak for themselves." Yet even in a
sector like telecommunications, where there has been a dramatic
improvement in service, critics have been able to focus on the increase in
connection and local-call charges (to economic costs; long distance and
international tariffs have been correspondingly reduced), to turn public
opinion against privatization.
(f)    Top-level political support is critical for success. When the message from
the top was clearly in favor of privatization, the process moved ahead
rapidly. Now that there appears to be more ambivalence, progress is much
slower.



17
(g)   People from the private sector should be given key roles in the process.
COPRI selected mostly people from the private sector for the CEPRIs, and
this is considered one of the main reason for their success. Existing SOE
managers proved less committed to and/or adept at privatizing their firms.
(h)   Concessioning may be a useful compromise where sale is not possible
politically. In several cases in Peru, there was considerable public
opposition to sales of SOEs, but virtually none to concessioning as an
alternative.
50. Lessons Learned About Bank Lending
(a)   Providing a TA loan alongside an adjustment loan can be valuable not only
for providing the funds, needed to undertake the reforms, but also for
increasing other minist:ries' stake in the process. While the Ministry of
Economy and Finance was the one most directly interested in the PAL, the
Ministries of Mining and Energy and of Transport and Communications
had access to PTAL funds for sector reform studies, and this helped ensure
their ability to carry ouLt the reforms called for under the PAL.
(b)   It is more efficient to have one technical assistance operation that covers all
privatizations rather than several sector-specific technical assistance
operations.
(c)   Continuity in Bank and Government personnel is very beneficial, because,
established relationships tend to be franker, more cooperative, and based
on fuller information. Key staff in the Ministry of Economy and Finance
and in the sectoral ministries, as well as in the Bank, have been in place
since the projects began, and this was one of the reasons for the projects'
success.
(d)   When implementation schedules are intentionally set very tight for
motivational reasons, more flexibility should be allowed in setting and
extending closing dates, so as not to create unnecessary work and tension.
While there was good justification for trying to adhere to a very optimistic
time schedule, the Bank should have set more realistic closing dates, or not
made such a great fuss about extending them.
(e)   Adequate thought needs to be given not only to what is the most suitable
management regime for a sector, but also to who should have the right to
decide. In the case of' fisheries, the Bank gave most of its attention to
designing the optimal system (ITQs), but did not recognize that since any
benefits of the change would accrue almost entirely to the existing fishing
industry, they should have the deciding voice.



18
(f)    Use of UNDP or another local office as the disbursement agent can be an
efficient way of avoiding bureaucratic delays in making funds available,
especially where there are many small contracts, as in TA projects.

APPENDIX A: AIDE MEMOIRE

PERU: Privatization Adjustment (PAL) and Privatization Technical Assistance
(PTAL) Loans
Aide Memoire of the Implementation Completion Mission
1. Introduction. This Aide Memoire summarizes the main findings of my visit to Peru
from March 3-12, and the next steps needed to produce the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) for the above projects. It reflects only my personal and preliminary views,
and has not been reviewed yet by the Bank. A combined report is to be produced for the
two projects, because of their close interrelationship. I wish to thank all the Peruvian
agencies and individuals I met for the time they have given me and the frankness with
which they have discussed these projects.
2. Achievements. Overall, it is clear that both projects have been carried out
successfully by Peru, and that they have achieved good results.
a) Peru's privatization program has been one of the fastest and most sweeping in the
world. About two-thirds (by value) of the state enterprise sector has already been
privatized. This amount greatly exceeds the relevant conditions under the PAL.
b) The program has been carried out in a very transparent manner, through an effective
institutional structure of COPRI and the CEPRIs, and they have come up, where needed,
with innovative solutions such as Participaci6n Ciudadana and Promoci6n Empresarial.
c) Privatization has been accompanied by adequate attention to the need to ensure
competition in the sectors being privatizaed, and the requirements for regulation in those
sectors where adequate competition is not feasible.
d) The program has already brought major benefits to Peru, including some $8 billion in
revenue from the sales, massive additional foreign investment undertaken and planned,
improvement in basic infrastructure, increased economic efficiency, capital market
development, and a redirection of Government focus away from activities best left to the
private sector and towards those properly in the public sector.
3. Sustainablity. Despite these impressive achievements, there is cause for concern
about the future. The problem is the increasingly negative public perception of
privatization. Public support (in Lima) has dropped steadily from about 65% in mid-1992
to 30% now. Among the reasons for this are the (a) short-term reduction in employment
accompanying the privatizations, (b) increases in certain public sector tariffs in the move
to economic pricing, (c) dominance in the electricity sector of Chilean companies, (d) use
of privatization as a convenient target for those opposing other Government policies, and
(e) Government's failure to respond to these criticisms. Already, this has had the effect
of slowing down the privatization process, shifting some emphasis from sales to
concessions, and removing at least one major enterprise entirely from the process. There
also appears to be lack of public confidence in the regulatory systems for electricity and
telecommunications. If unchecked, these negative public perceptions might eventually
even lead to some policy reversals, and thereby threaten the sustainability of the program's
achievements.



- 30 -
4. To reverse this trend will require a concerted effort by the Government to study and
publicize the results of the privatization and regulatory reform program. Analyses done by
APOYO should be widely circulated, seminars should be organized, and academic
institutions should be encouraged to do c,ase studies. Some of COPRI's income from the
sales could be allocated for this purpose.
5. Government's Performance. Government's performance has been extremely good in
both of these projects, and is the main reason for their success. The privatization of
PetroPeru, despite considerable resistance, and the moves towards competition in the
hydrocarbons sector have been among thie highlights. Also, the fact that not a single
transaction has been challenged on procedural or transparency grounds is a remarkable
achievement.
6. There has been, however, a considerable slowing down in the pace of privatization,
largely as a result of the decreasing popular support, the loss of a sense of urgency, and
the lack of a sufficiently-strong top-level advocacy for privatization. The privatization
program has taken considerably longer than planned -- the original goal was to complete it
before the 1995 elections -- but this is unlderstandable, given the large number of entities
involved and the complexity of many of them. The unfortunate result, however, has been
that considerable uncertainty remains concerning the important entities not yet privatized,
especially in the energy sector.
6. World Bank Performance. The Bank's performance in the projects has also been
very good, and this view is shared by alrnost all of the Peruvian officials with whom I have
spoken. The Bank provided important technical, psychological and financial support
especially during the crucial early stage of the program, and throughout has sought ways
to resolve problems. Working relationships between the Bank and Government have been
unusually good The Bank's attention to regulatory systems and to the PetroPeru
privatization were particularly commencdable. The Bank was appropriately flexible in
extending closing dates and granting a waiver (for the PAL third tranche), although it
seems to have made these processes more difficult for itself than necessary. It also
substantially underestimated the cost of the PTAL -- fortunately, revenues available to
COPRI from the privatizations also greatly exceeded estimates.
7. Fisheries Management. Special discussion of this matter is warranted because of the
inordinate attention it received during PAL implementation, and the fact that it finally led
to the only waivers required. Both the Government and the Bank could have handled the
fisheries sector better. Until 1996, the Mdinistry of Fisheries was uncooperative with the
efforts of the Bank, the Peruvian fisheries industry, and other MEF to devise a more
suistainable and efficient system of resource management. The Bank, for its part, became
too much of an advocate for a particular (ITQ) system, and the Peruvian fisheries industry
felt that its concerns tended to be brushed aside. The Bank also ended up paying
inadequate attention to other reforms which were, in fact, preconditions to applying an
ITQ system. In pressing the Government to impose a system whose primary objective
was to benefit the industry, but which the industry (wisely or unwisely) opposed, the Bank



- 31 -
ended up in the awkward position of asking the public sector to second-guess the private
sector on what was in the latter's interest. With the recent reforms in the sector, and the
granting of the third-tranche waiver, both sides have largely rectified the matter.
8. Lessons Learned about Privatization. It will take considerable more reflection and
discussion before I feel confident about the lessons to be learned from these projects. The
following is therefore only a tentative list.
a. Move very fast when there is an opportunity, because afterwards it becomes much
harder, once the crisis is gone and politics-as-usual returns.
b. Regulatory reform and concern with sector competition must go hand in hand with
privatizations, to attract investors and protect consumers.
c. It is often better to break up large companies, so as to make them more attractive to
a range of buyers and to encourage competition.
d. It is easy to underestimate the costs and time needed for such complex transactions.
e. Pay attention to public relations, lest public resistance impede the process.
f Top-level political support is critical.
g. Give people from the private sector key roles in the process.
h. Concessioning may be a useful compromise where sale is not possible politically.
i. A mechanism is needed for dealing with post-privatization issues that arise, especially
where there are ongoing payment or investment commitments.
9. Lessons Learned About Bank Lending
a.. Providing a TA loan alongside an adjustment loan is important for increasig other
ministries' stake in the process.
b. Continuity in Bank and Government personnel is very beneficial, because,
established relationships tend to be franker, more cooperative, and based on fiuller
information
c. When implementation schedules are intentionally set very tight for motivational
reasons, more flexibility should be allowed in setting and extending closing dates, so as not
to create uncessary work and tension.
d. Adequate thought needs to be given not only to what is the most suitable
management regime for a sector, but also to who should have the right to decide.
10. Next Steps I have received from COPRI and MEF their draft contributions to the
ICR, for the PTAL and PAL, respectively. This should make the following tight schedule
feasible:
a. April 22 -- Bank sends draft ICR to Government for comment;
b. May 1 -- Government sends comments to Bank;
c. May 15 -- Bank sends ICR to its Executive Directors.

PROJECT COMPLEllON REPORT
PRIVATIZATION ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(PRIVAT7ZATION ADJUSTMENT LOAN-PAL)
EXECUTION RESUME
The refonn progrmm fosweed by the Privatization Adjustiment Loan (PAL), entered into with the World
Bantk in April of 1993, has bon caarred out vithin the fmatnewerk of sound macroeconomic policies
established by the Peruvian Government, and has achieved an ample apenure of a capital market In this
context, the loan components made possible a more adquate fiuncioning of a market economy,
promotod private investment in different production sectors, cstablished an appropriate regulatory
framework which in tumn promoted economic efficiency, competition within such sectors, and
development of a capital markeL It has also contributed to generate a climate of confidence iD the
country, permitting a greater flow of long- term forign investments.
The privatization process is under the direction of the Private Investment Promotion Committe (COPRI).
established in 1991, and of the Privatization Special Committees (CEPRIS). In the Initial stae of the
proces, Govemment efforts concentrated on the transfcr of assets from the Public Sector (slato owned
enterprises) to the private sedor. In the second slage, the Governmet called upon the private sector to
assist in the devlopment and administration of infrastrucmue works and services of tlhe public soctor.
For this purpose the Private Franchise Prnotion Comnmission (PROMCEPRI), was created, as an agecy-
respousibe for the design and  management of the promotion procss, and solecion of the works and
services to be given over as franchises, as well as the form of these franchisees.
lcome gonerated by the s6cessful privatization program borders on USS8.364 million.
LUkewise the program pmits investments which will aexd USS6.000 million. The pivatization
prWoss has prmittod the suppont of economic mcfonrs establishod by the Government and the



- 33 -
improvoment of competition within the privac isoctors. Thus, intcnational expts With the mom
advanoed technologios have becn attracted, the rfficiency level of rpublic sevices ruaed, conoitions for a
wider basw ownership creatd, as well as the promotion of labor force participation in entrpris. In
addition, the privatization has allowed the Gov rnmcnt to obtain more ample resourcs which it has
allocated to permanent soial investment, anid has augmented it8 reserves. Ar a result it has given
suWport to the eomic program.
An imporlant aspect of the privatization progran has been the public placing of rmaining Goverunent
sbares in soene privatized corporations (Cemenios Norte Pacasmayo, Telefonos del Peru, Luz del Sur). In
addition to benefiting more than 385,000 peoplic it has opeed the way for Peruvian citizens to shae in
the benefits of privatization, contnud to the -evelopment of the capital uarket, spread private
ownership, and stimulated domestic saving and investmet. Moover, an Enteprenou Promotion
Program has boon established for the purpose of facilitating the participation of local entreprnurs In the
privaizatioin prooess, offering them spocal inicctives, such as financing plans similar to those available
abroad.
The privatization process has been performed with gat transpamecy amd its impact has been defnitive,
reprsenting income for the Govermnent of 12% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
During 1998 a new strengthenod impetus will be given to the privalization of those remaining in the
eloctric, hydrocaibon, and mining sectors witln the goal of completing the privatization process in 1999.
The Peruvian Gwornmenmt considers that liO loan has been a success, attaining the m eomics
program objectives. Moreover, the sectorial policy measures, the legal and regulatory mures in the
aras of mining, hydrocarbons, telecoonumuicationms fishing, and usnitaion, have been implemented, and
the foreseen privatization progam has boen implemented sucoesully.



- 34 -
Fom Itk  experience obtained, from fth borrower's poi of view, it should be emphasized that the
principal objwive of the adjustment loan was to grant appropriate gudance to the beeiciay countuy
during tbe reform procecs. This should be done without fut requiring in a prioritive and strit manner,
the fulfillment of an exnsive list of conditions which oftea distract the executors from the primazy
objective for which tho loan was entered into.
With this in mind, it is evident that the Bank should work in the future to elaborate programs more
consistent with the realities faced by the individual country, and avoid mnading standard application of
the same policies to different countries. Also, whein evaluating the follow-up of policies applicable to
each individual case, there should be a spirit of mutual cooperation betwcen the Bank and the benelciay
to miuake the attainment of planned objectives in the best posible maimer.
In the panicular case of PAL, the priiipal objectivc of the loan was to support the privatizalion program
creatod by thc Peruvian Government. During its execution, it was niot fecasble to oxpect a strict
adherence to the specific fuUllmn of a list of conditions. Rather a close relationhip between the Bank
and tho country arose, in which the Bank showed reasonable flexbliy, adapting to the needs of tho loan
receiver,
Yet, it did happen that at the time of the signing of the contract, the Bank as well as the Peruviau
Govenumnol conceived objoctives too optimistic, creatinig tension btwee the parties with respect to their
compliance. These goals were not achieved and led to many extension requests of the fmnal conpletion
date originally agreed upon.

Informne de Cierre de Proyecto
Pr6stamo de Aluste de Privatizaci6n
(Pnvatization Adjustment Loan - PAL)
Resumen Ejecutivo
El programa de reformas amparado por el Prestamo de Ajuste de Privatizaci6n -
Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL) acordado con el Banco Mundial en abril de
1993, se ha desarrollado en el marco de sanas politicas macroecon6micas
implantadas por el Gobierno Peruano y la total apertura de la cuenta de capitales.
En este contexto, los componentes del referido prestamo han permitido un mejor
funcionamiento de ia economia de mercado mediante la promoci6n de la inversi6n
privada en diferentes sectores productivos, el establecimiento de un marco
regulatorio apropiado que promueve la eficiencia economica y la competencia en
dichos sectores, y el desarrollo del mercado de capitales. Ello tambien ha
contribuido a generar un clima de conflanza en el pais, permitiendo atraer mayores
flujos de inversi6n extranjera de largo plazo.
El proceso de privatizaci6n esta a cargo de la Comisi6n de Promoci6n de la
Inversi6n Privada (COPRI) creada en 1991 y los Comites Especiales de
Privatizaci6n (CEPRis). Durante la primera etapa de este proceso, los esfuerzos del
Gobierno se concentraron en la transferencia de los activos del Estado (empresas
estatales) al sector privado. Para la segunda etapa, el Gobierno ha convocado al
sector privado para el desarrollo y la administraci6n de obras publicas de
infraestructura y servicios p6blicos. En este sentido, se ha constituido la Comisi6n
de Promoci6n de Concesiones Privadas (PROMCEPRI), 6rgano que disena y
conduce el proceso de promoci6n y define las obras y servicios que se entregaran
en concesi6n asi como la modalidad de concesi6n.
El exitoso programa de privatizaciones ha generado ingresos que bordean los US$
8,364 millones. El programa ademas permitira inversiones por mas de US$ 6,000
millones.
El proceso de privatizaci6n ha permitido apoyar las reformas econ6micas
implantadas por el Gobierno, mejorando la competitividad de los sectores
privatizados. Asi, se atrajo operadores internacionales con tecnologia de punta, se
aument6 el nivel de bienestar en la prestaci6n de servicios al publico, y se crearon
condiciones para una base mas amplia de propietarios, promoviendose incluso la
participaci6n de trabajadores en las empresas. De otra parte, la privatizaci6n le ha
permitido al Estado obtener mayores recursos que se han destinado a inversi6n
social de caracter permanente y al aumento de las reservas, lo que le brinda
sostenibilidad alprograma econ6inco
Un aspecto importante del programa de privatizaci6n ha sido la colocaci6n publica
del remanente de acciones del Estado en algunas empresas privatizadas(Cementos
Norte Pacasmayo, Telef6nica del Pera, Luz del Sur). El sistema, ademas de haber
beneficiado a la fecha a mas de 385,000 personas permitiendo que ciudadanos
peruanos compartan los beneficios de la privatizaci6n, contribuye con el desarrollo
del mercado de capitales, difunde la propiedad privada y fomenta el ahorro interno y



PAL -ICR

la inversi6n. Adicionalmente, se ha implantado un Programa de Promoci6n
Emlpresarial que busca fomentar 1I participaci6n de empresarios locales en el
proceso de privatizaci6n, otorgandoles condiciones especiales para el pago
mediante esquemas de financiaci6n similares a los existentes en el exterior.
El proceso de privatizaci6n se ha efectuado con la mayor transparencia y su impacto
ha sido concreto habiendo significado ingresos para el Gobierno que representan el
12% del Producto Bruto Interno (PBI'>
Durante el ano 1998 se retomara con un renovado impetu las privatizaciones que
auri restan en el sector electrico y en el de hidrocarburos y mineria, con el fin de
concluir con el proceso de privatizaci6n en 1999.
El pr6stamo es considerado como exitoso por el Gobierno peruano habiendose
mantenido las metas del programa macroecon6mico.   Asimismo, se han
implementado medidas de politica sectorial, reformas legales y reglamentos en las
areas de mineria, hidrocarburos, teloacomunicaciones, pesca y saneamiento y se ha
implementado exitosarnente el programa de privatizaci6n previsto.
Entre las lecciones aprendidas, desde la perspectiva del prestatario, es preciso
resaltar aquella que permite confirmar que el objetivo principal de un prestamo de
ajuste debe ser el de brindar una adecuada gula al pais beneficiario durante el
proceso de reforma, orientada basicamente al logro de un sano desarrollo de la
economia del pais antes que exigir, de manera prioritaria y estricta, el cumplimiento
de una larga lista de condiciones que muchas veces distraen a los ejecutores de las
metas primordiales por las cuales se acord6 el prestamo.
En este sentido, ha quedado en evidencia la necesidad de que el Banco trabaje, en
lo sucesivo, en el disenio de planes mas acordes con las realidades de cada pais
evitando estandarizar la aplicaci6n de politicas similares a diferentes paises.
IguLalmente, al momento de evaluar el seguimiento de las politicas aplicables segun
cada caso, debe existir un espiriltu de colaboraci6n mutua entre el Banco y el
beneficiario para alcanzar los objetivos trazados de la mejor manera posible.
En el caso particular del PAL, el objetivo principal del pr6stamo fue apoyar el
programa de privatizaci6n concebido por el gobierno peruano, y durante su
ejecucion no oper6 la circunstancia de ceniirse estrictamente al cumplimiento
especifico de una lista de condiciiones. Mas bien se dio un trabajo de estrecha
coordinaci6n entre el Banco y el pals, donde el primer demostr6 una flexibilidad
razonable para adaptarsea las necesidades del receptor deJ prbstamo.
Empero, si ocurri6 que tanto el Banco como el gobierno del Perui trazaron metas
rnuy optimistas al momento de la suscripci6n del prestamo, hecho que genero
presiQnes por ambas partes para llegar a cumplirlas, lo que finalmente no se
concret6, dando lugar a que se solicitaran varias pr6rrogas a la fecha de cierre
pactada inicialmente.

El Prestamo de Ajuste de Privatizaci6n -Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL)- fue
concebido para apoyar al gobierno del Peru en la realizaci6n de un ambicioso
programa de privatizaci6n que ha permitido contribuir a un mejor funcionamiento de
la economia de mercado, promover la inversi6n privada, desarrollar el mercado de
capitales, asi como generar ingentes recursos para el Tesoro Publico.
El PAL fue aprobado por el gobierno peruano mediante Decreto Supremo No. 059-
93-EF publicado el 13 de abril de 1993 y fue suscrito el 21 de abril de 1993. Para el
Gobierno del Peru, el PAL fue el primer prestamo otorgado al pais tras el
restablecimiento de relaciones con el Banco Mundial concretada el 18 de marzo de
1993 con la lmpieza de atrasos por US$ 867 rnillones, operaci6n que incluy6 los
prestamos de Ajuste del Sector Comercio (TPRL), Ajuste del Sector Financiero
(FSAL) y Ajuste Estructural (SAL). El Perui de esta manera volvia a ser sujeto de
credito frente al Banco.
El contexto macroeconomico
La columna vertebral del programa econ6mico peruano ha sido la disciplina fiscal y
monetaria. El programa se sustenta en un regimen de tipo de cambio flotante,
aunado a un estricto control monetario, acompafiado de una politica fiscal austera,
con una administraci6n tributaria eficaz y un ferreo control del gasto publico.
La total apertura de la cuenta de capitales, conjuntamente con sanas politicas
macroeconomicas y estrictas normas prudenciales y de supervisi6n bancaria, han
reportado importantes beneficios. Estas politicas, ademas de haber contribuido a
generar un clima de confianza, han permitido atraer significativos flujos de inversi6n
extranjera de largo plazo.
Desde inicios de 1993 y luego de las duras medidas de estabilizaci6n iniciales, el
Peru ha crecido 5 anios consecutivos y lo ha hecho a una tasa promedio anual de
7.3%. Este crecirmiento no ha estado basado en la expansi6n del consumo ni en el
estimulo del gasto fiscal, sino en la inversi6n (tanto interna como externa) del sector
privado y en el reciente dinamico desarrollo de las exportaciones de los bienes no-
tradicionales.
La aplicaci6n del Programa Econ6mico ha permitido alcanzar un crecimiento
sostenido con una baja tasa de inflaci6n. Asi la tasa de inflaci6n en 1997 fue de
6.5%, la mns baja en los ultimos 25 aftos y el deficit del sector publico (excoluidos los
ingresos de privatizaci6n) ha alcanzado 0%. Por su parte la tasa de inversi6n ha
aumentado de 18.6% en 1993 a 24.7% en 1997 constituyendo la segunda tasa de
inversi6n mas alta en Latinoamerica. El ahorro interno creci6 de 13% a 20% del PBI
y casi el 90% de los flujos de capitales privados extranjeros en los ultimos 5 anios se
realizaron bajo la forma de inversi6n directa extranjera.
Finalmente la fortaleza de los indicadores macroecon6micos se refleja en que el
crecimiento ha ido acompafiado por una constante acumulaci6n de reservas
internacionales netas que ascienden a US$ 10.3 mil millones equivalentes a 15
meses de importaciones, 6 veces la base monetaria y 80% de la liquidez total del
sistema bancario. Se puede aseverar que en la actualidad el Peru cuenta con una



PAL-ICR
- 39 -
combinaci6n ideal de tasa de cambio flotante y una posici6n fiscal y monetaria
fortalecida.
En relaci6n al servicio de la deuda peruana, la deuda del sector publico ha sido
reprogramada en su totalidad de acuerdo a la capacidad de pago del pals.
Asimnismo, no existe deuda intema ni deuda externa de corto plazo.
Actualmente se cuenta con un sisterna financiero s6lido, regulaciones prudenciales
estrictas y una excelente superintendencia de banca.
Los objetivos en el mediano plazo incluyen una tasa anual de crecimiento de 6.5%,
una continua reducci6n de la inflaci6n a niveles internacionales hacia el fin de la
d6cada, asi como una reducci6n del deficit en cuenta corriente a menos del 3% para
el aino 2002. Estos objetivos son resultado del compromiso del Gobierno de
maintener la estabilidad macroecon6mica y el fortalecimiento de las reformas
estiructurales, incluyendo las de segunda generaci6n que ya han sido iniciadas.
Finalmente se pretende alcanzar iguales oportunidades para todos los peruanos a
traves de la concentraci6n del gasto publico en la promoci6n de la cantidad y calidad
de la educaci6n, salud y justicia.
La Drivatizacion en el Peru
En el nuevo papel que el gobierno del Presidente Fujimori ha otorgado al Estado, el
sector publico ha sido reestructurado para mejorar las finanzas y servicios publicos,
reorientando el rol del Estado hacia sus funciones esenciales en las areas de salud,
educaci6n, justicia, seguridad e infraestructura, en tanto que el sector privado tiene
la responsabilidad de producir los bienes y servicios que se demandan en el
mercado. En ese marco, el gobierno asumi6 la tarea de privatizar mas de 200
empresas estatales.
Los objetivos de la privatizaci6n incluyeron:
a La contribuci6n al mejor funcionamiento de la economia de mercado
o La promoci6n de la inversi6n privada, nacional y extranjera, en sectores
gravitantes para el desarrollo E.con6mico (energia, comunicaciones, petr6leo,
etc.)
o La promoci6n del desarrollo del mercado de capitales nacional incrementando el
monto y nCimero de transacciones y participantes (a traves de mecanismos como
participaci6n ciudadana, fondos mutuos)
o La generaci6n de ingresos para el Tesoro Publico (financiamiento de programas
de lucha contra la pobreza, etc.)
En el proceso de privatizaci6n, el Estado s6lo ha efectuado tareas de
reestructuraci6n de las empresas 21 ser privatizadas cuando ha sido estrictamente
necesario y en areas donde se cont6 con ventajas comparativas, como la
racionalizaci6n del personal y la reorganizaci6n financiera.
La promoci6n de la venta se ha sustentado en el mantenimiento de un cdima
empresarial que promueve la rentabilidad y la inversi6n productiva, el ofrecimiento



PAL -ICR
- 40 -
de informaci6n tecnica y financiera de calidad sobre las empresas, la promoci6n de
la venta en los mercados locales y extranjeros.
En este proceso, se ha invitado a participar como asesores a empresas consultoras
y bancos de inversi6n de primer nivel, se ha garantizado un trato no discriminatorio
a los inversionistas interesados y se ha conducido un proceso de precalificaci6n
apropiado para garantizar que el control de las principales empresas privatizadas
corresponda a operadores capaces.
Las ventas se han realizado mediante subastas publicas y son pagadas en efectivo,
ademas se ha permitido el canje de deuda por privatizaci6n en adici6n a estos
pagos.
Es importante destacar que es el mercado el que fija el precio de las empresas y
activos que se privatizan.
El proceso de privatizaci6n esta a cargo de la Comisi6n de Promoci6n de la
Inversi6n Privada (COPRI) y los Comites Especiales de Privatizaci6n (CEPRIs). La
COPRI fue creada en 1991, actua como el directorio del proceso y tiene plena
autoridad legal sobre la privatizaci6n de empresas estatales, los CEPRis
administran con autonomia a los procesos individuales de cada empresa.
La COPRI esta integrada por los Ministros de Trabajo y Promoci6n Social;
Economia y Finanzas; Industria, Turismo, Integraci6n y Negociaciones Comerciales
Internacionales; y el Presidente del Consejo de Ministros. La COPRI ha monitoreado
los esfuerzos del Gobierno durante la primera etapa del proceso privatizaci6n de
empresas del Estado.
La segunda etapa de este esfuerzo la constituye la promoci6n de la inversi6n
privada en la construcci6n y operaci6n de obras publicas de infraestructura y
servicios publicos. Con este prop6sito el Gobierno ha creado la Comisi6n de
Concesiones Prvadas (PROMCEPRI), que es el 6rgano encargado de la promoci6n
de la inversion privada en obras publicas de infraestructura y servicios publicos que
sean financieramente viables, dejando para el Estado las obras publicas de
infraestructura de menor rendimiento financiero, pero socialmente necesarias y de
mayor impacto en los sectores de menores recursos.

El exitoso programa de privatizaciones ha generado ingresos que bordean los US$
8,364 millones. Asimismo, este programa permitira inversiones por mas de US$
6,000 millones.

Cabe seffalar que al iniciarse el proceso de privatizaci6n, el Estado era propietario
de alrededor de 200 empresas publicas que en 1990 habian llegado a tener un
deficit operacional de US$ 2.5 mil millones, equivalente al 10% del PBI.
Lai participaci6n del Estado en la aclividad empresarial durante el Gobierno Militar
de. finales de los ahios sesenta era total, luego de la nacionalizaci6n de
practicamente todas las empresas privadas existentes en el pais. Este experimento
result6 un verdadero fracaso en I:erminos de manejo empresarial, resultados
firiancieros, eficiencia y calidad. Los gobiernos siguientes acentuaron esta situaci6n
pues se sucedieron designaciones politicas en cargos claves, hubo trafico de
influencias sobredotandose a las empresas con personal sin aptitudes, y como
consecuencia de ello, su nivel de endeudamiento fue incrementandose
paulatinamente con el unico prop6sito de mantenerlas operativas, a pesar de la
perdida de capitales.
Con la privatizaci6n se ha reducido la burocracia estatal, hay activa participaci6n del
sector privado, se cuenta con mayores recursos para el Estado, se ha redefinido la
funci6n del Estado y se ha logrado la modernizaci6n empresarial.
El proceso de privatizaci6n se inici6 en junio de 1991 con la venta de la empresa
Sogewiese Leasing del sector financiero por US$ 1 mill6n y hasta la fecha se han
pirivatizado 158 empresas.
A continuacion indicaremos algunos beneficios del programa de privatizaci6n en
sectores tales como telecomunicaciones, construcci6n, electricidad, etc.
En el sector telecomunicaciones, en lo que se refiere al servicio de telefonia, se ha
reducido el tiempo de espera promedio para la instalaci6n de una linea telef6nica,
de diez anios en 1992 a 7 dias en 1997. Por otro lado, el costo de la linea telef6nica
ha pasado de US$ 1,500 a US$ 300, el numero de lineas en servicio por cada 100
habitantes ha pasado de 2.9 en 1993 a 7.5 en 1997 y el numero de hogares con
linea telef6nica ha crecido de 17% en 1993 a 42% en 1997 con un gran numero en
los estratos de menores ingresos.
Ademrs, Telef6nica del PerCi se comprometib entre otros, a la colocaci6n en un
plazo maximo de cinco anos de un mill6n de lineas telef6nicas, asi como la
interconexi6n que permita que todos los poblados con mas de 500 habitantes esten
integrados a la red nacional de telefonia antes de los cinco afns.
En el sector electrico, luego de la privatizaci6n de las empresas de distribuci6n y la
empresa de generaci6n de electricidad en Lima, el grado de electrificaci6n ha
crecido. de 68% en 1994 a 98% en 1997 y la perdida de energia en distribuci6n ha
bajado de 19% a menos de 14% del total recibido, las inversiones realizadas en el
sector practicamente garantizan lae no interrupci6n del servicio en ausencia de
Iluvias. La oferta de electricidad ha crecido significativamente.
El 14 de febrero de 1996 concluy6 el proceso de subasta de las acciones del Estado
en la empresa Siderurgica del PerCi S.A. (Sider Peru). El ganador fue el consorcio
denominado Sider Corp. S.A. a quien se le adjudic6 el 96.46% de las acciones de la
empresa por US$ 162.7 millones en efectivo, mas US$ 25.1 millones en titulo de la



PAL -ICR
- 42 -
deuda a valor nominal y US$ 30 millones como compromiso formalizado de
inversi6n.
El consorcio Sider Corp. SA esta integrado por Acerco SA  (40%) subsidiaria de
GS Industries Inc. de los Estados Unidos, Wiese Inversiones Financieras S.A. (40%)
y Stanton Funding Co. (20%). GS Steel Company es el operador siderurgico del
consorcio.
El indice de producci6n de acero de esta empresa antes de ser privatzada era de
98,2% (febrero de 1996) y ahora es de 151,1% (enero de 1998). La empresa
Siderperui, luego de la privatizaci6n exporta productos especializados.
En el sector financiero, el crecimiento de la banca sin la participaci6n del Estado es
significativo, beneficiandose directamente el publico usuario.  En los servicios
bancarios, los gastos operativos como porcentaje de los activos promedio han
descendido de un 7,3% a 5,7% en el Banco Continental y de 8,5% a 6,6% en
Interbank. Se ha verificado ademas mejora en la calidad de la cartera y la mayor
competencia ha originado una flexibilizaci6n en las condiciones de los prestamos
personales y en el lanzamiento de nuevos productos.
En el sector minero, la empresa Centromin se transfiri6 de modo fraccionado a
traves de la venta de activos, capitalizaci6n y venta de acciones. Los proyectos
Paucara, Proyecto de cobre de Antamina, Prospecto de Oro Quicay, Yaukyaco S.A.,
Metal Oroya S.A., Mahr Tunel S.A., Mina Yauricocha, en conjunto cuentan con una
inversi6n prevista en US$ 2,833.7 millones.
Adicionalmente, la empresa Minero Peru cre6 tres nuevas sociedades para vender
acciones de cada una de estas empresas y consideraba la venta de las concesiones
separadamente a traves de contratos de opci6n en la mayoria de los casos. A la
fecha, el Yacimiento Minero Quellaveco, la Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A., las
Huaquillas, Jehuamarca Cafnariaco, La Granja, Colpac, Hualatan y Pallacochas,
Sociedad Minera Refineria de Cobre llo S.A., Sociedad Minera Refineria de Zinc
S.A., Yacimiento Berenguela y San Artonio de Poto, en conjunto tienen una
inversi6n prevista que supera los US$ 500 mi.
Por otro lado, existen ciudades como Chimbote que se han visto beneficiadas de la
privatizaci6n por encontrarse en ella dos grandes industrias, la de acero, a cargo de
Siderperu y la de Pesca Peru.
Los trabajadores de las empresas en proceso de privatizaci6n tienen el derecho
preferencial de adquirir hasta el 10% del capital que se transfiere. Esta opci6n ha
sido ejercida en la mayor[a de los casos, de tal manera que mas de 16 mil
trabajadores han ejercido su derecho de compra.
Por su parte el programa de participacion ciudadana aplicado en los saldos de
acciones de Telef6nica, Luz del Sur y Cementos Norte Pacasmayo, ha beneficiado a
mas de 385,000 personas.
Este sistema busca que mas peruanos se conviertan en accionistas de empresas
que han sido privatizadas y brinda una oportunidad de inversion en el mercado



PAL -ICR
- 43 -
burs*til a traves de la adquisici6n cle pequefhos paquetes iguales vendidos en el
mercado.
Sin embargo, no todas las ventas tienen que tener un componente de participaci6n
ciudadana o realizarse a traves de ella. Se debe de identificar claramente aquellas
empresas en las que el sistema sea viable y con ello reducir la participaci6n del
gobierno en dichas empresas.
El Programa de Promoci6n Empresarial busca fomentar la participaci6n de
empresarios locales otorgandoles condiciones de financiaci6n similares a las
existentes en el exterior. Hasta la fecha, se ha logrado aplicar este Programa en
mas de 80 transacciones en diversos sectores econ6micos.
El proceso de privatizaci6n se ha efectuado con la mayor transparencia y su impacto
ha sido concreto habiendo significado ingresos para el Gobierno que representan el
12% del Producto Bruto Interno (PBI).
Asimismo, el Gobierno a la par que ha avanzado en su programa de privatizaci6n,
ha venido creando entidades reguladoras a fin de que se encarguen de supervisar el
cumplimiento de las concesiones u otros contratos por parte de operadores del
sector privado en los diferentes sectores. Estas entidades cuentan con autonomia
politica, administrativa, tecnica y financiera. De esta manera el nuevo rol del Estado
serk el de regular las diferentes actividades productivas de bienes y servicios.
Durante el anio 1998 se retomara con un renovado impetu las privatizaciones que
auri restan en el sector electrico y en el de hidrocarburos y mineria, con el fin de
coricluir con el proceso de privatizaci6n en 1999.
Obietivos del Prestamo de Aiuste le PrivatizacL6n
El programa de reformas que el Banco ha apoyado con este prestamo incluy6 tres
componentes principales: a) mantenimiento de un programa macroecon6mico y un
plan financiero satisfactorios para el Banco, b) irmplementaci6n de medidas de
politica sectorial, reformas legales y regiamentos en las areas de mineria,
hidrocarburos, telecomunicaciones, pesca y saneamiento, y c) implementaci6n del
programa de privatizaci6n.
1   Mantenimiento de un programa macroecon6mico v un plan financiero
satisfactorios Para el Banco.
Desde la suscripci6n del prestamo en abril de 1993 y el desembolso del tercer tramo
en diciembre de 1997, el Banco Mundial ha realizado un seguimiento de la politica
macroecon6mica del Peru y un plan de financiamiento consistente con los objetivos
del programa de reformas.
Las Misiones del Fondo Monetario Internacional han realizado un seguimiento
continuo de la politica macroeconomica. Entre los principales objetivos y logros
macroecon6micos planteados y alcanzados respecto de aquellos trazados segun la

Oltima Pre-publicaci6n de la Carta de Intenci6n presentada al FMI en mayo de 1997,
encontramos los siguientes:
o Crecimiento del PBI real de 7,4% en 1997, lo cual supera el crecimiento
proyectado de 5%.
o Reducci6n del nivel de inflaci6n: en 1996 la tasa de inflaci6n fue de 11,8% y en
1997 se redujo a 6,5%, con lo cual se cumple ampliamente la meta propuesta en
la mencionada carta (se esperaba que la inflaci6n se ubicase entre 8-10%).
o Se logr6 una reducci6n del d6ficit de cuenta corriente de 5,9% del PBI en 1996 a
5,2% en 1997 (se incluy6 que fuera menor al 5,5%).
a Las Reservas Intemacionales Netas del Banco Central de Reserva llegaron a
niveles de US$ 10,3 billones lo cual equivale a 15 meses de importaciones de
bienes y servicios no financieros (mientras que en 1996 equivalia a 12 meses), 6
veces la base monetaria y el 80% de la liquidez total del sistema bancario.
o La tasa de inversi6n asciende a 25% del PBI y la tasa de ahorro nacional a 20%
del PBI. De la misma manera ambas tasas superan lo proyectado.
o Por otro lado, el deficit del sector publico, antes de ingresos de privatizaci6n, se
redujo a 0% en 1997, lograndose de esta manera un equilibrio fiscal.
b)   Implementaci6n de medidas de politica sectorial, reformas leQales v
realamentos en [as areas de mineria, hidrocarburos, telecomunicaciones, Pesca v
saneamiento
Mineria
En el area de mineria, la meta acordada con el Banco incluy6 la publicaci6n del
reglamento de la Ley de Mineria.
El 4 de junio de 1993 se public6 el Texto Unico Ordenado de la Ley General de

PAL-ICR
- 45 -
consumo de los productos dervados de petr6leo y la emision del reglamento para
estas leyes.
En esta area, se public6 la Ley No. 26221, Ley Organica de Hidrocarburos, el 20 de
agosto de 1993 y entr6 en vigencia a partir del 19 de noviembre de 1993. Esta Ley
norma las actividades de hidrocarburos en el territorio nacional considerando que el
Estado promueve el desarrollo de las actividades de hidrocarburos sobre la base de
la libre competencia y el libre acceso a la actividad econ6mica y el Ministerio de
Energia y Minas es el encargado de elaborar, aprobar, proponer y aplicar la politica
del sector y velar por el cumplimiento de esta Ley.
El regimen tributario de los productos derivados del petr6leo se estableci6 con el
Decreto Legislativo No. 775 del 31 de diciembre de 1993 que aprob6 la Ley del
Impuesto General a las Ventas (16\V) y el Impuesto Selectivo al Consumo (ISC),
esta Ley fue ratificada por el Decreto Legislativo No. 821 de abril de 1996 y
rnodificada por Decreto Suprerno No. 1 08-97-EF de agosto de 1997.
Adicionalmente, los bienes afectos al IGV estan afectos al Impuesto de Promoci6n
Municipal (IPM).
En base a este marco legal, son biesnes afectos al Impuesto Selectivo al Consumo,

montos que fluctuan entre S/.0.13 para fueloils y S/. 2.54 para gasolina para
motores de mas de 95 octanos. Estos bienes tambien estan afectos a una tasa de
16% por IGV y 2% por ]PM.
Finalmente, los reglamentos de la Ley de Hidrocarburos se publicaron a partir de
noviembre de 1993. Estos incluyen: protecci6n ambiental en las actividades de
hidrocarburos, calificaci6n de empresas petroleras, aplicaci6n de la regalia y
retribuci6n en los contratos petroleros, refinaci6n y procesamiento de hidrocarburos,

Telecomunicaciones
Como meta previa al desembolso clel segundo tramo, se acordo la preparaci6n del
nuevo regimen de competencia, la nueva estructura tarifaria y el plan de
privatizaci6n del sector. Como meta previa al desembolso del tercer tramo, se
acord6 la implementaci6n del nuevo regimen de competencia, estructura tarifaria y
plan de privatizaci6n.  Asimisma, la emisi6n del Reglamento de la Ley de
relecomunicaciones con respecto a la operaci6n de la nueva agencia reguladora,
los principales tipos de servicio, el proceso y metodologia para el establecimiento de
tarifas y el proceso para el otorgamiento de concesiones.



PAL -ICR
- 46 -
Asi, se public6 el Texto Unico Ordenado de la Ley de Telecomunicaciones (Decreto
Supremo No. 013-93-TCC), la Ley de Desmonopolizaci6n progresiva de los
servicios puiblicos de telecomunicaciones de telefonia fija local y de servicios de
portadores de larga distancia (Ley No. 26285 de enero de 1994), y el Reglamento
del OSIPTEL (Decreto Supremo No. 62-94-PCM). Se estableci6 ademas un periodo
de transici6n hacia la libre competencia para los servicios de telefonia local fija y de
portadores de larga distancia nacional e internacional, contandose con un periodo
de concurrencia limitada durante el cual s6lo se otorgara la concesi6n a una
empresa, segun lo indicado en la Ley No 26285 y los Contratos de Concesi6n.
En relaci6n al organismo regulador, el Organismo Supervisor de la Inversi6n Privada
en Telecomunicaciones (OSIPTEL) promueve la libre y leal competencia, controla y
sanciona los abusos de posici6n dominante en el mercado y emite de manera
transparente reglas de juego claras y estables para los inversionistas y
consumidores.
El 28 de febrero de 1994 se subast6 un paquete compuesto por el 35% desaccones
de la Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. (ENTEL), alrededor del 20%
de las acciones del Estado en la Compaffia Peruana de Telefonos S.A. (CPT) y la
suscripci6n de capital en CPT para alcanzar el 35% del accionariado. El consorcio
ganador fue liderado por Telef6nica Internacional de Esparia que ofreci6 US$
2,002.2 millones. De este modo, el Estado recibi6 US$ 1,391 millones por sus
acciones, mientras que US$ 610.8 millones fue suscrito como capital adicional en
CPT. Asimismo, se vendieron acciones a los trabajadores de ENTEL en enero de
1995.
Entre junio y julio de 1996 culmin6 con gran exito la oferta publica de acciones del
Estado en Telef6nica del Peru, constituyendose en una operaci6n que incluy6 la
colocaci6n de acciones en los tramos internacional, institucional local y el Sistema
de Participaci6n Ciudadana.
Pesca
El Gobierno y el Banco Mundial acordaron que en el sector pesca se promulgue la
Ley de Pesca y se emita el reglamento de esta Ley estableciendo un nuevo regimen
de ordenamiento pesquero.
El 22 de diciembre de 1992 se public6 la Ley General de Pesca (Decreto Ley No.
25977) y el 15 de enero de 1994 se public6 el Reglamento de la Ley General de
Pesca, Decreto Supremo No. 01-94-PE) el cual tuvo observaciones por parte del
Banco.
La Ley General de Pesca norma la actividad pesquera a fin de promover su desarrollo
sostenido como fuente de alimentaci6n, empleo e ingresos y asegurar un
aprovechamiento responsable de los recursos hidrobiol6gicos, optimizando los
beneficios econ6micos, en armonia con la preservaci6n del medio ambiente y la
conservaci6n de la biodiversidad.



PAL -ICR
- 47 -
Por otro lado, el Reglamento de la Ley General de Pesca ha sido objeto de sucesivas
modificaciones para adecuarlo a los requerimientos de la actualidad pesquera en el
pals. Dichas modificaciones, ademas, han sido debidamente concordadas con los
principios de conservaci6n y aprovechamiento responsable de los recursos
Ihidrobiol6gicos buscando asegurar el sostenimiento de la actividad y evitar las
ineficiencias econ6micas asociadas a la realizaci6n de inversiones desmesuradas en
capacidad de planta y flota. En octubre de 1997 se modificaron algunos artfculos del
IReglamento de la Ley General de Flesca referidos a la actividad pesquera artesanal.
Aun se realizaran modificaciones a este reglamento en lo que respecta a infracciones,
sanciones y programas de adecuaci6n ambiental, estando previsto elaborar un
proyecto destinado a sustituir parte del reglamento de la Ley General de Pesca, para lo
cual se contarb con el apoyo de la 'Sociedad Nacional de Pesqueria y representantes
del sector pesquero privado, a fin de lograr un marco legal promotor para el desarrollo
de esta actividad.
A continuaci6n se presenta la actuail politica pesquera, las actividades desarrolladas
en el sector durante el periodo de vigencia del prestamo, asi como las perspectivas
del mismo.
ILa politica del sector se orienta haicia la armonizaci6n de los intereses nacionales
con el concurso e iniciativa empresarial del sector privado. Asi, la implementaci6n
de las politicas de manejo y regulaci6n pesquera se han basado en la consideraci6n
,de factores biol6gicos, pesqueros, ambientales y econ6micos involucrados en la
actividad de extracci6n y de procesamiento y su correlaci6n con el factor social,
coadyuvando a la preservaci6n y a Ia explotaci6n racional de los recursos
Ihidrobiol6gicos en el marco de los planes de ordenamiento y constantes medidas de
regulaci6n pesquera fijadas de acue.rdo a la dinamica de la pesquerfa nacional.
El sector pesquero ha ejecutado programas de investigaci6n tecnol6gica para lograr
el maximo  aprovechamiento  de  los recursos hidrobiol6gicos marftimos y
continentales como fuentes de alimentaci6n, velando por aspectos de seguridad y
calidad en los productos que se elaboran, y propendiendo a diversificar la
producci6n pesquera. En lo concerniente a la investigaci6n cientifica, se
intensificaron los cruceros de investigaci6n, asi como las acciones de monitoreo y
!prospecciones para el conocimienlo y regulaci6n de la pesca de las especies de
mayor importancia comercial como la anchoveta, sardina, jurel, caballa, y merluza,
entre otras. Asimismo, se han realizado monitoreos oceanograficos permanentes
con la finalidad de estudiar la evoluci6n del calentamiento del mar peruano y la
predicci6n del fen6meno "El Niffo"; un mejor conocimiento de este fen6meno
permitira contar con los elementos iiecesarios para mitigar sus efectos negativos en
la actividad pesquera. Finalmente se ha fortalecido al IMARPE brindandole mayor
autonomia en su gesti6n y mejor. presupuesto.
Otros logros a destacarse en el sector pesquero son el crecimiento y desarrollo de la
infraestructura de la pesqueria artesanal, el apoyo crediticio otorgado a la actividad
pesquera artesanal y acuicultura, la capacitaci6n de los pescadores artesanales a
escala nacional, y la ampliaci6n de lla infraestructura piscicola.
En terminos de participaci6n estatal en la producci6n pesquera, el Estado ha dejado
de ser propietario de las plantas de harina y aceite de pescado de Pesca Peru. En



PAL -ICR
- 48 -
ese sentido, se procedi6 a subastar las siguientes plantas de harina de pescado:
Chicama, Chimbote Centro, Mollendo, La Planchada, Atico, Norte Supe, Chancay,
Huacho, Callao Norte, Huarmey, Tambo de Mora Sur, 1lo Centro, llo Sur, lo Norte,
Tambo de Mora Norte; y las refinerias de aceite de pescado de Chimbote y Callao.
Actualmente s6lo queda la Oltima planta de Pisco Norte para que la ex-empresa
estatal Pescaperu pase por completo al sector privado.
De otra parte, el Ministerio de Pesqueria aprob6 los lineamientos de polffica pesquera
pare el desarrollo sostenido de la pesqueria y acuicultura (R.M.No.646-97-PE,
publicada el 25.10.97) que se resumen en:
o Promover e incentivar la investigaci6n cientifica y tecnol6gica pesquera y
capacitaci6n pesquera en aguas marinas y continentales
o Fortalecer la gesti6n del Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE), Instituto Tecnol6gico
Pesquero (ITP), Centro de Entrenamiento Pesquero de Paita (CEP Paita) y Fondo
Nacional de Desarrollo Pesquero (FONDEPES)
o Propiciar la cooperaci6n tecnica y econ6mica nacional e internacional
o Fomentar la pesca responsable de los recursos hidrobiol6gicos
o Desarrollar e implementar los Sistemas y Planes de Ordenamiento Pesquero y
Acuicola
o Propiciar el desarrollo y diversificaci6n de la pesca artesanal y acuicultura
o Apoyar la operatividad de una moderna flota pesquera de consumo humano directo
o Priorizar el desarrollo tecnol6gico de la pesca para consumo humano directo, a fin
de incrementar el consumo per capita
o Promover el consumo de recursos y productos pesqueros, asi como el
abastecimiento, distribuci6n y comercializaci6n de recursos hidrobiol6gicos
, Optimizar en acci6n concertada entre el Estado y el sector privado, la explotaci6n
de los recursos hidrobiol6gicos en las fases de extracci6n, acuicultura,
procesamiento y comercializaci6n
o Promover la inversi6n nacional y extranjera hacia el aprovechamiento diversificado
de las especies inexplotadas o subexplotadas para el consumo humano directo
o Fomentar la preservaci6n de la calidad del medio ambiente y la diversidad biol6gica
o Promover el desarrollo de la acuicultura de subsistencia, especialmente en las
zonas andinas de mayor pobreza y en las zonas de frontera.
Se aprobaron los Planes de Ordenamiento del Calamar Gigante o Pota (abril 1994)
de la Merluza (enero 1997), y del Atun y especies afines a fin de contar con una
norma legal mas dinamica que permita lograr el aprovechamiento racional y
sostenido de los stocks de atun y especies afines, y fomentar el desarrollo gradual
de su pesquerla.  Actualmente, se encuentra en elaboraci6n el plan de
reordenamiento del atun y del calamar para lo cual se vienen recibiendo importantes
aportes del sector privado.
Para los prop6sitos del ordenamiento pesquero se tiene previsto la adopci6n de
sistemas modernos en materia de monitoreoa vigilancia y control de las actividades de
extracci6n acordes con los avances tecnol6gicos. En este sentido, el MIPE ha
dispuesto la puesta en marcha de un Sistema de Control Satelital para las
embarcaciones pesqueras de bandera nacional. El referido Sistema tambien
comprende la instalaci6n de Centros de Control en la Direcci6n Nacional de Extracci6n



PAL -ICR
- 49 -
del MIPE, en la Direcci6n General Je Capitanias y Guardacostas del Ministerio de
Defensa y en el IMARPE. La instalaci6n del Sistema permitira conocer la ubicaci6n de
la flota pesquera, efectuar su segluimiento y mantener comunicaciones con las
embarcaciones que se integraran ail mismo; ademas, esta herramienta de control
automatizado cubrira la amplitud del ambito geografico del mar peruano, incluyendo la
zona de altamar hasta donde se desplaza eventualmente parte de la flota pesquera
que cuenta con permisos de pesca otorgados por el MIPE para realizar actividades
extractivas, de conformidad con los Planes de Ordenamiento Pesquero.
En el marco del Censo y Programa de Verificaci6n de Capacidad de Bodega, el 12
de junio de 1997, se promulg6 el D.S. 006-97-PE mediante el cual se aprobaron
normas complementarias al D.S. 013-97-PE que en febrero de 1997 precis6 la
situaci6n de embarcaciones pesqueras que fueron materia tanto del censo como del
mencionado Programa. Este nuevo dispositivo oficializ6 la situaci6n legal de las
embarcaciones autorizadas a realizar actividades extractivas, para cuyo efecto se
public6 la relaci6n de las mismas.
Posteriormente, por D.S. 0008-97-PI_ publicado el 22 de octubre de 1997, se aprob6
los listados definitivos de las embarcaciones con permiso de pesca, incrementos de
flota y embarcaciones siniestradas con p6rdida total.  En dichos listados se
comprueba la existencia de 736 ernbarcaciones pesqueras autorizadas a realizar
actividades extractivas, de las cuales 565 son embarcaciones con permiso de pesca
para el recurso anchoveta/sardina.
Asimismo, del total de embarcaciones pesqueras autorizadas a realizar actividades
extractivas, 570 realizan labores de pesca para consumo humano indirecto, 19 para
consumo humano directo e indirecto y 147 exclusivamente para consumo humano
directo.
Como una medida destinada a combatir la pesca ilegal, se dispuso que las
enmbarcaciones no consignadas en los listados emitidos mediante el D.S.0008-97-PE
estan impedidas de efectuar labores de pesca.
De acuerdo a los objetivos de promoci6n de la participaci6n privada en el monitoreo
y supervisi6n del sector, la Resoluci6n Ministerial No. 404-97-PE publicada el 10 de
setiembre de 1997, aprob6 las normas complementarias para ejecuci6n del
Programa de Verificaci6n y Certificaci6n de la capacidad de operaci6n instalada de
las plantas de procesamiento, consistente en la verificaci6n de las declaraciones
realizadas por las embarcaciones piesqueras sobre el recurso extraido, asegurando
que las mismas se correspondan con la autorizaci6n otorgada respecto del volumen
capturado, tamafio del recurso y artes de pesca utilizadas para su extracci6n.
La Comisi6n Especial encargada de coordinar y centralizar la ejecuci6n del
mencionado Programa hizo conocsr los resultados del proceso de apertura de
sobres y evaluaci6n de propuestas confirmando la selecci6n de Bureau Veritas S.A.
Sucursal en el Peru, como la entidad especializada que se encargada de ejecutar el
referido programa, precisandose que la Comisi6n Especial suscribira con Bureau
Veritas S.A. Sucursal en el Peru el Convenio, sus anexos y demas documentos
requerdos para la ejecuci6n del programa sefialado.

Desde el mes de setiembre, se vienen desarrollando programas piloto de
verificaci6n de descarga de las especies hidrobiol6gicas atun, sardina, jurel y
caballa. Estos planes consisten en verificar del 15 al 20% del total descargado. A
partir de noviembre y hasta fines de aflo, se verificara el 20% del total descargado.
A partir del presente afio comenzaria la verificaci6n al 100% de la descarga de las
especies mencionadas. Estos planes piloto han permitido detectar infracciones,
tales como pesca sin autorizaci6n, pesca de especie no autorizada, etc.
Finalmente, en el caso del recurso sardina para consumo humano directo, la
verificaci6n se esta haciendo al 100%.
Asimismo, se autoriz6 la realizaci6n del Plan Piloto de Verificaci6n destinado a
proteger el recurso anchoveta, el mismo que estara a cargo de la Asociaci6n Bureau
Veritas - CERPER Sucursal del Pero, empresa que resulto ganadora del concurso
"Verificaci6n de artes de pesca, sistemas de preservaci6n a bordo y volumenes de
descarga de las embarcaciones pesqueras industriales para consumo humano
directo e indirecto de las especies: anchoveta, sardina, jurel y caballa". Desde
octubre de 1997 dicha asociaci6n viene encargandose de las inspecciones tecnicas
y del seguimiento y control de las actividades extractivas, en adici6n a tareas
similares que realizan los 6rganos del Ministerio de Pesquerfa (MIPE) y las
Direcciones Regionales y Subregionales de Pesqueria.
Tambien se autoriz6 la realizaci6n del Plan Piloto de Verificaci6n destinado a
proteger el recurso sardina, el mismo que, al igual que en el caso del recurso
anchoveta, esta a cargo de la Asociaci6n Bureau Veritas - CERPER Sucursal del
Pero.
Por su parte, a fines de octubre de 1997, se design6 una Comisi6n conformada por
representantes de los sectores publico y privado, encargada de elaborar el Plan
Estrategico para el Desarrollo de la Pesqueria en el mediano plazo, el cual estaria por
culminarse.
En relaci6n a las actividades de investigaci6n, el Instituto del Mar del Pero
(IMARPE) realiza un seguimiento cientifico de las especies con la finalidad de
disponer de informaci6n sobre su biologia, dinamica poblacional, determinaci6n de
la biomasa total y del stock de reproductores, del potencial de captura o rendimiento
y sus perspectivas de explotaci6n en el corto y mediano plazo, asi como de los
demas requerimientos para el ordenamiento pesquero, con la finalidad de lograr la
explotaci6n racional y el desarrollo sostenido de su pesqueria, estudios que pueden
ser reforzados en el futuro. Entre sus actividades, IMARPE tambien realiza el
monitoreo de las condiciones ambientales.
En este contexto, en agosto de 1997, se autoriz6 al IMARPE la ejecuci6n del Plan de
Operaci6n Eureka Sur I con cobertura entre los puertos de Atico y la Frontera Sur, y
con la participaci6n de embarcaciones pesqueras de mayor escala. El objetivo del
referido Plan es la comprobaci6n o determinaci6n de los cambios en la distribuci6n y
concentraci6n que se producen en dicha zona del litoral, asi como la constataci6n de
las condiciones biol6gicas-pesqueras, principalmente del recurso anchoveta y sus
relaciones con el ambiente. Los recursos hidrobiol6gicos extraidos con fines de
investigaci6n de acuerdo a lo dispuesto en el Plan de Operaci6n y en el ambito
sefialado, son autorizados a ser procesados en las plantas que cuenten con licencia

de operaci6n vigente en las zonas; comprendidas entre los puertos mencionados.
IMARPE presentara un Informe Final de la investigaci6n a ejecutar a la Direcci6n
Nacional de Extracci6n.
El IMARPE ejecutara el crucero de evaluaci6n de recursos pelagicos en el verano
de 1998, con la finalidad de determinar la ampliaci6n de la cuota de captura
permisible del recurso anchoveta.
Cabe seifalar que el presupuesto del IMARPE se ha incrementando en los ultimos
anos. De la asignaci6n dispuesta para el ejercicio 1993 ascendente a S/. 6.1
millones de nuevos soles se pas6 ai una asignaci6n de Sl.17.8 millones de nuevos
soles en 1995, S/.22.8 millones de nuevos soles en 1996 y S/.27.3 millones de
nuevos soles en 1997.
En torno al fen6meno de "El Nifno", 4,ste viene desarrollandose desde marzo de 1997
a lo largo de la costa peruana y sus efectos ya se han mostrado en el sector. Asi,
por ejemplo se ha estimado que durante 1997 se ha obtenido una menor extracci6n
de la anchoveta de aproximadamente 21,6% respecto a 1996. En el mes de marzo
de 1998 se concluiria una investigaci6n para determinar la disponibilidad de la
anchoveta y las cuotas de captura que se fijarian para el presente anio.
Durante el periodo que dure "El Nino" con ia aparici6n de recursos tropicales, como
el perico y el langostino, se orientara la producci6n a la elaboraci6n de conservas y
congelados. Asi, se ha observado por ejemplo, que la pesca de sardina, jurel,
caballa y otros pescados, crustaceos y moluscos, destinada a la elaboraci6n de
conservas de pescado y mariscos ha tenido un incremento de 69,9% con respecto a
1996.
Finalmente se considera que a pesar del fen6meno de "El Niffo" no se producira
desabastecimiento de productos pesqueros, debido a que este suceso climatol6gico
trae consigo la presencia de una variedad de recursos que pueden ser explotados.
Adicionalmente el IMARPE ha informado el surgimiento de una gran corriente de
agua fria frente a la costa peruana, clue permitiria reanudar en abril la temporada de
pesca de anchoveta y sardina para 1a producci6n de harina y aceite de pescado.
A fines de 1997 y en coordinacion con el Banco Mundial, se organiz6 la visita de un
consultor de reconocido prestigio internacional en el area de pesca. El referido
consultor estuvo en nuestro pais para identificar las areas en que brindara
asesoramiento especializado al MIPE respecto de las diferentes opciones para la
administraci6n de recursos pesqueiros, identificando sus ventajas y desventajas.
Igualmente, el consultor ha proporcionado informaci6n sobre la experiencia
internacional en materia de sistemas de administraci6n pesquera, y ha bnndado
asesoria puntual en torno al actual sistema de administraci6n de los recursos
anchoveta y sardina. Tambien ha sugerido mejoras al sistema de administraci6n
pesquera y ha efectuado una primera evaluaci6n del impacto del fen6meno "El Niffo"
en las condiciones de operaci6n de la industria de la anchoveta y la sardina.
Entre las actividades por realizar en el sector, se deberS concluir con el programa de
fortalecimiento de las funciones de control, monitoreo y verificaci6n, continuandose
ademas con la delegaci6n gradual de estas funciones al sector privado. Como



PAL -ICR
- 52 -
resultado de este programa tambiCn se podra identificar los recursos que requieran del
establecimiento de planes de ordenamiento especificos. Asimismo, durante 1998 se
llevaran a cabo coordinaciones con la industria pesquera privada a fin de determinar la
introducci6n, en una primera etapa, del sistema de cuotas individuales transferbles
(ITQs) para el calamar gigante o pota y la merluza, especies que actualmente cuentan
con sus respectivos planes de ordenamiento.  El avance del programa de
fortalecimiento mencionado anteriormente permitira identificar otras especies que
eventualmente podrian ser incorporadas al referido sistema de cuotas individuales
transferibles.
Como se ha detallado antes, la empresa Bureau Veritas viene apoyando al
Ministerio de Pesqueria con la realizaci6n del censo de embarcaciones para
determinar su capacidad de bodega, el censo de plantas procesadoras para
determinar su capacidad instalada y la realizaci6n de los proyectos piloto para
verificar la descarga de anchoveta, sardina, jurel y caballa.
Actualmente se esta realizando el censo para determinar la capacidad instalada de
las plantas procesadoras. Posteriormente, cuando se levante la actual veda, en
mayo de 1998, se dara inicio a la realizaci6n del proyecto al 100%, vale decir la
verificaci6n de la descarga al 100% las especies anchoveta, sardina, jurel y caballa.
Finalmente dentro del ordenamiento pesquero se contemplaria la reducci6n en el
mediano plazo del 30% de la capacidad de bodega de la flota para recursos
plenamente explotados.
Saneamiento
En el sector saneamiento, las metas incluyeron aspectos como la remisi6n al
Congreso de un borrador de la Ley en el sector y la preparaci6n del borrador del
reglamento para dicha ley; asi como la promulgaci6n de la Ley en el sector
saneamiento, la emisi6n del reglamento de la Ley y el establecimiento de la agencia
reguladora para el sector.
En diciembre de 1992 se cre6 la Superintendencia Nacional de Servicios de
Saneamiento (Decreto Ley No. 25965) y en 1994 se public6 la Ley General de la
Superintendencia Nacional de Servicios de Saneamiento (Ley No. 26284) y su
reglamento (Decreto Supremo No. 24-94-PRES). En julio de 1994 se public6 la Ley
General de Servicios de Saneamiento (Ley No. 26338) y en 1995 se aprob6 el
Reglamento de la Ley General de Servicios de Saneamiento (Decreto Supremo No.
09-95-PRES).
c)   Implementaci6n del programa de privatizaci6n
Programa de Privatizaci6n
El Acuerdo del Prestamo PAL estableci6 que antes del desembolso del segundo
tramo se ofrezca en venta por lo menos US$ 450 millones en activos de la "Agenda
de Privatizaci6n", con un minimo de US$ 275 millones en activos de dos de los tres
sectores de minerfa, hidrocarburos y telecomunicaciones. Por otro lado, antes del



PAL -ICR
- 53 -
desembolso del tercer tramo, el Perb se comprometi6 al ofrecimiento en venta do
por lo menos US$ 1,200 millones en activos de la "Agenda de Privatizaci6n", con un
minimo de US$ 300 millones en cada uno de los sectoros de minoela y
telecomunicaciones y la venta efectiva al sector privado de por lo menos US$ 600
millones en activos de la "Agenda de Privatizaci6n".
Se entiende por "Agenda de Privatizaci6n" la relaci6n de empresas y valorizaci6n de
sus activos que se estableci6 en la Carta Suplementaria al Pr6stamo PAL.
En t6rminos de la referida Agenda, det los US$ 4,135 millones establecidos en ella, se
ha logrado ofrecer en venta mas de U.S$ 3,000 millones.
En el sector minero se ha logrado ofrecer en venta mas de US$ 875 millones con una
inversi6n proyectada de US$ 4 690 rnillones aproximadamente. Entre las empresas
privatizadas se incluye: Hierro Peru, mina de cobre Condestable, mina de cobre de
Cerro Verde, refinerla de cobre deo Hay refinerla de zinc de Cajamarquilla, entre otros.
En el sector hidrocarburos el monto transado alcanz6 los US$ 790 millones con una
inversi6n proyectada de US$ 170 rnillones, habiendose privatizado las siguientes
empresas: Solgas (distribuidora de gas), Petrolera Transoceinica (transporte maritimo
de combustibles), Petromar (explotaci6n de petr6leo off-shore), Petroperb (estaciones
de gasolina), Planta de Lubricantes Petrolube, Lote 8 y Loat 8X y el Lote X (concesi6n
para explotaci6n y exploraci6n de hidrocarburos), Terminales del Norte, Centro y Sur.
En el Area de telecomunicaciones, el monto ofrecido en venta borde6 los US$ 2 600
millones con una inversi6n proyectgada de US$ 2 176 millones, monto explicado
mayormente por la subasta de la Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A.
(ENTEL) y la Compaflia Peruana de Telefonos S.A. (CPT).
Petroperu
El pr6stamo PAL contribuy6 al esquema de privatizaci6n de PetroperO. La meta
establecida con el Banco con relaio6n a esta empresa indicaba quo antes del
desembolso del segundo tramo, soi prepararia el plan do implemontaci6n y ol
cronograma de privatizaci6n. Antes del desembolso del tercer tramo, se ofrocerla
en venta los activos de Petropero de acuerdo con el plan de implementaci6n y el
cronograma establecidos (antes del desembolso del segundo tramo) con un minimo
de US$ 300 millones de los activos de Petroperb de la "Agenda de Privatizaci6n" y
con un 70% en plantas de almacenamiento, de manora tal que so promueva el
meircado abierto y competitivo.
En la "Agenda de Privatizaci6n", laI empresa Petroperb estuvo valorizada do la

pr6stamo exltosoo El equlpo de trabajo del Banco aslgnado pars esti pristamo fue



PAL -ICR
- 55 -
muy bueno. Por ejemplo, en el cumlplimiento de las metas del sector pesquero, el
Banco evalu6 los pros y contras de la aplicaci6n del sistema de ITQs tratando de
dejar de lado la discrecionalidad de los actores involucrados.
En ei caso del PAL en particular, el principal objetivo del prestamo fue apoyar la
realizaci6n del programa de privatizaci6n en el Perui y no el cumplir unicamente con
un listado de condiciones. El Banco y el Gobierno trabajaron juntos y se tuvo una
flexibilidad razonable para la adaptaci6n a las necesidades del beneficiario.
El Banco no debe tratar de imponer condiciones, mas bien se debe tener en claro
que estas son un Acuerdo entre Banco y el Gobierno.
Una gran ventaja en el prestamo PAIL fue la continuidad de la(s) personas a cargo
que permitio aplicar flexibilidad necesaria en el cumplimiento de metas.
El !Pr6stamo de Asistencia T6cnica de Privatizaci6n (Privatization Technical
Assistance Loan - PTAL) tambien ayud6 a cumplir las metas del prestamo PAL. No
s6lo en el MEF, sino tambien en COPRI y los CEPRIs, se tuvo asesoria t6cnica y
continuidad en el campo de acci6n del pr6sLamo.
Punto importante a seffalar es la necesidad de mejora en la coordirlaci6n al interior
del "Grupo Banco Mundial" con la finalidad de lograr el mejor efecto en los menores
plazos en las coordinaciones que se efectuen con las misiones provenientes de las
instituciones conformantes del Grupo.
Sobre el desempefho del Beneficiario del Prestamo
Tanto el Banco como el gobierno del Peru trazaron metas muy optimistas al
momento de la suscripci6n del pr6stamo, hecho que gener6 presiones por ambas
partes para Ilegar a cumplirlas, lo que finalmente no se concret6, dando lugar a que
se solicitaran varias pr6rrogas a la fecha de cierre pactada inicialmente.
Peru trat6 de cautelar todos los aspectos del proceso de privatizaci6n lo que implic6
algunos atrasos. Sin embargo, entre 1998 y 1999 se concluira con este proceso.
Pesca v PetroperO:
Al principio, las condiciones de mayoir trascendencia en el prestamo PAL fueron las
referidas a los sectores de pesca y Petroperu. Las fechas establecidas en los
cronogramas resultaron muy optimista perdiendose un aflo por posponerlos.
Con relaci6n al sistema de Cuotas Inclividuales Transferibles (Individual Transferable
Quotas - ITQs), a pesar de tener claridad en la concepci6n del Sistema, se tuvo
problemas en determinar la mejor manera de implementarlo - de ser esta la decisi6n
- en el sector pesquero peruano. La implementaci6n del sistema de ITQs podria
tornarse inmanejable por el sector pesquero a menos que se le delegue al sector
privado.
Duraci6n del or6stamo:



PAL -MCR

El pr6stamo suscrito el 21 de abrl de 1993 tonia como fecha inicial de cierre el 30

segunda hasta el 30 de junio de 1997 y una tercera hasta el 31 de dicdembre de
1997. Finalmente hubo una iltima pr6rroga por razones administrativas hasta el 30
de enero de 1998.

EVALUACION DEL PROGRAMA DE PRIVATIZACION
CON FINANCIAMIE:NTO DEL BANCO MUNDIAL
I.- OBJETIVOS
1.1. Convenio del Prestamo
El objetivo del proyecto establecido en el Convenio del Prestamo (Proyecto de Asistencia
Tecnica para Privatizaci6n) entre la Republica del Peru y el Banco Internacional de
Reconstrucci6n y Fomento - BIRF de fecha 21 de abril de 1993, se ha cumplido a cabalidad
al haberse concretado la asistencia a la COPRI en la preparaci6n e implementaci6n del
Programa de Privatizaci6n, habiendo contribuido con las reformas de las politicas sectoriales
y participado en la definici6n de un nuevo marco regulatorio.
El Financiamiento del Banco Mundial ha permitido cumplir los siguientes objetivos
especificos:
F ortalecimiento de la Capacidad Administrativa de COPRI y los Comitds Especiales, a
trav6s de la contrataci6n de consuiltores, coordinadores y asistentes tecnicos.
Campafia Informativa y Promocional, a trav6s del desarrollo de campanas promociones
locales e internaciones para difundir el programa de privatizaci6n e interesar a los
potenciales inversionistas.
Preparaci6n e Implementaci6n del Programa de Privatizaci6n y apoyo en la definici6n
del marco regulatorio necesario para garantizar la ejecuci6n del programa. La
preparaci6n del programa comprendi6 la realizaci6n de auditorias financieras, evaluaci6n
y valorizaciones, elaboraci6n de prospectos y documentos necesarios para la venta de las
empresas en proceso de privatizaci6n.
1.2. Programa de Privatizaci6n
A lo largo de estos afios se viene cumpliendo los objetivos trazados al inicio del proceso, los
cuales estan orientados a:
Contribuir a un mejor funcionamiento de la economia de mercado.



-59 -
Promover la inversi6n privada, nacional y extranjera, en sectores gravitantes para el
desarrollo econ6mico (energia, comunicaciones, petr6leo, etc.)
Promover el desarrollo del mercado de capitales nacional incrementado el monto y
nuimero de transacciones y participantes (a traves de mecanismos como participaci6n
ciudadana, fondos mutuos)
Generar ingresos para el Tesoro Puiblico (financiamiento de programas de lucha contra la
extrema pobreza, etc.).
II. EVALUACION DEL PROCESO DE PRIVATIZACION
En 1990 el gobierno inici6 un programa de reformas estructurales orientado a redefinir el rol del
Estado y sentar las bases para un desarrollo integral y sostenido; los objetivos sobre los que se ha
venido trabajado incluyen la estabilizaci6n de variables macro econ6micas y monetarias como son
los gastos fiscales y ia presion inflacionaria, la reinserci6n internacional, la apertura hacia el libre
mercado, la promoci6n de la inversi6n privada, la buisqueda de competitividad internacional y la
consolidaci6n de la pacificaci6n.
La privatizaci6n es un componente esencial de este esfuerzo y no una simple venta o transferencia
de empresa o activos, constituyendo una herramienta a traves de la cual el Estado deja en manos
del sector privado la iniciativa empresarial y productiva, a la vez que se fortalece en areas donde
fue perdiendo presencia como educaci6n, salud, seguridad, administraci6n de justicia,
infraestructura, que son claves para el bienestar de la poblaci6n.  Paralelamente, el Estado adopta
un rol regulador para el funcionamiento sano del mercado.
2.1. Marco Legal
En 1991 se da inicio al Programa de Privatizaci6n promulgandose el 25.09.91 el Decreto
Legislativo 674 "Ley de Promoci6n de la Inversi6n Privada en las Empresas del Estado" que
define los principios generales de la privatizaci6n, los 6rganos del proceso (COPRI, CEPRI),
mecanismos, modalidades, venta a trabajadores y crea el FOPRI para financiar las
actividades del proceso.
Asimismo, la Ley 26438 precisa que el FOPRI es un organismo descentralizado, dependiente
de la COPRI, con personeria juridica, que cuenta con autonomia funcional, econ6mica,
financiera y administrativa.  Las funciones, organizaciones y facultades de la Direcci6n



- 60 -
Ejecutiva FOPRI estan contenidas en su estatuto aprobado mediante Decreto Supremo No.
060-97-PCM del 24.11.97. Por este dispositivo el FOPRI sigue siendo el soporte del proceso
de privatizaci6n y ademas participa como la entidad responsable de velar por los intereses del
Estado en materia de posprivatizaci6n, cumpliendo una labor importante en la supervisi6n de
los compromisos de los inversionistas, cuando esa funci6n no haya sido asignada a los
organismos reguladores correspondientes.
2.2. Resultados Obtenidos y Experienci.a Adquirida
-    Como resultado del proceso de privatizaci6n, el total de ingresos generados a la fecha por
las transacciones realizadas a diciembre de 1997, asciende a US$ 8,363.8 millones,
distribuido en: compra de acciones y/o activos US$ 6,988.9 millones, concesiones/contratos
de cesi6n/contratos de operaci6n/derechos de vigencia opci6n US$ 477.6 millones,
capitalizaciones US$ 897.3 millones. De este total de transacciones (sin la capitalizaci6n)
se ha pagado al contado US$ 5,925.6 miillones y US$ 343.1 millones en papeles de la deuda.
quedando un saldo financiado de US$ 1,197.8 comprendidos dentro de los siguientes
esquemas:  Programa de Promoci6n Empresarial 19%, Trabajadores 2%, Participaci6n
Ciudadana 29%, Concesiones/Opci6n 25% y otros 25%. (Anexo No.l, A ance del Proceso de
Privatizaci6n)
Asimismo, las operaciones de privatizacii6n permitiran inversiones a futuro por mas de US$ 6
mil millones, donde US$ 2,729 millones (que incluye la inversi6n a ser realizada con los
recursos aportados en la capitalizac:i6n) corresponde a inversiones comprometidas
contractualmente y con metas establecidas; los informes peri6dicos de auditoria reflejan en
la mayoria de los casos el cumplimiento de los compromisos de inversi6n de acuerdo a lo
previsto en los cronogramas. Es de resaltar que dicho cumplimiento es liderado por el sector
minero, telecomunicaciones y electrico. (Anexo No. 2, Estado de Situaci6n de los Compromisos
de Inversi6n)
Se ha logrado una notable ampliaci6n de la base de propietarios.  Por un lado. los
trabajadores de las empresas a ser transferidas pueden adquirir hasta el 10% de las acciones
de la empresa privatizada, lo cual ha posibilitado que mas de 16 mil trabajadores, que han
ejercido su derecho de compra, disfruten de los beneficios que esto conileva. Por otro lado,
inas de 385 mil personas se han beneficiado a traves del Sistema de Participacion Ciudadana



- 61 -
aplicado en el saldo de acciones de Telefonica, Luz del Sur y Cementos Norte Pacasmayo.
El establecimiento de mecanismos efectivos y transparentes garantiza el desarrollo del
mercado de capitales, difunde la propiedad privada, fomenta el ahorro, la inversi6n y
promueve una cultura de mercado.
Igualmente, el proceso busca fomentar la participaci6n de empresarios locales otorgandole
condiciones de financiaci6n similares a las existentes en el exterior, logrando hasta la fecha
aplicar el Programa de Promoci6n Empresarial en mas de 80 transacciones en diversos
sectores econ6micos.
Se ha atraido a importantes operadores, como por ejemplo: Telef6nica (Espania), Generandes
(EE.UU/Chile), Mobil Oil (EE.UU.), Repsol (Espafia), Doe Run/Renco Group (EE.UU.),
Banco de Credito (Peru). Cambior Inc. (Canada), Perez Companc (Argentinal), Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya (Espafia), BHP (Australia), Acerco/Stanton Funding/Wiese (EE.UU./Peru), Rio
Algom/Inmet (Canada), Cominco/Marubeni (Canada/Jap6n), etc.
Se ha generado mayor eficiencia en el servicio de telefonia donde el tiempo de espera
promedio para la instalaci6n de una linea se ha reducido de 118 meses en 1992 a 7 dias en
1997, el costo de la linea telef6nica ha bajado de US$ 1,500 a US$ 300, la densidad
telef6nica ha aumentado de 2.9 en 1993 a 7.5 en 1997 de lineas en servicio por cada 100
habitantes, el numero de hogares con linea telef6nica en Lima creci6 de 17% en 1993 a 42%
en 1997, gran expansi6n estratos de menores ingresos.    En la distribuci6n y generacion
de energia en Lima, el grado de electrificaci6n ha crecido de 68% en 1994 a 98% en 1997, la
perdida de energia en distribuci6n ha bajado de 19% a menos de 14% del total recibido, las
inversiones realizadas en el sector prActicamente garantizan la no interrupci6n del servicio en
ausencia de lluvias.  En los servicios bancarios, los gastos operativos como porcentaje de
los activos promedio han descendido de un 7.3% a 5.7% en el Banco Continental y de 8.5% a
6.6% en Interbank, mejora en la calidad de la cartera, la mayor competencia ha originado una
flexibilizacion en las condiciones de prestamos personales y en el lanzamiento de nuevos productos.
Asimismo, el proceso de privatizaci6n ha permitido: la reducci6n de la burocracia estatal,
activa participaci6n del sector privado, mayores recursos para el Estado, redefinici6n de la
funci6n del Estado y una modernizaci6n empresarial.

Finalmente, dada la complejidad que reviste el proceso de privatizaci6n en su conjunto, que
incluye acciones preparatorias y propias de transferencia, han surgido algunos problemas de
posprivatizaci6n, como:
Contingencias legales, laborales, tributarias (incluyendo reclamos, juicios, etc.).
Incumplimiento en algunos casos del calendario de pagos correspondiente al saldo de
precio, en los casos que se vendan acciones y/o activos en forma diferida (caso de 5 ex
hoteles de turistas de Chimbote, Huaraz, Ica, Iquitos y Moyobamba, asi como el Circuito
No.2 de propiedad de Epsep).
Incumplimiento de los compromisos minimos de inversi6n de acuerdo a los plazos para
su ejecuci6n (donde mencionaremos nuevamente a los 5 ex hoteles de turistas detallados
en el punto anterior).
Complejidad de los procesos de las liquidaciones y extinciones.
2.4. Principales Privatizaciones
2.4.1. Sector Telecomunicaciones
- Entel / CPT
Con la transferencia al sector privado de las empresas de telecomunicaciones, en el marco de
la exitosa subasta realizada el 28 de febrero de 1994 en la cual el consorcio Telef6nica del
Peru liderado por Telef6nica Intemacional de Espafia ofreci6 US$ 2,002 millones por el 35%
de acciones de Entel Peru, el 19.9% de la Compafiia Peruana de Telefonos CPT con la
obligaci6n de suscribir un aumento de capital para alcanzar el 35% del accionariado de CPT,
se crearon asi las condiciones propicias para la modernizaci6n de este sector sobre la base de
la eliminaci6n de las distorsiones que en el pasado detuvieron su desarrollo. El compromiso
del consorcio ganador de la subasta contemplaba, entre otros, la colocaci6n en un plazo
maximo de cinco afios de un mill6n de lineas telef6nicas, asi como la interconexi6n que
permita que todos los poblados con mas de 500 habitantes est6n integrados a la red nacional
de telefonia antes de dicho plazo.
De igual modo, entre junio y julio de 1996 culmin6 con gran exito la oferta puiblica de
acciones del Estado en Telefonica del F'eru, constituyendose en una operaci6n que incluy6 la



- 63 -
colocaci6n de acciones en los tramos intemacional (US$ 918 millones), institucional local
(US$ 41 millones) y el Sistema de Participaci6n Ciudadana (US$ 280 millones).
Asimismo, con el fin de contar con un ente regulador en el sector de telecomunicaciones se
cre6 al Organismo Supervisor de la Inversi6n Privada en Telecomunicaciones OSIPTEL que
tiene como objetivo principal promover el acceso, modernizaci6n, calidad y eficiencia de los
servicios publico de telecomunicaciones, asi como de regular el comportamiento de las
empresas operadoras, establecer la politica de defensa de los usuarios, fijar los cargos de
interconexi6n de los servicios piublicos de telecomunicaciones, etc..
2.4.2. Sector Hidrocarburos
- Petroperu
La estrategia contempla la reestructuraci6n de Petroperut en Unidades de Negocio, en las que
se viene promoviendo la participaci6n de inversionistas estrategicos, otorgandoles control
sobre las operaciones, a traves de contratos de operaci6n, de cesi6n de posici6n contractual o
de gerencia y a traves de la venta de acciones manteniendo el Estado, en algunos casos, un
determinado porcentaje del capital social.

2.4.3. Sector Minero
Centromin
Luego de la subasta de Centromin de modo integrado, declarada desierta en mayo de 1994 por
falta de postores, se inici6 la adecuaci6n y la definici6n de una nueva estrategia, que fue



- 64 -
puesta en ejecuci6n en enero de 1996, y considera una transferencia de modo fraccionado a
traves de las siguientes modalidades:
Venta de activos:  proyectos (Antamina, Toromocho, Yauricocha) y prospectos mineros
(Quicay, otros).
Capitalizacion: utilizada en Metaloroya (Complejo Metalurgico de La Oroya).
Venta de acciones: utilizadas en las empresas creadas: Yauliyacu S.A. (mina Casapalca),
Mahr Tunel S.A. (minas San Crist6bal / Andaychagua), Cobriza S.A. (mina Cobriza),
Paragsha S.A. (mina Cerro de Pasco), Imexcallao S.A. (dep6sito y facilidades portuarias),
Electroandes (sistema electrico).
Para lograr dichos objetivos, se hizo necesario transferir a distintas entidades del Estado,
servicios basicos y de apoyo:  Sistema Ferroviario Yauricocha-La Oroya-Cerro de Pasco,
(Colegios, Hospitales, Servicios locales de agua, energia.

2.4.4. Sector Electricidad
La transferencia al sector privado de este sector se basa en los siguientes principios: la
generaci6n, transmisi6n y distribuci6n deben ser manejados por empresa separadas e
independientes; la actividad de generaci6n electrica debe realizarse dentro de un
marco de libre competencia absoluta; los derechos y responsabilidades de las
compafnias deben ser regulados, debido a su naturaleza monop6lica.

Asimismo, se crea al Organismo Supervisor de la Inversi6n en Energia OSINERG, con
la misi6n de fiscalizar el cumplimiento de las disposiciones legales y tecnicas
relacionada con las actividades de los subsectores de electricidad e hidrocarburos, asi
como el cumplimiento de la conservaci6n y protecci6n del medio ambiente en el
desarrollo de dichas actividades.
III. Evaluaci6n del Prestamo del Banco Mundial
3.1. Estructura de Financiamiento del Programa de Privatizaci6n
El presupuesto del proceso de privatizaci6n se financia con los recursos provenientes del
Fondo de Promoci6n de la Inversion Privada (FOPRI), cuyas fuentes se sustentan en lo
dispuesto por el Articulo 30 del Decreto Legislativo 674: el 2% del producto de la venta de
las empresas a privatizar, los fondos que le transfieran algunas empresas en proceso, creditos
y donaciones externas y otros ingresos.
Los gastos de privatizaci6n entre 1991 a 1997 son US$ 180 millones, de los cuales US$ 83
millones corresponde a otros egresos como pagos por racionalizaci6n de personal, beneficios
sociales, incentivos, laudos, saneamiento, transferencias a entidades del Estado, prestamos.
Los US$ 97 millones restantes corresponden a los gastos de privatizaci6n como consultorias
(legal, financiero, auditorias, valorizaciones, tasaciones, peritajes, promoci6n, etc.), otros
servicios (divulgaci6n, publicaciones), pasajes, viaticos, etc; cabe resaltar que estos gastos
de privatizaci6n representan el 1.2% del total de transacciones realizadas.
Estos US$ 97 millones han tenido como soporte financiero el prestamo del Banco Mundial
hasta por US$ 30 millones, representanclo asi el 31% de participaci6n en el proceso.
3.2. Programas y Proyectos Financiados con el Prestamo del Banco Mundial
Podemos afirmar entonces que el Banco Mundial ha participado en el financiamiento de los
principales procesos de privatizaci6n, cuyos resultados han sido desarrollados en la segunda
parte del presente informe, destacando:

3.3.  PNUD Administrador de los Recursos FOPRI
Mediante Cartas Acuerdo entre el Gobierno del Perut y el PNUD se conviene en lo
concemiente a la utilizaci6n de los recursos del FOPRI a traves de la administraci6n del
Progratna de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), en principio en lo concerniente
a la ejecuci6n de la donaci6n Japonesa administrada por el Banco Mundial y, posteriormente,
a los demnas recursos del FOPRI incluido el Prestamo del Banco mundial hasta por US$ 30
millones.
En lineas generales, la administraci6n de PNUD de los recursos del FOPRI, ha pennitido la
transparencia del proceso, agilidad en los tramites, asi como tambien ha actuado como palanca
financiera en los inicios del proceso hasta contar con la liegada de los recursos del Banco
Mundial y  del FOPRI;   posteriormente, al generarse  excesos de  caja  provenientes
principalmente del 2% de las ventas en los afios 1994 (US$ 10.5 millones), 1995 (US$ 23.8
millones) y 1996 (US$ 21.8 millones) basicamente, no se ha logrado rentabilizar dichos
recursos debido al no reconocimiento de intereses por nuestros saldos positivos.

IV. PERSPECTIVAS
Durante 1998 y 1999 se tiene programado culminar el proceso de privatizaci6n de las empresas.
En esta etapa se tendra especial cuidado en la calidad de la privatizaci6n de tal modo que se
cuente con un marco regulatorio e instilucional que rija el funcionamiento de las empresas,
especialmente si se trata de servicios puiblicos.
Durante 1998 destacarian la ejecuci6n del Fondo Mutuo de Ahorro Publico como un instrumento
financiero orientado a elevar el bienestar de los trabajadores jubilados (puiblicos y privados), y con
mecanismos que contemplan la utilizaci6n parcial de los remanentes de acciones que todavia el
Estado mantiene en empresas privatizadas. Previamente, se efectuaria una colocaci6n en mercados
internacionales y en menor medida nacionales, de los remanentes ya mencionados mediante la
Oferta Publica de Venta.
