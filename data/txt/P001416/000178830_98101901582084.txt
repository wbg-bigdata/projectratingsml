SUMMARY
i.        Since its establishment in 1965 with tha assistance of the Inter-
national Finance Corporation, LBIDI has been the only source of long-term fi-
nancing for industry in Liberia, but its volume of operations has been very
low. LBIDI has, nevertheless, played a useful role; its investments have gone
mostly to Liberian sponsored projects, and have had a positive effect on value
added, employment and exports.
ii.       LBIDI's management has been strengthened in the past two years with
the presence of a new General Manager, who has contributed to rectifying past
errors in LBIDI's records and to setting up better operating procedures. LBIDIts
staff has also been strengthened recently and is now adequate in number and
quality to cope with increasing activities.
iii.      LBIDIts project appraisals are acceptable. Economic analysis was weak,
but has improved; LBIDI has started to calculate the economic rate of return of
projects as part of its appraisal procedures. Project follow-up has been spora-
dic, and LBIDI has agreed with the Bank on steps to establish effective follow-
up procedures. Accounting and disbursement procedures have improved and are
adequate. LBIDI's lending terms and collateral requirements have been rigid,
but its Board has recently approved more flexible guidelines for terms and col-
lateral requirements.
iv.       LBIDI has recently made a commendable effort in loan recoveries, and
loans in arrears have decreased from over 40% to under 5% of the total outstand-
ing loan portfolio. LBIDI's failure to protect itself against the foreign ex-
change risk on its loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau resulted in losses
of $135,000 in 1971. However, LBIDI's financial position is sound: LBIDI has
little debt, and risks of losses in its portfolio are amply covered by provi-
sions and reserves.
v.        LBIDI has a substantial pipeline of projects under study. Given more
dynamic management, more flexible lending practices and a greater degree of
coordination with the Liberian Development Corporation, a Government agency res-
ponsible for project promotion, LBIDI could achieve the $1 million annual busi-
ness volume which was envisaged at the time of its establishment. While LBIDI
can generate sufficient resources to finance its local expenditures, it will
need about $1.5 million for import financing in the next two years. To cover
this amount LBIDI has applied for loans to the African Development Bank and to
the World Bank.
vi.       LBIDI is creditworthy for a Bank Loan; an appropriate amount would
be $1 million. The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied
to Bank loans to development finance companies, except that it is recommended
that LBIDI receive concessional treatment or comnitment charges. A suitable
free limit would be $50,000, with an aggregate free limit of $200,000.
vii.      LBIDI can play an important role in enhancing industrial development
in Liberia, and stands a good chance of fulfilling this purpose with the proposed
loan and with recent improvements in its management, staff and procedures. How-
ever, LBIDI's success depends on the environment for industrial development. A
UNIDO team is now preparing a program of assistance to small industries, and



- iv -
the Government is revising the Investment Code. The Government and the Bank
have agreed to review the scope and results of these efforts and supplement
them if necessary with a wider study that would produce specific recommenda-
tions to improve the environment for industrial development.



APPRAISAL OF
LIBERIAN BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment (LBIDI)
was established in 1965 with the assistance of the International Finance Cor-
poration, which subscribed to 25% of LBIDI's share capital of $1 million. In
1965 LBIDI received a loar from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau of DM 10 mil-
lion. LBIDI was unable to utilize the entire loan before it expired in 1971b.
As a result LBIDI faces a shortage of resources, has been unable to process
projects due to lack of funds, and has applied for loans to the African Devel-
opment Bank and to the World Bank. This report appraises LBIDI for a loan of
$1 million.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
The Liberian Economy
2.01      An analysis of the economic situation of Liberia appeared in the
report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia", dated June 11,1971
which was distributed to the Executive Directors under R-71-150. Liberia has
a dualistic economy with a prosperous, foreign-dominated enclave sector of
iron ore mines, rubber plantations, and logging operations which contribute
about 40% of GDP and 90% of exports but employ only about 11% of the labor
force. Alongside the enclave sector is a large underdeveloped and stagnating
rural economy consisting primarily of subsistence farmers which employs two
thirds of the labor force. The per capita GNP of $233 obscures the real
poverty of the country. Income distribution is highly skewed. Two thirds of
the 1.5 miUion population which is engaged in subsistence agriculture have an
average per capita income of-less then $50. The remaining one third of the pop-
ulation is engaged in the monetary sector of the economy (of which 10% are ex-
patriates including a large number of Lebanese engaged primarily in trade) and
have a much higher per capita income.
2.02      Mining is the dominant sector of the economy, accounting for over
30% of GD? and 75% of exports. Iron ore alone accounts for 95% of the total
mining output. Agricultural output represents less than 25% of GDP, of which
one third is accounted for by subsistence agriculture, one third by rubber,
and the other third by the production of logs, coffee, palm oil, cocoa, rice,
and other cash crops.
Recent Economic Developments
2.03      The Liberian economy has experienced a moderate growth rate.  The
growth of GDP in real terms is estimated to have averaged nearly 4%, and in
current terms about 6%, over the past three years. Most of this growth



originated in the enclave sector and there has been little growth outside this
sector. Iron ore sales, however, fell in 1971 as a consequence of a recession
and slowdown of steel consumption in industrialized countries. Iron ore prices
may also have started to decline, after a price peak in 1970. Rubber has also
been affected by a long-term deterioration in world prices. Log exports in-
creased considerably in 1968 and 1969, helped by the near depletion of forest
reserves in neighbouring Ivory Coast. However, some logging concessions have
experienced difficulties because of poor transportation facilities and low e-x,o1L
prices for logs.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.04      The manufacturing sector in Liberia is small; its contribution to
GDP and to employment in the monetary sector represents respectively 5% and
8% of the total. There are only about fifty industrial enterprises operat-
ing in the country, many of which produce for the local market. Because of
the small size of the market, most enterprises are either of less than optimum
scale or operate at low rates of capacity utilization. These include a cement
factory and other producers of construction materials, textiles, footware,
chemicals, furniture, beverages, an oil refinery, and small mechanical work-
shops. Export oriented industries are few, and include several sawmills for
timber, fish and shrimp processing, and the production of explosives for min-
ing operations.
2.05      On the basis of information collected by the Ministry of  Planning
from 24 industrial establishments, which show gross value of production and
not value added, industrial production for the twelve months ended on June 30,1971,
totaled about $33.5 million, of which half was contributed by the oil refinery.
Of the other half, food and beverages contributed 50%, cement and other con-
struction materials 13%, explosives 12%, wood and furniture 9%, textiles and
shoes 9%, and paints, soaps, other chemicals and mechanical industries the re-
maining 7%.
2.06      Annual growth in manufacturing output for the period 1964-1970
averaged better than 12%. However, most of the growth in the past two years
is accounted for by the oil refinery. Statistics on fixed capital formation
in this sector are not available. However, there are indications that annual
industrial investment has been erratic and ranged between $1 and $3 million
(see para. 3.10). Industrial development has been constrained by the small
size of the market and by the shortage of indigenous skills. In contrast with
the structure in many sub-Saharan countries, there are few small enterprises in
the Liberian industrial and handicraft sector. With few exceptions, most in-
vestments have been of medium size, generally ranging between $50,000 and $500,000
in capital cost. While non-Liberians have dominated commerce, about half of the
industrial investment in Liberia has been in companies owned predominantly by
Liberians.
2.07      Prospects for industrial investment in Liberia are limited because of
the small size of the market and the limited prospects for regional economic
cooperation in Western Africa in the near future0 However, industrial poten-
tial is not negligible; further scope exists for import substitution in some



- 3 -
industrial branches (flour milling, meat processing, beverages, textiles, foot-
wear, furniture, handtools and agricultural implements, construction materials)
and the availability of local raw materials offers possibilities in pulp and
glass manufacturing, vegetable canning, and rubber and wood products. Other
small scale projects in mechanical industries and handicraft could also emerge
if industrial promotion institutions were more effective (see para. 2.08).
Industrial Promotion Institutions
2.08      The Liberian Development Corporation (LDC) was created in 1961 as
an independent Government agency reporting to the Department of Commerce and
Industry with the four following main functions: (i) to identify and promote
viable industrial projects, (ii) to review and recommend projects for incen-
tivesunder the Investment Code; (iii) to issue guarantees to encourage banks
lending to Liberian enterprises, and, (iv) to hold the Government's equity in-
vestments in industrial and financial companies. LDC has 18 professional staff
grouped into four departments: marketing, engineering, finance and agriculture.
LDC holds the Government's shareholding in LBIDI, and the President of LBIDI
sits on LDC's Board of Directors. LDC has not been a very effective organiza-
tion. Its Board seldom meets more than once a year, and several senior staff
members have left because of low salaries. LDC's feasibility studies have
deteriorated in quality, and some enterprises established with incentives recom-
mended by LDC may be enjoying benefits disproportionately high in comparison
with their contribution to the economy. In addition, LDC's loan guarantee
scheme has proven to be ineffective because it lacks sufficient funds. Al-
though LDC expected to be strengthened in 1972 with assistance from UNIDO, its
role and organization need to be reassessed.
2.09      The Bureau of Industrial and Resource Development (BIRD) is an agency
in the Department of Commerce and Industry in charge among other functions, of
surveying Liberia's industrial potential and recommending plans for industrial
development, studying world supply and demand situation for Liberian products,
and facilitating contact between foreign industrial investors and their Liberian
counterparts for the purpose of promoting industrial development and investment
in Liberia. The Bureau has been understaffed, and some of its functions over-
lap with those of LDC, with which there is no working contact. It would appear
prima facie desirable to have only one Government institution in charge of
industrial promotion in Liberia in order to use economically the scarce quali-
fied staff available in the country. The Government is contemplating a possible
merger between BIRD and LDC but any definitive decision should be preceeded by
a study to determine what should be their role and organization.
Industrial Promotion Measures
2.10      The Investment Code, issued in March 1966, provides tax benefits
(generally a holiday from Liberia's 45% income tax for up to ten years), tariff
protection from competing imports, and duty-free imports of equipment and raw
materials for periods ranging from one to seven years. Incentives under the
Code are believed to be too generous and a Cabinet Committee was appointed in
1971 to review the Investment Code, but no report has yet emerged. Annex 2
shows the number of projects in manufacturing approved for incentives each
year since 1966 and their aggregate investment cost: they total )44 projects



-w-ith a total investment cost of $8.1 million, an average of $1.4 million per
year.  Incentives under the Code are granted by the Investment Incentive Com-
-nittee, on the basis of recommendations by the Department of Planning for
projects costing over $150,000, or by LDC for smaller projects.
2.11      Extension Services.  Six industrial enterprises have been established
in an industrial park near Monrovia under the direction of LDC.  So far the only
facility provided has been the land. The location of the park offers some seri-
ous problems such as the lack of adequate access roads and communications facil-
ities and a severe shortage of water. UNIDO is assisting LDC in the establish-
ment of an extension service and a small industrial estate in the park. A three
man UNIDO team is already in Liberia to undertake the studies and assistance
needed,     to develop a program of feasibility studies, and to assist small
industries.
Evaluation of Industrial Promotion
2.12      The industrial promotion institutions existing in Liberia could be
much more effective, and their role and organization should be reassessed.
During negotiations, Government representatives fully concurred in the need
for such review and called attention to the initiatives already under way
summarized in the preceding paragraphs. Agreement was reached that the Govern-
ment and the Bank would review all these initiatives with a view to recommend-
ing how they should be supplemented or modified so as to effect comprehensive
improvement of the environment for industrial development. Supplementary
studies would deal with the following main topics, among others:
a) Determination of the major obstacles, prospects and integration
possibilities for the industrial sector in relation to the
resource endowment of the country;
b)  Analysis of the tariff structure in relation to industrial
efficiency and incentives;
c) Review of industrial performance under the existing promotion
and incentive policies and examination of the benefits  as
against the losses tothe econony resulting from these incentives
and the effort of the proposed modificationsto the Investment
Code;
wi  d)  Examination of the proposed reorganization of LDC and the possible
reorganization of related agencies involved in industrial develop-
ment;
e) Establishment of an effective business extension service and loan
guarantee scheme;
f) Preparation, based on the above, and a set of integrated recom-
mendations and a plan for their implementation.



- 5-
Financial Institutions
2.13      In addition to LBIDI, the only source of long-term capital in Liberia,
there are seven commercial banks, six of which are subsidiaries of foreign banks.
The Agricultural Credit Corporation, a public sector institution responsible for
short-term credit to agriculture, ran into financial problems and no longer
operates. There is no central bank, and the U.S. dollar is legal tender. The larg-
est bank (the Bank of Monrovia) performs some central banking activities sach as
providing clearing facilities for the other banks, ensuring an adequate supply of
currency notes, placing Liberian coins into circulation, and providing overdraft
facilities to theGovernment. There are no Government regulations for commercial
banking operations. As a result each bank establishes its own reserve requirements
under guidelines decided by their parent institution.
2.14      Aggregate Balance Sheets for these banks show a considerable growth
of private deposits (from $33.9 million in 1969 to $41.5 million in 1971) and
a still more rapid growth in bank loans to the private sector (from $25.2 mil-
lion at the end of June 1969 to $38.9 million at the same date in 1971).
2.15      Annex 1 shows the sectoral breakdown of commercial bank loans out-
standing to the private sector. As of June 30, 1971, commerce and manufacturing
account for 54%, construction for 4%, and agriculture for 6% of total loans.
Personal loans account for an additional 16%. The large foreign consessions do
most of their banking transactions with banks abroad, and their operations have
therefore only a limited impact on the commercial banks' activities.
2.16      No statistics on the distribution of loans by term are available.
However there are indications that individuals and enterprises with good cre-
dit ratings have little difficulty in obtaining medium-term loans from the
banking system. Credits with shorter maturities are often rolled over. Inte-
rest rates are of theorder of 9-1/2 to 10% including commissions.
III. LBIDI's ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
LBIDI as a Source of Financing
3.01      LBIDI's influence on the Liberian economy has been disappointingly
small due to its low volume of operations. When IFC participated in LBIDI's
share capital in 1965, an annual level of approvals of $1 million was envisaged
for the next few years. This level has not been achieved in any single year.
Annex 3 shows LBIDI's volume of investments since operations began in 1967. They
total $2 million, an average of $400,000 per year. A peak was reached in 1969,
when investments approved reached $860,000, and a low in 1970 when they fell to
$82,000. In 1971 LBIDI approved eleven investments totaling $266,000. The low
level of operations in 1970 and 1971 seems due to several constraints:
(i) insufficient management aggressiveness in the search for
business,
(ii) rigid collateral and security requirements (which resulted in

rities and grace periods not much longer than those of
commercial banks, from which potential LBIDI clients were
able to obtain medium-term loans, and
(iii)   lack of coordination with LDC and other public agencies, and
(iv)   in 1971, lack of resources after the cancellation of the un-
committed balance on the KfW loan last September. Two projects
for $356,000 were ready for presentation to LBIfDI's Board but
could not be considered until LBIDI had resources; other pro-
jects have also been turned down for this reason.
3.02      Annex 3 showsthe sector distribution of LBIDI's operations. Of the
$2 million volume of investments approved since LBIDIts inception, industry
(59% of amounts approved) is the leading sector, followed by agribusiness and
livestock (28%) and by tourism, transport and other services (13%). Industrial
loans have been predominantly for food processing, wood and furniture, while
agricultural projects financed include palm oil, tobacco, poultry and rubber.
Since no statistics on gross fixed capital formation by sector are available
in Liberia, it is difficult to measure LBIDI's contribution to investment in
the country. Private investment has averaged about $50-60 million annually in
recent years, mostly in mining, while public investment has been around $10
million annually, with the major part going to infrastructure. Even with the
predominance of mining and infrastructure in fixed capital formation, LBIDIfs
contribution to total investment in industry and commercial agriculture has
been small.
3.03      A rough idea of LBIDIfs contribution can be obtained by comparing
LBIDI's lending to that of commercial banks. LBIDI's loans outstanding at the
end of 1971 represented between 7% and 10% of total commercial bank loans to
agriculture, industry and commerce. A more meaningful estimate is the propor-
tion of projects approved by the Investment Incentive Commission which have
been financed by LBIDI; of 44 projects approved by the Commission with an over-
all investment of $8.1 million, LBIDI has financed only seven with a total capi-
tal cost of $2.28 million, or 28%.
Characteristics of LBIDI's Operations
3.03      Size.  Annex 3 shows the distribution of LBIDI's loans by size.
LBIDI has served mostly small scale firms, with only five of 49 loans exceeding
$100,000 ind accounting for 75% of LBIDI's loan portfolio), and 30 loans for
less than $10,000. Most small loans have been granted to rubber farmers. Others
have financed small coffee or cocoa farms. Despite their small size, rubber
loans are not too onerous for LBIDI since both the technical appraisal and the
subsequent loan collections are handled by the Rubber Planters Association, an
independent group promoted by large rubber concessions who want to encourage
the growth of small rubber farms and, hence, their raw rubber supplies. However,
LBIDI is not equipped to process a large number of small agricultural credits.



-7 -
3.04      Geographical Distribution.  Since Liberian industry is concentrated
in the vicinity of Monrovia, most of LBIDI's investments were for enterprises
located in the area, although a large loan was granted to a logging company
in the eastern region, near the Ivory Coast. Investments in agribusiness show
a more balanced distribution, with loans to rubber farms located near the large
foreign-owned plantations, and a large palm oil plantation in the north.
3.05      Nationality of Borrowers.  A positive aspect of LBIDI's operations
is that over two-thirds of its financing has gone to Liberian sponsored compa-
nies (see Annex 3). The remaining investments have gone to joint ventures with
a minority Liberian participation.
3.06      Clients' Performance. Annex 4 summarizes important aspects of the
economic and financial performance of LBIDI's eleven largest investments, which
accounted for almost 94% of LBIDI's outstanding portfolio. Of the ten invest-
ments in operation, five had returns of over 15% in 1970, one of 12%, and four
are not performing well and had returns on investment below 7%. (See para. 5.03).
3.07      Exports.  Over half of LBIDI's projects are export oriented, with
exports accounting for over 50% of production (Annex 3), while a third are
for import substitution and the balance for services. LBIDI calculates that
exports by its clients exceeded US$6 million in 1970, which represents 11%
of total exports of Liberia during the year, excluding mining. This is a sa-
tisfactory proportion considering the much smaller share of LBIDI in overall
investment in the country.
3.08      Employment. The average investment per job created by LBIDI's 11
largest projects is $U,600 (see Annex 4), which is quite low, showing that
LBIDI has invested in relatively labor intensive projects. LBIDI has esti-
mated that since the start of operations in 1967 the projects it has financed
have created a total of about 1,300 jobs, of which about 800 were in manufac-
turing and represented over 5% of employment in that sector.
3.09      To sum up, LBIDIts volume of operations has been low. It is note-
worthy, however, that most of LBIDI's investments are:
(a) projects which involve a high proportion of Liberian value
added (logging, food processing and agribusiness);
(b) export oriented;
(c) in Liberian sponsored companies; and
(d) quite labor intensive.

IV. THE COMPANY
Ownership, Management and Organization
4.01      Ownership. There have been no material changes in ownership since
the Company's inception in 1965. Annex 5 shows LBIDI's shareholders. Of
LBIDI's capital of US$1 rmillion, the Government of Liberia and IFC hold 25%
each, and private Liberian investors 1% (class A shareholders). Financial
institutions, Firestone Plantations and two mining companies (class B share-
holders) own the remaining 49%.
4.02      Board of Directors and Executive Committee.  The Board of Directors
is made up of the eight members listed in Annex 6, four of which represent
class B shareholders, and four, class A shareholders. The Government has two
seats in the Board, while IFC and private Liberian shareholders have one each.
Mr. A.A. Khosropur resigned as IFC's representative and Mr. P.M. Mathew was
elected to the Board on December 15, 1971. Mr. Stephen Tolbert, brother of the
President of Liberia and a successful businessman, was recently appointed
Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman of LBIDI's Board; he has been a Board
member since 1969.
4.03      Most members of the Board of Directors take a strong interest in
LBIDI's affairs. The Board, which has been meeting twice a year, has delegated
to an Executive Committee power to approve investments up to $100,000, and to
exercise most of the Boardts other powers when it is not in session. Since 1969
the Executive Committee has had five members (see Annex 6) with three members
constituting a quorum. Decisions require the affirmative vote of all members
present at the meeting, and any member present may refer to the full Board any
project or issue he considers important. The non-voting Chairman of the Committee
is the President of LBIDI and its Secretary is the General Manager. The Committee
met eight times in 1970 and nine times in 1971.
.04       Management. Mr. C. Parker was appointed President of LBIDI in May 1970;
he had been the acting Chief Executive since July 1969. The General Manager is
Mr. R. Chellappah, who was recruited with the help of the Bank Group and appointed
in May 1970 by LBIDI's Board. Mr. Chellappah's appointment has recently been ex-
tended for one more year, with an option to renew it for a further year. The
President and the General Manager constitute the Senior Management Team of the
Bank, and must reach agreement on all matters relating to policies, organization
and operations of LBIDI. In case of difference of opinion their views must be
reported to the Board or Executive Committee.
4.05      Mr. Parker has been with LBIDI since its inception. He has benefited
from Mr. Chellappah's experience, and the management team works well together.
Mr. Chellappah, formerly with the Bank of Ceylon, has done an excellent job in
rectifying past errors in LBIDI's accounts and in setting up operating proce-
dures, and has only recently begun sharing with Mr. Parker the supervisory res-
ponsibility for project appraisal work. LBIDI has agreed with the Bank's view



that the General Manager should be fully involved in investment operations.
This will be possible since adequate records and procedures are now esta-
blished and LBIDI's staff has been strengthened (see para. 4.06)
4.06      Staff and Organization.  Annex 7 shows LBIDI's Organization Chart.
Its staff totals 17 o. whom nine are professionals. In addition to Messrs.
Parker and Chellappah there are a Project Director, a Project Appraisal Mana-
ger, a Project Analyst, a Compt-roller and an Accountant, and two Peace Corps
volunteers doing work in loan supervision and recoveries. Among LBIDI's staff
only Mr. Chellappah and the two Peace Corps members are non-Liberians. LBIDI
has agreed with the Bank's view that LBIKI should take advantage of Mr.
Chellappah's presence 'o hire and train qualified Liberian staff members who
can provide continuit1r of management upon Mr. Chellappah's departure and
handle the forecast increase in operations. To that end, it has recently hired
a Project Director, who will coordinate appraisal anf follow-up work and a
new Project Appraisals Manager who wilI be responsible for LBIDIPs appraisals;
LBIDI is actively seeking another professional staff member. LBIDI's staff
appears now sufficient in number and quality to cope with increasing activi-
ties.
4.07      Procedures. Project appraisals are quite good, particularly on market,
organizational and financial aspects. Until recently economic analysis was weak,
and included only a few qualitative remarks which stressed the positive factors
in a project without trying to weigh them against the nega-tive ones. The Bank
had expressed concern that, although there is no evidence that this has happened
in the past, the lack of quantitative analysis might lead LBIDI to finance pro-
jects which are financiallly viable but which rely heavily on protection from
imports. To guard against this, LBIDI has started to calculate the economic rate
of return on projects as part of its appraisal procedures. LBIDI agreed during
negotiations to undertake this calculations for all investments over $50,000.
4.o8      LBIDI's follow-up work has been weak. Some projects were visited by
LBIDI during construction, but lack of technical expertise minimized the value
of such visits. There is no supervision for companies in operation, except for
those in serious trouble, and thus follow-up work has not been useful in povid-
ing management with advance notice on problem cases. LBIDI has reporting require-
ments in its loan contracts but has not been enforcing them until recently.
4.09      LBIDI agreed with the Bank that effective follow-up was essential to
allow LBIDI's management to take pertinent action on problem cases, and to pro-
vide feedback information for LBIDI's operations. During negotiations, LBIDI
has agreed to visit the offices of the party carrying out each project, or the
site thereof, at least once a year, and as often as required in problem cases.
Following such visits LBIDI staff will prepare comprehensive reports for consider-
ation by management. LBIDI has also undertaken to request assistance to LDC when
special engineering or agricultural expertise will be needed to carry out LBIDI's
follow-up work.

>iO 1t   LBIDI's books are now better kept, and errors made in the past have
c;een corrected. Control of disbursements has improved recently. However, LBIDI
Is niow suffering the consequences of past negligence. Four loan agreements in-
vl-iving Kreditanstalt funds failed to protect LBIDI against the exchange risk
and, as a result of the revaluation of the German Mark LBIDI suffered losses
of $155,000 in 1971.
Policies
4,11      LBIDI's Policy Statement is shown in Annex 8. It precludes LBIDI
from financing enterprises in the public sector, and sets the following expo-
sure limits: (a) a maximum of 10% of LBIDIts resources may be invested in a
single enterprise, (b) a maximum of 10% of LBIDI's equity may be invested in
the share capital of a single enterprise, and (c) total equity investments are
limited to 100% of LBIDI's own equity. LBIDI's Policy Statement also provides
guidelines for LBIDI's operations and activities. It is noteworthy that it allows
LBIDI to consider agricultural projects associated with or contributing to manu-
facturing enterprises. LBIDI has operated within the framework of its Policy
Statement, except that it assumed the foreign exchange risk under the KfW loan,
as mentioned in para. 4.10.
4.12      LBIDI charges interest rates of 10% on loans outstanding plus a
commiitment charge of 1/2% and an administration fee of 1% of the amount of
the loan granted. Since 1971 LBIDI adds a 1% penalty charge for loans in arrears
of over three months. Total charges on loans and security requirements are com-
parable to or somewhat higher than those charged by commercial banks. Maturities,
which have averaged about five years, and grace periods have occasionally not
been long enough to allow borrowers to service their debt comfortably. Collateral
requirements were too strict and applied rigidly without due regard to the indi-
vidual features of the project and the borrower. On balance, LBIDI appears to
have been inflexible and cautious in its lending practices with respect to matu-
rities, grace periods and collateral requirements. While some caution was under-
standable in view of the poor repayment performance of several of its borrowers
(see para. 5.01), it also meant that, when they could, borrowers often preferred
to deal with commercial banks for medium-term loans and come to LBIDI only if
they were unable to obtain a commercial bank loan or when they needed a parti-
cularly long-term loan which LBIDI was willing to grant -to more established
sponsors. LBIDI is now aware of this problem and its Board has approved in prin-
ciple more flexible guidelines for lending terms and collateral security require-
ments.
Relations with the Government and Business
4.13      In the past few years there was frequent high level political inter-
vention in LBIDI's affairs which jeopardized LBIDI's effortts to recover some
delinquent loans. There are indications that this situation has changed with
the new Administration, which has stressed that the economy of the country needs
to be run more efficiently than in the past and that financial and economic con-
siderations must prevail over personal ones. The Government is also likely to
expect an improvement in LBIDI's perfornance and level of operations.



- 11 -
4.14      LBIDI's relations with LDC have not been as close as they should be;
there are no regularly scheduled meetings to coordinate activities, and LBIDI's
President seldom attends LDC's Board meetings. Coordination with LDC and with
other Government agencies responsible for industrial promotion is important to
LBIDI because it would enable LBIDI to contact project sponsors when projects
are first being formulated and to ensure that appropriate investment incentives
are recommended to the Investment Incentive Committee. During negotiations the
Government and LBIDI agreed with this view and decided that the following mea-
sures will be taken to enhance cooperation between LBIDI and LDC:
(a) Bimonthly working meetings of staff of LBIDI and LDC will be
scheduled for exchange of information on the respective activities; and
(b) In cases when LBIDI's needs for technical appraisal and follow-
up of projects warrant it, LBIDI will request assistance from LDC, and LDC will
be agreeable to assist LBIDI by supplying engineering and agricultural expertise
needed to carry out LBIDI's work.
4.15      In recent months there have been discussions in Liberia concerning
the possible absorption by LBIDI of the presently inactive Agricultural Credit
Corporation (ACC) with the purpose of utilizing economically the country's scarce
managerial and technical talent in the financing field. The Finance Minister,
who is also LBIDI's chairman, has wisely objected to the timing of the proposal
on the grounds that LBIDI still has enough problems in dealing with its original
scope of work and is not equipped to handle a large volume of short term agri-
cultural lending. Although the proposal for the merger seems to have been aban-
doned for the immediate future, the Bank should watch the situation closely.
4.16      LBIDI's image in the business commanity is not yet good, but has im-
proved. Clients object to LBIDI's collateral requirements and, as usual with
most development banks, to the amount of detailed information they have to
supply and to the time it takes to finally obtain financing.
Resources
4.17      On December 31, 1971, LBIDI's resource position was as follows:
US$1000
Equity                                       1,133
Government Loan (repayable 1985-94)          1,000
KfW loan at 4-1/2%                          1,033
Total resources  3,166
Less:  Net Portfolio                         1,640
Undisbursed commitments                          8
Government notes (redeemable 1972-81)        1,000
Net fixed assets                                26
Total Commitments 2,674
Resources available for commitment             492



- 12 -
4.18      In 1965 LBIDI received a DM10 million loan from KfW; this amount was
considerably in excess of LBIDI's needs, particularly since LBIDI found it more
advantageous to commit at no cost its own equity funds than the 4-1/2% KfW loan.
As a result LBIDI was unable to commit the whole KfW line of credit before it
expired and, in August 1971, the uncommitted balance of DM6 million was reallo-
cated to another project in Liberia at the Government's request. The $1 million
G6vernment loan is subordinated to other debt as well as to share capital, is
interest free, and is to be repaid by LBIDI over 10 years beginning in 1985. As
agreed at the establishment of LBIDI, the loan was relent to the Government at
6-1/2% interest, and was to be redeemed to LBIDI over 10 years beginning in 1975.
The Government undertook to consider earlier redemption of the loan if LBIDI's
business required it. On March 3, 1972, the Government agreed, despite its tight
budgetary position, to start redemption of the loan in August 1972.
V. PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Portfolio
5.01      Two years ago arrears in LBIDI's loan portfolio had risen to an un-
acceptably high level. As of June 1971, loans in arrears corresponded to over
40% of the total loan portfolio outstanding. A strong effort by LBIDI since
September to improve the arrears situation has been highly successful. Only
13 loans with an amount outstanding of $79,200 (4.7% of LBIDI's loan portfolio)
were in arrears by more than three months at the end of 1971. The actual amounts
in arrears were $33,500 in principal and $8,800 in interest. This is a remark-
able improvement. Of the 13 loans in arrears, one, the Lancelot Holder poultry
project, accounts for two-thirds of the total; the others are small loans, most
of which are for about $2,000.
5.02      Of LBIDI's portfolio of $1.88 million outstanding on December 31, 1971,
eleven investments for $1.74 million account for over 90% of the total. A brief
analysis of their situation and prospects constitutes, therefore, a reasonable
evaluation of LBIDI's portfolio. These 11 investments are as follows (in $tQOO).
Amount Outstanding
as of December 31, 1971

- 13 -
5.03      Annex 4 presents detailed information on the performance of these
eleven investments. Five (Mesufish, LPSC, LIPCO, Liberian Cement and Fresh
Foods) offer no cause for concern; two others (Liberia Amusements and WATCO),
although irregular in debt service in the past, are profitable and paying
back, and one, a palm oil plantation (WAAC), is not yet in operation. Of the
three others, Maryland Logging is incurring heavy losses because of the fall
in export prices and high transport costs )j but LBIDI's loan is guaranteed
by the parent company in Holland and is being repaid regularly. Coconut Grove
and Lancelot Holder are experiencing difficulties and, although LBIDI's loans
are well secured, some loss appears possible. The weak spots in LBIDI's port-
folio at present are mostly in its small loans of which eioht, for $19,100, are
in arrears of over one year; prospects for recovery are not good and LBIDI may
lose most of the amount.
5.04      Summing up, LBIDI's serious risks in its portfolio include two rela-
tively large loans for $126,000 of which LBIDI might lose as much as 50%, and
eight small loans for $19,100 which could be entirely lost. Potential losses
are amply covered by provisions of $190,000 and reserves of $133,000 (see para.
5.06).
Profitability and Financial Position
5.05      Financial Results. Annex 9 shows LBIDI's income statements and
Annex 10 its Balance Sheets from 1967 to 1971. After very modest profits in
previous years (not more than 3% on equity) LBIDI made an operating profit of
$20,000 in 1971 before extraordinary losses of $155,000 as a consequence of
the revaluation of the German mark and of its failure to protect itself against
the foreign exchange risks. LBIDI therefore suffered a net loss of $135,000 for
the year. Administrative expenses in 1971 were at the same level as 1970 and
represented 3% of total assets. LBIDI's profitability will not reach a respect-
able level until operations increase substantially.
5.o6      Financial Position.  Due to the low level of operations in 1970-71
and to short maturities of loans outstanding, loan collections exceeded dis-
bursements and LBIDI's loan portfolio decreased by $43,000 during 1971. LBIDI's
leverage is very low, and long-term debt equals only 32% of equity plus the
subordinated Government loan. LBIDI has a strong liquidity position, with a
net working capital of $500,000, and a sound financial position with reserves
and provisions equivalent to 17% of its outstanding portfolio and amply cover-
ing potential losses.
j The sponsor believes the company will only become profitable when a
veneer mill is established to process the logs locally, and has been
searching for a suitable technical partner in Europe.

5.07      Auditors.  LBIDI's accounts are audited every year by Cooper Brothers
& Company. The auditors had made no qualification on LBIDI's accounts until
their 1970 audit when they pointed out that no share certificates had been re-
ceived for any of the equity investments made by LBIDI. By the end of 1971,
LBIDI had the share certificates for three of its four investments and expected
to obtain certificates for its fourth investment in 1972.
VI. OUTLOOK
Business Prospects
6.01      Prospects for industrial investment in Liberia are limited (see para.
2.06) but further scope exists for import substitution in some industries and
the availability of local raw materials offers some possibilities in pulp and
glass manufacturing, vegetable canning and rubber products. Potential exists
for additional agribusiness projects (oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and rice) although
prospects for rubber plantations are uncertain in view of the fall in world prices.
A promising area for Liberian entrepreneurs is the supply of services to the
mining and plantation enterprises. Only one such enterprise has been financed
by LBIDI: WATCO (West African Transport Company) providing transportation ser-
vices to LAMCO (Liberian-American Mining Company), but other opportunities are
open in transportation, laundry services, bakeries, meat supply, etc.
6.02      LBIDI's project pipeline at the end of 1971 included 22 projects re-
quiring investments of $800,000. Four projects for $400,000 were ready for
Board action, 11 for about $300,000 were at an advanced stage of appraisal and
seven more for $100,000 at a preliminary stage. In addition, for projects with
a total capital cost of $750,000 have been studied by LDC and will be referred
to LBIDI for financing in 1972; they are in agribusiness, pharmaceutical pro-
ducts, tiles and cosmetics. Five other projects with an aggregate investment of
$1.7 million (salt, roofing materials, foam rubber, agricultural hand tools and
soluble coffee) are at an advanced stage of review by LDC and have a fair chance
of execution within the next two or three years. Although the above possibilities
include some potential casualties, these could be replaced by other projects.
Forecast of Operations
6.03      LBIDI has based its forecast of operations on loan approvals of $1
million for 1972 increasing by 10% annually. Although it is difficult to quan-
tify LBIDI's business prospects, its experience in 1969, when commitments were
near the $1 million level, as well as the general outlook and project pipeline
described above indicate that LBIDI's projections are attainable. The achieve-
ment of these projections requires more dynamic management, which is now thought
to be likely because the new Administration's interest in having LBIDI play a
more important role in the economy. Moreover the General Manager, who has spent
most of his time establishing internal procedures, will now have more time to



- 15 -
look for new business. More flexible lending practices and better coordina-
tion with LDC than in the past will also help efforts to increase operations.
6.04      Annex 11 contains LBIDI's forecasts of operations through 1976, esti-
mating total commitments for 1972-1976 at $6.3 million. Forecast commitments
for 1972 and 1973 total $2.15 million including $1.45 million (67%) for import
financing and $0.70 million (33%) for local procurement.
Resources Needed
6.05      To meet the $1.45 million import component for 1972 and 1973, LBIDI
hopes to receive $1 million from the Bank and $0o5 million from the African
Development Bank. The $0.7 million that is expected to be needed for local pro-
curement will be available from the sale of equity investments and net loan
collections ($0.4 million), profits and depreciation ($0.2 million), and the
$0.2 million Government notes to be redeemed in 1972 and 1973 (see para. L.18).
These sources are sufficient for LBIDI to meet commitments for local procure-
ment and also to invest $0.13 million in a proposed new building to accommodate
its staff.
6.06      After 1973, LBIDI will need to have recourse to additional foreign
borrowing to finance the import content of its forecast commitments. Domestic
needs will continue to be met from internal cash generation and redemption of
the Government's promissory notes.
6.07      Disbursements.  The proposed Bank loan would finance the CIF cost
of direct imports and/or an agreed percentage of imported goods purchased
from domestic distributors.
Financial Projections
6.08      Annexes 12 through 14 give LBIDIts 1972-76 projected income statements,
balance sheets, and sources and uses of funds. The substantial increase in pro-
ject operations and a decrease in administrative expenses from 3% of average
total assets in 1970 to 2.3% in 1976 will have a major effect on LBIDI's earnings,
which are expected to evolve as follows:
Total Revenue                     Net Profit (Loss)
of % of Average          as % of              as % of
Total Assets             Share Capital    Average Equity
Actual:  1971               7.6                   (13$5)             (11.0)
Est:  1972               7.9                     8.7                7.0
1973              8.2                     10.7                8.1
1974              8.6                     12.6                8.7
1975              8.9                     14.3                9.1
1976              9.3                     16.4                9-5
LBIDI does not forecast any dividend payments through 1976. If the results
shown above are realized LBIDI could start paying dividends of perhaps 6%
in two or three years.



- 16 -
6.09      The projected Balance Shoets anticipate that LBIDI's loan and equity
portfolio would more than double over a five year period, from $1.8 million in
1971 to $4.4 million in 1976. Although LBIDI's leverage will increase substan-
tially, its debt/equity ratio will be only 1.2:1 at the end of 1976, substan-
tially below the 3:1 limit apt in its Statutes.
6.10      Debt service coverage will be ample during the period 1972-1976.
Annual interest payments on LBIDI'  borrowings would remain below gO% of in-
terest income, and the ratio of loan collections to principal repayments by
LBIDI will range between 1.4 and 2.6. If LBIDI continues keeping in balance
the maturities on its debt and the repayments on its lendings, this ratio should
not drop below 1.3 through the life of the proposed Bank loan.
VII.  CONML&BIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      LBIDI, while playing a useful role in Liberia, has had a disappoint-
ingly small inpact on the Liberian economy. It has also suffered from internal
weakness. However, there have been some significant improvements in the past
year, particularly in management, record keeping, operating procedures, project
appraisal and loan recoveries. LEIDI is now in a sound financial position.
7.02      There is sufficient demAnd for term financing in industry and agri-
business so that LBIDI could achiove the $1 million of business volume per year
which was envisaged at the time of its creation. To remedy remaining weaknesses
and to increase its volume of operations, LBIDI agreed with the Bank on measures
which should bring a noticeable improvement in LBIDI's operational performance.
LBIDI has strengthened considerably its Liberian staff during the past few months,
and its Board has given management more flexible guidelines regarding lending
terms and collateral requirementa. Agreements have been reached with the Bank
on improving LBIDI's econoziic analysis of projects, on the establishment of an
effective follow-up system, and on the need for clover cooperation with the
Liberian Development Corporation and other Government agencies concerned with
industrial promotion.
7.03      In addition to its internal improvementa, LBIDI's success in the long
run also depends on a better environment for industrial development. The present
efforts by the Government and UNDO will be supplemented by the Bank if necessary
to make comprehensive, speoific recomnendations for changes in industrial policies
and existing institutional arrangements for industrial promotion.
7.0h      LBIDI is the only institution providing long-term capital in Liberia,
and since its KfW loan was cancelled in August 1971 it has been in a critical
resource situation. Unless it obtains funds from the Bank and the African Develop-
ment Bank, it may not be able to remain active. LBIDI is a credit worthy borrower
for the proposed Bank loan of $1 million which, together with the envisaged $0.5



- 17 -
million loan from the African Development Bank, should cover LBIDI's import
financing commitments for the next two years. The loan would be disbursed as
estimated in Annex 15. The terms of the proposed loan should be those normal-
ly applied to Bank loans to development finance companies. However, since LBIDI
has not had the opportunity to build-up its operations to an adequate level,
it is recommended that LBIDI receive concessional treatment regarding commit-
ment charges. Accordingly, the normal commitment fee should not be charged un-
til specific projects are authorized for withdrawal.
7.05      The Bank should require prior approval of each project using $50,000
or more of the proceeds of the proposed loan. An appropriate aggregate free
limit would be $200,000, which would ensure that at least 80% of the amount of
the loan would come to the Bank for approval.

1.        Purposes and Types of Activity
The Liberian Bank for Industrial Development & Investment shall
assist in the economic development of Liberia. To this end, it will
