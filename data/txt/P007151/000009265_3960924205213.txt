EL SALVADOR
URBAN I & II PROJECTS
(Loan 1050-ES - Credit 517-ES)
(Loan 1465-ES - Credit 726-ES)
Project Completion Report
PREFACE
The Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared for the
Urban I and IX projects in El Salvador for which Loan/Credit 1050-ES/
517-ES, in the amount of US$8.5 million, was signed on November 4, 1974,
with effectiveness declared on February 3, 1975.  Loan/credit 1465-ES/
726-ES, in the amount of US$12.7 million, was signed on July 28, 1977, and
became effective on December 20, 1977. The two projects are viewed as com-
plementary works, the second project building on the goals of the first
project which was designed to serve as a demonstration project and to
respond to critical shelter needs of the urban population in El Salvador.
Because of the similarity in objectives and overlapping elements of these
two projects (and because some works of first project were substituted for
works planned for second project), in this renort they are treated as one
project being implemnuted over the 1974-1980 period. Final closing of the
project was December 31, 1984 with an overall total disbursement of US$21.2
million.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Projects
Department, Urban Division, on the basis of information contained in the
Staff Appraisal Report and Legal Agreements, a review of Bank files includ-
ing supervision and progress reports, and information collected on a mis-
sion during October 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the projects were not audited by OED
staff.  The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their
reply is shown as an attachment to the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.         The first project was designed to function as both a demonstra-
tion project and one which responded to critical shelter needs of the urban
population of El Salvador.  The option of partially-built homes provided
through self-help to poor beneficiaries with little or no eubsidy using a
nongoverrment agency, was one which was not being seriously considered by
the Government.  However, shortly after project implementation began, the
concept started to gain acceptance and a second project was developed to
complement and expand upon the goals of the first one, using a government
hoUsing agency (IVU) to do pilot upgrading works, and having a quasi-
government credit institution (FEDECREDITO) involved in providing access to
credits for artisans. The two projects can thus be viewed as complementary
works which had to be evaluated jointly in order to assess their achieve-
ments, shortcomings, and problems, along with possible new approaches which
the experience suggests.
2.         Given the nature of these projects, there was need to have an
environment conducive to their proper implementation:   one in which the
different participants had time to focus upon the institutional, financial
and overall managerial aspects of the projects.  Unfortunately, there were
several start-up problems, chief among which were land availability and
local financing, The armed conflict which followed compounded the problem
in a variety of ways.   Apart from making resources scarce, the conflict
caused people to flee several project areas and martial law prohibited
workers from implementing project works for several months.  The combined
effects of these adversities led to a restructuring of the projects in
which, instead of providing about 15,000 units, only about 9,600 were
provided and many of the infrastructure and complementary community facil-
ities (e.g., roads and schools) were not provided.   The upgrading and
artisan components were implemented, but for the latter, selling artisan
products and making loan collection became more difficult as the conflict
intensified (paras. 12-21).
3.        In spite of the range of adversities which affected the projects,
they have accomplished substantial results both in physical and demonstra-
tive terms.   It is estimated that over 50,000 persons received direct
benefits and there is currently widespread acceptance of the projects and
their concepts. Even with cost increases and delays, the economic rate of
return is generally as projected at appraisal mainly because benefit also



increased as costs did.   Under any measuring standard, the projects have
achieved remarkable success; when evaluated in context of the u stable
environment under which ths works were implemented, the results are even
more impressive.  Awong the shortcomings, land acquisition problems and
difficulties in obtaining appropriate community facilities and adequate
roads figure prominently. Also, there is need to make more systematic
widespread use of the lessons learned from these projects especially for
IVU and other parastatal agencies. The land issue is one which needs to be
addressed at a mcre macro level; however, the current political and socio-
economic situation has determined government priorities and apparently not
much can be done until conditions change (paras. 30-34, 38, 46).

PRWECT COMPLETION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
1.        El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country in
Central America.  Its 1985 population was estimated at about 5.5 millica
with overall density of about 225 per sq. km.  A significant rural-urban
outflow which began from the mid-1960s accelerated as the armed conflict in
the country increased, and between 1978 and 1983, the country's urban
population rose from 41 to 49% of the total population. The majority of
this urban population reside in substandard dwellings in squatter settle-
ments (tugurios), extra-legal subdivisions (colonias ilegales), and rooming
houses (mesones).  Table 1 contains greater details of urban population
growth.
2.        The number of new households in urban areas (incluiding migration)
numbered about 10,000 annually during the 1960-1970 period, while the total
public and private production was only about 2,600 units annually, and the
majority of these was affordable to only about the upper 40% of the popula-
tion. Therefore, in the mid-1960s, the Government began formulating cohe-
rent housing policies to promote, finance and produce some 55,000 new units
with about 20,000 built between 1971 and 1975. Unfortunately, these units
were not affordable to low-income beneficiaries even with substantial
subsidies.
3.        The Instituto de Vivienda Urbana (IVU), and the Fondo Social para
Vivienda (FSV) were created by the Government in 1950 and 1973 respectively
to address low-income housing needs in the country.  Unfortunately, they
ended up producing housing largely for the upper-income group. However, in
late 1968, a non-profit agency, Fundacion Salvadorena de Desarrollo y
Vivienda Minima (FUNDASAL) which was formed to help relocate 69 poor fadi-
lies affected by floods was very successful in its goals and it decided to
expand its operations to serve more low-income families through provision
of low-cost urbanized lots with starter units.
4.         In general, during the early 1970s, the Government was aware of
the nature and dimension of shelter problems. However, it was not fami-
liar with available options and so it continued to use traditional ap-
proaches, e.g., subsidized housing programs, to try to solve such problems.



-2-
Project Origin
5.           In August 1972, the Government requested Bank assistance for
financing of the first sites and services project with FUNDASAL as imple-
menting agency.  This was followed in December 1975, with a second Bank-
assisted project, building upon the lessons already learned from the first
project, and expanding its scope to new areas of need. This PCR covers the
implementation of both projects (i.e., Loan Nos. 1050-ES/1465-ES).
6.         The first project, prepared between December 1972, and October
1973, faced several issues includinj land availability, absorptive capac-
ity of FUNDASAL, costs, Government financing, and tistitutional arrange-
ments. The appraisal took place in November 1973, and mainly in response
to the inflation which occurred in 1974, several reductions were made
regarding project scope, level of service, and number of solutions to be
provided.
7.         The second project, the preparation of which took place between
March and June 1976, and the appraisal in September of that year, included
new components such as upgrading needs and financing for artisans. IVU and
a cooperative bank (FEDECREDITO) to implement the technical assistance
program for artisans were included as implementing agencies.
Project Objectives and Description
8.         The first project was designed to:  (i) demonstrate that a site
and service program with partially-built units is a practical alternative
to conventional fully-built Government housing programs; (ii) ease the
severe shortage of low-cost urban shelter by providing units affordable to
families earning US$40-120 per month (17th percentile); (iii) demonstrate
the potential role of the private sector in providing self-financing, low-
income housing, thereby reducing Government subsidy; (iv) encourage provi-
sion of adequate community facilities and effective community development
programs; and (v) generate employment through labor-intensive construction
methods and organization of small commercial ventures. Its components con-
sisted of:   (a) construction of offsite and onsite infrastructure and
sanitary core for 7,000 units with 3,500 of these having self-help basic
dwellings; (b) construction material credits to assist in expansion of the
core units; (c) community facilities; (d) a small industries loan fund; (e)
technical assistance and training; and (f), studies in urban land use,
squatter upgrading and mortgage interest rates. Because of its demonstra-
tion nature, the first project was to be implemented in San Salvador and
the four largest secondary cities.
9.        The second project was designed to improve access to land, credit
and technical skills for the lowest-income families and enable them to
improve their standard of living directly by their own efforts.  It was
basically an expansion of scope of the first project with upgrading works,
business credit and production training included to assist artisans.  It
included the following components:   (a) development of 8,000 owner-built
dwellings on urbanized plots in urban areas in El Salvador, including trunk



- 3 -
infrastructure, construction loans and community facilities; (b) upgrading
of basic infrastructure and community facilities for about 800 families
through mutual-help, with secure tenure and credit for home improvements;
(c) credit, technical assistance, training and small industrial/commercial
sites within project and other areas; and (d) technical assistance and
training to executing agencies to improve their management capacity,
shelter design technology and to monitor and evaluate the project. Project
implementation was to be in San Salvador and about eight other secondary
cities.
IMPLEMENTATION
10.        Implementation of the first project (Loan No. 1050-ES) was sche-
duled to begin in 1974 and end in mid-1978. and for the second project
(Loan No. 1465-ES) the timeframe was late 1976 to mid-1980. Because of the
similarity in objectives and overlapping elements of these two projects,
they are treated in this completion report as one project being implemented
over the 1974-1980 period.
1.        Basically, there were three project implementation agencies for
the two projects: (i) FUNDASAL whose main tasks could be broken down into:
(a) site analysis; (b) land acquisition; (c) design; (d) prequalification,
bidding and awards; (e) civil works and trunk infrastructurt; (f) mutual
help; (g) plot occupancy and materials credit; and (h) provision of commu-
nity facilities; (ii) FEDECREDITO responsible for the credit component to
artisans; and (iii) IVU responsible for the upgrading components.
12.       Land.  Although many of these tasks could have been implemented
in parallel fashion, land availability became the most serious bottleneck
of both projects.  Table 2 gives details of the land-acquisition process.
Instead of the expected two-year acquisition period (March 1974-February
1976) for land for 7,000 plots, the process took over four years.   By
February 1976, only about 45% of the land was acquired after much search-
ing.  Among the uwin rcasous for this problem were:  the relatively large
tracts required, illegal subdivisions by owners (who initially agreed to
sell land .o PUNDASAL but later sold these plots themselves without serv-
ices), competition from other public agencies (mainly the Fondo Social),
monopoly control of large landowners, unexpected inflation in   various
areasg and difficulties in employing Government expropriation mechanisms to
overcome obstacles.  With delays in land acquisition, final design works
could not be finalized for about half of the programmed plots and so
slippages occurred.
13.         In retrospect, a better assessment of land markets and land
acquisitioni procedures at the time of project preparation and appraisal
would have been helpful.  However, It Is doubtful whether more expeditious
acquisitions could have been mrde, given existing conditions. The large
vacant tracts required were not generally available in the city, especially
when such tracts had to be accessible to trunk services and had to meet
various mutually-agreed criteria which were formulated to reduce costs as
much as possible for low-income groups.   Also, the intense unexpected
demand for vacant land from both private residents as well as government
, .



- 4 -
agencies caused the price to be bid up dramatically. Government expropria-
tion laws could have been used to prevent illegal subdivisions and facil-
itate acquisition by FUNDA$AL.  However, such laws were not easy to use,
given existing political conditions. A more beneficial approach could have
been coordinated for purchases by the various public agencies for low-
income housing. This would have reduced some of the competition and price
pressures. Cooperation among such agencies could also have assisted if one
with unused land could have made available such land to the others in need,
with the understanding that the borrower would acquire a similar plot to
repay the lender.
14.        Civil Works.    As Table 3 shows, civil works were to begin in
November 1974, and end in June 1978.  Actual works began in Sanuary 1974,
10 months earlier than programmed; however, the termination date was March
1985, 81 months later than the planned date.   Three main elements were
responsible  for  this  dclay:    land  purchasing  and design  delays  (30
months), offsite infrastructure delays (24 months), and political and
financial problems (27 months). Although adequate provisions had been made
in both projects for the sites to be located in close proximity to water
and other basic trunk lines, there was need to have the water and sewerage
authority (ANDA), the drainage authority (DUA), the roads authority (DOC),
and the electricity authority (CAESS/CEL), all provide off-site connec-
tions. These agencies had all agreed to provide their services in a time-
ly manner. However, the water and electricity supplies proved to be espe-
cially difficult to receive in several project sites. For the water, one
of ANDAs expansion program which was scheduled to be finished by January
1976, was not ready until two years later, because of a veriety of finan-
cial and technical problems.   After furnishing services to four sites,
CAESS encountered several financial and political problems and it was
reluctant to continue with the other sites in a venture which it claimed
was losing money.   Most of the offsite roads were already in acceptable
condition, although some (e.g., Popotlan), were in a state of disrepair
from overuse by heavy vehicles. DGC was not able to maintain these roads
mainly because of financial problems.
15.         Although necessary assurances were obtained from the relevant
authorities regarding the timely and adequate provision of water and other
basic trunk lines, substantial delays occurred. For water, provision was
made to have emergency wells dug if the Zona Norte river scheme was
delayed.   However, by that time, the country was already experiencing
financial difficulties and the armed conflict was getting worse. Still, in
spite of the above-noted delays, all but two sites (Rio Zarco and Chintuc
II) finally got water from ANDA. For Rio Zarco, FUNDASAL managed to use
force account to dig a well, while for Chintuc II, the Public Works Minis-
try provided the required supply lines.  Electricity lines also finally
reached all but one of the nine sites after some delays. For Rio Zarco,
CAESS initially insisted on being paid through project funds for the needed
lines, although it was stipulated in the loan agreement that the Government
was to bear such costs. FUNDASAL finally managed to install the lines and
finance the work through a Special Fund of the FNV and some donations.



-5-
16.         Building Construction.    Table 4 presents details of planned
versus actual construction of dwellings in the nine project sites.  As it
indicates, the combined adverse effects of land acquisition and timely pro-
vision of basic infrastructure produce delays ranging from twelve to
eighty-one months for individual sites. In one site, Popotlan II, although
the land was acquired, available funds were not sufficient for other works
to be completed. After discussions with the Government, the Bank decided
to use some project funds to protect the limited infrastructure works
already done and to prevent erosion.  FUNDASAL then began to seek alter-
native financing sources for this site and it finally obtained assistance
from KfW to complete urbanization and core dwelling construction works.
17.         Successful mutual help and group construction works have been
among the outstanding achievements of this project. As the internal strife
worsened, it had pronounced negative impacts upon several aspects of the
project.  First, people began to flee the conflict areas in which many
sites were located (about 50% of the sites are located fully in the con-
flict zone, with another 25% affected to a lesser degree). This movement
created a shortage of workers in several areas, and there were restrictions
on gatherings even for working on the project.  By late 1979, there were
outright prohibitions against group activities under martial law restric-
tions, and this continued until mid-1982.   Even completed units in some
sites (e.g. Rio Zarco, Chintuc) could not be allocated to beneficiaries
because of the violence which caused many to flee the areas. Such general
restrictions are estimated to have resulted in at least a two-year delay of
project implementation.
18.        Community Facilities.   Table 5 presents details on planned and
actual achievements for this component. Facilities such as schools, health
centers, markets, community centers and sports fields were to be built by
the government through its relevant agencies. The timing of these facili-
ties came during the latter period of project implementation, and as such,
they were subject to the combined delays mentioned above. Consequently, in
a period of severe financial constraints, only construction of most of the
planned schools and some of the health units and community centers for the
first project sites took place, but no markets or sports fields.  For the
second project, schools in some areas (e.g. Rio Zarco and Popotlan I) are
still inadequate; however, government officials explained that there are
literally tens of thousands of refugee chil.dren without any facilities, and
so they should have priority.
19.       To FUNDASAL's credit, it kept on implementing the project, albeit
on a much reduced pace, even during the most intensive armed conflict
,eriod. During 1983, when the Government could not provide any counterpart
fund and FUNDASAL,'s cash flow position was precarious, the Bank increased
its financing share and raised the amount it was providing in a special
project fund (established in March 1975) from US$100,000 to US$400,000 in
May, 1979; and to US$600,000 in February 1980, thus   providing greater
liquidity  for project  execution.   These  actions may well have  saved
FUNDASAL from substantial losses.  Table 6 provides details on the works
done by FUNDASAL in the different project areas.



-6-
20.   11_onent.   Under the second project, IVU was responsible for
upgrading one site in the "22 de Abril" area. Although IVU had had some
prior experience in upgrading work, this component was designed to intro-
duce new elements such as cost minimization and maximum cost recovery, con-
sistent with affordability criteria. Since the site was on marginal land
owned by the Government, there were no land acquisition problems. However,
there were serious problems caused by the political situation. The area
was regarded as an anti-government stronghold and much violence took place
there. There were prohibitions against public gatherings and this delayed
both self-help and other construction work.  IVU staff worked there at
great personal risk. The project unit head was kidnapped and held by armed
men; fortunately, he was later released unharmed. Other delays arose from
residents demanding higher standards than those originally planned {e.g.,
level of services to be provided changed from communal facilities to indi-
vidual water connections and septic tanks), and there was a 10-month delay
arising from difficulties in acquiring a pump to provide water. The work
was completed by mid 1983, almost four years after the originally schedul-
ed date with approximately 500 families benefitting from the upgrading and
titling  works.  (Initial estimates of about 800 families living in the
project area were overstated.)
21.         FEDECREDITO's Component.  This component which included over
26,000 loans to artisans had impressive initial success. However, it too
suffered adversely from the armed conflict in two principal ways: as
violence and dislocation spread to the urban areas, the artisans were not
able to move about and freely sell their products. Also, with the escala-
tion of the violence, many borrowers fled or were killed. FEDECREDITO was
not able to send officials into the field either to assist borrowers or to
collect overdue accounts since there were frequent assaults upon these
people. The effects of inflation also became a factor as decapitalization
eroded the value of available fund.   During early  implementation, the
management of FEDECREDITO did not show too much interest in this component,
preferring instead to focus upon other operations e.g. on agriculture and
rural lending.  To its credit, the staff of the responsible unit were
nevertheless very enthusiastic about its work and they performed well in
spite of staff constraints and a deteriorating   environsment.   Lack of
appropriate technical assistance during the early phase did, however, have
a negative influence upon activities.   With on-the-job exposure, staff
performance improved especially at the loan processing level, although for
macro-level planning and follow-up activities, there continued to be severe
deficiencies. Frequent managerial changes in the agency adversely affected
implementation, and it was not until the current administration that the
importance of this project component was fully &cknowledged and steps were
taken to strengthen it.  Details of beneficiary profile, types of loans
made, cost recovery, etc. are in Table 7.
Procurement
22.         All contracts above US$120,000 were to follow ICB procedures.
However, mainly because of the dispersed nature and size of the works and
the worsening armed conflict, international firms (including regional ones)
were not interested in bidding. Later on, as the conflict worsened, many



local firms could not survive, either because of martial law restrictions,
or through limited employment opportunities and destruction of their ma-
chinery  and  equipment.   Their  financial viability  also suffered,  and
FUNDASAL had to work through force account and provide much of the initial
financing in order to get the work done.  Use of direct payment to sup-
pliers by the Bank also facilitated the work and reduced delays, especially
toward the latter part of project implementation.
Reporting
23.        Throughout the project, all of the agencies complied very well
with their reporting requirements. The quarterly reports of FUNDASAL and
FEDECREDITO were especially helpful in monitoring and supervising the
project, and this became more so, when, during 1980/1981, Bank missions
could not go to the country to supervise the works and a local consultant
was hired for this. All of the agencies were very cooperative in providing
additional information, when needed, and the annual audited financial
reports were received on time witheut negative observations.
Project Costs and Financing
24.        Table 8 details appraisal versus actual project costs.  As it
indicates, for about 64% of the originally planned project works, 91% of
the allocated resources were used.   Actual cost overrun is difficult to
estimate because of the restructuring of the project and changes in solu-
tion types provided. In general, the implementation delays (81 months) and
accompanying inflation have been among the principal reasons for cost
increases.  Table 9 shows inflation figures for the 1970-1985 period.  In
some cases, e.g., for the "22 de Abril" project, there have also been
increases due to design changes in the  project.  Also, for some areas,
e.g., Chintuc, land scarcity led to acquisition of poorer quality sites,
and this has resulted in greater preparation costs.  Costs could have been
much higher under the circumstances, had it not been for FUNDASAL's low
administrative costs, coupled with the self-help construction program
(which is estimated to be about 10% of total project cost).
INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS
25.           Table 10 contains details of the financial operations of
FUNDASAL, FEDECREDITO and IVU.  In spite of the difficulties they faced,
all of these agencies have fared rather well and have weathered what
appears to have been the worst of the crisis.  In FUNDASAL's case, a do-
minant item in its income statement still continues to be donations. How-
ever, there has been a significant growth in its investment income as its
construction programs ended and beneficiaries have begun to pay their
mortgages.   Still, in spite of a favorable earnings statement, there is
concern about the agency's ability to service debts incurred, both for the
Bank-assisted projects, as well as for its other investments. As of 1985,
it had long-term debts of over 58 million colones (approx. US$23 million).
Admittedly, the majority of these debts was to other Government agencies,
and they were backed by inventory of real assets.   However,   given the
precarious socio-economic situation under which it is difficult to develop



-8-
and sell urbanized plots, there is a need for FUNDASAL to review its debt
structure and work to begin repaying its debts (or explicitly asking the
Government to reduce the outstanding amounts through some form of equity
participation or grant).
26.         FUNDASAL has a very good policy of including all development
costs in calculating the final cost of its units.  Table 11 presents a
summary of such calculations for the project works.  As can be seen, it
includes land and urbanization costs as well as costs of construction,
finance and administration charges, insurance, collection fees, bad-debt
allowance, and a fee for maintenance works.  The agency has had an out-
standing repayment record with bad debts averaging below 3% of its port-
folio in general. (In 1984, this figure was almost 5% because of some
administrative problems in collection.) Part of this excellent record is
due to the pre-screening and orientation work of the agency in which it
works closely with the beneficiaries to make sure that they have the needed
resources and can afford the solutions they select. The community spirit
developed through self-help work is also very important, and so also is
the frequent on site collection process of FUNDASAL.  It should also be
noted that for certain very needy cases, FUNDASAL has earmarked donations
which are used when a family cannot temporarily meet its mortgage payments.
27.         IVU is in a more privileged position than FUNDASAL in that it
receives regular Government grants and subsidies in its operations and it
owns several valuable tracts of land.  IVU's costing and record-keeping
system is unfortunately not as detailed and up-to-date as those of
PUNDASAL. It is now in the process of updating its management information
system  and this should assist greatly in budgeting and planning.  It is
estimated that IVU's bad debt account is about 2-3% of its total port-
folio. This figure is for total arrears, and so arrears of 90 days or more
would be much smaller.  Given that there is a large subsidy element in
IVU's operations, beneficiaries generally are willing to pay and so avoid
losing their homes.
28.        For the upgrading component, IVU followed the Bank's guidelines
on computing all project costs and having the beneficiaries repay these.
Unfortunately, since IVU's current system does not present these benefici-
aries separately, their repayment record is not easily verifiable.  When
the new system is in place, IVU will prepare a separate list for these 500
beneficiaries.
29.        The FEDECREDITO artisan component has accomplished a great deal
in spite of severe adverse conditions. As Table 7 shows, over 26,000 loans
were made for about 25 million colones during the 1978-1984 period. Table
7, page 1, shows the expected and actual terms and conditions of these
loans. During appraisal, the component was designed to have beneficiaries
paying competitive rates of interest (including the cost of technical
assistance and administration). Commercial bank rates during that period
averaged 13-15% but these loans were not accessible to low-income groups.
As the table shows, actual subloan conditions for this component were equal
to those of commercial banks with the majority of the funds (96%), being
used for working capital. Many of the loans were grantad on a repeat basis



-9-
(maximum of three times), but this does not detract from the beneficial im-
pact of this component. With more than 78% of the borrowers being females,
this component has had  remarkable success in reaching a segment of the
population which is often overlooked but which is very important in the
economy. Loans have typically averaged 100 colones (US$40) per individual;
however, since most loans are made on a collective basis to groups of 3 to
10 members, each member generally received between 300 and 1000 colones for
which the group is collectively responsible. Most of the loans have been
used for working capital (e.g. for buying corn for making tortillas), and
the repayment period is usually 2-3 months.   The level of arrears for
FEDECREDITO's artisan program has averaged 4% of tVie portfolio in general,
although for specific areas of conflict, the arreats have been estimated at
about 40-50% during some periods. Still, the overall figure is much better
than those for several other windows which the agency has (e.g. total
arrears for agriculture loans is 48%).
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
30.       General.  Under any measuring standard, this project has undoubt-
edly achieved remarkable success; when evaluated in context of the unstable
environment under which the works were implemented, this is even more
impressive.   Over 50,000 persons received  direct benefits  from these
works.   For the FUNDASAL component alone,  there were close to 47,000
persons benefitting from the 9,640 units built. The IVU upgrading compo-
nent for just over 500 units directly benefitted an estimated 3,000 people,
while FEDECREDITO's artisan program directly assisted about 6,000 in a
lesser but significant manner.
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR)
31.        In both the first and second projects, it was expected that for
the 15,000 units to be constructed, there would be about four different
types of housing solutions in the more than 19 project sites.  With the
combination of the two projects, just over 9,600 units were provided in 11
sites and there were basically three types of solutions along with the
urbanized lots.
32.          Since there are several variations in unit types among the
different areas and even within units in the same areas (e.g., in plot size
and design), it was decided that representative sizes would be presented to
facilitate the economic analysis.   A summary of the salient features of
these units for the economic analysis is presented below.

33.        The economic analysis which was done during appraisal of the two
projects followed essentially the same umthodology. On the cost side they
included land, on-site infrastructure, superstructure, administrative and
maintenance, vhile benefit included imputed rental values for the various
unit types along with a residual land value at the end of the project after
30 years. Self-help labor in the appraisal analysis of the first project
was shadow priced at zero opportunity cost; however, for the second pro-
ject, a representative varket value was Imputed.
34.          The PCR analysis generally follows the same pattern as the
appraisal. However, there is a market value imputed for all self-help
labor and no residual land or house value was taken into account. Because
of the consolidation of project works, only a single analysis was done for
both projects. As indicated above, the appraisal estimate and the recal-
culated figure are rather similar.   The many changes in project scope,
soiution types, site location, etc., all prevent detailed comparisons and
analyses between projected and recalculated figures. Still,, at the global
level, there are indications that the combined effects of inflation,
implementation delays and the refugee inflows had impact upon both the
cost and benefit streams and resulted in IERR figures which did not change
much from original estimates. The imputed rental figures used by the PCR
mission are higher than those assumed during appraisal (70-180 vs. 25-145
colones) but according to data compiled by FUNDASAL, the PCR figures under-
state actual ones by about 30-50X. The combined effect of using FUNDASAL's
higher figures and a residual house and land value will result in an lERR
which is greater than appraisal estimates. Table 12 contains details of
the cost and benefit streams used in computing the TIERR.

35.    Employment Effects.   Approximately 4,000 person/year of employment
have directly resulted rom the civil works component of these projects
with an additional 3,000 indirect person/year arising from secondary ex-
penditures.  These figures include both paid and self-help work.   Apart
from the imputed or actual income gained, there have been rather signifi-
cant and widespread gains in construction skills which have been used both
for individual expansion of homes, as well as a source of employment
income.   FEDECREDITO's SSE component has been estimated to create about
1,500 new jobs and it has provided access of beneficiaries to credit at
conditions which are superior to those of private money lenders.
36.        Poverty Impact.  Chart 1 provides details regarding the income
levels reached through this project for the FUNDASAL program. Before con-
tinuing, it is advisable to note here that these calculations were based
upon 1976-1977 household income data which were updated by the Planning
Ministry. Current data is not available, and under current conditions in
the country, such data would surely reflect worsening disparities in over-
all,  as well as stratified  income  levels.    As  the  chart  indicates,
FUNDASAL's early projects were generally affordable to up to about 90% of
the population. However, the more recent projects (including many of the
later Bank-assisted ones), have been affordable to only about 65% of the
population. Although the levels reached are within originally envisaged
general targets, they could have been substantially lower if land costs
(including urbanization costs) were lower and if there were not so many
delays in the project implementation schedule.  Still, in comparison with
other similar projects both within and outside the country, the overall
results are very favorable.   Comparing costs with IVU and the Fondo  So-
cial, for example, indicates that FUkDASAL's basic units averaged US$2,900
while similar units for IVU and the Fondo Social were US$7,200 and
US$10,200 respectively in 1983 prices. Table 6, page 6 contains additional
details of relative costs.
37.        IVU's upgrading works have been affordable to all of the house-
holds in the area. These residents are estimated to be within the 20th and
30th percentile of the population in terms of household income  levels.
Beneficiaries of the FEDECREDITO component have been estimated to be within
the 15th and 25th percentile of household income levels. As already in-
dicated, the majority of these beneficiaries are women and most of them are
household heads with an average of 3-5 children to support.
OVERALL EVALUATION
38.          FUNDASAL.   The project has amply demonstrated that properly
managed private organizations could play a very important role in providing
shelter.  With a group of committed and capable technical staff,  large-
scale sustainable achievements can be realized. Even during very difficult
periods, FUNDASAL managed to continue working. When contractors were un-
available, it assumed the role of coordinator and nired workers. Similar-
ly, when complementary facilities (e.g., electricity and water) were not
delivered on time, it lobbied extensively to have these provided by the
appropriate authorities,  and when these efforts were unsuccessful,   it
provided its own services through donations and assistance from other



- 12 -
agencies.   Also noteworthy, is the way in which the agency managed to
acquire land for the project in spite of many difficulties.  Admittedly,
for some sites (e.g. Chintuc and Popotlan), it should have made a more in-
depth analysis of the affordability aspects before purchasing them. It has
shown resourcefulness and creativity in various situations and its general
performance has been excellent.
39.       When the first project began, FUNDASAL was in its early expansion
phase. From a staff of about fifteen and annual output averaging about 100
units, it grew to a peak of 195 employees and annual production of over
1,000 units. Under any measure, its growth and achievements would be con-
sidered outstanding. The difficulties encountered during the project im-
plementation only add to its credit and ability. While its physical and
social achievements have been generally great, there are several areas
which need to be reviewed and carefully assessed.   Among these are its
financial base.  As its financial records indicate, the institution con-
tinues to be very dependent upon donations for its operations. Furthermore,
the Government also provides regular grants earmarked for its administra-
tive costs, and there are de facto interest-free Government loans which
arose because of FUNDASAL's poor liquidity position and its inability to
make timely payments.   Its current stock of houses under construction
should result in a significant increase in operational income.  However,
with only about 4,000 new units currently planned or under construction,
such income would not be sustainable over the long run.
40.   FUNDASAL's rapid growth has also caused concern among its directors
and supporters who have voiced fears about its direction and its high
dependency upon Government support.   Such concerns were heightened  by
recent events when its stock of housing under construction could not be
finished or sold because of scarcity of working capital and the ongoing
conflict.   Also,  there were some labor-management difficulties and the
trend toward relatively higher-cost solutions has bothered some donors and
upper-level staff. To some extent, the managing board of FUNDASAL allowed
the agency to drift without clear direction for a while after several key
personnel were forced to leave the country. The combined effects of all of
these factors ultimately led to a serious review of the organization and
its future role.
41.    Questions such as these have far-reaching implications affecting
original Bank aims. Essentially, among other goals, the Bank was trying to
aid in development of affordable low-cost solutions and it was also show-
ing that private agencies such as FUNDASAL could perform well in helping to
meet national shelter needs.   The expectation was that the institution
would expand its scope of operations and it would increase its earned
income as it grew.  In terms of demonstration effects, there is no doubt
that project achievements have been more than met.   However, FUNDASAL'Iu
supporters appear to feel rather uncomfortable with its rapid expansion an,
its apparent over-dependency upon Government assistance.   They have thus
begun to chart a new course for the agency; one in which the goal of
meeting shelter needs of the poorer segment of the population is still
paramount, but the scale is more controlled.



- 13 -
42,        While  some of the concerns of these groups are legitimate, they
should bear in mind that so long as the agency depends upon charitable
donations for a substantial part of its operations, its performance will be
subject to greater fluctuations than if it had its own generated pool of
resources with which to operate.  Pressures for it to reduce the scope of
its operations and focus more upon the poorest segment of the population,
would also result in lesser operational reflows and this could again have
negative effects.
43.       Perhaps, the agency should develop a dual approach to addressing
beneficiary needs.  For those low-income households which can afford it,
FUNDASAL should consider a program of maximum cost recovery consistent with
affordability and other criteria which it has established.  At the same
time, for those who do have need for subsidies, it could use its donations
(along with any profits from the other program) to provide such assistance,
to the extent that these profits and donations are available. In line with
the above plan, the agency could also work on a contract basis with the
Government to provide shelter to low-income beneficiaries under appropriate
arrangements. The alternative of drastically curtailing its activities and
focussing mainly upon the very poor through subsidized operations with
donations does not appear to be sustainable from a purely financial view-
point, nor is it a practical solution, given the nature and extent of the
problem in El Salvador.
44.         The Bank.  In general, the Bank has been very supportive and
helpful in this project. As the results indicate, the idea of the Bank to
use a nongovernment organization (NGO) as the lead institution was a very
sound one. This is especially so in light of current discussions of the
role of private firms and NGOs in shelter financing and provision of solu-
tions.  These being early operations of the urban department, there was
need to be flexible and to adapt to changing conditions. In the case of El
Salvador, the need for adaptation became more pressing when the armed con-
flict escalated into the project areas and the flow of refugees became
greater. At the height of the conflict, when it was not safe for supervi-
sion missions to visit the country, a local engineer was hired to do the
work and include photographs in his report. Also, missions visited neigh-
boring countries and net with project officials to discuss their problems.
When funds for the first project were exhausted, the Bank agreed to combine
the two projects and have the first project completed with funds of the
second one. It also decided to assist the cash flow position of FUNDASAL
by establishing one of the earliest cases of special project accounts in a
lacal bank whereby the agency could have quick access to loan funds for
project implementation. As the socio-economic situation became worse, the
Bank made appropriate adjustments aimed at keeping the project alive. Such
actions included increasing the special account limits, facilitating more
direct payments to overseas suppliers, and regular contacts with the
planning ministry to assure project funding as well as funding for the
community and other necessary complementary facilities. When the situation
became critical, the Bank realized that the Government was facing other
priority needs and so counterpart resources were becoming scarcer.  Con-
tacts were then made with other donor agencies such as AID and they did



- 14 -
provide some of the necessary assistance, e.g., in financing for road
works. After it became obvious that all of the originally envisaged works
could not be financed under the combined loans, the Bank moved quickly to
assist In consolidation of those works which were partially done and to
finance measures to prevent their destruction from the elements until such
time as funding would become available. In the case of Popotlan II such
financing came shortly afterwards from KFW which is working with FUNDASAL
to complete about 500 units.
45.       It could be argued that the Bank should have focussed more close-
ly upon FUNDASAL's institutional sr.d financial structure in light of the
future role which was expected of this institution.   Given the situation
which the country was in during the latter period of project implementa-
tion, of necessity, the focus had to be upon the survival of the agency.
To some extent, it was felt that once FUNDASAL was able to get its houses
built and sold, the process would continue with its earnings reflows, and
in this way the institution would be weaned from its high dependency upon
donations.   Indications are that during its initial phase, FUNDASAL did
have plans to assume a more prominent role in the sector. Howeverg after
the conflict intensified and it was buffetted by a series of problems,
almost all of which were not of its making, its management and supporters
decided to assume a lower profile until they could define its role more
clearly.  Once the problems began, the Bank could do no more than try to
help the institution along.
46.         Regarding the relatively high cost of the houses constructed
later, the Bank should have taken a closer look at this problem. Also, it
should have focussed more upon the issues of land acquisition and availa-
bility of services; both of these being part of the affordability ques-
tion. As mentioned earlier, given the nature of the land market in the
country and the competition which existed at that time for such land, there
is probably not much that could have been done.   Still, had the Bank
insisted that guidelines on affordability be used for acquisition of all
land, this would have brought the result of high-cost land to light much
earlier and probably would have resulted in rejection of some of these
sites.   The issue of unavailable land should have also indicated that
perhaps the. project should have been scaled down or some special program
should have been explicitly developed to deal with this issue.  In retro-
spect, given the crisis management system which existed during the latter
part of the project, it is questionable whether any alternative plans for
land acquisition or the provision of services would have fared better.
47.         In its relatic,s with IVU and FEDECREDITO, the Bank tried to
effect as many beneficial changes as possible. However, its leverage was
rather weak, given the size of the subcomponents in relation to the assets
of these institutions. Nevertheless, there have been significant improve-
ments in the operation of these institutions as a result of direct Bank
intervention. In IVU, for example, the Bank worked closely with officials
to ensure that project costs were properly assigned and that beneficiaries
were paying the full amount that they should. Also, officials of IVU were
shown examples of affordable solutions with little or no subsidy and they



- 15 -
have begun to use this system in other IVU operations. For FEDECREDITO, a
simnilar situation has arisen whereby the institution has used the example
of the project in its other activities.
48.         In general, the projects have accomplished substantial results
both in physical and demonstrative terms.   The conflict situation which
ex!-ted for most of the project implementation period had negative impact
upon the pace and financial viability of the projects.  However, in spite
of such difficulties, the achievements have beer. remarkable. The conflict,
with its massive dislocations and infrastructure destruction, has made many
existing urban studies useless for planning purposes. The current situa-
tion is still one of crisis management. However, once longer-term planning
gets underway, the project experience of IVU, FUNDASAL and FEDECREDITO can
be usefully incorporated into such plans.
