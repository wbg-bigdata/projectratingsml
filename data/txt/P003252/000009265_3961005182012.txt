MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ZAMBIA
FOR THE PETROLEUM SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
l.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to Zambia for SDR 21.6 million, the equivalent of US$30
million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years (including a grace period of 10
years) to help finance the Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project. A part of the proceeds
(US$2.8 million equivalent) would be used to develop an efficient monitoring unit in the
Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD), US$25.1 million equivalent would be
onlent to Tazama Pipelines Limited (Tazama) for its pipeline rehabilitation, and US$2.1
million equivalent would be onlent to Zambia Oil Company (ZOC) for the modernization of
its Ndola depot. Parallel financing of US$15 million equivalent is expected from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) for the pipeline rehabilitation and construction of a new
storage tank in Ndola. Onlending of IDA funds will be at 8% (1.1 times the prevailing IBRD
rate) for a period of 20 years including 5 years grace period.
Energy Sector Background
2.           Zambia is a landlocked country in southern central Africa with a land mass of
753,000 km2: it shares borders with Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique. Namibia,
Tanzania, Zaire and Zimbabwe. The closing of Zambia's southern border and the imposition
of economic sanctions on Rhodesia in 1965 constrained the supply of petroleum fuels. To
ensure a steady supply of petroleum products, the construction of 1710 km Tazama Pipeline
from Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania to Ndola, Zambia, was completed in 1968. The pipeline was
converted into crude oil service in 1973 when the Indeni Refinery at Ndola was
c&,mmissioned. Pipeline leakage due to external and internal corrosion became serious in the
early 1980s, causing loss of oil and serious pollution in Tanzania. The Govermnent of the
Republic of Zambia (GRZ) initiated sreps for rehabilitating the pipeline as a priority, but this
had to be done in stages because of shortage of funds. The first stage (with Zambia Industrial
and Mining Corporation's (ZIMCO) own financing) and the second stage (with European
Investment Bank (EIB) and Italian Government financing) are complete; the third stage (with
African Development Bank (ADB) financing) is nearing completion.
3.           The Zambia's energy supply consists of domestically produced hydropower
(12.2%), coal (5.2%), fuelwood and charcoal (70.19%), and imported petroleum (12.39%).
Final domestic energy consumption in 1992 totalled about 4.6 million tons of oil equivalent
(toe), of which household nse accounts for 62.8% and mining 14.2%. Per capita annual
commercial energy consumption of about 379 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in 1991 was
the fourth highest among the low-income countries mainly because of use in copper mining.
The major sources of commercial energy supply are petroleum (41.7%), electricity (40.9%)
and domestic coal (17.4%). The Zambian Government policy is aimed at promoting optimum
supply and use of energy, especially indigenous forms, to facilitate the development of the
country and maintain a safe and healthy environment. As part of this policy, the Government
seeks to promote energy efficiency and fuel substitution, speifically a reduction in oil



-2-
consumption, and has undertaken a conservation and management program to seize energy
conservation and substitution opportunities.
4.           The Government's energy policy seeks to establish a viable institutional
structure that will ensure attainment of the policy objectives. This will require reform of-and
better operation, management and coordination of-Government, public enterprises and the
private sector. The central Government is responsible for energy policy and planning. In
1991, the new Government consolidated the responsibility for energy under a single portfolio
in the newly-created Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD). The energy
component of the Ministry's portfolio is handled by the National Energy Council (NEC) and
the Department of Energy (DOE). NEC acts as a policy adviser to the Ministry and is
responsible for integrating the plans of the various sectoral institutions, while DOE
concentrates on technical/administrative advisory services. Both units need significant
reinforcement in technical and analytical capacities: for this they will need to recruit more
qualified candidates and undergo suitable training. The proposed project includes institutional
strengthening of petroleum operations in the Ministry.
Project Objectives
5.           The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) restructuring of the
petroleum industry to become more competitive and cost effective; (b) policy development
through encouraging establishment of a monitoring system on the government side and
through using a satisfactory regulatory framework, competitive imports of petroleum and
eventual deregulation of the market; (c) rehabilitation of the Tazama pipeline as the least cost
and most reliable means of transporting oil to Zambia and strengthening of its institutional
structure; and (d) improvement of infrastructure facilities to reduce the cost of petroleum
product importing and distribution.
Project Description
6.           The principal feature of the proposed project is the redefinition and
enlargement of the private sector to reduce the presence of Government and government
agencies. The new policy structure will enable the private sector to purchasa the refinery
feedstock as soon as it is landed in Dar-es-Salaam, and negotiate performance contracts with
the pipeline and refinery. The private sector companies, as a consortium, will take over
management of the national storage. The main prerequisites to enable the companies to do
this are an overhaul of the price system (included under the project) and its subsequent
deregulation, and an interim financing mechanism. At the completion of the project,
Government will review the role of the refinery. Most elements will be in place for a rapid
conversion of the pipeline for products use (bypassing the refinery), should that decision be
made. No part of the rehabilitation under the present project would become redundant.
7.           The proposed project would have 4 main components:
(a)    Technical Assistance to MEWD (US$3.1 million) to permit it to identify
and formulate policies and strategies to address current and eme;jing energy
issues such as pricing reform and restructuring of sector organizations.



(b)    Rehabilitation of Tazama Pipeline (US$39.0 million) including corrosion
protection, overhaul of pumps, engines and generators, rehabilitation of the tank
farm at Dar-es-Salaam, consultancy services in relation to design and supervision
of the project and adoption of stronger environmental practices to eliminate most
of the present problems from operations.
(c)   Institutional Strengthening of Tazama (US$3.3 million) to improve its
efficiency and environmental awareness in operation, maintenance, and financial
management.
(d)    Modernization of the Oil Products Depot (US$2.6 million) to allow unit train
loading, and the supply of equipment and measuring instruments at Ndola. The
private sector companies would make parallel investments at their Lusaka depots.
8.           The IDA Credit of US$30 million equivalent would finance about 67% of the
foreign exchange and about 63% of the total financing required. EIB is expected to finance the
remaining US$15 million foreign exchange needs. Schedules A, B and C give the cost
breakdown and detailed financing plan, procurement and disbursement, and processing events,
respeciively Schedule D shows the status of Bank group operations. Two maps, showing the
pipeline route and main features, are attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 12607-ZAM is being
distributed separately.
Project Management and Implementation
9.           The supply component would be implemented by ZOC, which will be formed to
take over some of ZIMOIL's activities; capacity strengthening component by MEWD; and
pipeline rehabilitation will be executed by Tazama. Tazama and ZOC would be responsible for
coordinating their actions for the appointment of consultants and contractors, procurement, project
programming and budgeting for their respective portions of the project. A project implementation
team, headed by an experienced pipeline engineer as project manager, will be established within
the engineering department of Tazama. This team will also assist ZOC.
Project Sustainability
10.          The project focus is on restructuring the petroleum industry to put all key
operational responsibilities into the hands of experienced private sector companies. At completion
of the project, the private sector, in the form of a consortium of oil marketing companies
(OMCC), will be responsible for all actions from the time the feedstock is received at Dar-es-
Salaam, including negotiating performance contracts with Tazama. The only company possibly
remaining under public sector control will be Tazama itself (the possibility of privatizing Tlazama
is remote). ZOC's proposed shareholding structure is likely to leave day to day control with the
private sector.
11.          The project addresses the financial viability of Tazama and ZOC. The pricing
system being developed will permit the financial viability of other well-managed institutions in the
sector. In all cases, a mechanism has been worked out to protect against the major risk -
currency fluctuations- and to provide regular review on variations in volume and other issues.



-4-
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations in the Energy Sector
12.          Experience indicates that the main sectoral problems causing implementation
delays ere institutional weakness and lack of coordination among the govermnental agencies
and project implementation agencies. Tazama's technical and financial skills are weak and
need reinforcing by experienced staff at all levels. Technical assistance provided under the
project plus the shift of responsibilities to the private sector will address these deficiencies.
13.          The pricing mechanisms to permit the financial viability of enterprises in the
sector have been closely related to the parastatal reforms included in the Privatization and
Industrial Reform Adjustment Credits (PIRC). The detailed structure envisaged for petroleum
product prices draws heavily on successful experience in other countries.
Rationale for IDA Involvement and Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy
14.          The Bank's previous lending for energy in Zambia has included the
development of hydropower generation, including expansion of the transmission network,
providing technical support for the rehabilitation of the coal industry and evaluating options
for modifying the country's oil refinery. The Bank's current involvement is vital to the
modernization and overhaul of the structure of the sector, which will include redefinition of
the public sector to open opportunities for the private sector, rationalization of the
management structure of the project's impl;menting agencies and the establishment of training
programs. The Bank's efforts to identify Tazama's environmental issues have led to the
development of an action plan. Bank staff have convinced the Government to review
performance and manning levels of Tazama, Indeni and the Ndola terminal.
15.          The goal of the Bank's strategy for Zambia, as articulated in the Country
Assistance Strategy distributed to the Executive Directors on February 18, 1994, in
conjunction with the Economic and Social Adjustment Credit, is to assist the Government to
achieve sustainable economic growth and to reduce poverty. This translates into a three-
pronged strategy of direct assistance aimed at: (a) supporting policy reform and providing
balance of payments support through adjustment operations; (b) improving the enabling
environment for private sector growth through project investments in infrastructure and
human resources; and (c) targeting the poor and vulnerable groups with programs in
agriculture and social services and ensuring that environmental issues are addressed promptly.
These interventions are mutually supportive and mutually reinforcing. The Petroleum
Rehabilitation Project directly supports the reform of policy, improving the enabling
environment for private sector growth, and minimizing environmental problems. It indirectly
supports poverty alleviation objectives through improving the reliability and efficiency of
petroleum supplies.
Actions Agreed Upon
16.   Before Board Presentation, Government (a) submitted to IDA a Letter of Petroleum
Sector Policy; (b) reached agreement with OMCs on measures to restructure the petroleum
sector; and (c) approved the formation of ZOC. As conditions of Credit effectiveness,
Government will (a) execute subsidiary loan agreements with Tazama; (b) execute an
agreement with EIB, including fulfilling EIB's conditions of effectiveness; and (c) implement



consultant for project engineering and supervision. ZIMCO (or ZOC, if it is then the owner of
Ndola terminal) will contract to transfer management and operation of Ndola terminal to OMCC.
Conditions of disbursement for the allocation of funds to ZOC are: (a) establishment of ZOC
and execution of subsidiary loan agreement between ZOC and Government; and (b) confirmation
by Zambia Railways of its acceptance in principle of performance standards relating to travel
time, wagon return time and physical losses. Other agreements include: Govermnent will (a)
ensure that petroleum product prices will be reviewed at least monthly and adjusted as required to
reflect all foreign and local currency costs, including those caused by devaluation and will be set
at a level to permit ZOC to recover losses incurred before June 1993, through the pricing system,
before December 31, 1994; (b) Government will cause OMCC to be established and will have
made adequate arrangements for the financing of all feedstock and refined products for the
purposes of transferring their ownership to OMCC by March 31, 1995; and (c) implement ending
of controls on retail prices before the end of 1996. Tazama and ZOC will agree on the
environmental measures to be implemented in conjunction with the construction program. A mid-
term review will be held in June 1996.
Environmental and Safety Aspects
17.          The project is classified as Category B. An environmental assessment of all the
project-related facilities has been conducted by an independent consultant; the assessment's
recommendations have been taken into account in preparing the scope of the project facilities and
have been incorporated in t;ie legal documents. ZOC would provide suitable drainage facilities to
collect the oil spillage in loading areas. With these facilities and new operational procedures, the
general housekeeping at ZOC's Ndola installation would be satisfactory. A review of the working
of the engines at the Tazama pumping stations is required to correct the air pollution problem.
The specifications for modifying the engines will be prepared accordingly. The operators will be
trained in environmental awareness. The proposed pipeline rehabilitation will prevent oil leaks
resulting from pipeline corrosion.
18.          An emergency plan will be developed to deal with a serious oil spill or a fire.
Basic equipment to stop a serious leakage or a fire will be available along the pipeline and at the
terminals. Operators will be trained In handling emergencies.
Program Objective Categories
19.          The project aims to increase the reliability and reduce the long-term cost of
bringing petroleum products into Zambia, through reliance on a stronger private sector. It
supports the Government privatization strategy and the development of the private sector.
Project's Economic Viability and Benerlts
20.          The proposed project represents the logical core investment requirement in the
petroleum sector. It would correct the now deteriorating pipeline, and together with private
sector investment, would rehabilitate the rail loading and unloading facilities at Ndola and Lusaka.
It would remove the threat to the environment in Zambia and Tanzania caused by the pipeline's
current condition. Investment costs for the pipeline have been compared to the next least cost
alternative of supplying Zambia with petroleum products. Without the Tazama pipeline, the
region's least cost access to the sea would be the Tazara railway system. As the "with pipeline"



- 6 -
solution is less costly than the rail option in each of the first 10 years, the economic benefit is
clear: the return will exceed 100%.
21.          The major benefits from the product distribution component would be a reduction
in transport costs and savings from a shift from road haulage to rail. The EIRR for improving
the distribution systems of petroleum by upgrading facilities at Ndola is 14.9%.
Project Risk
22.          In addition to the stated objectives of this operation, the reform process will be
pursued and maintained through a dialogue on privatization, transparency in procurement and a
suitable regulatory framework in connection with the adjustment credits. The risk of Tazama's
management not performing to industry standards is mitigated by the proposed management
contracts and the incorporation of experienced staff. However, the cost differential between road
and rail may change, especially in view of the weak performance of Zambia Railways (ZR).
There is also a risk that ZR will never accept responsibility for losses of product under its care,
and that the Ndola rail loading component would not proceed as planned. Government and IDA
are addressing this issue through an ongoing IDA-financed railway operation.
Reconmnendation
23.          I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

Implementation of Bank Projects in Zambia
Disbursements in FY94 are performing well and will be close to the original estimate. This is
a marked improvement on previous years. In recent years disbursement was slow as a result
of poor implementation capacity and procurement procedures in the Government. The IDA-
financed PIRC/TA project is improving Government's capacity to manage projects. In
addition, the Government has agreed to hire private sector consultants to monitor and evaluate
projects, thus increasing the Government's capacity to manage projects more efficiently.
Actions taken for specific, slow disbursing projects are:
Railways IV: Project down-scaled and large proportion of undisbursed balance cancelled
because of insufficient Government action to address implementation problems.
Agricultural Research and Extension Restructured to facilitate better implementation.
Coffee IH: Restructured in line with current government policy for better implementation.
