INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE FOR A LIVESTOCK, FRUITS,
VINEYARDS AND AGRO-INDUSTRY CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$25 million to help
finance a livestock, fruits, vineyards and agro-industry credit project.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 3 1/2 years of grace, with
interest at 8.7 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Chile in October/November 1975, and
its findings are contained in Report No. 966-CH, entitled an "Economic
Memorandum on Chile", issued on December 24, 1975. Updating missions visited
Chile in May and November 1976. Annex I contains country data sheets. A
emorandum discussing Chile's current economic situation and prospects is at-
tached hereto as Annex IV. It contains an account of the emergency measures
taken by the Chilean authorities to deal with the severe foreign exchange
constraint that resulted from the collapse of copper prices in 1975 as well
as the longer-term policies intended to lay the basis for future sustained
growth. In light of the progress of these efforts and the consequent improve-
ment in the nation's external accounts, as well as of Chile's excellent human
and physical resource base and of the prospects for export growth, Chile is
considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
3.        Among developing countries, Chile is the Bank's oldest borrower.
The first development loan ever extended by the Bank was made to Chile in
1948 and, in subsequent years, the Bank has made 21 loans totaling US$296.8
million, net of cancellations. The Association has also extended one credit
of US$19 million to the country for a road project. IFC commitments in Chile
come to US$21.2 million with US$15 million of this amount committed to copper
mining and the remainder to industry. The Corporation presently holds
US$9.6 million of its Chilean commitments. Bank Group loans and credits made
to, or guaranteed by, the Republic of Chile constituted about 5.9 percent of
Chile's total indebtedness (including undisbursed amounts) in December 1975
and accounted for about 3.9 percent of the country's 1975 debt service
obligations after rescheduling.
4.        Of total Bank and IDA lending to Chile, 42 percent has been for
power, 17 percent for mining, 15 percent for roads, and 13 percent for
agriculture. The remaining 13 percent has been earmarked for industry,
education and technical assistance.

5.        Historically, the volume of Bank lending to Chile has fluctuated
substantially, varying in accordance with the country's economic performance
and the availability of suitable projects. In FY71-73 the Bank did not lend
to Chile because of the severe deterioration in economic and financial
management described in the memorandum on Chile's economy. In FY74 the Bank
increased the amount of two existing loans to finance up to US$8.3 million
of interest and other charges and also made a US$5.25 million Technical
Assistance Loan. The Bank's most recent Chilean operations were the US$20
million loan for agricultural rehabilitation and the US$33 million loan for
a copper sector project approved by the Executive Directors in May 1975 and
February 1976, respectively.
6.        Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been satis-
factory. In the case of the highway and education loans made in 1970,
however, a high rate of inflation coupled with deteriorating conditions in
the local construction industry and a shortage of counterpart funds combined
to slow down markedly project implementation. The difficulties facing these
projects are gradually being overcome, however, and their execution is
returning to a satisfactory basis.  A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC commitments to Chile as at October 31, 1976, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects are contained in Annex II.
7.        In addition to the proposed agricultural credit loan and the one
for power rehabilitation being presented to the Executive Directors at the
same time, the Government and Bank are also working on the preparation of
a DFC project designed to stimulate export-oriented industries and to
strengthen Chile's development banks network and on a rural development
project aimed at assisting poor farmers. The presentation of these projects
to the Executive Directors will depend on the maintenance of sound economic
policies which give promise of strengthening creditworthiness, stimulating
growth and improving income distribution.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
8.        General characteristics:  Agriculture's contribution to the Chilean
economy is small and has been waning, dropping from 19 percent of GNP in 1960
to less than 10 percent today.  Its importance as a source of employment,
while also declining, is still significant. In 1960 nearly a third
of the population depended on the sector for their livelihood; today the
figure is down to about a fifth.
9.        While the country is relatively well endowed with goo&>soils,
rainfall and irrigation facilities, agricultural growth through 1973 did not
keep pace with that of the rest of the economy. To bridge the gap between
faltering domestic production and local demand for foodstuffs, Chile
increasingly relied on the import of food --particularly wheat, sugar, corn
and oils. The level of these imports rose from US$140 million in 1965 to
US$600 million in 1973. Reasons for the sector's poor performance included



-3-
(i) an inefficient use of available resources; (ii) a lack of continuity
in agricultural policy; (iii) generally depressed farmgate prices; and
(iv) a climate of uncertainty caused by the lengthy agrarian reform process
referred to below.
10.       Land reform:  In 1962 Chile launched a far reaching land reform
program which in time greatly altered land tenure in the country. Prior to
the program's inauguration, about 80 percent of all agricultural land belonged
to some 11,000 farmers, about 7 percent of the nation's total, who owned more
than 80 basic ha 1/ of land. Between 1965 and 1973, approximately 5,800
properties totalling nearly 10 million ha (or about 40 percent of the
country's arable land) were expropriated and farms exceeding 80 basic ha in
size were virtually eliminated. Distribution of the land and titling,
however, lagged behind the pace of expropriations, particularly during the
1971-73 period when little attention was given to assignment of land. By
the end of 1973, only about 1.1 million ha of expropriated land had actually
been assigned to some 10,000 families and the remainder of the expropriated
farms were administered by the Government.
11.       One of the present Government's first objectives in the field of
agriculture was to consolidate Chile's land reform by accelerating the land
titling process. Between October 1973 and December 1974, nearly 4,350 titles
were assigned and, during the course of 1975, an additional 15,000 titles were
distributed. The titling program is continuing. In 1976 an estimated 15,000
titles affecting approximately 218,500 basic ha of land will have been dis-
tributed and the titling program is expected to be completed by the end
of 1977.
12.       Recent trends and future strategy:   In addition to land reform
consolidation, the Government's principal goals for agriculture in 1974
included (i) restoring domestic output --which had fallen off by about 13
percent in the 1971-73 period-- to 1970 levels;   and (ii) improving the
country's balance of payments by increasing the export of agricultural
products while reducing their import. The first objective, returning to
1970 production levels, was achieved with the 1974/75 harvest and during the
1975/76 crop year, agricultural production increased once again, albeit at
a slower pace (one percent). Factors contributing to the recovery included
more favorable farmgate prices, the efficient and timely distribution of
inputs to farmers, the availability of agricultural credit and a decrease
in the level of uncertainty in the countryside owing to the on-going titling
program.
1/ One basic ha is equivalent to one irrigated ha of the best soils
located in the Maipo Valley; it is used as a common index to
express productive potential of the soils of other regions.



-4-
13.       Progress has also been made in substituting agricultural imports
by domestic production. Foodstuff imports dropped from US$600 million in
1973 to US$361 million in 1975 and to an estimated US$300 million in 1976;
the drop in 1976 would have been even larger had it not been for poor
weather and blight which severely curtailed the wheat crop. Moreover,
agricultural exports, which averaged only US$24 million per year between
1965 and 1973, climbed to US$54 million in 1974, to US$86 million in 1975
and are estimated at approximately US$130 million in 1976. Increases in
domestic production combined with decreased local demand and a realistic
exchange rate were mainly responsible for this improved performance.
14.       Even though nearly 80 percent of Chile's population lives in urban
areas, the Government attaches considerable importance to agriculture and
has instituted a number of programs to spur the sector's long-term develop-
ment. These include (i) the rehabilitation and expansion of the country's
irrigation network; (ii) rural development assistance for Chile's subsistence
farmers; (iii) a 1975-80 reforestation program affecting 350,000 ha and
creating 8,000 man-year jobs; (iv) increased production and processing of
fruits, vegetable and vineyards products --mainly for export; and (v) invest-
ments in livestock aimed at increasing production and replacing imports. The
proposed project aims at supporting stepped-up fruits, vineyards and live-
stock production and agro-industries in Chile.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth in the agricultural
sector. The first two were made in 1963 to help finance on-farm investments
for milk and beef production (Loan 366-CH) and to support modernization and
construction of milk processing plants and slaughterhouses (Loan 367-CH);
the former loan was fully disbursed in 1972 and the latter in 1970. The
Bank's most recent agricultural operation was the 1975 Agricultural Rehabil-
itation Loan (Loan 1119-CH, US$20 million) which provided short- and medium-
term credit for on-farm development. This project was highly successful.
It was disbursed in a year and over 75 percent of the credit provided under
the project went to small farmers owning only 12 basic ha of land or less.
16.       The proposed project builds upon the experience gained under the
Agricultural Rehabilitation Loan. It was prepared by FAO/Cooperative Program
missions which visited Chile in November 1974 and in February 1975 and was
appraised in September/October 1975. The appraisal mission's report (lOOlb-CH
dated November 29, 1976) entitled "Appraisal of the Livestock, Fruits, Vine-
yards and Agro-industry Credit Project" is being distributed separately.
Annex III contains a Loan and Project Summary. Negotiations of the loan took
place from November 8 through 12, 1976 and the Chilean delegation was headed
by Mr. Sergio Romero, Undersecretary for Agriculture.
17.       Description:  Under the project, long- and some medium-term credit
would be provided:
(i) to approximately 4,300 small farmers and ranchers who
--either individually or as members of cooperatives--
farm 12 basic ha of land or less. This number includes



-5-
about 2,500 "minifundistas" owning only 5 basic ha or
less. Most of these small farmers and ranchers never
had access to long-term credit before;
(ii) to an estimated 500 medium-sized farmers and ranchers
owning up to 80 basic ha of land; and
(iii) to some 80 agro-industrial enterprises.
The investments to be financed under the loan would be carried out over a
four-year period running from mid-1977 through mid-1981. The long-term
credit would help finance both an improvement in the quality, and an increase
in the production of, fruits, vineyards, beef, sheep and dairy products as
well as the installation, expansion or modernization of agro-industrial
facilities. An important feature of the project would be its impact on
Chile's balance of payments. Stepped-up livestock production, for example,
would reduce imports of beef and dairy products. The fruits, vineyards and
agro-industry components, on the other hand, would stimulate exports of
these products for which Chile enjoys a comparative advantage because of
its soils, Mediterranean climate and ability to grow these crops during the
northern hemisphere's winter months.
18.       Investments in livestock improvement are expected to account for
about US$11 million (or 17.6 percent) of the project's costs.   All of this
would be earmarked for on-farm development. Financing would cover the cost
of fencing, pasture and breeding stock improvement and the acquisition of
machinery, equipment and livestock handling facilities. An estimated 1,700
small ranchers, most of whom are agrarian reform beneficiaries, are expected
to participate in the project. While the majority live in the country's
temperate zone, about 500 are dairy and beef ranchers in the central region
around Santiago and about 100 are located in Chile's far south, in the
province of Magallanes.
19.       The fruit component would absorb approximately 25 percent (US$15.5
million) of project funds. Subloans are expected to benefit about 1,700
small- and medium-sized farmers living in the central region and most of
the financing would be for planting new orchards and rehabilitating existing
ones. Project funds would be used, inter alia, to introduce or increase
mechanization on participating farms, for planting materials, trellising
and fencing and for inputs such as fertilizer and for pest and weed control.
While a variety of fruits would be grown at participating farms, the
principal crops are expected to be table grapes, peaches, nectarines, apples
and almonds --most of which would be exported.
20.       Chile's wine industry is the Western Hemisphere's oldest dating back
to the mid-16th century, 200 years before vineyards were introduced into
California. Today, the country's wine is considered to be of superior quality
and offers good export opportunities, particularly in the Western Hemisphere.
Under the project, approximately US$16 million (or about a quarter of project
funds) would be invested in the rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of
1,400 small- and medium-sized vineyards --both rainfed and irrigated-- in the
central region. Nearly half of this amount would be to introduce or increase



mechanization at participating vineyards with the rest being used to finance
planting material, trellising and fencing, transport, fertilization and pest
and weed control.
21.       The modernization and expansion of agro-industries would be the
project's single largest component. Altogether, an estimated 80 enterprises
would participate and about US$20 million (or nearly a third) of project in-
vestments would be directed towards them. The industries expected to benefit
from subloans would be mainly dairy processing, fruit cold storage and pack-
ing plants and wine processing facilities. The average size of loans to
agro-industrial firms would be US$250,000 and most loans would be for a
package of small investments needed to modernize or expand existing plants.
22.       Project implementation:  The Project Commission created to oversee
implementation of the 1975 Agricultural Rehabilitation Project would also
supervise and coordinate this project's execution (Section 3.03 of the draft
Loan Agreement). The Commission is chaired by an official of the Central Bank
and includes representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture, Economy and
Finance as well as from participating lending institutions. The Commission
would meet at least once a month to review the status of project implementa-
tion and to ensure its smooth coordination (Section 3.03 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
23.       The Central Bank would administer the project and coordinate it, at
the working level, with participating banks and lending institutions. The
Government would on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan,as well as its matching
counterpart contribution, to participating lending institutions through the
Central Bank. For this purpose, a special project account would be set up
at the Central Bank and, as a condition of loan effectiveness, the Government
would deposit therein the equivalent of US$7 million to start up lending opera-
tions (Section 3.02 (a) and (b) and 6.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Thereafter, the Government would maintain sufficient funds in the account
to carry out the lending program until at least US$50 million equivalent had
been on-lent to participating farmers, ranchers and agro-industries (Section
3.02(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
24.       The Central Bank would lend project funds to participating financial
institutions under subsidiary loan agreements whose terms and conditions would
be acceptable to the Bank. Payments of interest and principal on the sub-
sidiary loans would revert to the Central Bank's project account. The
balance in this account, after servicing the proposed Bank loan and covering
the Central Bank's direct operating expenses, would be used for further
lending to the agricultural sector (Section 3.02(d) of the draft)Loan Agreement).
25.       Although a number of commercial banks and other lending, institutions
are eligible to on-lend project funds to sub-borrowers, three agencies,are
expected to handle most of the on-lending. These are the Banco del Estado
(BECH), the Small Farmer Development Institute (INDAP) and the National



-7-
Development Corporation (CORFO). BECH is state-owned and Chile's largest
banking institution. It accounts for about 85 percent of agricultural
lending in the country and would be dealing, under this project, with all
types of subloans for on-farm development except those reserved for the
smallest farmers, i.e., those with only five basic ha of land or less.
Credit to these "minifundistas" would be handled by INDAP. CORFO, because
of its specialization and experience, would concentrate on credit to dairy
and beef/sheep ranchers. CORFO, BECH and participating commercial banks
and DFCs would extend credit for the agro-industrial investments envisaged
under the project.
26.       Loan requests submitted to-participating lending institutions in
connection with fruits, vineyards and livestock investments would be sup-
ported by farm development plans' which would include cash flow provisions.
Whenever needed, the lending agencies would assist prospective borrowers in
drawing up these plans. In the case of loan requests for agro-industries,
applications would be accompanied by feasibility studies. Subloans exceeding
the equivalent of US$100,000 for on-farm development would require prior Bank
approval (Schedule 4, paragraph A.14 of the draft Loan Agreement). It is
expected that there will be no more than a dozen subloan requests of this
size and that these would be made by cooperative groupings of farmers and
ranchers. Subloans exceeding the equivalent of US$200,000 for agro-industrial
investments would also require prior Bank approval (Schedule 4, paragraph A.14
of the draft Loan Agreement).
27.       Lending terms and conditions:  Depending upon the type of investment
to be financed, the terms of subloans would vary from five to fifteen years.
Because of the long development periods associated with most of the expected
investments, however, 90 percent of the loans are expected to have longer --11
to 15 year-- maturities and will have three to five year grace periods. Sub-
loans would normally cover up to 80 percent of investment costs although
small farmers would be eligible for 100 percent financing; medium-sized
ones and agro-industries are expected to sometimes require less than 80 per-
cent financing.
28.       Because of traditionally high inflation rates, it is the usual
practice in Chile for local banking institutions to adjust the outstanding
principal, in the case of medium- and long-term credit, to the Consumer Price
Index (C.P.I.) and then to charge interest on the adjusted principal.
The Central Bank would on-lend project funds for agro-industrial investment
to participating lending institutions at an interest of between 4.5 and 8.5
percent, depending on the demand for credit and the overall interest rate
structure. Participating financial' institutions would then releed these
funds to the ultimate beneficiaries at an interest rate of between 8 and
12 percent (Schedule 4, paragraphs A.4 and B.5 of the draft Loan Agreement).
With regard to loans for on-farm development, the Central Bank would fix
its on-lending rate to financial intermediaries at between 2.5 and 4.5
percent. Relending by the intermediaries to the ultimate beneficiaries



- 8 -
would bear interest of from 6 to 8 percent (Schedule 4, paragraphs A.4 and
B.5 of the draft Loan Agreement). The resultant spread, up to 3.5 percent
in both cases, is the same as for the recently completed agricultural
rehabilitation project's medium-term lending and is sufficient to allow
the lending institutions to cover their costs for technical assistance and
loan supervision.
29.       Costs and financing:  The project's cost, net of taxes and duties,
is estimated at US$62.5 million. Its foreign exchange component is US$25
million, equivalent to 40 percent of net project costs, and would be covered
by the proposed Bank loan. The Government would provide another US$25 mil-
lion in financing and the balance, US$12.5 million or 20 percent of costs,
would be contributed by the project beneficiaries themselves. The proposed
loan would be made to the Republic of Chile which would also bear the
foreign exchange risk.
30.       Procurement:  The proposed project does not lend itself to inter-
national competitive bidding because of the large number of participating
farmers, ranchers and agro-industries and the varied composition of the
items to be procured both for on-farm development and for the agro-industrial
component. Consequently, sub-borrowers would procure most items through
normal commercial channels which include major suppliers of farm equipment
from at least six Bank member countries. In the case of investments in
agro-industries, however, sub-borrowers would be required to obtain at least
three price quotations from machinery and equipment suppliers before deciding
on a purchase. Moreover, the Banco del Estado --expected to be an important
supplier of both fertilizer and farm equipment and machinery to project
participants-- would continue its usual practice of obtaining at least three
price quotations from suppliers from Bank member countries and Switzerland
prior to procuring fertilizer, equipment and machinery.
31.       Disbursements:  The disbursement of the proposed loan,
expected to be spread over a four and one-half year period, would be made
against 50 percent of the amount on-lent by participating lending institu-
tions to project beneficiaries. The Central Bank would certify and document
this on-lending and make the supporting documentation available to Bank
missions supervising the project's execution.
32.       Economic benefits and justification:  The project's principal aims
are (i) to increase the earnings and improve living conditions for 500
medium- and 4,300 small-sized farmers (including about 2,500 "minifundistas")
and their families, i.e. some 28,800 people; (ii) to provide livelihoods
for another 24,600 people by creating new employment possibilities for an
estimated 4,100 rural poor, either at participating farms and ranches or
agro-industries; and (iii) through increased exports of fruits, vineyards
and processed agricultural products and decreased importsof livestock and



-9-
dairy products, to earn, or save, US$46 million in foreign exchange for
Chile annually at full development.
33.       Most of the project's beneficiaries fall into Chile's lowest 30
percent income group. The overwhelming majority of the farmers and ranchers
expected to participate in the project are either land reform beneficiaries
--farming only 12 basic ha of land or less-- or "minifundistas" owning only
5 basic ha of land or less. Together, these two groups are expected to
receive about 1/2 of project funds. To assure a special effort to assist
the poorest and smallest farmers, it has been agreed that a minimum of 20
percent of project funds would be earmarked specifically for the "minifun-
distas" (Section 3.02(c) and Schedule 1, paragraph 4(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
34.       The project's overall economic rate of return is estimated at 27
percent and varies from a low of 22 percent for the fruit cold storage and
vineyards components to 39 percent for wine processing. If, for sensitivity
purposes, the benefits were assumed to decrease by 10 percent and costs to
increase by 20 percent, the project's overall rate of return would still be
a satisfactory 17 percent. Project risks in connection with the proposed
loan are no greater than can normally be expected with operations of this
type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Chile and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of the draft Loan Agreement of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 22, 23, 24, 26, 28 and 33 of this report. Special
conditions of effectiveness are that the Government deposits the equivalent
of at least US$7 million in the project account and that the Central Bank
enters into Subsidiary Loan Agreements to cover the on-lending of project
funds to ultimate beneficiaries with BECH, INDAP and at least one other
participating financial intermediary.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 668 Third Education Project; US$5.45 million Loan of May 7, 1970;
Effective Date: October 21, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Project implementation was hindered at the outset by a combination of
frequent changes in project unit directors and unstable conditions in the
construction industry between 1971 and 1973. Rapid price escalation in-
creased construction costs and competitive bidding for construction works
became impracticable. The Bank agreed to accept a system of cost-plus
fixed-fee contracts as an emergency measure. In March 1974 the new
Government issued a decree which transferred all teacher-training to the
universities. Since no new construction of primary teacher-training col-
leges or modernization of existing ones would be undertaken, the Government
requested that resulting savings in the loan be used to finance cost over-
runs elsewhere in the project. The corresponding amendment was signed in
October 1974. More recently, in view of a lower than expected capacity
in the public and private sectors to absorb the initially planned number
of graduates of the project's 11 agricultural schools, the Government re-
quested a second amendment of the project which entailed reducing the
number of project schools from 11 to 10 and the enrollments of 6 of these
schools from 406 to 160 students each. This request was agreed to by the Executive
Directors on a "no objection" basis in June 1976 and the loan amount was re-
duced--because of decreased project costs-from US$7 million (the original
amount) to US$5.45 million. The project is now proceeding more smoothly and
is expected to be completed by mid-1977, approximately three years behind
schedule.
Loan No. 688 Second Highway Construction Project; US$10.8 million Loan of
June 10, 1970; Effective Date: December 2, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Substantial slippage occurred in starting construction of the project works.
This was due, initially, to delays in the prequalification of contractors
and in the preparation of specifications, and later to numerous changes of
ministerial oTicials and technicians. Competitive bidding became difficult
in an environment of rapidly rising inflation after 1971 and the Bank agreed
to proceed with a portion of the road construction on the basis of negotiated
contracts and works subdivided into small bidding sections. It was also
necessary to reduce the scope of the project and an amendment to the
Loan Agreement was signed in August 1974.  Project works are now proceeding
more smoothly and the project is now expected to be completed by mid-1977,
about three years behind schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 978  Technical Assistance ProJect; US$5.25 million Loan of April
22, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
After a slow start due primarily to ineffective coordination of study prepara-
tion among the various public sector agencies, project implementation has
improved. The loan's proceeds have been fully committed for 13 preinvestment
studies, 11 of which are now underway. Approximately 45 percent of the
loan's funds have been disbursed but, because of the delays experienced in
early project implementation, the loan's Closing Date will likely have to be
extended by a year.
Loan No. 1119 Agricultural Rehabilitation Project; US$20 million Loan of
June 4, 1975; Effective Date: September 23, 1975; Closing
Date: September 30, 1976.
The project was virtually completed on September 30, 1976, a year after being
declared effective. Consultants financed under the loan are completing a
study regarding a proposed reorganization of the Government agencies providing
services to the agricultural sector. Their final report is expected by the
end of 1976.
Loan No. 1200 Copper Sector Project; US$33 million Loan of March 24, 1976;
Effective Date: June 15, 1976; Closing Date: September 30,
1979
The loan was declared effective on June 15, 1976 and CODELCO and ENAMI --
the project's executing agencies-- have begun to call for bids on individual
project components. Both agencies' lack of familiarity with Bank procedures
has resulted in some initial delays in the bidding process and in the selection
of consultants for technical assistance. With close Bank staff support on
procurement matters, however, existing difficulties are being resolved and
both bidding and the hiring of consultants are expected to proceed more
smoothly.

AND AGRO-INDUSTRY CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                    Republic of Chile
Participating Lending        The Central Bank on behalf of the Republic of Chile;
Institutions:              most on-lending would be handled by the Banco del
Estado and INDAP although CORFO, commercial banks
and development finance companies are also likely
to participate.
Amount:                      US$25 million
Terms:                       Amortization in 17 years including a 3 1/2 year
grace period; interest at 8.7 percent.
Relending Terms:             Depending on the type of investment to be financed,
the terms of Central Bank lending to the participating
lending agencies and of their on-lending to the
ultimate beneficiaries would vary from 5 to 15 years
with most loans and subloans expected to have 11 to
15 year maturities and 3 to 5 year grace periods.
Central Bank lending to the participating lending
institutions in the case of agro-industrial invest-
ments would bear an interest of between 4.5 and 8.5
percent on outstanding balances, adjusted annually
on the basis of the Consumer Price Index. Re-lending
by the lending agencies to the ultimate beneficiaries
would bear an indexed interest rate of 8-12 percent.
In the case of loans for on-farm development, Central
Bank on-lending to participating financial interme-
diaries would bear an interest of between 2.5 and
4.5 percent on outstanding balances fully indexed.
Re-lending by the intermediaries to the ultimate
beneficiaries would bear an indexed interest rate of
between 6 and 8 percent.
Project Description:         Long-term credit would be provided:
(i)   to approximately 4,300 small farmers and
ranchers who--either individually or as
members of cooperatives-- farm. 12 basic
ha of land or less. At least twenty per-
cent of project funds would be earmarked
for the use of approximately 2,500 "mini-
fundistas" owning only five basic ha of
land or less;
(ii)   to an estimated 500 medium-sized farmers
and ranchers; and
(iii)   to some 80 agro-industries.
The long-term credit provided under the project would
finance on-farm improvements in the fruits, vineyards,
beef, sheep and dairy products fields as well as the
installation, modernization or expansion of related
agro-industrial facilities.

Procurement:                 Because of the large number of farmers, ranchers
and agro-industries expected to participate in
the project and the varied composition of the
items to be purchased, sub-borrowers would procure
most items through normal commercial channels
which include major suppliers of farm equipment
from at least six Bank member countries. Agro-
industries, however, would be required to obtain
at least three price quotations from machinery
and equipment suppliers before deciding on a
purchase. Moreover, the Banco del Estado --ex-
pected to be an important supplier of inputs and
equipment to participating farmers-- would continue
its usual practice of obtaining at least three
price quotations from Bank member countries and
Switzerland prior to purchasing its inputs and
farm equipment.

Updating Memorandum on the Economy of Chile
The Economy Through 1975
1.        During the early 1970s the Chilean economy was disrupted by major
shifts in the political situation and in government economic philosophies
and policies, exacerbating such traditional weaknesses as heavy dependence
on mining exports, persistent inflation, unemployment, inefficient budget
and tax administration, a low savings propensity on the part of private
households, and high levels of industrial protection to the detriment of
agricultural growth and export diversification. During the 1970-1973
period, a large share of the manufacturing sector, the entire financial
sector, the major copper mines, and approximately one-third of cultiv-
able agricultural land were taken under government control, with ensu-
ing problems of administration, structural adaptation, decline of in-
vestment, and the loss of technical-managerial personnel. The growth of
output, which had slowed perceptibly through the second half of the 1960s,
picked up sharply in 1971 in response to expansionary government policies
but then stagnated in 1972 and fell in 1973 as declining investment, sup-
ply bottlenecks, and general uncertainties exhausted the economy's ability
to respond to the continuing demand stimulus. Consumer prices, propelled
by massive government deficits and monetary expansion, rose some 35 to 40
times between 1969 and the end of 1973, reversing by 1972 the real wage
gains achieved in 1970 and 1971. Selective price controls seriously dis-
torted the structure of prices and resulted in supply shortages throughout
the economy. The decline in agricultural output was particularly sharp,
production in 1973 dropping below the levels of the mid-1960s. Rising food
imports and falling copper production contributed to an accumulated loss of
international reserves amounting to US$640 million between 1970 and 1973.
Chile ceased to make scheduled payments on most of its debt service obliga-
tions from 1971 through 1973.
2.        The Government that took power in September 1973 set
out to reduce the direct role of the public sector in the economy and to
move as quickly as possible to a mixed economic system where prices, with
few exceptions, would be determined by market forces. Among its primary
shortrun objectives were the stabilization and rationalization of prices,
the recovery of output and real income levels, the balancing of the inter-
national accounts, and the establishment of the basis for market-oriented,
"outward-looking" growth. Major policy changes affecting the international
sector were the re-introduction of flexible exchange rates, measures to
promote the expansion of copper and nontraditional exports, reductions in
tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports and stringent limits on new
foreign borrowings. The currency was sharply devalued in late 1973, and
gradual real devaluation continued through 1975. (Balance of payments
performance and projections are shown in Table 1, and exchange rate move-
ments are summarized in Table 2.) Agricultural imports declined sharply
as agricultural output rebounded, and the freeing of prices slowed the growth
of demand. Despite the larger import bill resulting from higher prices,
particularly for petroleum, the external accounts improved markedly in 1974.



ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 8
Increased copper output and higher prices, coupled with the doubling of non-
copper exports, reduced the trade deficit to US$95 million in 1974, as
compared with US$377 million and US$353 million in the two previous years,
respectively. A rescheduling agreement, covering service payments due in
1973 and 1974, was reached with major creditors, and settlement was achieved
of outstanding compensation claims of expropriated foreign investors. An
SDR 79 million Stand-By Agreement was negotiated with the IMF in January
1974, and an additional SDR 118.5 million was acquired under the 1974 Oil
Facility.
3.        Other major policy changes introduced in late 1973 and 1974 were
the freeing of most domestic prices and the divestment of most expropriated
assets. New taxes and increased tax rates were introduced, which--in com-
bination with improved tax administration, higher public sector prices and im-
proved efficiency in the public enterprises--have greatly improved the
financial performance of the fiscal sector. The Central Government achieved
a current account budgetary surplus in 1974 for the first time in four years.
Expenditures continued to grow, however, as the Government, encouraged by
high copper prices in the first half of the year, attempted to maintain real
wages and employment in the face of rising domestic and international prices.
Consequently, the Government budget deficit and resulting expansion of central
bank credit remained major sources of continuing inflation; consumer prices
rose 376 percent in 1974.
4.        The balance of payments deteriorated sharply in 1975 as a conse-
quence of the falling world copper price, which dropped to its lowest level
in real terms in more than a decade. Copper export earnings for the year
totaled US$834 million as compared with US$1,551 million in 1974. Thus the
economy had to adjust to a decline of more than US$700 million in export
earnings, about 34 percent of total 1974 exports, without a cushion of net
foreign exchange reserves. In addition, debt service payments in 1975, even
after rescheduling, exceeded 1974 payments by US$220 million. The reduced
exports and increased debt service combined to increase the debt service
burden sharply from 11.2 percent of exports in 1974 to 28.7 percent in 1975.
At the same time, inflation began to accelerate, consumer prices rising at
an average monthly rate of 18 percent through the first semester. Had
inflation continued at this rate, the annual increase in the cost of living
would have reached 630 percent.
5.        Faced with accelerating inflation, falling production and real.
incomes, and a projected overall balance of payments deficit for 1975 ex-
ceeding US$800 million, the Government introduced drastic new austerity
measures in April 1975. Central Government capital expenditures (excluding
amortization) were reduced 54 percent in real terms as compared with 1974;
current expenditures (excluding interest) were reduced by 19 percent in
real terms. Overall, the Central Government's demand for real resources
(including its transfers to the public enterprises and decentralized
agencies) was cut almost one-third. Furthermore, despite the economy's
deep recession, the real value of current revenues collected outside the



ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 8
copper sector rose, and the overall deficit of the Central Government
(excluding amortization payments) was eliminated. The fiscal accounts are
shown in Table 3.
6.        Thus, despite a 46 percent decline in copper revenues, the loss
of reserves in 1975 was limited to US$275 million, only slightly.above the
US$240 million IMF stand-by target which had been based on a much higher
copper price assumption.j/ Most of the deficit occurred during the first
half of the year. The continued rapid growth of non-copper exports pro-
vided some of the offset, the total for the year reaching us$664 million,
as compared to US$583 million in 1974 and US$254 million in 1973. This
growth came in the face of a stagnating world economy and reflects the
effects both of the exchange rate policy and the contraction of domestic
sales. The adjustment process was eased by net medium- and long-term loan
disbursements and IMF support, together totaling more than $400 million.
The major burden of adjustment, however, had to fall on merchandise imports,
which were reduced by almost 20 percent, falling to their lowest per capita
level in real terms since 1965. Net international reserves fell in 1975
to a negative $551 million.
7.        The powerful deflationary impact of the April 1975 stabilization
plan,forced by the reduced availability of foreign exchange, came on top of
already declining economic activity, and the costs in lost output and unem-
ployment have been very high. Although agricultural output continued to
recover, industrial production for the year was 23 percent below the level
of 1974, construction was down 35 percent, and mining output fell 8 percent.
Real GDP declined by 13 percent. The effect of deteriorating terms of trade
reduced the economy's real income by an additional 6 percent relative to 1974.
It is not possible to be precise regarding the distribution of the social
costs of the 1975 recession, but some broad observations can be made. Inevi-
tably, a major share of the burden has been borne by the unemployed, who
tend to be concentrated among the less skilled, lower-income members of the
labor force. By year end, unemployment had risen above 18 percent of the
labor force in the Santiago metropolitan area. For those who held their
jobs, average real salaries and wages fell 8 percent as compared with 1974.
Supplementary wage adjustments have favored the lowest paid workers. Alto-
gether, the average total wage bill in 1975 fell an estimated 12 percent in
real terms. Non-wage incomes in the aggregate fell by an even greater
percentage. The rural areas have in general fared better than the urban
sector, real incomes to producers of the i4 major crops rising more than
10 percent in 1975. Finally, among professionals, public, sector)salaries
have fallen significantly behind the private sector. The Government
instituted a "minimum employment program", food distribution and other
nutrition programs were expanded, and a wage subsidy program was introduced
for new hirings.
1/ A change of one-cent in the price of copper means roughly a $20 million
change in Chilean export revenues.



ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 8
8.        Taxpayers as a group, excluding the copper enterprises, paid
higher real taxes despite declining incomes. Direct taxes on income held
approximately constant, while taxes on property (including gifts and inher-
itance) rose more than 20 percent in real terms. Among the measures taken
were the broadened coverage of withholding taxes, the generalized applica-
tion of monetary correction to tax liabilities, increased taxation of
undistributed corporate profits, and the substantial upward adjustment of
property valuations. Indirect taxes also increased 4.5 percent in real
terms as a consequence of the elimination of most exemptions from the value-
added tax, increased excise taxes on petroleum, alcohol and tobacco, and the
subjection of public sector agencies to the same import duties as the pri-
vate sector.
9.        Official external development financing to Chile during 1974 and
1975 was provided principally by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
and USAID. The IDB made five loans to Chile during this period: US$75 mil-
lion for hydroelectric power, US$22 million for agricultural rehabilitation,
US$10 million for industrial credit, US$35 million for telecommunications,
and US$25 million for urban infrastructure and services. AID made two loans
in 1975--US$5 million for nutrition and US$15 million for agricultural
cooperatives. AID guarantees were authorized for US$55 million of housing
investments. In addition, a total of more than US$100 million of commodity
assistance was disbursed under U.S. Public Law 480 in 1975.
10.       In March 1975 Chile signed a new SDR 79 million Stand-By-Agree-
ment with the IMF, but only an SDR 20 million first tranche was drawn as
the greater-than-expected shortfall in copper earnings resulted in rates
of credit expansion to the Government and reserve loss in excess of the
agreed second-quarter targets. The Chilean authorities, in response to
the shortfall in copper earnings, introduced the adjustment program
discussed above (paragraph 7). Under the 1975 Oil Facility, the Fund
provided SDR 79.79 million in November and another SDR 45.43 million in
April 1976. In addition, the IMF approved an SDR 79 million compensatory
finance credit in 1976, while Chile repaid SDR 53 million received from
the compensatory finance facility in 1971 and 1972.
The Current Situation
11.       The year 1976 has been one of modest recovery for the Chilean
economy. The balance of payments, in particular, has improved mArkedly,
net international reserves showing a US$362 million gain through the first
nine months of the year. Chile is, at the same time, fully meeting its
debt obligations without rescheduling for the first time in several years.
More than 40 percent of the total public debt outstanding at the end of
1975, and almost half of debt service between 1975 and 1978 is the result
of previous reschedulings and compensation agreements with nationalized
enterprises. Many factors have contributed to the improved balance of
payments. The partial recovery of the world copper market has increased
export earnings by almost US$400 million. In addition, agricultural and



ANNEX IV
Page 5 of 8
industrial exports have continued to show strong growth, running some
21 percent above the 1975 level. As a consequence of these two factors
and an approximately constant import level, the current account deficit in
1976 is now expected to be near US$140 million as compared to a us$628
million deficit in 1975. At the same time, capital inflows have far ex-
ceeded earlier expectations, the largest increases occurring in suppliers'
credits, financial loans to the private sector, and continued repatriation
of Chilean dollar holdings abroad.
12.       Progress is also evident in the effort to reduce inflation
(Table 4). Through the first ten months of 1976, the consumer price
index rose 151 percent, as compared to 281 percent for the same period in
1975. Similarly, the wholesale price index has risen 139 percent through
the first ten months, down from 343 percent over the first ten months of
1975. Inflation for the entire year, as measured by the C.P.I., is ex-
pected to total around 175 percent, as compared to 341 percent during 1975.
The seeming intractability of Chilean inflation, despite the large decline
that has occurred in aggregate demand and output as well as the contraction
of the real money supply, reflects the powerful inflationary expectations
that have built up over the nation's many decades of monetary instability.
These expectations have been sustained, to some extent, by the impact on
costs of the Government's efforts to maintain real income levels and in-
ternational competitiveness through indexing of wages and exchange rates.
With the inflation rate now diminishing, however, the size of wage adjust-
ments and other indexed costs are also declining, and there is reasonable
hope that the inflation rate can be halved again in 1977.
13.       With net international reserves still negative and the copper price
always uncertain, the Chilean authorities have been understandably cautious
in their efforts to restimulate the economy. In June several measures were
taken to stimulate demand, while at the same time reducing cost pressures:
these included an 11 percent revaluation of the peso, a small tax reduction
and increased credit to the private sector, particularly for construction
and nontraditional exports. The only production data so far available for
1976 show an increase of industrial output of 10 percent through September.
Agricultural output, on the other hand, is expected to decline some 3 to 5
percent as a consequence of bad weather and wheat blight. Overall, GDP
will be up about 4 percent in real terms. The rate of unemployment in
Greater Santiago remains high, 15.7 percent in September, but has improved
somewhat from the high point of 19.8 percent measured in March. At the
same time, the wage indexing formula, in the face of a falling inflation
rate, will permit an average real wage gain of around 10 percent in 1976
as compared with 1975.

14.       A syndicated private bank loan for US$125 million was signed in
May 1976 and will be drawn in December to cover debt service payments due
at the end of the year. Commitments from the bilateral and multilateral
development lending agencies have totaled some $120 million thus far in
calendar 1976. In light of the improved balance of payments, a new Stand-
by Agreement with the Fund was not requested.
15.       Since early 1974, the Government has steadily reduced import duties
and restrictions on foreign investment. With some rates previously exceeding
500 percent, a limit of 200 percent was set in March 1974. By mid-1976,
the maximum rate had been lowered to 60 percent with the intention of
reaching 35 percent by 1978. Over the course of 1976, Chile's desire
to greatly liberalize its international trade and treatment of foreign
capital came increasingly into conflict with the existing provisions of
the Andean Pact. Having failed to reach agreement either on changes in
these provisions or on terms for an associate member status, Chile with-
drew from the Andean Pact on October 30, 1976. Very little of Chile's
present exports depend on Pact preferences, and the withdrawal is not
expected to affect Chile's trade significantly.
16.       In summary, 1976 has been a year of modest recovery of domestic
economic activity. The foreign exchange constraint has eased, however,
and the foreign financial community has evidenced renewed confidence in
Chile's determination and ability to meet its debt service obligations.
As a consequence, Chile will enter 1977 with a much improved base for
accelerated economic growth and capacity to withstand unexpected shocks.
Net international reserves are now expected to become positive for the
first time since 1971. Thus, the Government has indicated its intention
to provide additional stimulus through selective tax reductions, increased
public works spending, and expanded low-income housing construction. Credit
in general will be expanded as the inflation continues to abate and the
demand for money increases.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.       Despite Chile's progress in diversifying its exports, sustained
growth in the medium term will continue to depend heavily on the world
demand for copper. The Bank projection for 1977 is US$.8O per lb. on the
London Metal Exchange.  At that average price, less shipping charges and
a discount for quality differential, Chile's copper exports would exceed
US$1.5 billion in 1977, as compared with US$1.2 billion expected in 1976.
With a projected 6 percent real growth of non-copper exports, and capital
flows on approximately the same level as this year, it should be possible
for Chile to increase its real GDP by about 7 percent (5.3 percent per
capita) while fully servicing its debt, reducing its high debt service
burden, and further replenishing reserves.

18.       The Bank projects the copper price to rise substantially, in
nominal terms, reaching $1.20 by 1980 and $1.80 by 1985 (see Table 5).
In constant U.S. dollars of 1974, the prices projected are: 1976-51.7i;
1977-60.5i; 1980-73.1; 1985-78.2i. The projection is; thus, for a faster
growth of copper prices than that of world inflation. It reflects the
fact that even though during the current recession some surplus capacity
has developed in the world copper industry, in the longer term copper is
a resource for which demand will be strong and which will require rapidly
rising prices to cover the costs of bringing new mines into production;
recent studies suggest that most producers currently need prices of
$.60-.70 per lb. to break even, and that higher prices will be required to
provide an adequate rate of return on new mining investments. With the
above copper price assumption, GDP growth at 7 percent per annum through
the rest of the decade would be consistent with a decline of the debt
service burden from 35.5 percent of exports in 1976 to 33.5 percent in
1977, falling to 21.2 percent by 1980. Thus, the balance of payments
should not be a major constraining factor on a recovery of growth of
output and employment.
19.       A 7 percent growth rate would make possible a considerable
reduction of unemployment and is achievable with relatively modest invest-
ment given the large amount of idle capacity presently available. Although
the required marginal savings rate, relative to the very depressed levels
of 1975, is high, the projected average savings rate for 1980 is only
slightly above the level achieved in 1974 and still below the savings rates
of the mid-1960s. It should be feasible to realize the marginal savings
growth necessary, along with an annual increase in private consumption of
2 to 3 percent per capita, if a large fraction' of the gains from terms of
trade improvement are captured and directed to investment uses. This can
be done if the public sector invests directly a rising share of profits
from copper sales or acts as a financial intermediary to private sector
investors. In any event, the anticipated availability of foreign exchange
will permit considerable freedom in managing the trade-offs between
domestic economic expansion, reserve accumulation, and debt reduction.
20.       Should the above assumptions about the foreign exchange constraint
not be met--as a result, for example, of a lower world market price for
copper--the Government has demonstrated its determination to abide by its
international financial obligations and to manage the economy in accordance
with the availability of the necessary foreign exchange. Table 5 shows the
value of copper exports if the price falls 15 percent below the Bank's
projection. Such a decline in export revenues, other things being equal,
would require Chile to lower its GDP growth rate through the rest of the
decade to around 4.5 percent or to reduce the accumulation of reserves.

21.       Looking further ahead, the agricultural sector offers excellent
export potential. Forest products, in particular, are expected to become
a major export, second only to copper by the late 1980s. The Government is
currently engaged in a massive forestation program under which 80,000
hectares were planted in 1975 and another 100,000 are to have been planted
by the end of 1976. A total of 350,000 ha will have been forested by 1980.
Since October 1974, when the Committee on Foreign Investments was established,
more than US$325 million of foreign direct investments have been approved,
mostly in non-copper mining and manufacturing, and some US$2-3 billion of
investment in copper, gas, oil and petrochemicals are under active discussion.
22.       In conclusion, Chile is emerging from its most difficult economic
crisis since the Depression of the thirties. The Government has taken the
difficult measures required by the severe export shortfall of 1975 and by
the need to service external debts. Most Chileans have had to share in
the burden of these measures. Meanwhile, many fundamental economic reforms
have been made. The Government has gone a long way toward rationalizing
the structure of prices, including interest rates and the exchange rate,
made substantial improvements in the public sector budgetary process,
implemented a major tax reform, taken significant steps toward the moderniza-
tion of the financial system, and has opened the domestic economy to the
opportunities and competition of the international economy. In light of
these efforts and the consequent improvement in the nation's external
accounts, as well as of Chile's resource base and of the prospects for
export growth, Chile is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.

The balance of payments projection assumes a GDP real growth rate of 7.0 percent through 1980 and a rate of 5.0 percent from 1981 to 1985. The food
import projection assumes an exceptionally high income-elasticity of demand through 1980 and a continued reorientation of domestic production toward
the export sector in response to Chile's relative cost advantages. The oil import projection assumes that demand will grow at the same rate as
output, while domestic production declines 10 percent per year until 1979 and then stabilizes. Other intermediate goods imports are assumed to grow
at roughly twice the rate of industrial growth in 1977 and 1978, as depleted inventories are replenished, and at the same rate as industrial growth
thereafter. The capital account pro5ectiona assume that: (a) the repatriation of Chilean-owned dollwa ceases after 1976; (b) net financial credits to
the private sector taper off sharply as existing loans are amortized; (c) that borrowings from suppliers are reduced in 1977 and 1978, compared with
the high level of 1976; and (d) that no new bilateral aid commitments are obtained after 1976.
