REPORT AND-RECOMMENDATION OFaTHE PRE5IDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON APPROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
FOR A DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$2.5
million on standard IDA terms for a development finance company project.
US$2.2 million of the proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Lesotho
National Development Corporation (LNDC) at an interest rate of 8.5 percent
per annum to help finance the foreign expenditure component of its subloans
and investments. LNDC's repayment schedule would conform substantially to
the aggregate of the amortization schedules for its subloans and the fixed
repayment schedules for its investments. The remaining US$0.3 million of
the proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Basotho Enterprises Devel-
opment Corporation (BEDCO) at an interest rate of 7 percent per annum to help
finance the foreign exchange requirements of its Small-Scale Enterprises
Credit Scheme. BEDCO would repay according to a fixed amortization schedule
over 10 years including 4 years of grace.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic reported entitled "Economic Memorandum
on Lesotho" (No. 1083a-LSO) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
July 8, 1976. A special mission visited the country in September 1976, as
part of a study on regional migration in southern Africa. An updating
economic mission is scheduled to visit Lesotho in November 1977. Country
data are shown in Annex I.
3.        Lesotho is one of the 29 countries designated as "least developed"
by the United Nations. Completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa
(RSA), it is mountainous, with few natural resources.  Less than 15 percent
of its land area is suitable for crop cultivation; population pressure on the
land is considerable. In 1975, the population was estimated at 1.2 million
with a growth rate of 2.2 per cent a year; GNP per capita was estimated
at US$180.
4.        The economy is characterized by the dominance of subsistence agri-
culture and by migration for employment in the mines and agriculture of
South Africa. Subsistence agriculture and livestock rearing provide the main
economic activity of about 85 percent of the population and account for about
48 percent of the domestic product. The production pattern is characterized
by traditional methods of cultivation, low productivity, and extensive soil
erosion; the production of the main crops (maize, sorghum and wheat) is pres-
ently inadequate for domestic needs, and Lesotho has to rely heavily on food
imports from South Africa. Although the most recent agricultural census in-
dicated an increase in crop production of almost 50 percent between 1969/70
and 1973/74, this was due more to the vagaries of the weather than to any

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
long-term upward trend in output.  In fiact, crop production in 1973/74 was
only 13 percent higher than in 1960/61, implying a long-term growth rate of
about 1 percent a year, less than the growth rate of the population. In
recent years, the Government has successfully started implementing a rural
development program (Basic Agricultural Services) which provides farmers with
a package of inputs (including fertilizer, seeds, extension services, credit)
and which offers some prospects for improving agricultural productivity and
for arresting the deterioration of the soil.
5.        While Lesotho's lack of natural resources imposes a severe con-
straint to development, its unique migrant labor situation remains the Gov-
ernment's most formidable problem. About 200,000 Basotho (including half
the country's male labor force) are estimated to be employed as migrant
workers in South Africa, mainly in mining and agriculture; this contrasts
sharply with only about 28,000 gainfully employed in the domestic economy.
With few opportunities for domestic earnings comparable to those in South
African mines, the rising wages in South Africa in recent years have spurred
even greater migration. Since 1970, the number of Basotho migrants to the
mines increased by 28,000 while domestic wage employment is estimated to
have grown by about 6,000.
6.        Lesotho has benefitted from migration through substantial remit-
tances which have become critical to improving the living standards of a
large segment of the population. The value of net earnings of migrants is
almost equivalent to the country's domestic product. However, the absence of
such a large proportion of the country's able-bodied population occurs at the
same time as a domestic shortage of both skilled and semi-skilled manpower and
compounds the problem of long-term development of the economy. Furthermore,
the country is now extremely vulnerable to developments affecting migration in
South Africa and over which the Lesotho Government has no control. This was
brought home sharply in the beginning of 1974 when, because of disorders at
some South African mines, between 10,000 and 15,000 migrant workers suddenly
returned to Lesotho.  Although the emergency situation was quickly resolved
and most of the migrant workers resumed work in South Africa, the likelihood
of similar occurrences (which might be of longer duration) caLused the Govern-
ment serious concern. Also, increasing mechanization in the South African
mines and greater recruitment of South African workers since 1974 (the pro-
portion of South African workers in mining has increased from 24 percent to
45 percent), are expected to lead to a slackening in the future demand for
foreign migrant labor. Because of these uncertainties, the Lesotho Government
has decided to establish, during the current plan period, a Labor-Intensive
Construction Unit within the Ministry of Works (with IDA support under the
Second Highway project). The operations of the Unit (comprising 35 profes-
sional and technical personnel and about 200 unskilled workers) would be
somewhat experimental and are to be closely monitored. The Unit would develop
the Government's organizational capacity to cope with any future emergency
employment situations, while providing the opportunity for training in much
needed supervisory skills. It should also provide a basis for a long-term
strategy to accelerate domestic employment and gradually reduce the critical
reliance on migration to South Arica.

7.        Lesotho, together with South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland, belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union. Merchandise trade, which is carried
on mainly with South Africa, shows an increase in recorded imports from US$32
million in 1970 to US$116 million in 1974 as against a corresponding rise in
the value of recorded exports (mainly wool and mohair) from US$6 million to
US$14 million. So far, the trade deficits have been more than offset by
migrant workers' remittances and transfers to the Government as well as to the
private sector.
8.        The Customs Union is the source of about 60 percent of Government
revenue, which increased from US$16 million in 1969/70 to US$42 million
in 1974/75. Recurrent expenditure in the same period rose from US$16 million
to US$27 million. United Kingdom grants in support of the current budget were
discontinued in 1973/74 when a surplus of US$8 million was realized; in
1974/75 the current surplus was US$15 million but dropped to US$3 million in
1975/76 as recurrent expenditure increased sharply. A recent revision of the
revenue distribution formula of the Customs Union Agreement will further
increase revenues and should enable the Government to finance part of its
capital investment program from recurrent surpluses and reserves.
9.        Given the economic stagnation of the previous decade, results of
the First Five Year Plan have been encouraging. Between 1969/70 and 1974/75,
GDP growth in real terms was about 5 percent a year. This favorable perfor-
mance was due mainly to the recovery in agricultural production from its
low level of 1969/70, and the expansion in the government and tourism sec-
tors. Investment (most of which was in the public sector) increased from 10
percent to about 15 percent of GDP following a marked improvement in the
Government's implementation capacity . Manufacturing, mining, construction
and public utilities together account for less than 5 percent of GDP. How-
ever, the investment of US$30 million in developing a diamond mine at Letseng-
la-Terai in the northeast is expected to boost industrial output and create
about 500 jobs; production is scheduled to begin in 1977.  GNP increased dur-
ing this same period at about 10 percent a year largely as a result of sub-
stantial migrants' remittances. In addition to output growth, there have
been a number of other favorable developments: the educational system is
being reformed to better serve the country's development needs; the chronic
ro        budgetary deficits were eliminated; the financial system as well as the domes-
tic resources mobilization effort have been strengthened; and most impor-
tantly, the Government's implementation capacity has improved significantly.
10.       The Second Five Year Development Plan (1976-81), which calls for
a GDP growth rate of 8 percent a year, extends the basic objectives contained
in the First Plan. Briefly, it aims at (i) raising agricultural output;
(ii) increasing employment opportunities at home; (iii) improving the quality
of education and expanding vocational training and educational opportunities
in rural areas; and (iv) improving communications among regions within the
country. It calls for public investments of US$92 million (compared to US$29
million in the previous Plan) of which one third is allocated to agriculture
and rural development (compared to 23 percent in the previous Plan). The
Government recognizes the difficulties in raising agricultural incomes to a



-4-
level comparable with earnings in South Africa as well as the limited employ-
ment effects of agricultural programs. However, these investments are part of
a long term process towards viability in agriculture, which would have to
absorb most of the migrants if there were a significant reduction in migrant
labor in South Africa.
11.       In the past, the country's low absorptive capacity was itself
a serious constraint to economic growth. However, in recent years, the
Government has increased its capacity to identify investment cipportunities.
The results of a number of pre-investment studies on sector potential (trans-
portation, tourism, power, minerals, telecommunications) have enhanced the
project content of the second Plan. With a substantial program of technical
assistance in education, training, and government administration, we expect
the country's overall implementation capacity to continue improving over
this plan period.
12.       At the end of December 1975, ]Lesotho's external pub:Lic debt (dis-
bursed only) amounted to US$13.2 million on which service payments were
US$0.4 million; this represents less than 2 percent of recurrent revenue (in
Lesotho's circumstances a more meaningful concept than the relationship to
foreign exchange earnings).  Over the next several years, Lesotho is likely
to continue to receive most of its capital assistance as grants or conces-
sionary credits. Servicing of external public debt is expected to be about
2 percent of government recurrent revenues.
13.       Lesotho's lack of natural resources and the constraints imposed by
the migrant labor situation underline the difficult task of development.
Current revenue remains critically dependent on the Customs Union, the future
of which is uncertain. While the recent revision of the revenue sharing for-
mula will improve the revenue situation, this will be largely offset by the
substantial 1975 revision of public service salaries (the first since 1964);
as a result, the recent budgetary surplus is expected to decline over the next
few years. The country's growing absorptive capacity and in particular the
recurrent budgetary commitments of an expanding public investment program call
for a more rapid increase in revenue and greater diversification of revenue
sources. However, given the country's limited resources and narrow tax base,
these objectives can only be realized in the long term. In the meantime,
donor agencies should consider financing in most projects not only all foreign
costs, but also a substantial part of local costs. If Lesotho is to sustain
its development, it will need continuing concessionary financing on grant and
IDA terms.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       To date Lesotho has received IDA credits totalling US$19.2 million for
four projects. The first, in 1966, was a US$4.1 million credit for a highway
project which provided for paving a section of the main north-south road; the



- 5 -
project was successfully completed in 1969. The second was a US$5.6 million
credit made in 1973 for the Thaba Bosiu rural development scheme. The project
is currently meeting its objectives of providing 12,000 rural families with
a minimum package of inputs, credit and extension services. The third, in
1974, was a US$4.0 million credit for an education project. The project has
progressed well in expanding Lesotho's vocational and commercial training
capacity and improving the country's rural educational program. Project
implementation is almost a year ahead of schedule. The fourth was a US$5.5
million credit for a second highway project and the establishment of a labor-
intensive construction unit. The credit was signed in March 1976 and project
implementation has made a good start. At the end of 1975, IDA's share of
Lesotho's total external debt (disbursed and outstanding) was 61 percent (due
to the fact that most external aid in the past has been provided on grant
terms). Servicing of IDA credits accounted for 12 percent of total debt
service. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and notes on
the execution of the three ongoing projects.
15.       Future operations will continue to support the Government's develop-
ment objectives (para. 10). The Bank has appraised a follow-up project to
the Thaba Bosiu rural development project which will help improve output in
the agricultural sector, essentially through an extension of the Basic Agri-
cultural Services Program (para. 4). It will cover a large portion of the
country and encompass most of the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Bank has also appraised a proposed second education project which will
continue the expansion of vocational and rural education and support Lesotho's
efforts to integrate and strengthen the non-formal education programs. It
will also assist in improving the quality of education by supporting the
establishment of curriculum development services and by expanding the diver-
sification of lower secondary education. In addition, because of Lesotho's
mountainous and difficult terrain, development of transport and communication
is an essential part of rural development; we, therefore, propose to continue
assisting Lesotho in further developing its transport and communication net-
works. Identification work is underway on both a third highway project and
a third rural development project which will focus on land use and soil con-
servation.
PART III: INDUSTRY, TOURISM AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
Industry
16.       Lesotho's industrial sector is still in its infancy.  It accounted
for about 1 percent of GDP and employed about 600 persons in 1969/70. In
1974/75 its share of GDP was about 3 percent, providing employment for about
3,000 persons (12 percent of cash employment) and accounting for about 20 per-
cent of total exports. The manufactures include pottery, umbrellas, sheep
skin products, candles, electric lamps, furniture, building materials, hand-
loom rugs, tyre recapping, and diamond cuttings. As a result of its free



- 6 -
access to the lucrative South African market, and its associate status with
the European Economic Community, Lesotho has promising export opportunities.
There are major constraints to industrial development, however, mainly (i) the
small size of the domestic market which remains the mainstay of the sector's
output; (ii) a modest resource base (limited arable land and minerals); and
(iii) scarcity of entrepreneurs and skills.
17.       Although the industrial sector is relatively small, it is poten-
tially a key sector in helping to diversify and reduce the dominance of sub-
sistence agriculture, and to create employment. In this regard, there is
scope for developing new and expanding existing lines of processing and man-
ufacturing, especially in agro-based industries, such as processing hides,
wool, mohair, grains and canning meat. In the current development plan period
the industrial sector's contribution to GDP is projected to increase from 3
percent to about 4.5 percent along with, increases in employment opportunities.
18.       The Government's long-term obijective is to rely on a policy of
free enterprise. To that end, in 1969 the Government passed a "Pioneer
Industries Encouragement Act", which provides generous tax incentives to
private investors in pioneer industries. The incentives include a six year
tax holiday or a depreciation allowance of up to 150 percent of the initial
investment during the first year of operation; a citizens training allowance
equal to 110 percent of the training cost to the manufacturer and a citizen
wage allowance equal to 10 percent of the total wages paid by a firm to
Basotho. The incentives relating to training and employment of Basotho are
especially innovative and noteworthy. Despite these incentives, the process
of developing entrepreneurial skills domestically and of attracting expatriate
investors is necessarily slow. Given these circumstances, the range of
activities the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC) and Basotho
Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO) will perform on behalf of the
Government is substantially broader than would be the case for a conventional
development finance company.
Tourism
19.       Tourism is another important sector in diversifying the economy.
The number of tourists (mostly from Soujth Africa) coming to Lesotho has
grown from about 5,000 per annum in 1969 to about 80,000 in 1974. Lesotho's
beautiful mountain scenery and congenial climate offer further scope for
expanding tourism, and toward that end the Government has established the
Lesotho Tourist Corporation. The Second Five Year Development Plan (1976/81)
proposes increasing investment in the industry.
Financial Environment
20.       Lesotho, a member of the Rand Monetary Area, has no central bank
of its own, and thus largely depends on South Africa's monetary and credit
policies. The operations of commercial banks, however, are subject to reg-
ulation under the "Financial Institutions Act of 1973", which sets minimum



- 7 -
levels of capital and liquid assets and levels of investments which they must
maintain. The act also regulates lending operations, provides for periodic
inspection of accounts and requires comprehensive statistical reporting by
financial institutions.
21.       There are three commercial banks in Lesotho, of which the largest
is the Lesotho Bank which is fully owned by the Government. Since it started
operations in 1972, the bulk of its resources have been loaned to public
agencies, used to acquire fixed property, or deposited with other commercial
banks. The other two are Standard Bank Limited and Barclays Bank. Both
belong to international banking groups with headquarters in the United Kingdom
but were locally incorporated in Lesotho recently. They have not been active
in term lending for industrial development in Lesotho and invest most of their
funds abroad.
22.       Other financial institutions operating in Lesotho include LNDC and
BEDCO, several South African building societies, an Agricultural Development
Fund, the Lesotho Credit Union Scheme for Agriculture, and various small
credit unions. All insurance business is handled by South African insurance
companies. The Government is considering legislation to strengthen credit
unions and to establish a local insurance company for greater resource mobil-
ization.
23.       Interest rates in Lesotho generally follow those in South Africa.
Borrowers pay interest rates ranging from 11 to 14 percent per annum for
short term, 9 to 13.5 percent for medium term and 8.5 to 12 percent for
long-term money, depending on the security provided. The Government pays
a concessionary 6 percent interest rate for its overdrafts. Savings accounts
with commercial banks yield between 3.5 and 5 percent interest per annum and
time deposits yield from 5.5 to 7.5 percent per annum.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Lesotho National Development
Corporation (LNDC) and its subsidiary, Basotho Enterprises Development Corpo-
ration (BEDCO)" (No. 1332a-LSO dated March 17, 1977) is being circulated
to the Executive Directors separately. A credit and project summary is
provided in Annex III. The project was appraised in March 1976. Negotiations
were held in Washington on February 14-18, 1977. The Lesotho delegation
was led by Mr. Mapetla, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance.
25.       The proposed credit would help finance a project which aims at
supporting Lesotho's industrial development by providing financial and
technical assistance to LNDC and BEDCO. The former was established ten years
ago to supply the equity capital and long-term loans needed by large,medium,
and small enterprises, mainly in industry and tourism. As the principal
vehicle of the Government's industrial policy, LNDC is also primarily re-
sponsible for promoting industrial development. In this role, it tries to



- 8 --
attract both local and foreign investors, or, if unable to do so, establish
and manage suitable enterprises on its own. With BEDCO's creation in mid-1975
to promote and assist indigenous small enterprises (an important national
policy objective), LNDC now concentrates on promoting and financing medium and
large-scale enterprises. Thus, the two institutions are intended to function
in a complementary fashion which precludes any costly duplication.
Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC)
26.       LNDC was established under the Lesotho National Development Corpora-
tion Act (1967) as a 100 percent Government owned, limited liability company,
to promote industrial, tourism, mining and trading projects. It makes loans,
guarantees and equity investments as well as direct investments in factory
sites and buildings, which LNDC leases to investors. From its establishment
until 1973, LNDC successfully implemented about 15 well-conce-Lved projects.
After that, however, the Corporation was beset by severe management and admin-
istrative problems from which it only now is recovering. IDA assistance to
LNDC commenced with a mission in 1973, which identified the Corporation's
most serious weaknesses. Since then, II)A and LNDC have worked closely to-
gether to place the institution on a sound managerial and financial footing.
IDA has assisted with identification and recruitment of qualified staff and
the development of a suitable organizational structure and procedures. There
has been noteworthy improvement: LNDC IIow has sound management (see para.
32); has adopted a revised Policy Statement and maintains appropriate finan-
cial and legal records. LNDC continues to seek Bank Group advice.
27.       Policy Statement:  LNDC's Board adopted a policy statement in 1975,
which has now been revised on the advice of IDA. Apart from ithe general
objectives for LNDC to assist creditworithy enterprises which fEurther the
country's development, the significant provisions of the statesment are: (i)
LNDC should not invest more than 10 percent of its net worth in the equity of
any one project; (ii) LNDC's aggregate equity investment shou:Ld not exceed its
net worth; (iii) LNDC's total financial commitment to a single project should
not exceed 20 percent of LNDC's net worth nor 60 percent of the project's
total capital cost, including permanent working capital; (iv) LNDC should not
incur exchange risks with respect to those of its borrowings payable in
foreign exchange; and (v) LNDC should seek over time to revolve its funds by
selling off its equity investments.
28.       Share Capital:  According to the LNDC Act, the Board is authorized
to determine the share capital of the Corporation, but has not yet done so.
Consequently, the Corporation has been operating without a spiecific authorized
share capital. While this would not cause any problems as long as the Govern-
ment fully owns LNDC, it is the Government's long-term objective to attract
non-governmental investors who will contribute equity funds as well as tech-
nical expertise. The amount of share capital, therefore, should be determined
in the near future.  Agreement was reac'hed that appropriate action on this
matter will be taken not later than May 31, 1978 (Section 3.04 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).



- 9 -
29.       Operating Procedures:  LNDC has prepared its Operational Manual
along the lines suggested by IDA. Prior to appraisal LNDC had not set debt
limits. LNDC has agreed to limit its debt/equity ratio to 3:1 (Section 3.06
of the draft Project Agreement); in fact, the debt/equity ratio is expected
to remain low (rising from 0.1:1 in its FY1975/76 to 1.2:1 by its FY1980/81).
30.       Interest Rates and Other Charges:  LNDC will charge an annual
interest rate of 12 percent on its loans, and a 1 percent foreign exchange
risk fee with respect to those borrowings payable in foreign exchange. The
rate will reflect its cost of borrowing and the expected inflation rates in
Lesotho. It will be positive in real terms and will give LNDC an adequate
spread. For rental of its factory buildings, LNDC charges 15 percent per
annum on development costs and for loan guarantees a fee of 1 percent per
annum. These charges are considered adequate.
31.       Board of Directors.  The LNDC Act provides for not less than four
and not more than nine directors. Presently there are seven directors,
with the Prime Minister as Chairman. The other directors are the Ministers
of Finance and of Commerce and Industry, a prominent local businessman,
the Regional Controller for Southern Africa of the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, a Swiss businessman and the Managing Director of LNDC.
32.       Management and Staff:  The Corporation is in the process of build-
ing up a competent team of professional staff. The Managing Director, a
Canadian national, was previously a consultant with Currie, Coopers and
Lybrand of Montreal. The Deputy Managing Director, a Basotho who was pre-
viously the Director of Economic Planning in Lesotho, is one of the country's
leading economists. A British national has just been appointed Financial
Controller. At present, the professional staff comprises nineteen persons,
of whom nine are expatriates. Expatriates hold many of the senior posi-
tions, but progressively they will be replaced as qualified Basotho acquire
the requisite experience. One LNDC staff member was recently attached to
the legal department of the Bank Group for training and another has been
accepted for an Economic Development Institute Development Banking course.
A Director of Operations will be appointed not later than November 30, 1977
(Section 2.01 (b) of the draft Project Agreement). In addition, LNDC plans
to carry out a five year recruitment and training program for Basotho pro-
fessionals.
33.       Operations:  As of June 30, 1976, LNDC has provided assistance
totalling about R 4.7 million for 38 projects, in most cases through combina-
tions of equity investments, loans, building leases and guarantees. The
projects assisted include handicrafts manufacturing, food processing, trad-
ing, hotels, and construction enterprises. Much of LNDC's lending has been
to the tourism sector, which, as of mid-1976, accounted for about 49 percent
of its total approvals. After the initial substantial investment, the level
of future investment in the tourism sector is expected to be much lower. Al-
though LNDC has not yet undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the economic
impact of its investments, it is estimated that about 90 percent of all
industrial output in Lesotho is accounted for by LNDC-assisted enterprises



- 10 -
which now employ about 2,090,persons. The fixed asset cost per job of its
investments has been low, ranging from about US$650 to about US$9,500. Its
largest operation has been a loan of R 800,000 to the Amalgamated Hotel
Ltd., owner of the Holiday Inn complex at Maseru, and the smallest, a loan
of R 3,000, to a weaving company. Most of the loans were in the R 10,000 to
R 50,000 range with an average loan size of about R 30,000. Repayment
periods for these loans have ranged from one year to seven years, reflecting
LNDC's flexibility, particularly in dealing with its subsidiaries and associ-
ated companies whose needs have included short-term working capital funds as
well as term finance for fixed assets. LNDC's largest single equity invest-
ment approved to date is R 100,000 in a hotels holding company which it owns.
Although LNDC has also made some token investments, its average equity in-
vestment has been about R 35,000. In order to eliminate delays in project
implementation and to attract foreign investors, LNDC has built a number of
factory buildings which it now rents to entrepreneurs. LNDC has also dev-
eloped several building sites for lease. As of June 30, 1976, LNDC had
invested R 1.3 million in such buildings and sites out of which R 0.1 million
was for four of its subsidiaries. In addLition, LNDC provides guarantees to
facilitate access of entrepreneurs to other sources of capital; as of June 30,
1976, these guarantees amounted to R 0.7 million of which R 0.2 million was
for five of its subsidiaries.
34.       LNDC's Subsidiaries:  Since there are presently very few Basotho
entrepreneurs with the necesary financial resources or experience to promote
and manage their own medium and large-scale enterprises, LNDC has taken
majority ownership in a number of enterprises. Sixteen of the thirty equity
investments LNDC had approved by mid-1976 were for such majority-owned sub-
sidiaries, for which LNDC bears the management responsibility. In addition to
the heavy burden which the management of these companies places on LNDC's
managerial resources, its majority ownership position exposes it to finan-
cial risks. It is LNDC's policy to reduce these risks by progressively
divesting itself of these subsidiaries. The Corporation will annually review
each of its subsidiaries to determine their suitability for divestiture based
on criteria agreed by IDA. Following the review, LNDC will consult with IDA
on steps it intends to take. IDA will continue to discuss the issue with
LNDC and will clqsely monitor progress.
35.       Financial Performance and Situation:  LNDC's financial picture has
been complicated by the fact that during 1973-1975 substantial non-operational
revenues (from sugar royalties and dividends) were transferred by the Govern-
ment to the Corporation. These revenues, coupled with the fact that in the
past LNDC failed to make any provisions iagainst possible portfolio losses,
enabled LNDC to show net profits in all three years, but masked the Corpora-
tion's actual operating situation. In 1976, however, LNDC received no income
from sugar royalties (nor is any further income from this source expected in
the foreseeable future) and the dividends (from a token investment in the
Maseru Holiday Inn) were half the 1975 figure. As a result, LNDC's profits,
before deducting investment losses and provisions for possible losses on its



- 11 -
investments, dipped from R 387,000 in 1975 to R 38,000 in 1976.  After writing
off R 293,000 in losses on investments and setting aside R 924,000 in pro-
visions, LNDC ended 1976 with a R 1.2 million loss. The substantial write-
offs and provisions were necessary, but belated, steps to reflect the erosion
of LNDC's capital investments in its subsidiaries and associated companies,
most of which had accumulated large losses over the years, mainly as a result
of poor management.
36.       LNDC, taken together with its subsidiaries, presents a similar pic-
ture.  In 1975, the entire group showed a net profit of R 189,000.  In 1976,
with LNDC's reduced non-operational revenues and R 287,000 in subsidiaries'
operating losses, the group suffered a loss of R 249,000, before investment
losses and provisions. With the addition of investment losses (R 115,000) and
provisions against losses (R 566,000), the group's 1976 net loss came to
R 930,000.
37.       LNDC's net worth, as of March 31, 1976, was R 3.3 million, con-
sisting mainly of fixed assets of R 2.8 million (largely factory buildings
and infrastructure). Its net loans and equity investments (R 0.9 million)
were substantially below the total gross portfolio figure due to provisions
against possible losses. Total debt in March 1976 was R 0.5 million, giving
the Corporation a very low debt to equity ratio of 0.15:1. Looking solely
at long-term debt (R 0.3 million), the ratio was only 0.09:1.
38.       The consolidated net worth of LNDC and its subsidiaries (March 31,
1976) was R 3.7 million, again mainly fixed assets. The group's R 1.0 million
in portfolio investments and R 1.6 million in current assets were roughly
equal to its current and long-term liabilities. The latter, however, totalled
only R 0.7 million, and, as in the case of LNDC alone, gave a relatively low
long-term debt to equity ratio of 0.18:1. Although both LNDC and the con-
solidated group were temporarily illiquid at March 31, 1976, the problem
subsequently has been alleviated by the Government's injection of R 1.0
million in additional equity. Overall, LNDC and the group as a whole had
financed their assets largely with equity, thus leaving considerable scope for
increased borrowing.
39.       In summary, then, both LNDC, and LNDC together with its subsidiaries,
(i) have in the recent past performed poorly in terms of profits, but (ii) have
fundamentally sound financial bases, relatively unencumbered by debt (parti-
cularly long-term liabilities), and (iii) can be expected to improve markedly
in their future financial performance, given (a) LNDC's present management
(the most effective since LNDC's establishment), (b) vastly improved financial
administration and (c) LNDC's decision to divest itself as soon as practicable
of unprofitable operations.
40.       Future Operations:  In its fiscal year 1976/77 (ending March 31,
1977), LNDC expected to approve a total of R 3.3 million in loans and invest-
ments. Half of this (R 1.7 million) is for the development of industrial in-
frastructure in Maseru and other parts of the country which is being financed
with funds made available by the European Development Fund. The remaining



- 12 -
approvals in its FY1976/77 were mainly for restructuring and recapitalizing
existing projects. In its FY1977/78, LN9DC expects to shift its emphasis to
promoting and investing in new projects. Approvals are expected to amount to
R 1.8 million in that year, growing gradually to R 2.7 million by its FY1980/
81. This proposed level of operations appears reasonable given LNDC's im-
proved management and administration, the increasing importance of industry
and tourism in Lesotho's economy, and the role of LNDC as the principal
institution for the development and long-term financing of these sectors. LNDC
will continue to provide loans, equity investments, factory buildings and
guarantees.
41.       LNDC's Resource Requirements:  LNDC's expected total commitments
are estimated at R 3.8 million for its FYs1977/78 and 1978/79. Of this, R 2.9
million will be required to cover the import component of LNDC's operations.
It is looking primarily to IDA to finance this requirement. The US$2.2 mil-
lion (R 1.9 million) earmarked for LNDC out of the proposed IDA credit of
US$2.5 million (R 2.2 million) thus would meet 65 percent of LNDC's estimated
foreign currency requirements of its FY1977/78 and FY1978/79. The remainder
would be financed by the Government and possibly the European Investment Bank,
which is closely following the progress of the proposed IDA credit. If the
European Investment Bank credit does not materialize, LNDC will seek assist-
ance from other sources or reduce its level of commitments. LNDC's local
currency requirements of R 0.9 million will be financed mainly with loans
from the Government and funds generated from its operations.
Basotho Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO)
42.       BEDCO was established in May 1975, as a limited liability company
under the Lesotho Companies Act, to promote the establishment: and development
of small scale Basotho-owned enterprises through providing loans, equity
investments, guarantees, facilities, equipment, and technical assistance.  It
began operations in late 1975, and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of LNDC
in 1976.
43.       Share Capital and Resources.  The Corporation has an authorized
share capital of R 4,000 of which only a token R 2 has so far been issued.
As of March 1976, however, BEDCO had received grants from Government totalling
R 80,000 in cash, and equipment valued at R 27,000. In addition, the Canadian
International Development Agency, a major supporter, has provided capital
grants to BEDCO of R 315,000.
44.       Policies and Procedures.  The policy statement adopted by BEDCO's
board in 1975 was revised following discussions with IDA. The revised state-
ment, among other things, limits BEDCO's assistance normally to projects
whose total capital cost, including buildings and working capital, does not
exceed R 50,000; requires that the Corporation not finance more than 75 per-
cent of a project's total capital costs; and stipulates that BEDCO normally
should not take more than 50 percent of the share capital in any enterprise.



- 13 -
BEDCO will charge an interest rate of 12 percent per annum (Section 2.05 (c)
of the draft Project Agreement) and BEDCO's exchange risks on foreign borrow-
ings will be borne by the Government.
45.       Board of Directors and Management.  BEDCO's Articles of Association
stipulate a Board of five to nine directors. To date, seven have been appoint-
ed by the Government. BEDCO's Managing Director is a Canadian national, who
was formerly the manager of Lesotho Cooperative Handicrafts. His deputy is
a Basotho who was formerly with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. BEDCO
has a staff of 11 professionals, of whom six are Basotho. The five expatriates
are expected to be replaced by Basotho by 1981. Meanwhile BEDCO is seeking a
Senior Projects Officer to strengthen the evaluation capability for its
Small-Scale Enterprises (SSE) Credit Scheme. BEDCO will appoint a Senior
Projects Officer not later than November 30, 1977 (Section 2.01 (c) of the
draft Project Agreement). In addition, BEDCO plans to carry out a five-
year recruitment and training plan for discussion.
46.       Financial Operations.  BEDCO has operated for about one year.
As of August 1976, its investment portfolio totaled R 62,220, consisting
of R 55,114 in equity investments and R 7,106 in loans to five enterprises.
Its Sebaboleng industrial and commercial estate was valued at about R 95,000.
BEDCO is promoting four subsidiary companies in brick making, stone crushing,
construction and local distribution, and has established a mobile equipment
pool to service the needs of small manufacturers.
47.       Future Operations.  BEDCO's projected operations for its FYs1979/77-
1980/81 have been planned to complete projects and programs started in its
first year of operations as well as to start new projects and programs. In
its FY1976/77 and FY1977/1978, it plans to invest R 0.8 million to complete
its Sebaboleng industrial estate in Maseru. Beginning in its FY1977/78, it
also plans to invest R 0.9 million in new industrial estates in other parts of
Lesotho. This program of investments in industrial estates is necessary since
it will enable BEDCO to provide much needed factory shells for small Basotho
manufacturers. BEDCO plans to provide R 50,000 in SSE loans in its FY1976/77,
and will increase this to an annual average of R 320,000 by its FY1980/81.
The average loan size is expected to be R 4,000 which means that by its
FY1980/81, BEDCO would be providing about 80 loans per year. This target is
reasonable considering the anticipated demand for such loans. Other important
projected investments during the 5 years include R 0.2 million for expansion
of its equipment rental activities, R 1.4 million for special projects (a
foundry, a machine workshop and a brick plant) to be used as training centers
in the respective technical skills for Basotho, and R 0.3 million for other
training and technical assistance activities. The total projected volume of
operations during FYs1976/77-1980/81 is R 5.5 million.
48.       Resource Requirements for BEDCO:  The foreign component of BEDCO's
expected total operations in its FYs1977/78 and 1978/79 (R 3.3 million), will
amount to R 2.5 million, of which R 0.5 million will be SSE loans. The
US$0.3 million (R 0.25 million) of the proposed IDA credit allocated to BEDCO
will thus finance 50 percent of the foreign currency requirements for SSE



- 14 -
loans during its FYs1977/78 and 1978/79. The remaining 50 percent and other
foreign currency requirements of BEDCO are expected to be financed mainly with
Canadian aid. (The Canadian International Development Agency has indicated
keen interest in further assisting BEDCO.) The local currency requirements of
BEDCO will be financed by the Government.
Proposed Credit
49.       The Government would relend U'3$2.2 million of the proposed credit
to LNDC at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The US$0.3 million
earmarked for BEDCO would be relent by Government to BEDCO at 7 percent
interest per annum. LNDC would handle part of the administration of the
Government subloan to BEDCO. LNDC would repay its portion of the credit
to the Government on a schedule conforming to the aggregate amortization
schedules of LNDC's subloans and the fixed repayment schedules for its
investments financed out of the credit. BEDCO's repayment would be on a
fixed amortization schedule over 10 years, including 4 years of grace. The
foreign exchange risk would borne by the Government without a fee on the
BEDCO portion, and with a fee of 1 percent per annum on the LNDC portion
which would be passed on to the sub-borrowers. The individual free limit
on LNDC projects would be US$100,000 and the aggregate free limit US$700,000.
The first 10 projects to be financed by BEDCO with IDA funds would require
prior IDA approval. The remainder would be submitted to IDA in a summarized
form quarterly as the basis for IDA reimbursement. Procurement would be
through normal commercial channels.
Benefits, Justification and Risks
50.       The proposed IDA assistance would provide medium- and long-term
funds for developing industry, tourism and small-scale enterprises in Lesotho.
Based upon LNDC's past experience, the US$2.2 million to be relent to LNDC
would create about 2,300 new jobs in Lesotho (an average investment of about
$995 per new job created directly). While the employment effect of BEDCO's
portion of the credit is not quantifiable, it, too, should make a significant
contribution to the economy.
51.       The proposed credit also would, through the provision of IDA tech-
nical and financial assistance to the two institutions, aid them in further
improving their capabilities to identify and exploit investment opportunities
in Lesotho. Essential in this process is the development of Basotho entrepre-
neurs; to that end, LNDC and BEDCO, in particular, will expand their training
and other technical assistance in business management to locaLl enterprises.
Continued improvement in LNDC's and BEDCO's policies and operations, parti-
cularly management, resource allocation and financial discipline, also should
reduce their dependence on Government financing and enable them to generate
more of their own investment resources.
52.       There are important risks, however, in the project.  First, there
is a risk related to LNDC's management, The present Managing; Director



- 15 -
is a highly capable expatriate, but there is no certainty that he will
remain in this position throughout project implementation. His deputy,
a Masotho, is also highly capable but needs greater experience; thus any
change in LNDC's top management in the near future could be damaging to the
project. Secondly, there is a financial risk which the poor performance of
LNDC and its subsidiaries during 1973-75 highlights.  This risk, of course,
is directly related to the quality of management in the institutions con-
cerned. It also is connected to LNDC's ability to carry out its intended
shedding of unprofitable operations, and BEDCO's lending to small enterprises,
which normally have a high rate of failure (which BEDCO seeks to minimize with
its training and other assistance). Nevertheless, as pointed out earlier, (i)
the LNDC alone and LNDC with its subsidiaries have a fundamentally sound
financial base, (ii) there has been marked improvement over the past year in
LNDC's management and financial administration, (iii) both the Government,
LNDC and BEDCO are from all indications committed fully to continued improve-
ment in the two institutions' management, policies and operations, and look to
IDA for further assistance in this regard, and (iv) LNDC and BEDCO, through
developing and training incipient Basotho entrepreneurs, are the key to any
locally-based industrial expansion in Lesotho.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between Lesotho and the
International Development Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the International Development Association and LNDC and BEDCO, the recommenda-
tions of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex IV of this
Report. It is a condition of effectiveness that the subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Borrower, LNDC and BEDCO should have been duly authorized and
signed.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 361      Thaba Bosiu Rural Development Project:
US$5.6 million; March 23, 1973; Effectiveness Date:
August 29, 1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1979
The project is making good progress and farmer participation ex-
ceeds appraisal estimates. Crop yields have not yet reached appraisal levels
due to unexpected soil fertility problems. First results from research deal-
ing with this problem indicate that through increased fertilizer application
high yields can be obtained. Introduction of vegetable and fruit as well as
improved animal husbandry programs are likely to raise farm incomes above
appraisal estimates. Soil conservation work started late due to delays
in machinery deliveries but is now gaining momentum. Due to the dollar
devaluation and cost escalation, credit funds are expected to be exhausted a
year and a half ahead of appraisal estimates.
Credit No. 497  -   Education I Project; US$4.0 million; July 25, 1974:
Effectiveness Date: January 23, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1979
The project continues to make fully satis'actory progress; however,
a new Project Director has recently been appointed and some difficulties may
be encountered during the initial familiarization period. The project is
currently about one year ahead of appraisal schedule and in dollar terms is
within the original cost estimate.
Credit No. 619  -   Second Highway Project; US$5.5 million; March 10, 1976
Effectiveness Date: July 28, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project is proceeding satisfactorily.  The civil works con-
tract is progressing in accordance with the implementation schedule agreed
at negotiations but the labor-intensive component is about 4 months behind,
mainly due to delay in selection of consultants.  However, consultants have
been selected and are currently mobilizing; this component is expected to
move ahead now.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
