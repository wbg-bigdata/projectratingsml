PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Third Education
Project in Lesotho, for which Credit 1148-LSO of SDR 8.2 million was
approved on May 21, 1981. The Credit was closed on September 30, 1987, one
year behind schedule. The last disbursement was made on July 6, 1988 when
the unused balance of SDR 21,795.60 was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by UNESCO (Parts I and III) and the
Population and Human Resources Operations Division, Southern Africa
Department, Africa Regional Office (Preface and Evaluation Summary). It is
based on the findings of the UNESCO project completion mission to Lesotho
in October 1988; discussions with persons knowledgeable about the project;
data from project files at Bank Group headquarters in Washington, D.C.; and
other data collected by the UNESCO mission.
The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III of the draft PCR with a
request to prepare Part II. A reply has not been received.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1148-LSO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Third Education Project in Lesotho was formally identified by
the Bank Group in April 1979, although the primary school textbook
component had been sketched o-t in July 1978. The project appeared to have
been prepared by the Governmeat with assistance from the Bank Group.  At
any rate, the Government made a formal application to the Bank Group for
financing in January 1980.  Appraisal took place in September 1980.  The
estimated project cost was Maloti 10.15 million, or US$13.10 equivalent,
including customs duties and taxes.  The project was to be financed by an
IDA Credit of SDR 8.2 million (US$10.0 million equivalent), and Government
funds totalling Maloti 3.02 million. Following negotiations in April 1981,
the project was approved by the Board on May 21, 1981. Credit signing took
place on June 25, 1981, and the Credit became effective on September 23,
1981. The project was scheduled to be completed by March 31, 1986, and the
the Closing Date was set at September 30, 1986.  About midway through the
project the Government received Bank Group approval to use the Credit
savings arising from the greatly increased purchasing power of the US
dollar to expand the primary school classroom construction program.
Consequently, th-: Closing Date was extended to September 30, 1987, to give
more  time to the completion of the project additions.   Thus,  the
disbursement period was informally extended through March 31, 1988, but the
last disbursement was made on July 6, lq88, and an unused balance of SDR
21,795.60 was cancelled.
Objectives and Project Content
2.       The project was designed to assist the Government in improving
quality and efficiency in primary and vocational education.   It would
alleviate overcrowding of classrooms by providing additional physical
facilities and supply furniture and textbooks.   It would improve the
management capability of the Training for Self-Reliance Project (TSRP,
otherwise known as the Project Implementation Unit) and strengthen the
Planning Division and Statistics Unit of the Ministry of Education, Sports
and Culture (MOE). Specifically, the project would comprise the following
parts:
Part A: Primary Schools, which would receive about 150 new
classrooms with furniture to accommodate about 7,500
students (about 50 per classroom).



- iii -
Part B: Textbooks, of which about 1.9 million would be purchased
and distributed to primary schools.
Part C:  Lesotho Opportunities  Industrialization Center (LOIC),
which would be provided with permanent facilities
(including classrooms, workshops and offices) for skill
training courses for about 165 students.
Part D: Thaba-Tseka Vocational Training Center (TVTC), which
would be provided with permanent facilities (classrooms,
workshops, hostel) for 110 student classroom places and
100 boarding places, and 6 staff houses.
Part E:  Technical Assistance,  totalling about 13 man-years,  to
strengthen the TSRP.
Part F:  Evaluation and Pre-Investment Studies to improve the
evaluation and planning capabilities of the MOE's
Planning Division and Statistics Unit, and to prepare for
future projects.
Part G: Project Administration would be assisted with funds for
the operation of the TSRP, including the Book Supply Unit
(BSU), employment of an architectural team, including
support staff and equipment.
Implementation Experience
3.       The TSRP, first established under Legal Notice No. 40 of 1975 .o
administer Education I (Credit 497, dated July 25, 1974) and subsequently
Education II (Credit 743, dated November 30, 1977), was adequately staffed
to implement Education III, including managing the Book Service Unit (BSU).
All the physical facilities originally included were completed one ear
ahead of schedtle. The Credit Agreement was amended in March 1983 to
include in-service teacher training, financing for which was taken from the
allocation for textbooks.   In July 1983, the Government with Bank Group
approval established a revolving fund of Maloti equivalent of SDR 570,000
drawn from the Credit to finance civil works. This revolving fund enabled
the TSRP to expedite payments to local contractors and, according to TSRP
officials,  helped lower tender bids.          External developments had a
beneficial impact on the project. Between 1982/83 and 1985/86 the exchange
value of the Maloti declined by about 47 percent against the US dollar.
This meant that the original Credit amount could buy much more local gooas
and services which comprised the bulk of the classroom construction
program. Thus, about midway through project implementation, the Government
decided, with Bank Group approval, to use the project "savings" to expand
the classroom construction program.   Consequently,  337 classrooms were
built in 87 schools, compared with the appraisal estimate of 150 classrooms
in 53 schools.   Total classroom space built was about 21,800 sq. mcters
compared with the appraisal estimate of 11,330 sq. meters. Offices, store
rooms, staff rooms and kitchen facilities made up another 2,400 sq. meters
(PCR, Annex 2, p. 1 of 3). In the TVTC, total area constructed was about
20 percent more than planned, but in the LOIC the area constructed was



-iv-
three percent less than planned (Annex 2, pp. 2 and 3). A total of about
2.5 million textbooks, teachers' guides and related materials were
distributed, compared with the appraisal estimate of 1.9 million.   The
project architects worked well in designing low-cost school buildings using
local materials and adapted to self-help schemes by adhering to stringent
Bank criteria regarding space standards and economy.   Local contractors,
after a veak start, rapidly built up their capabilities which eventually
resulted in a speedy implementation of the school classroom construction
program.   Despite some tension !n the relationship between individual
consultants and the Government, mostly over conditions of service and the
precise interpretation of certain contractual clauses, the technical
assistance specialists rendered good sarvice and contributed to the overall
success of the project.  Total project cost was estimated at Maloti 12.93
million, about 27 percent higher than the appraisal estim :e of Maloti
10.15 million.   In US dollars, however, the estimated actual cost was
US$8.36 million equivalent, 36 percent lower than the appraisal estimate of
US$13.10 million.   For the higher nominal cost  :- Maloti, the project
provided nearly  90 more classrooms,  125 percen  ,nore than originally
planned.
Restilts
4        Through a combination of effective project management and
fortuitous increase in the purchasing power of the US dollar, the project
exceeded most of its physical targets and was notably successful in
institution-building through the establishment of a revolving fund for
primary school textbook provision.   The increased number of classrooms
built benefitted about 16,800 primary school pupils instead of the
appraisal aim of only 7,500.   The nearly 32 percent increase over the
project target in the number of textbooks and other materials distributed
also meant that more pupils and teachers benefitted from the project.
Although textbook distribution was somewhat uneven, due mainly to
incomplete information regarding school enrollments, the project has
largely succeeded in providing the essential inputs, combined with better
physical facilities, for qualitative improvement in primary education. In
terms of vocational training, both the LOIC and TVTC met their targets of
165 and 110 training places respectively.  Although at project completion
it was too early to evaluate the project impact on vocational training, it
is expected that both the LOIC and the T"7TC should have no problem meeting
their respective output targets.
Sustainabilitv
5.       Given the Government's commitment to education and manpower
development for overall national development, there appears no doubt that
the necessary budgetary resources will be made available to maintain the
project institutions.  However, the LOIC was reported in the Bank Group's
last supervision report in September 1987 to be facing difficulties in
securing operating funds from the Ministry of Commerce which is responsible
for the facility. Regarding primary schools, notwithstanding the Government
aim of strengthening control over education, school maintenance is still
largely the responsibility of the various church groups.   Continued
cooperation between the Government and the church authorities would ensure



v 
the sustairiability of the investments made in the new classrooms. A major
risk is the textbook program, but the maintenance of a graduated textbook
usage fee collected from students and paid into a revolving fund is a
strong insurance for its sustainability.
Findings and Lessons
6.       The immediate objectives of the project pertaining to physical
facilitiei and teaching materials were achieved and exceeded by a wide
margin: in the case of primary school classrooms by 125 percent and in
textbooks by 32 percent.   The expanded vocational training facilities at
the LOIC and TVTC have been responsive to manpower training needs.   The
success of this project may be attributed to adequate appraisal and well
designed components, particularly the classroom construction and textbook
program.   These initial conditions were amply supported by effective
project management, and the fortuitous increase in the value of the US
dollar permitted the provision of physical facilities for the primary
schools and the TVTC to be expanded.  The prior preparation of a back-up
list of schools for assistance in case project funds were available enabled
the construction of additional classrooms to proceed without undue delay,
thereby maximizing the use of funds. The establishme;ut of a revolving fund
for civil works expedited construction and effectively lowered the cost of
this project item.   Thus,  the experience of this project suggests the
following lessons:
(a) An adequately appraised and well designed project is a
prerequisite for successful implementation and achievement of
physical (immediate) objectives which, in turn, will influence the
achievement of qualitative (long-term) objsctives;
(b)  A successful textbook program requires an expert to establish the
appropriate procedures for implementation and to guide it d,ring
the critical initial years;
(c) To lay the foundation for the sustainability of a textbook
program, it is essential to establish, as part of the project
design, an equitaole and viable book-usage fee and a revolving
fu-id for future replenishment of textbooks;
(d) A successful primary school construction program depends largely
on simple, economical architectural designs based on the use of
local materials and technology; and
(e) A revolving fund for civil works construction will facilitate the
efficient use of financial resources by securing lower tender bids
from contractors who know they will be paid promptly for their
work.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FkuM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Proiect IdeDntit
Project Name:   Lesotho Education 3
Credit No.:     1148-LSO
Country:        LESOTHO, Kingdom of
Sector:         Education / Human Resources Development
Sub-sector:     Primary education and vocational training
Credit amount:  SDR8.20 million (equivalent US$10 million)
2.    Sector DeveloQRnDt OblfctivEs
Sector Development
As t .- human capital is the single most important resource of the country,
the Ban's Lending strategy in the education sector aims at developing this
resource by assisting the Government to reach its education and manpower
development targets, with emphasis on primary (basic) education, technical
education/ vocational training (TKET), and building up institutional
capacities.
Linkages with Preceding Projects
Both previous projects in education centered on secondary level and out-
of-school education with collateral activities in curriculum development. The
third project drew the consequences of the second one: that a strong
foundation of basic education was a prerequisite for successful educational
develoment in the country.
Linkages between Project, Sector and Macro-economic Policy Objectives
Lesotho being amongst the LDCs depends economically on the Republic of
South Africa where migrant workers find employment (up to one half of the male
labour force, and one third of the total labour force); their remittances
constitute up to 40 per cent of GDP. In this situation, improving the basic
qualification of migrant workers, while at the same time providing for the
skills necessary to develop the country's other resources (hydro-electric
energy and potential tourism), and implementing development projects
successfully are necessary policy objectives which establish a strong linkage
between the sector and macro-economic and social development.
3.    Prslct l Obiective and Deact!ptton
Project Objectives
Assist the Government in its effort (i) co improve quality and
efficiency of primary education and to make it more equitable, and (ii) to
meet manpower needs. To achieve these objective, the project comprised:



- 2-
(i)   the ccntruction of about 150 primary classrooms, providing 7,500
pupil places;
(ii)  the provision of textbooks in three core subjects of primary
education (Sesotho, English, mathematics);
(iii) the provision of new facilities for two TEVT institutions (with
a total capacity of 235 trainees);
(iv)  technical  assistance  to  improve  the  project  implementation
capability, and to strengthen the planning division and statistic
unit of the Ministry of Education; and
(v)   pre-investment funds for the identification ;nd preparation of
futur projects.
Project Description
Primary school classrooms would be built acccording tce simple, economic
standards conducive to active community participation in construction, and
would replace open-air and grossly sub-standard school facilities. As to
texbooks, a total of 1,900,000 books would be purchased and distributed to all
primary school children and on a (nominal) fee paying basis; the Ministry of
Education would establish a Book Supply Unit (BSU) and would establish a
revolving (replenishable) fund for the continuation of the book supply scheme.
The two TEVT institutions in the count-y would have new or improved
facilities, including equipment. The technical assistance would be used to
strenghten the Training for Self-Reliance Project (TSRP) under the Ministry
of Education, and would include . cextbook specialist; out of a total of 264
staff-months considered to be necessary, 156 would be provided under the
project, the remaining 108 coming from other agencies.
Of the allocation for pre-investment activities, (US$300,000), 58.3 per
cent would be used to strengthen the planning division of the Ministry of
Education, while the remainder would be for detailed project preparation.
4.    Prolect DANsig  And Orgaization
Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework for the primary education part of the project
was unambiguously clear, as in fact primary school construction does not
require a great deal of sophistication, the more difficult aspects of the
project being the book supply scheme and the institution building aspects;
a condition for disbursement was that arrangement satisfactory to IDA be made
in these respects. The objectives were clearly understood by all parties,
and the detailed modalities were to be elaborated in the course of project
4 mplementation.
Innovation
Of course, the Government has built primary school prior to the project,
and curriculum development had to some extent taken place under the second
project. Thus, the innovative features of the project were not in the
hardware, but in the institutional modalities of implementing the project, as
well as in the textbook component which constituted a highly innovative
feature of the project.



-3-
Project Preparation
Project preparation was done in tho frame of the second project; this
preparation work took due account of the "national dialogue" on education, a
manpower study that was undertaken, and the National Development Plan. The
fact that project Ireparation was thus dono as part of an on-going activity
may have contributed to the eventual smooth project implementation over-all.
Appropriatei,ess of Timing
Primary school construction would have been desirable at an earlier time,
of course. But over-all, the institutional capabilities of the country had to
be developed to a point where a complex compontnt as the book supply scheme
could be absorbed adequatoly. In the sense that the absorptive capacity now
seemed to exlst, the project was timed appropriately.
Institutional Roles and Pesponsibilities
As the unit responsible for project implementation would be the same as for
the preceding projects - the independant "Training for Self Reliance
Project"(TFSR) - the institutional responsibility was clear with regard to
national staff, even if this had not at all time been duly appreciated by tha
technical assistar-'e staff appointed under the project. As to IDA, fruitful
relations had been established under previous projects, and would be
maintained for the benefit of the third education project (and subsequent
ones)
Contribution to Project Success/Failure
The project over-all must be considered successful; minor difficulties do
not constitute "failures" in any respect.
It would appear that the following factors contributed in a large measure
to the success of the project:
(i,   its clear and not overly ambitious concept in realization of the
fact that what the country needed most wss not so much a
"different" education,  but more of the existing one:   more
classrooms, more books etc.;
(ii)  the existence of an experienced project implementation unit as
well as a supporting infrastructure established during previous
projects (e.g. existence of architectural firms);
(iii) the positive and harmonious working relations that existed between
the country, and the responsible project division of the Bank.
5.    Proiect Imvlementation
Critical Variances between Project Design and Implementation
Critically important variances concerned (i) the timing of project
implementation, and (ii) the volume of activities to be undertaken. Both
variances are interrelated in that the favourable development (for !,esotho)
of the exchange rate resulted in savings that could be used to increase the
volume of classroom contruction, ani of procurement of books. This in turn
necessitated a change in the project completion dates, so as to incorporate
the implementation of the added activities.



-4-
Avoidability of Variances
The only way for IDA to avoid the above mentioned variances would have
been to insist on a more luxurious type of classroom construction resulting
in higher costs per unit constructed, or to procure books of better paper
quality, binding etc. As this would have been detrimental to the replicability
o)f the project inputs, this was clearly unfeasible. IDA, therefore, agreed to
the modification which must, in fact, be considered unavoidable.
Calibration of Project Risks
Project risks were adequately calibrated. IDA (appraisal mission) did not
for.see risks with regard to the classroom construction programme.
Practically, the only risk mentioned was that the revolving fund for the
procurement of additional textboo.:s might not be replenished in time. So as
to minimize this risk, the setting up of an appropriate administrative
structure was made a condition for disbursement, and the component was so
designed that the budgetary requirements for its up-keep were recuced through
the introduction of a scheme of user fees.
Unforeseen Factors affecting Project Implementation
Apart from macro-economic development which led to the favourable shift in
the exchange rate of the US$ (referred to above), there were no unforeseen
factors influencing project implementation.
Actions/Decisions affezting Projuct Implementation
The single most important decision taken jointly by the Government and IDA
concerned the utilization of unspent loan proceeds for expanding the size of
project activities. But on a more day-to-day basis it must be said that the
sum total of decisions discussed, negotiated and agreed upon during IDA
supervision missions positively affected the outcome of the project.
6.    Prglect Rsgults
Physical Project Results
Out of the total of ten regions in Lesotho, six were affected by the
programme: Maseru, Hafeteng, Mohales Hoek, Quthing, Leribe, and Berea. At the
time of project appraisal, 77 per cent of total primary school enrolment was
in these regions. A total 337 classrooms, 84 offices and store rooms, 6 staff
rooms and 4 kitchen were built [for details, see Annex 1]. If these classrooms
were to be used for 30 students each (number of students per classroom assumed
at appraisal, these would cater for 10,110 students (- 4.3 per cent of
enrolment at appraisal). However, 50 students per classroom is a more likely
figure, as this was the target enrolment per classroom envisaged by the
educational development plans; in this case, facilities would have been
constructed for a total of 16,850 students.
In the TEVT schools, three workshops plus other educational facilities
(classrooms etc.) were constructed and equipped for LOIC, and another three
workshops plus a construction shed at TVTCs; in the latter, boarding
facilities were also constructed.
The procurement and distribution of textbooks may also be mentioned here,
although by its nature the emphasis would rather be on educational quality.

Qualitative Results
The institution building results were on the whole positive, as
demonstrated by the fact that the project was implemented on time -or in fact
so early that it was still possible to adjust project content in such a way
as to make optimal use of unspent funds. The fact, also, that in the interim
a new education project financed by IDA has come on steam testifies to the
success of the implementation of the institution building component. The
development of low-cost design for primary school buildings undertaken by
TSRP, together with the building-up of the capacity of Lesotho's construction
industry augure well for the beneficial long-term effects of the project.
The institution building success of the project is not, however, without
uncertainties. These concern in particular the TSRP staffing with architects.
Secondment of architects from the Ministry of Works provides only interim
relief. The fact remains that architects in Lesotho are in short supply, and
they are not attracted by the pay-scale in the public sector. Until such time
when more architects may become available, some form of technical assistance
might be needed for the next years to come.
Paramount amongst the qualitative accomplishments would be the school book
supply scheme. The effects of every student having a complete set of textbooks
available on the quality of primary education can hardly be overestimated,
even if it eludes quantitive measurement.
Quantitative Results
No measureable quantitative results were expected from the primary school
and institution building components of the project. The output from LOIC
includes carpenters and cabinet makers, plumbers and sheet metal workers,
technical draftsmen, construction workers and foremen. TVTC also provides
training in building and metal work, together with leather work training.
Both institutions have still not reached their full output capacity, so that
the quantitative impact on the labour market cannot as yet be assessed
adequately. The fact that programmes in both institutions are so designed
that leavers could be working on their own account (-"self-employment") augurs
well for the long-term success of LOIC and TVTC.
7.    Sustainabillty
Risks
Risks concerning the sustainability of the project concern in particular
(i) TSRP, as this project implementation unit would eventually have to attract
a sufficient number cf architects - which depends on the TSRP's ability to
offer competitive salaries, and (ii) certain risks with regard to the future
operation of the book supply scheme. The latter may not become entirely self-
sustaining in the near future, and may require further budget support. But
this fact does not put into question the school book supply as such.



-6-
Sustainability
Given the country's devotion to educational development, in particular with
regard to universal primary education, there appears to be little doubt that
the needed budgetary resources will be made available for sustaining the
project schools in the future as it is the case at present.
8.    Bank Performance
Overall Performance
The project design and the appraisal were integrated in a continuum of
country-Bank relations that had evolved during the preceding projects. IDA had
learned from experience with the past projects to the effect that the third
education project concept was realistic, fully in line with t..e country's
priorities, and, therefore, fully zupported by the Goverument. Hence, the
project united from the start the ingredients necessary for an eventual
success.
Project Supervision
The calendar of supervision missions shows a high density of supervisions
in the earlier stages of its implementation. This proved to be successful.
Adherence to tight construction standards and schedules may not have been
possible without such tight supervision. As thus supervision have contributed
substantially to the extension of the project to finance construction of a
larger number of classrooms it was highly beneficial for the borrower in
qualitative and quantitative terms.
Main Lessons
As Bank-borrower cooperation for the implementation of the project was
quite successful overall, one might be inclined to think that no major lessons
are to be learned for IDA. A challenge for IDA, however, would lie in the need
to work equally successfully under its present organizational set-up.
9.    Borrow  Performance
Main Strengths and Weaknesses
The principal strength of the Borrower' s performance is demonstrated by the
successful implementation of the project in spite of a project implementation
unit, the Training for Self-Reliance Project, with but limited manpower
resources. Of course, adequate calibration by IDA of project risks, and as a
consequence, the provision of technical assistance for project implementation
have contributed greatly to this end, as have the supervision missions sent
by IDA.
Main Lessons
It would seem that through the imaplementation of this third project the
country has acquired the capacity to take in the future a more active role in
the definition, preparation and implementation of projects than it has done
in the past - provided that technical assistance be made available in areas
of critical shor .ages of qualified manpower.

10.    roet RelAtion1hiR
The specific pzoject-oriented relationship between IDA and the Borrower
(through its appropriate administrative branches), and IDA has been touched
upon in the preceding paragraphs. Although at times there were strains when
IDA had to insist on stringent and coset-conscious project implementation,
relationships have been fruitful and conducive to successful project
implementation - as well as to the development of a follow-up project.
11.   Cnsulting Servics
Architects
Architects have worked well in designing low-cost school buildings for the
construction of which locally available materials could be used and that were
conducive to community self-help schemes: a prerequisite for achieving the
country's amibitious school construction programme. Also, design work is
generally pleasant and well adapted to the environment.
It is noteworthy that architects have in the main adhered to stringent Bank
criteria with regard to space standards and economy.   The architects'
performance in this respect is substantiated in the figures provided in
Annexes 2 and 3.
Contractors
Although initially the country's construction industry appeared to be
somewhat weak for the implementation of the project, capacity was built up
rather rapidly - which speaks well for the ability of the contractors to
adjust to economic opportunities. The speedy implementation of the
construction programme too goes to the credit of contractors. It must be
added that execution of work overall is satisfactory.
School Book Supply
Even it questions remain with regard to the sustainability of the school
book supply system as an economically self-supporting activity, the wide
coverage achieved through savings cannot exclusively be attributed to the
development of the US$ exchange rate.   Credit must also be given to all
parties involved in tht scheme - Government, tzchnical assistance, and private
partners.
Technical Assistance
At times there were strains in the relationships between the team, or
individual members thereof, and the Government - mostly over conditions of
service, more precisely in the interpretation of certain contractual clauses.
But in spite of these occurrences, the experts of the technical assistance
rendered credible and successful services in the context of implementing the
project.

11.   Prolect Dcum entation
The legal documents pertaining to the project followed the usual pattern.
Their major strength was that they could be subject to amendments which became
necessary as the project evolved. The covenants were realistic in that they
did not concern activities that would come into play only after project
completion (as would e.g. be the case with tracer studies etc). Covenants
have been complied with, in general at the time envisaged.

La    The total is based on the TSRP's annual financial statements on project
expenditures, as displayed in the above table.   The breakdown of annual
expenditures is also necessary to derive the approximate cost in US
dollars.   According to the financial statement by the Office of the
Lesotho Auditor General, dated Febru&cy 9, 1988, the cumulative total
project expenditure as of March 20, 1386, was M 12.938 million.
/b    To derive the US dollar equivalent o. project expenditures  in Maloti,
period averages of market exchange rates in US dollars were used.   The
--, .ial rate used for each year to compute the US dollar equivalent of the
Maloti was the average of the rates for two cale-Kuar years.  Thus, the
rates were:   1982/83 - 0.9118; 1983184 = 0.7972; 1984185 - 0.5759; and
1985/86 - 0.4486.  The change in the exchange rate between 1982183 and
1985186 shows a decline of about 47 percent. IMF, International Financial
Statistics. Vol. XLI, No. 6, June 1988.

Total                  337              10,110
Comment:    According to the Appraisal report, total additional classroom
needs in the six regions covered were 1,897; thus the project
provided 17.8 per cent of the classroom needs. However, as the
surface area per student was high by Lesotho standards (1.2 to
1.3 sq.m/pupil) it must be assumed that in actual fact the
project covered a higher percentage of the postulated needs.
B. Textbooks
Total 2,526,690 primary level textbooks (133 per cent of appraisal
estimates) plus teachers guides and related materials.
C. To!cationa,l raining
LOIC        160 training places
TVTC        110 training places
The total annual output capacity (depending on course configuration)
is about 100 skilled persons.
