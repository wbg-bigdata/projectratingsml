ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.    Introduction
The main objective of the Consultancy Services is to assist the Government of Bangladesh in
preparation of detailed engineering design and detailed environmental studv for the proposed new
road (NHBNR) connecting Nalka-Hatikamrul and Bonpara/Ahmedpur. This report includes all
findings and assessments with respect to the environmental issues related to NHBNR. It also
elaborates an Environmental Management Action Plan for the major interventions of this project in
order to mitigate, minimise or to avoid potential environmental hazards.
1.1    Terms of Reference
During its screening and assessment procedures, the Feasibility Study (CIECC, 1993) has identified
many issues relating to engineering and environmental aspects as needing more detailed investigation
during a detailed design phase. Based on this analysis, the ToR.) that relate directly and indirectly to
both the EIA and the EMAP are as follows:
Scope of Services
Taking into account the findings of the feasibility analysis and preliminary engineering, as well as
the relevant environmental impact studies, the Consultants shall perform detailed environmental
studies, economic analysis, detailed field surveys, surface and subsurface investigation, including
specific soils and materials investigations, laboratory testing and related works, and proceed with the
detailed design of the road, bridges and other drainage structures. A master plan for environmental
mitigation shall be drawn up, and implementation procedures established.
During the course of their services the Consultant was supposed to carry out inter alia, a detailed
environmental Study in accordance with World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 and 4.30 for a
Category A project.

Specific Environmental Issues to be Addressed:
The environmental study will include, but not be limited to, the following environmental issues:
* Carry out a survey to identify the distribution and remaining value of Chalan Beel wet lands
within the impact zone of the proposed road.
* Assess impacts of embankmnents on surface drainage patterns and natural fish production to assist
the engineering team in designing appropriate road cross-drainage.
* Carry out a base line survey to identify sensitive areas which should be protected from borrow
activities.
* Develop criteria and procedures for rehabilitating the sites after the earth work is completed.
• Assess air pollution and noise problems principally during operation phase, base rmainly on a
survey for those of existing roads; and
* Develop a comprehensive environmental management: plan and an environmental monitoring plan,
based on the results of above.
As for the route choice, the Environmental Team will work in close consultation with Technical
Design Team and with the Client fmalising the choice of alignment. To meet these requests. the
Environmental Team will
* undertake detailed topographic surveys of the proposed road alignment and prepare route plan
and profile drawings with relevant cross-sectional details.
• contribute to the site survey and assessment of proposed and existing bridges and culverts on the
route;
* assist with hvdrological analyses for all bridges t culvert sites and finalising length, and
navigational clearance formal bridges;
* determine number, size and location of all culverts required on the routes chosen. Special
attention will be given in determining the opening of the culverts so that velocity of water flow be
minimum so that obstruction is not created in the movement of fish.
* review the data obtained during the feasibility study and undertake additional soils and materials
investigations as required to find suitable materials for road embankment, pavement and
reinforced concrete works. For all materials proposed, the Environmental Team will also assess
the environmental compatibility with respect to obtaining and processing these materials, and
assess potential adverse effects due to waste disposal;
* ascertain the possibilities to cater for the uninterrupted flow of traffic for the period concerned.
* undertake an inventory of the road side trees and make a detailed report on such removal of trees
affected by the alignment.
The main output of this EIA is the definition of the final road alignment in accordance with
minimisation of environmental impacts and technical and economic feasibility.

1.2    Scope of Assessment and Management Action Plan
The initial screening undertaken at the stage of project identification (CIECC, 1993) came to the
conclusion to include this project as Categorv A in accordance with OD 4.01, i.e. requiring a full
environmental assessment. This classification seems justified given the type, location, ecological
sensitivity as well as the nature of the expected adverse impacts of NHBNR project that mray be
irreversible and multifold.
This ELA is based on the results presented in the Baseline Environmental Survey which covers the
major bio-physical, ecological and human aspects pertaining to the Project Area. The EIA also
analyses all major cross-sectoral issues (e.g. socio-economic, resource uses, health, culture) and the
existing environmental impacts (the without project situation). All areas which are directly affected
bv the road alignment are assessed to the degree where changes in the environmental setting are
expected. Depending on the factor assessed, these areas are approximately I to 5 km adjacent to the
CL (see Tab. 1.3.2.1). This study excludes, however, more distant areas where major economic
changes are likelv to follow as a result of improving the regional communication network.
The Management Action Plan focuses mainly on appropriate measures in those sectors where major
adverse effects are expected which could be mitigated by employing specific technical solutions and
management options. Major sectors of interventions with mitigation actions are (i) ) mnaintenance of
drainage pattern, (ii) flood protection (iii) income generating facilities for PAP's in the field of
aquaculture, forestry and agriculture, (iv) rehabilitation of borrowpits. The Management Action Plan
will also take into consideration control and mitigation measures for a variety of impacts that are
commonly associated with this type of project, such as air and noise pollution, health and accident
risks, impairment of communication and social disturbances.
This EMAP will not elaborate the RAP as the RAP is not part of Consultant's assignment. The RAP
is to be defined after the PAP census and is part of the "to be appointed NGO's assignment". Once
the ERAP and the RAP will be defined, the adequate nmitigation measures for PAPs like IGP,
training, and the MIS can be worked out.
The Consultants are fully aware that this omission renders the environmental management plan
somewhat incomplete, but it is not under the Consultant's responsibility to tackle these tasks. As
defined in the ToR for the RAP (see Report on "Resettlement Issues") the entire resettlement part of
the EMAP is to be provided by the selected NGOs. Nevertheless, this report discusses some of
suggestions that evolved during this EIA on the linkage of linking income generating activities (e.g.
modification of borrowpits into fish farms, roadside plantation schemes) with a future resettlement
action plan.
1.3    Approach and Methodologies
1.3.1 Data Collection and Analysis
Essentially the methodological approach in collecting, analysing and processing the primary and
secondary data for the EIA was identical with the one outlined in Section 1.5 of the Environmental
Baseline Study. Reference is also made to the respective sources of information quoted in the
Annexes of this report (e.g. maps, institutions contacted, interviews and questionnaires, public
involvement and participation of the PAPs, documents) and the specific field surveysundertaken.

The issues associated with resettlement of PAP are nol: considered in this ELA and in the EMAP as
they are not included in the Consultants ToR. The Consultant prepared, as requested, the ToR for
an "Resettlement Action Plan" as outlined in the reporl: on "Resettlement Issues on the PAPs". This
report also identifies the needs for a comprehensive PAP census. Eventually, the elaboration of the
RAP and the MIS for planning, implementation and monitoring of the resettlement program, together
with the income generating and training program fully depends on the outcome of the PAP census
and the furthter requirements of the Client.
1.3.2 Bounding
The delineating of the areas and zones of influence of possible impacts were following the criteria
described in the Baseline Survey (Section "Definition of Boundaries for Project Area"). For each of
the major impact parameter a specific bounding (corridor identification) was performed, describing
the width of each corridor in relation to the CL (Tab. 1.3.2. 1)

1.3.3  Defining Project-Specific Environmental Criteria and Guidelines
Above all, the en%ironmental assessment ensured to the maximum possible and applicable to keep
the number of people who would loose their homestead or only source of income due to the new road
construction as low as possible. All analytical results were extensively discussed with the technical
design team to ensure the feasibility of both the selected alignment and the proposed mitigation
measures.
By the nature of this project, a number of sites had to be selected in which specific impacts of
construction elements (e.g. CL, borrowpits, newly created lakes, construction sites) needed to be
assessed and, to the maximum possible, to be avoided. In achieving this goal, environmental criteria
were taken account while
(i)    selecting the sites for
*  access (temporary) roads
*  borrowpits (including possible later use for income generating activities such as fish or rice
production)
*  sand excavation (or, if technically applicable, hydraulic dredging) sites
*  material deposits
*  campsites and sanitation facilities
(ii)   choice ofproper materials and construction proceduresfor
*  access (temporary) road construction
*  borrowpit material options
*  excavating and dredging operations
e  depositing waste material and surface water runoffs
*  pavement material and hot air emission
*  hazardous construction material
(iii)   confining air pollution with respect to
*  during construction and operation phase
* vehicle gas emission
.  dust
*  hot air
(iv)   confining noise problems during construction and operation phase
1.4    Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
Above all, the Client was consulted about the policy oi. this project, and the overall objective the
NHBNR will pursue. Taking the broad range of assessment for the parameters ascribed to the
project into account, a variety of institutions and organisations were contacted which could either
contribute direct information (documentation, reports, maps etc.) or give for valuable comments
while analysing data. The project team contacted therefore organisations which are either
administratively involved with the project, or which pursue vested interests and policies in proper
execution of this project. Annex B of the Environmental Baseline Survey Report enlists all
institutions and organisations which were contacted during the execution of this work.

By nature of the many surveys conducted in the field, the project personnel and management stayed
continuouslv in constant contact and dialogue with the communities affected by NHBNR. Major
issues were discussed at village meetings and during the household surveys (see Socio-Econornic
Survey of the PAP). Village people information, concerns and response to the project contributed
therefore significantly to the specific assessment described in this report.
To the extent necessary (and depending on the degree of actuality and availability) the
documents/acts enlisted in this report in Annex A were consulted to assess the legal framework in
which this project is embedded. More specific, the purpose of this approach was
* to find out whether the project proposals are in conformity with the existing policies, laws and
regulations;
• to identify any part of the project recommendations and mitigation measures which would be in
contradiction with the existing policies, laws and environmental standards;
• to elaborate at the stage of preparing the tender documents the guidelines which would ensure the
long-term environmental protection interest of both the Government and the communities;
. to discover at an early stage of planning whether any proposed action may infringe on the
fundamental or traditional (cultural) rights and perceptions of the people;
* to ascertain that there exists relevant legislation in force. but is inoperative because of prevailing
setbacks due to poor socio-economic conditions.
* to identify the degree of legal support the project may expect with regard to safeguarding the
fragile ecological conditions in the floodplain, and to enhance environmental awareness among
the communities involved.

2.    Project Description
2.1    Project Rationale and Justification
The NHBNR project will provide a direct link to the West of Rajshahi division leading from the
western approach of the proposed Jamuna Bridge. Thie junction point at Bonpara is on the
Natore-Pabna road. The distance between Nalka and Bonpara is about 55 km. The first
approximately 4 km. between Nalka and Hatikamrul involving the upgrading of an existing route.
The main objective of NHBNR is to provide direct link to the west of Rajshahi Division leading from
the western approach of the proposed Jamuna Bridge. The highway will equally represent a major
link between the North Western Districts and the capitil. As such, the NHBNR will definitely
achieve major positive socio-economic impacts in many parts of the area by improving better
communication, transport and social services which ultimately create better environment for human
life. It is expected to have a significant affect on improved traffic movement and related economic
development in this region.
The Preliminary Engineering, Economic Feasibility and Environmental Impact Assessment study for
a new road betveen Nalka and Bonpara via Hatikamrul has been prepared by N/S. China
International Engineering and Consulting Corporation in association with O'Sullivan & Graham
iimited and Development Design Consultant Ltd. Two routes, Route 1 complying with the project
description and Route 3A, terminating at Ahmedpur rather than at Bonpara, and passing close to
important Thana centers such as Tarash, Gurudaspur and Baraigram, have been identified as giving
good economic rates of retum. This is conditional upon the Jamuna Bridge project going ahead.
Route I is cheaper but route 3A currently shows the better rate of retum. The Consultants have, on
balance, recommended Route I which was subsequently approved by GOB as final selected route for
the project.
2.2    Project Components and Technical Layout
The road will be constructed on an earth embankment with an average height of almost 4 meter. The
highest embankment will be situated at the approach of the Atrai River Bridge where the
embanlcnent will be 11 m high to assure navigational clearance for this river.
The total top width of the road embankment will be 18 in. The road generally consist of a 7.3 m
paved highway with hard and tufted shoulders of 1.25 m width each on both sides making the total
pavement width 12.3 m. 0.6 m below the top main pavement a secondary shoulder will be
constructed to accommodate a slow traffic lane of 3.8 m width.
The core of the embanlament consists of sand whilst a 0.5 m cladding layer of clay will be used for
initial slope protection. In places where long and intensive flooding is expected the cladding layer
will be increased to 0.75 m. In the newly constructed road 12 bridges are projected to accommodate
the calculated 25 year flood return discharge through main rivers and khals. In addition, about 85
culverts are included to drain off all surface water and minor rivers in the Project Area.
For the construction of the road a ROW of 50 m is required over the total length of the alignment.
For bridge approaches and junction additional land is required. According to the Land Acquisition
Plan more than 3,000 plots are affected. The extend of land loss for individual landowners varies
from 1 to 100 %. The land acquisition analysis showed ithat some landowners will loose so much

land that they would not be able to generate sufficient income to sustain living with their remaining
land. These landowners are to be provided with new land and/or adequate compensation and an
alternative source of income. The NHBNR project also requires that 28 homesteads are to be
removed. The concerned households are to be resettled.
2.3    Civil Works Construction Methods
The total project will be divided into four contracts which aLre provisionallY allocated to the following
lots:
Nalka - Hatikamrul           5 km
Hatikamrul - Atrai River    20 km
Atrai River - Baraigram     20 km
Baraigram - Bonpara         10 km
To a certain extend the Contractor(s) executing the works can choose his (their) own construction
method. As the Contract describes the materials to be used, some of the production and construction
methods will be established by the Contract.
The main part of the fill material will be transported by truck from borrowpit to the construction
site. The transport distance depends on the location of the borrov%pits. The total quantity of required
fill material for the entire project is approximately 5 million m3. It is estimated that more than 95 %
of this material will be transported by truck via (temporary) roads or tracks or via the (partly)
established embankment. However, the possibility of hydraulic dredging is not to be ruled out but
depends on the option chosen by the Contractor.
All building materials required for the construction of the road like stones, gravel, bitumen, cement,
reinforcement steel etc. is to be transported by road or by boat during the monsoon season. River
boat transport may play a more important role since the ge:neral infrastructure in the Project Area is
poor and the low quality of the existing roads will further deteriorate.
For each of the contracts an Asphalt Mixing Plant (AMP) will be used. The asphalt concrete will be
transported by truck to the paving site where it will be spread and compacted. For the construction
of culverts and bridges different concrete mixers will be used.
Where necessary, e.g. at bridge locations, drainage is required for bored piling.
2.4    Construction Planning and Implementation
At this stage the period of execution of the works is not delined. It is assumed that the reconstruction
of the Nalka - Hatikamrul section will be accelerated to ensure a appropriate connection between the
westem approach of the Jamuna Bridge and the Nagarbari - Bogra road when the Jamuna Bridge is
opened to traffic. This means that the construction of Nalka - Hatikamrul is to start latest in the first
part of 1997. It is expected that the total construction period for the Nalka - Hatikamnrul section will
be 18 months whilst the road will be open to traffic after 12 months. As for the completion of the
other sections of NHB (Ch. 4+000 to 54+820) present estimates range between 30 to 36 months.

3.    Existing Environmental Impacts in the Project Area
Like most areas in the country, the Project Area is affected by a number of environmental impacts
relating to both natural catastrophes and human activities.
3.1    Natural Impacts
3.1.1  Flooding
In the Project region, like in many regions in Banglades.h, flood is a regular phenomenon, often
causing substantial problems problem when the entire infrastructure together with the people's live,
their belongings and the cropland they depend on are affected.
As NHBNR is crossing the major depression at the Lower Atrai Basin, forming the so-called "Green
River" it will be often exposed to severe and long-lasting flooding caused both by major spills from
the Atrai River. The area is also influenced from the Chalan Beel area where flood, volume quickly
drains from the upper part of the Atrai basin. Flooding intensifies locally when there is coincidence
of temporary heavy run-off in the Atrai, Karotoa and Bangali system. Apart from that, there are
other lowland areas in the western part of the Project Area flooded by minor rivers.
The Project Area is partly affected by the backwater flow from the Jamuna River. In the early stage
of the annual monsoon the Jamuna level remains quite high and there is substantial back water
flooding into the Hurasagar when the river spills over and engulfs the Lower Atrai Basin.
The area experience severe flooding in the years 1987, 1988, 1991 and 1993 following breaches of
the Brahamputra Right Embankment and high levels in the Brahmaputra and the Ganges. Fig.
3.1.1.1 shows the magnitude of inundation during one of' the peak flooding occurring in August
1993. The security of Brahmaputra Right Embankment (BRE) needs to be taken into due account as
this construction and the hinterland to be protected (partly being the project area) are seriously
threatened by continued bank erosion. Of particular concern is the imminent breach of BR.E at
Mathurapara, some 40 km to the North of Nalka, where the Jamuna River bank erosion has already
approached the Bengali River in less than 1 km distance. The scenario that may have far-reaching
consequences, also for the NHBNR, when the BRE protection will break is simulated and broadly
discussed in the Hydraulic Modelling Study.
Infrastructure development like polder construction is continually taking place in the upper
catchment of the rivers, namely in the Atrai River Basirn. This is impeding the free flow of the
generated run-offs and causes a variety of enviromnental impacts and economic setbacks in some
areas. The effects are multifold, ranging from climatic; changes, change of drainage pattern,
deterioration of surface water quality, disruption of fish population and recruitment, loss of crops, to
social disturbances (FAP-2, 1992).

3.1.2  Storms
Storns that ravage the region are mostly of local nature. Typical storms are Nor' Westers.
tornadoes, and thunderstorms with wind speeds ranging from 90 to 200 km/hr. The storms'
damaging capacity is high but their area extent is limited. They can uproot trees, blow always Kacha
houses (at least all roofs), causing severe damages to peoples' life, livestock and properties. This
types of storms are generally expected during the months MLarch - May and again in September -
October. Two to three storms of such nature occur in average each year in the region.
The local storms may create considerable wave run-up in the project area on exposed embankment
structures. Particularly in the central area of the "Green River" (at Nimacharai khal) there is
sufficient effective fetch distance for wave to build up to 1.5 meters. Embankment erosion and scour
are often resulting from these hydrodynamic forces.
Cyclones which are generated due to deep depressions in the Bay of Bangal, proceeding towards the
coast and hitting coastal areas associated with high speed wind, extensive rainfall and surges do not
reach the Project Area (see Fig. 3.1.2.1) as they prevail in the coastal areas of Bangladesh.
3.1.3  Seismic Activities
Bangladesh, particularly the north-eastern zone has experienced in the past earthquakes of moderate
to high intensity. The great earthquake of 1897 which had its epicentre in the Shillong Plateau of
India caused widespread damages. Two other major earthquakes, the Bengal earthquake of 1885
and Srimongal earthquake of 1918 caused severe damages on limited areas surrounding their
epicentres.
According to BNBC (1993) Bangladesh has seismic zones. It appears the project area falls within
the limit of two zones with moderate and low seismic activity (Fig. 3.1.3.1). The errtire eastern part
of the Project Area fall in zone 2, i.e. moderate seismic zone. The eastern part lie within a zone
where negligible shocks are observed.

3.2    Man-made Impacts
3.2.1   Destruction and Modification of Natural Habitats
Almost all of the land in the Project Area is privately owned and almost completely mnodified by man
into agricultural plots (mainly paddy fields) and elevated homestead sites with horticulture.
In spite of these massive anthropogenic interferences, the region still contains some important
habitats for wildlife like the Chalan Beel, although much of the forner characteristic wetland
landscape has long been lost (see Baseline Survey). With the loss of valuable wetlands supporting
rich wildlife (predominantly waterfowl) the region suffered critical losses in vital habitats.
Man has modified vast areas of former floodplains into culture land by drainage and polder
construction. Similarly, the number of so-called refuge forests, e.g. stands of mixed tree and shrub
vegetation on medium highlands, has been drastically reduced due to settlement and land
reclamation. In fact, all medium highlands in the large floodplain area became reshaped by man,
establishing homesteads and associated homestead gardens. It is thus justified to conclude that
almost no pristine habitat exists in the entire Project Area except the barren lands adjacent to the
khals, particularly Nimacharai khal.
3.2.2 Pollution of Water Resources and Associated H[ealth Hazards
The Project Area experiences a wide range of detrimental interferences with its water resources.
Poor sanitation and hazardous drinking water supply, together with malnutrition and limited health
care are the main causes of high morbidity and mortality in the region. Groundwater drawdown has
locally reached alarming low levels.
Poor Sanitation Facilities and Hazardous Defecation Practices
About 90% of the population in the Project Area have no latrines and therefore defecate in open
places indiscriminately. Kutcha latrines are usually constructed by the sides of ponds, ditches, rivers
and khals. According to field surveys only 1.4% had V.S latrines which are, however, not regularly
used by all the family members. Given this hazardous defecation practices and the fact that livestock
also uses these resources, surface waters are seriously polluted and pose substantial risks upon
human health. Faecal bome diseases and parasites such as hookworm are common in the area.
Water and Vector Borne Diseases
It is assumed that the Project Area is representative for rural Bangladesh where about 80% of
people, prevailingly children, suffer from water and faecal bome diseases. Among the most
commonly reported diseases are diarrhoea, dysentery, gastro-enteritis, typhoid fever, diphtheria,
and hepatitis. Peaks widespread outbreaks of diseases are: shortly after the monsoon and during the
dry season. In 1993, the region was affected by epidemic cholera, reportedly caused by shortage of
drinking water and inadequate rural sanitation.
The existing FCD projects can encourage waterlogging, providing the main breeding areas for
mosquitoes. In addition, small borrow pits of rural roads, and minor khals develop stagnant pools
during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period. The vector-borne diseases such as malaria and
kala azar are common in the Project Area.

Pollution with Agro-Chemicals
With the introduction of HYV boro paddv culture the extensive use of agro-chemicals such as
chemical fertilisers and pesticides represents another ubiquitous source of surface water and soil
pollution. It remains for further investigation to which extent this will have long-term effects on both
wildlife and human health. Apart from agro-chemicals there are other pollutants, however limited to
local interferences such as poorly controlled waste disposals from sugar mills.
Prelimrinary water quality tests on main chemical components and bacteriological tests were carried
out during the Feasibility Study from tube-well sources. .The results showed that the pH value,
hardness, chloride and Fe2+ contents were within acceptable limits, except for four samples whose
iron contents exceeded the Bangladeshi standard. The reason of this excessive iron content mav be
due to the geological formation of the soil at these villages as Sirajganj district falls within the area
identified by DPHE as having an iron problem. Regarding bacteriological results, all samples were
bacteria free except two taken at Baraigrarn and Ullapara Thana respectively.
3.2.3 Impacts Influencing the Hydraulic Regime
The land slope is low. As such the flood flow of the area is controlled by the downstream flow into
the so-called "Green River" (Fig. 3.2.3.1). The hydrology and flooding of the Lower Atrai is
complex and includes surface water runoff due to heavy monsoon rains, occasional spills from
adjacent main and secondary rivers, occasional severe flooding following breaches of the
Brahmaputra Right Embankment and seasonal backwater flooding from the confluence area of the
Jamuna and Ganges rivers. Various structures and man-made activities tend to interfere with the
natural flooding and drainage system. The water uses prevailing in the Project Area are, at least
seasonally, not sustainable.
Disruption in Water Supply
Due to the remoteness and economic under-development the water supply facilities in the Project
Area are below the average standard in Bangladesh. The field survey showed that tube-well coverage
is one tube well for 150 people. However, many shallow tube-wells remain defunct during the dry
period due to the decline of static water level below the critical depth. As a result people of this
region use surface water resources from the surroundings, such as fishponds, ditches, beels, rivers.
In these times only few people can fully rely on dug wells.
Excessive Water Use Impeding Groundwater Recharge
The field survey identified that tube-well water is used mainly for drinking and surface water for
other domestic purposes, e.g. bathing, washing of utensils, cloth-washing, gardening, cattle washing,
cattle feeding and sanitation purposes after defecation. During the dry period, when almost all
shallow tube-wells become non-operational, people depend on the Tara-pump deep tube-wells which
may be more than 400 metres distant; very few rural people collect clean drinking water from such
distant Tara-pump deep tube wells. Rather they collect river water, pond water and dug-well water
for their drinking purposes. During the crisis period out of 51.8 litres per capita/day, the rural people
of the Project Area collect up to 2 litres of tube-well water from distant tube-wells and the rest of
their requirements are met from nearby available surface water sources.

Groundwater recharge depends mainly on rainfall less surface runoff. Due to the concentration of
tube-wells (either hand pump or moton'sed) in some locations in the Project Area the use of
groundwater is already extensive and reportedly reaches the limit. This conclusion is supported by
field investigations and data collection from the DPHE Thana offices, confirming that during the dry
period the groundwater level goes down, varving from 7.0m to 10.5 m below ground level in April to
May. As a result almost 90% of shallow tube wells become inoperational for a period from
December to May ever year. The DPHE Thana office supplied their water level monitoring data
which showed a maximum decline of 10.4 m in Baraigrarm Thana (CIEC, 1993). It must be stated,
however, that excessive use of groundwater resources due to the high numbers of tube-wells are but
two of the reasons for the general drawdown of groundwater in the Project Area. Other causes relate
to reduced rainfall, less flood, increased temperature and, reduction in river flow in the dry period
during the past years.
Polder Construction
The Bangladesh Water Development Board BWDB in a bid to mitigate flooding in the Chalan Beel
area implemented some flood control projects. For their location in relation to the Project Area,
reference is made to Fig. 3.2.3.1. The project included construction of Polders A,. B, C & D and
excavation of canals for drainage and diversion. Polders C & D are nearly fully implemented and
these are located in the upper reaches of the Chalan Beel. Polder A & B are only partially completed.
Due to creation of adverse conditions outside the polders, people often cut them to redress their
sufferings from losses in agriculture, increased flooding, development of stagnant waters,
impairment of mobility etc. The problem of dissatisfied people cutting these embankmnents has
become a recurring problem. One such a problem spot is situated right next to the alignment at km
24 where people from nearby Ambaria and Hamkuria villages cut deeply the South Tarash
embanlanent, making road passage impossible since 1998.
Blockage of Channels
Drainage channels and rivers such as the Atrai and Mora Boral have experienced during the past
three decades a number of blockages by villagers establishing bunds to deviate water for irrigation
purposes. Obviously this action contributes to substantial alterations in the flooding and siltation
pattem in both upstream and downstream areas.
Insufficiency of Hurasagar Sluice to Control Backflooding in the Lower Atrai Basin
The entire river system draining the Chalan Beel and its eastern periphery converge at Baghabari
and drain into the Brahmaputra-Jamuna through the Hurasagar. The tail end of the Atrai-Baral-
Karotoa-Bangali system from Baghabari to - Jamuna out fall is known as Hurasagar. The water
level of Jamuna rises first in the early part of the monsoon season, when levels in the Atrai-Baral
system remain lower. As a result, Jamuna water backs up and flows upwards through the Hurasagar
and reaches up to the lower part of the Chalan Beel. (Fig. :3.2.3.1).
Mitigation measures so far conceived and implemented by the BWDB approved to be ineffective. In
the light of recent studies by FAP-2 in association with the Surface Water Modelling Center, some
measures for flooding in the Atrai Basin has been put forward. But considering as a whole the flood
problem in the Chalan Beel area no tangible measure is forth coming. As an instance, a sluice at the
outfall of the Hurasagar was conceived. Its effectiveness was judged insufficient to cope with the
problem of backflooding unless a complete reconstruction of the sluices are considered, estimated by
BWDB planners to be in the range of several hundred billion BDT.

Railwav alignment South of N}BNR
The southernmost area of the "Green River" is traversed by a railway track between Ishurdi and
Sirajganj, constructed some 75 years ago. According to the magnitude of bac,water ponding
calculated in the Hydraulic Modelling Study (see Report) it is not believed that there is any far-
reaching hydrological impact from the railway ali gnment on the project or vice versa.
Notwithstanding, the openings kept in the rail track may serve as a guideline for the proposed road.
But due to continuous development in that area the hydrological scenarios are changing, some of
which give reason for careful monitoring.
3.2.4 Air Pollution
At present, air pollution is not an issue to be concerned in the Project Area since it is primarily a
rural agricultural setting without pronounced traffic network and without notable industrial
development.
According to the "Air Pollution Study" undertaken during this EIA, increased values of CO. HC and
NO, emissions reach measurable quantities in the vicinity of the existing junctions at Hatikamrul and
Bonpara. Reference is made to the specific Report.
3.2.5  Noise Pollution
There is virtually no significant noise level due to the remoteness and absence of heavy traffic. Most
of the road alignment for the newly constructed highway (between Hatikamrul and Bonpara) passes
through vacant agricultural low lands and floodplain depressions with few scattered villages.
Currently there are only two spots at NHBNR alignmenf which are subject to the comrnon level of
noise as they are located at the junctions of large highways. One such place is Bonpara junction
where the new road meets the newly rehabilitated Natore-Pabna Highway, the other is at Hatikamrul
junction where the National Highway Bogra-Nagarbary-Pabna meets with the trunk road from
Sirajgonj and Nalka. Both localities have bazaar facilities, with bus and lorry stops. Traffic
congestion is frequent, thus the noise level from both moving and starting heavy vehicles is high.
Additional noise is created from drivers utiLising excessively their horns and rikshas ringing bells in
such localities where traffic congestion is common and/or traffic flow is not constant.
At these location noise levels are particularly high between 8.00 hrs and 20.00 hrs with levels of 60
to 70 dBA (see Report on Noise Pollution). At the 4 km road connecting Nalka and FIatikamrul there
is less noise (45-55 dBA) because of the reduced traffic load identified by the Traffic Survey.

3.3    Development in the Project Region
The area is expected to become subject to major economic development in the near future due to the
development of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge and its highway network of which NHBNR is one
of the major elements. Apart from this evolvement there is r elative few other development going on
in this region which is sparsely populated and predominantly an agricultural domain. There is no
industrial development in or adjacent to the Project Area. Major small-scale industries and family
based enterprises are rice mills, potteries and sugar molasses production.
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Construction
The Jamuna Bridge wNill consist of a multi-span high level bridge totalling some 4.8 km in length,
with bridge end facilities on reclaimed land. The entire project, forecast to be completed by the end
of 1998, includes also extensive river training works and access roads. On the west side the access
road is designed to meet after a distance of some 15 km the existing Nalka Bridge. From that point
onwards (Ch.0.000) it would directly link to the NHBNR.
Road Upgrading Projects
The second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP2) aims to imnprove the existing
highways and roads in the Northwest through rehabilitation and maintenance activities. This project
involves constructing six by-passes and additions to the existing network designed to avoid both the
more congested cities and the riverbank erosion along the Padma river.
The upgrading on the rural road network includes the following projects: Rehabilitation of the
existing federal road network from Kashinathpur to Bogra (almost completed), whilst from
Kashinathpur to Pabna and Natore is a committed scheme intended to be completed in 1996. In
addition, the section of road from Bogra to Natore is due to be overlaid this year at the existing
standard. The Rural Roads Market Improvement and Maintenance Project (RD7) includes
rehabilitating markets and upgrading Type B feeder roads throughout the North West Region.
Flood Control Structures and FAP Projects
The continuing development of flood control measures for Bangladesh is being carried out under the
Flood Action Plan (FAP). In the entire North West Region the existing polder schemes are currently
reviewed with respect to their environmental impacts. The poldering development (e.g. Chalan Beel
polder A) in the adjacent and immediate realm of the Project Area has considerable influence on both
technical and environmental design of this project. Of particular importance is the interception of the
Atrai River by a dam construction between Gurudaspur and Katchikata to deviate surface irrigation
waters West to the Tarash region. Consequently, the downstream Lower Atrai hydrological regime is
affected in many ways.
River Navigation and Dredging of Navigation Routes
The Lower Atrai Basin has traditionally been served by a wide network of river transport. The
IWTA have proposed the use of the Atrai River, currently a Class IV route, to import rock from
India. The navigability of this main water artery in the Garges/Brahmaputra floodplain, however,
vill be largely affected by high sediment transport rate, leading to rapid morphological changes in
this riverine system, probably in the order of 15 to 20 years. The Regional Plan (FAP-2)
recommended excavation and reshaping of the channel in order to keep the river open for navigation
during the monsoon period. The FAP-2 Study shows that a substantial number of river locations will
require dredging, some of which are located near the site where NHBNR crosses the Atrai River.

4.   Environmental Impacts Anticipated Due to NHBNR-Project
4.1            Issues at Stake
Given the scope and complexity of the construction of this new highway crossing a, highly dynamic
floodplain, which is well populated and intensively used for agriculture, a number of (direct) short-
term, long-term and (indirect) chain effects can be expected. It seems justified to include this project,
following WB/OD 4.01, under Category A, i.e. a project that requires a full and comprehensive EIA
due to the nature of potential impacts associated uith the planned interventions.
The expected impacts are compounded with a number of specific potential impacts that are related.to
the sensitive nature of this vast floodplain extending between the Rivers Padma and Jamuna. The
likely increase in surface water pollution, groundwater problems, local congestion of floodwaters,
progressive erosion, solid and hazardous material deposit problems, creation of stagnant water
bodies and associated public health risks, gains in agriculture and rural development versus losses in
fisheries, interference with wildlife and ecologically important habitats, socio-economic disturbances
due to resettlement and influx of labour are the prominent effects that are at stake with this project,
and that will duly addressed in Part III dealing with managemient and mitigation measures.
Given the complexity of the different effects which are associated with this linear project, the
following qualitative matrix of the composite possible environmental impacts are summarised below:

4.2.1      Disruption of the Flooding and Surface Draining Pattern
The construction of a highway embankment perpendicular to the main flow stream and drainage
system of a large floodplain is to be viewed with care and caution. The flooding pattern, its
seasonal occurrence and duration, main and secondary river and drainage outlet discharges and
scenarios of Jamuna spills and embankment break through events have carefully been analysed in
the Hydraulic Modelling Study. The conclusion of this assessment is that, in general the NHBNR
is unlikely to cause significant change in the overall flooding regime of the so-called "Green River"
given the number and design of bridges and culverts. According to the calculations made in the
Hydraulic Modelling Study, the overall drainage of the Project Area is fully maintained.
Nevertheless, local ponding problems cannot be ruled out, and it is assumed that in the upstream
region of the road, the flooding duration may be slightly more than at present due to lack of lateral
flow of water only during monsoon. This increase is less than 15 cm and only occurs during flash
floods.
In the recent past few flood control polders have been built in the Chalan Beel which verv often
either fail or are willingly cut by dissatisfied people. Thus, the project must ensure that no major
impairment of flooding and drainage pattem occurs to avoid similar interferences and deliberate
destruction.
Local rainfall excess may accumulate in some low-lying areas and khals, resulting in increased local
water level. increase. On the other hand, at the end of monsoon, local drainage will be prolonged
which will further extend the presence of stagnant waters and may create environmental problems
discussed above.
Due to construction (earthwork) activities, sedimentation in adjacent lowlands can increase at
coincidence of heavy rainfall. In case of khals intercepted by the alignment, equally there might be
additional silting up of these channels during the construction of bridges and culverts. This would
imply that local drainage conditions will worsen.
4.2.2 Interruption of Local Transport and Communication
The project implementation foresees that during the construction phase considerable quantities of
material and equipment will have to be brought in by the Atrai River using barges. This may disrupt
or at least impede the regular riverine traffic. Furthermore, piling installation and installation of
prefabricated bridge spans by floating cranes can result in partial blockage of the navigational
channel.
In the eastern part (Hatikamrul - Nalka) and in the vicinity of Bonpara and Baraigram a significant
increase in road transport and traffic with heavy construction machinery will affect the local traffic
flow. To some extent, the rural road net and inter-village communication will also be affected by the
construction of access roads and heavy machinery plying between construction and campsites.
The alignment of NHBNR will cross 36 electric power lines, out of which one (Hatikamrul) is a
main line (132.000 Volt), while the rest are distribution lines. A total of 123 poles carrying electrical
power line will be affected, out of which 47 will need to be removed out of ROW. Early notice needs
to be made to both the Power Development Board (PDB) and the Rural Electrification Board (REB)
to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the respective outlets.

4.3     Construction and Operation Related Ecological Impacts
4.3.1    Destruction and Modification of Habitats and Vegetation
For the road construction of the highway, junctions, busstops and campsites all vegetation in the land
acquired will be cleared. Besides, the excavation of the borrow pits to raise the embankments for
access roads will add to the destruction of the vegetation.
Destruction and Alteration of Habitats
The major part (approximately 85%) of the new road alignment (km 4 to 54) will pass through more
or less uniform paddy fields. In these agro-ecological zone, impacts on biological resources will be
rather limnited. In addition to the monocultural crop pattern. high residual values and applications of
agro-pesticides are responsible for the paucity of fauna and flora in these habitats. In contrast, the
number of species affected will drastically increase if mnore complex habitats are affected (Fig.
4.3.1.3).
A total of 30 ditches of different sizes are affected by the NHBNR. Partly these ditches are result
from the construction of embankments, partly from the creation of highlands to establish homesteads
and associated horticultures. Besides, 24 ponds will be affected, some of them being intensivelv used
for pisciculture. The ditches are semi-natural habitats, principally used by the public for fishing,
washing animals, and grazing of livestock. Commonly the slopes of the ditches are surrounded by
various types of herbs and shrubs, all of them providing a habitat for smaller animals. The removal
and alteration of these elements will therefore contribute to a local reduction of floristic biodiversity
and of natural living space for a diverse fauna. The pond dikes are often similarly vegetated like the
ditches, but sometimes useful plants (e.g. mango trees, bananas, medicinal shrubs) are planted. The
removal and/or alteration of pond habitats will have similar adverse effects on the local ecology like
the removal of ditches. In addition, semi-intensively or extensively used ponds are a vital source of
food for resident birds (e.g. kingfisher, egret, herons) and aquatic reptiles.
At about 65 locations the NHIBNR will affect homestead gardens and horticultural plots. In
particular, the bird and insect fauna is rich in these micro-habitats due to the absei4ce of pesticides
and high structural heterogeneity of ecological niches. Other groups of wildlife, too, find their refuge
in these habitats. The homestead gardens also harbour a large number of wild plants and are vital for
both replenishment and propagation of these plants.
Two Sissoo plantations and 5 bamboo groves will be affected along the selected route alignment.
The ecological damage following their removal will be less pronounced than in small refuge forests
which are partly affected in 3 cases. The latter are composed of a highly diverse mix of trees, shrubs
and a dense undergrowth. Again, this habitat provides plentiful niches to support a relative high
species diversity. Some of these habitats, particularly in the surroundings of river embankments and
khals have an undisputed value for their landscape aesthetics.
Apart from the physical removal of habitats and vegetation, which will create an irreversible damage
if no countermeasures are taken, physical interference with the local vegetation may be expected
during the construction phase. Dust from the vehicle movement at the construction site and emissions
from asphalt plants will settle on plants and crops in the surrounding area which will contribute to

Removal of Trees
According to detailed and repeated field survevs along the selected alignment, a total of 852 trees
need to be removed for the construction of NHBNR. Annex B gives a detailed account on the
number of trees affected in the main categories.
It needs to be noted that not all trees enumerated in this survey are large in girth. This holds
particularlv true for mango trees. As for bamboo, the accurate number of trees is somewhat difficult
to assess due to the complex growth pattem of this plant. Among the category "other trees" Babla
and Sissoo trees used in roadside embankment planting in the first four kilometres (Nalka-
Hatikamrul) represent the major part (totalling 285 trees).
The detailed inventory of the trees which need to be removed in the NHBNR project show that 350
trees, representing 42% of the total, are located between 'Ch. 0+000 and 4+000, i.e. the stretch that
will be completely rehabilitated while using the former alignment. Unfortunately it was not possible
to spare at least one side of the alley in that chainage because of the technical need to level the entire
embankment for rehabilitation work according to the technical standard required (see Design
Report).
No other impacts on forest and vegetation resources are identified since brick buming and crushing
has been excluded from the technical design of base construction. Thus, the common environmental
impacts associated with brick making, such as forest depletion, air pollution and surface water
pollution need not to be addressed in this EIA.
4.3.2   Impacts on Wildlife
Some parts of the lowland areas as well as semi-natural small forest refuges eliminated by the road
construction may include the temporary or permanent habitat for wildlife. The available data and
observations made during the Baseline Survey indicate thaLt more than 30 (migrant and resident) bird
species use the flooded wetlands during the winter season. In addition, the banks of Nimacharai khal
also serve a number of rare insectivorous birds and several reptile species as homestead.
In the affected lowlands, the Nimacharai khal and the Mora Boral wil] be among the principal
borrow sites for excavation of sand material. Thus, earthwork activities, transportation etc. will
disturb wildlife in the directly affected area and the adjacent environs. It is anticipated that at least
temporary dislocation of all wildlife inhabiting the respective areas (in total some 100-150 ha) will
occur. On the other hand, rehabilitation measures to re-establish natural lake systems (4 to 7 ha
each) in these excavation sites are assumed to mnitigate all potential interferences with wildlife.
The possible impacts on fish in different habitats will be discussed separately in Section 4.4.2.

4.3.3    Risks of Deterioration of Surface and Groundwater Resources
Impairment of Surface Drainage
Disruption of surface drainage is a common problem associated with major earthworks in
floodplains. These works have the potential to disrupt the natural cross drainage facility which
consequently will have negative effects on crop production. Surface irrigation using low lift pumps
and other indigenous devices may be disrupted temporarily as a result of unavoidable closure of
water supply channels during the irrigation season. Although, the extent of damage may not be
significant compared to the entire project, the livelihood of small farmers may be affected.
Water Quality Deterioration due to Drainage Disruption
The establishment of local stagnant water bodies due to drainage disruption will create a number of
environmental problems, ranging from public health risks (disease transmitting insects),
eutrophication (high bio-degradation of organic wastes, faeces, removed vegetation) to contamination
with spillage from construction activities (fuels, solvents, lubricants, tank leakage, chemical wastes).
Soil pollution and ground water pollution by liquid wastes can have serious effects on the quality of
drinking water, peoples' health condition and grazing livestock.
Disruption of Domestic Water Supply and Effects on Groundwater Recharge
Groundwater recharge depends mainly on rainfall less surface runoff. Rural people in the region
satisfy their domestic water demand with dug wells, ponds and tube-wells (either hand pump or
motorised). In some locations in the Project Area the use of groundwater is already extensive and
reportedly reaches the limit. Due to increase of activities and labour influx it is likely that future
recharge becomes less than the consumption. If locally reduced flooding will occur due to NHBNR
this will have an adverse impact in that area on the groundwater use. In cases where deep drainage
will be necessary for the construction of bridges and culverts, local groundwater drawdown may
cause a disruption in the water supply for the adjacent settlerments.
Disposal of Harmful Material Affecting Surface Water Resources
Depending on the disposal methods for the dredged and excavated fill material certain environmental
risks may appear: Disposal of dredged spoils in the river will increase turbidity of the river water in
the downstream which may cause significant damage to breeding of fish and alter the aquatic
ecology, mainly due to reduced phytoplankton production.
Hydraulic dredging processes, particularly the outflow frorm the wet spoils, commonly create major
environmental impacts. With this technique, enornous quantities of outflow will be generated from
dredged spoils. Improper disposal of this water may cause water-logging in the surrounding area,
leading among others to stagnant puddles that become mosquito breeding places. The improper
disposal of dredged spoils in the river may equally impose downstream hazards to the aquatic life
and habitats as well as silting up of the navigable channel. Before disposal, the quality of the water
should be checked carefully.
Disposal of Construction Materials and Solid Waste
During construction an essential part of the construction material will be wasted. This waste material
will be, for example, the unsuitable material for fill, excess of concrete, wrongly produced asphalt
concrete, residue from cleaning bitumen distributors, used engine oil, etc.. A part of this type of
materials can be re-used, but still a considerable part is to be disposed off. Uncontrolled disposal
may lead to severe pollution of soil and water resources.

4.4    Construction and Operation Related Socio-Economic Impacts
4.4.1  Impacts on Agriculture
In the Project Area, like in the entire floodplain region, the agricultural system and cropping pattem
primarily depend on the flood regime (kharij) season and the water availability in the dry (rabi)
season. Changes in the water regime due to the NHBNR project are therefore expected to have an
impact in the immediate and nearby corridor of the road alignment. The width of the impact corridor
vanes with land elevation. In highlands it will be mostly negligible, but in lowlands the influence of
this impact may be felt up to 10 km from the CL.
Farmers growing deepwater aman in medium to low land will presumably experience increased
yields in areas which will be subject to less flood depth and faster drainage. Such areas might
develop to some extent in the areas located South of the road embankment and near intersections
with rural roads. On the other hand, farmers cultivating fields in the North of the CL might
encounter longer and higher flood depth due to the physical barrier of the embankment established
perpendicularly to the main flood direction from North. Crop losses are anticipated due to increased
flooding.
In the other hand, a reversed effect may become felt in areas which will drain faster during the early
flood recession. In case of partial dry up of the land during the pre- and post monsoon period lower
average crop yields may be experienced. This will be particularly the case in locations where boro is
planted.
The net result of these two adverse effects are difficult to assess as they depend entirely on the local
condition and crop pattem. Production losses and gains will be felt be different farmers, depending
on the vicinity and the side of their plot is located with respect to the road alignment. In those
locations where the flood regime changes permanently due to the NHBNR, farmers are bound to
adjust their cultivation system. In case of boro plantation, however, the production losses almost
seem inevitable unless specific irrigation arrangements can be made.
Agricultural practices may be disrupted at the immediate construction sites and earthworks (e.g. near
borrowpits) as a result of temporary but unavoidable disruption of surface water hydrology.
Agricultural land required for borrow pits, access roads, campsite construction and stock piling of
fill .ill cause loss of production. Even after the rehabilitation of borrowpits after excavation,
agricultural production will be reduced for some time due to the damage to the soil structure. In
addition, some minor damage to the agricultural land may be expected from uncontrolled driving of
transportation vehicles and soil deposits on the adjacent agricultural land.
The local impairment of drainage and establishment of stagnant water bodies may also affect small-
scale jute processors: Jute retting requires floating water, it cannot be executed in stagnant water.

4.4.2 Impacts on Fisheries
Obviously, the potential impacts of this road project on culture fisheries are easier to assess than those
relating to capture fisheries. Following the results of the field survey. some 44 structures of fishponds will
be completely or partially affected. No hatchery is affected by ithe NHBNR. Few of the fishponds in the
Project Area are operated at intensive level. Accordingly, production yields vary and are generally low.
The actual loss (fishfrmi, production) to the respective fish farmer will be anaiysed at a later stage in
context with the PAP census.
The potential effects of NHBNR on capture fisheries are more complex in nature. Production losses and
subsequent consequences for the fishermen and fish marketers are based on the general perception that the
natural flooding on certain portions of the regional floodplain (the so-called Green River) will become
altered. Besides, the blocking of drainage channels and alteration of flooding and drainage pattem in the
immediate surroundings of the new road embankment might, in spite of bridges and culverts, cause local
disturbances and losses for fisheries. Among the potential adverse on impacts the following were identified:
Reduced Fish Migrations
Full flood control and controlled flooding reduces lateral fish migrations between rivers and floodplains in
two ways; firstly, by reducing the number of entry points on to floodplains and thereby concentrating fish
into fewer channels where they were more susceptible to capture, and secondly, by intensified capture
during pre-monsoon and monsoon period at the openings in the obstructing structure, i.e. the culverts of
the road embankment. It was observed by previous stucies (ODA, 1994) that even submersible
emnbankments of secondary rural roads blocked or delayed the entry of fish hatchlings carried downstream
by passive drift to reach their nursery areas in the lowlands.
Reduced Fish Abundance and Diversity
To assess this kind of impact, the NHBNR is compared with polder constructions that experienced cuts in
the embankment. Following polder construction in the NW Region significarny lower densities of fish
were found prior to cuts in ernbanlrnents and significantly higher densities later in the year following
several cuts which allowed fish through the embankments. It is concluded from the results of FAP-17
Studies that flood control can result in a significant reduction in biological productivity by decreasing fish
abundance even when sluice gates provide restricted access tO floodplains (ODA,1995). Similarly, this
kind of construction has an adverse impact on fish diversity. Particularly among the migratory species
such as high-valued major carps and catfish reductions were observed between 19 and 95% (ODA, 1995).
Disruption of Fish Community Structure
The FAP-17 Research undertaken in the NW Region concluded from comparison between of catch
compositions in unobstructed floodplain and flood control structures that the fish community structure in
flood controlled areas was disrupted not only by a loss of riverine and nugratory species but also by major
changes in the composition of the remaining floodplain resident species. As the degree of flood control
increased there was a corresponding loss in community heterogeneity and catches were increasingly
dependent on a relatively small nunber of abundant floodplain resident (small-sized) species. Under these
conditions there is a danger that the capability of fish stocks to sustain increased fishing pressure may be
impaired and that disease outbreaks may be more frequent and damaging. Hence the fish stocks m such
areas with reduced flooding and migration potential are regarded as being highly vulnerable to
overexploitation and collapse.

DHV Consultants BV
Possible Loss of Catch through Loss ofHabitat
It is widely accepted that flood control structures reducing the area of flooded land there will be a loss of
habitat for fish production (FAP-17, 1995). It is assumed that about 19.5 km of the existing alignrment
crosses lowlands that are deeply flooded dunng the monsoon period. In this stretch the elevated
embankmnent has an average width of 46 m at the toe of embanknent. Phvsically, the road would therefore
occupy about 90 hectare of flooded lowlands. The respective embankment sections, however, will have for
hvdraulic reasons a considerable number of openings (bridges and culverts), adding up to a total width of
1440 m. In terms of hectarage, this accounts for about 6.6 hectares. Thus, the total area lost for potential
fish production will eventualy be in the range of 83 hectares. With an estimated fish production of
average 150 kg/ha (WORLD BANK, 1991)* the total loss of openwater capture fisheries due to the
project is calculated as 12.45 metric tons/year, with a local commercial value of approximately 500.000
BDT.
Increased Fishing Effort
In regulated floodplains there is a complex relationship between catch, the degree of flood reduction, fish
densities and- the amount of fishing effort. FAP-17 studies undertaken in the NW Region showed that
under fill flood control the annual catch per unit area (CPIJA) was reduced by 81%;'under controlled
flooding for deepwnater rice catches increased in two projects due to higher fishing effort, while they
decreased in a third project by 37%. Under partial flood control CPUA values were sirmilar inside and
outside three projects but were reduced in a fourth by 20%/o because of restricted entry of fish (ODA,
1995). The greatest reduction in catch from regulated canals was observed during this Study in the full
flood control project (BRE) in which the catch was 70% lower than  at from an unregulated canal.
Increased captzre at culverts
In the Project Area there exist vast examples where canals, ioad culverts and cuts in embankments were
deliberately used to prevent or hinder the passage of fish and facilitate their capture. These locations
provide the opportunity for the establishnent of active fishing techniques (ift nets) and passive gear (fish
fences, rows of barnboo traps). The result is to block almost entirely the fish on their attempts to migate
through these passages and to allow in a relatively short tire the capture of a large amount of fish. The
NHBNR with its design of 85 culverts will undoubtedly be used for this kind of intensive fishing unless
regulatory measures by the Fisheries Authorities are taken. It is not known at present what effect such
increased fishing pressure has on the long-term sustainability of fish stocks.
*) Comparative figures are also provided by FAP-17 Study conducted in 1993:
The results from unregulated floodplains, beel and canals outside eight flood control projects in four areas in the
NW Regions showed that the annual fish yield or catch per unit area from tius lost habitat varied geographically
between regions and between different land heights. The yields given here refer to land heights within the flood
phase series F2-F4 and ranged from 68 kg/ha to 202 kg/ha.

Possible Impacts on People Depending on Fisheries
There are several dozens of households, particularly small and landless fanners interviewed during the
field survey, whose income and livelihood depend largely on capture fisheries (see Baseline Survey
Report). The adverse irnpacts by the NHBNR project will affect subsistence, seasonal and professional
fishermnen likewise in the following ways:
* Whenever the high road embankment would effectively reduce the magnitude, extent and duration of
flooding a decrease in fish production would be expected. Consequently, those depending on fish catch
in that area will lose income, a cheap source of animal protein and employment opportunities.
* In areas which may newly be developed into deepwater aman cultivation plots adjacent to NHBNR
professional fishermen may lose income through a reduction in the extent of public water bodies which
they traditionally fished and through increased competition from agncultural communities.
* On the other hand, with the creation of new, deepwater amcn  cultivation plots adjacent to NHBNR,
both subsistence and seasonal fishernen can gain through increased fishing opportunity as long as they
have access to waters.
* Where ponding occurs alongside the embankment, fishenTLen may make short-term gains through
increased catches in these locations where fish will concerntrate. In the longer-term, however, these
practices may be detrimental to the sustainability of fishenes.
4.4.3 Construction and Traffic Hazards
Road construction implies the use of heavy machinery and thLe handling of hazardous materials. The
material transport system (by land and by river) designed with this project, too, bears a number of
hazards that need to be taken into account.
As for the entire project it is estimated that 6 million m3 of material is to hauled, the traffic intensity
on existing and temporary roads will increase considerably. All these activities bear certain accident
risks for both the construction workers as well as passers-by and casual observers. Construction
works also attract a crowd of spectators which for one or other reason want to be as close as
possible to the working equipment without knowing the potential hazards. Especially curious
children are at risk in the vicinity of the construction works and borrowpits. Children do not perceive
risks and will, for instance, try to climb on construction equipment or run after vehicles.
As a part of the haul roads will be temporary, the surface quality will not be like in existing roads.
Thus, these temporary roads will be less safe than existing roads. Contractors sometime deny the
normally required safety standards for site equipment as it is only used outside public roads (no
lights and/or insufficient brakes on graders, trucks, front end loaders, etc.).
After the opening of the road to traffic, high speed circulation will undoubtedly occur. People living
within the vicinity of the new road are not used to these high speed and especially during the first
month after the opening of the road the they will misjudge the speed of the vehicles and wrongly
react on fast moving traffic.

4.4.4 Air Pollution
During construction phase, air quality may be locally affe:cted at roadside locations near construction
campsites and during pavement works. Main air pollutants will be CO, HC, NO,, S02, lead
compounds and dust will be expected, resulting from earthworks, heavy vehicle movements, dippers.
supply transport etc. Depending on the technical production of asphalt and the quality of crude oil
for bitumen processing, toxic heat emissions (SO2) and black soothe are anticipated during this
work stage.
Air pollution and emissions will be unevenly distributed along the road alignment due to the wind
blowing predominantly with 1-2 Bft from NNW direction'. Thus, linear areas South of the CL or-the
respective construction sites will be generally more affected than those located North to the source of
emission. Campsite selection, particularly for positioning the asphalt plants, will have to take the
impact zone of the emission plumes into due account.
Permanent air pollution will be inevitably occur at various levels after completion of the road.
Exhaust emissions from heavy and light duty vehicles will, be the principal mix of agents (CO2, NO,,
HC, CO, SO2 and Pb). Both the nature and magnitude, as well as seasonal and local variations of
air pollution will depend on the overall traffic development which is analysed in the respective
reports.
4.4.5 Noise Pollution
Inevitably, noise pollution during construction works (e.g. excavations, pilings; transportation,
various machinery) will affect relative few people who live within 100 or less meter from the
respective construction site. With exception of two schools, no specific infrastructures like hospitals
and hat-bazaars are likely to be affected by acoustic problems during and after the construction of
the road.
Noise pollution will occur due to heavy traffic when NHBNR is completed. However, the
intemationally accepted maximum noise level of 50 dEtA as average day-night level, cannot be
applied to Bangladesh. Because of the conditions of the vehicles, sound level of horns and the
frequency of its use by the drivers of different vehicles Bangladesh is considering to set the average
standard sound level to 55 dBA for residential area, 65 dBA for commercial area and 75 dB for
industrial area (DOE, 1991).
In spite of the high noise level people apparently have no great discomfort to live near the highway
margins where many small shops and stalls are aligned. Notably sensitive areas like schools and
hospitals are also situated in relative close distance to existing highways. It needs to be stated that
ambient noise perception as such is seemingly less problematic than it would be expected in other
countries.

4.4.6 Health and Sanitation Hazards
Major health and sanitation concerns relate to the influx of labour force during construction and the
facilities and waste disposal performance in the respective campsites. Although not quantifiable the
following potential impacts may be considered:
Hazards Resultingfrom the Lack of Excreta Disposal System
Good sanitarv facilities, such as an excreta disposal system, is essential for better health of a
community, especially at labour camps. At the Jaamuna Multipurpose Bridge construction site it is
essential that a good excreta disposal system is provided. The latrines provided with water seals
should be connected to a treatment plant or septic tank with sufficient capacity to store the solids for
two to three years. Care should be taken, that the effluent from the septic tank is not discharged into
open drains but is treated by subsurface infiltration through absorption trenches or soak pits without
contaminating ground water.
Hazards Resultingfrom the Lack of Drainage System of l;astewater
Lack of proper drainage system is likely to cause accumulation of sludge water creating breeding
ground for mosquito and water borne diseases. Wastewater from washing. bathing. kitchen etc. can
be treated separately from excreta by infiltration in the sub-soil or direct discharge into the flowing
water via storm water drainage.
Hazards Resultingfrom the Contamination of Drinking WKater
Deterioration of community health is compounded by contaminated drinking water. In construction
site without proper sanitation the possibility of contamination of drinking water is very high.
Drinking water should meet the WHO guideline values (1984) or proposed Bangladesh Standards
(DOE, 1991). Special attention should be paid to the bacterial water quality. Deep tube-well water
can be used with post treatment. Depending on the mangEmese and iron concentrations in ground
water, removal of iron and manganese may be required.
Risk of Waterborne Vector Diseases and Spread of Communicable Diseases
The excavation of borrowpits may also create breeding grounds for mosquito and water-borne
diseases if no proper precautions are made. Besides, if not adequately rehabilitated (e.g. levelled for
paddy culture or re-shaped into a fishpond) this plot will be lost for economic production. Threat of
communicable diseases among the labour force is very much likely. Regular health inspection and
vaccination program will control spreading of any communicable diseases.
4.4.7 Social Life Disruption
In the four contract labour camps will be constructed with temporary accommodation for estimated
500 workers during the peak of construction activities. Social disturbances and conflicts are possible
between the local communities and the influences attributed to the large number of labour forces that
will enter the Project Area. The project will also, inadvertedly, attract landless who sill seek
temporary employment and will settle in squatters near the campsites.
Major health and sanitation concerns are to be taken unto due account for both the communities
residing next to the aligrunent and the labour camps. Such concerns relate to:

* Problems compounded with the actual lack of a proper excreta disposal system (effluents and
discharges of untreated excreta into open drains and subsequent contamination of groundwater):
* Accumulation from wastewater from washing (detergents), bathing and kitchen offal;
* Uncontrolled disposal of garbage may create additional nuisance and health threats;
* transmission of communicable diseases among the labour force
Inevitably the concentration of both resident and non-resident labour will bring social conflicts and
cultural clashes. To name but a few, problems commonly associated with the establishment of
construction carnpsites within or adjacent to traditional rural village communities may be
* Violence
* Job ,,snatching"
* Theft in campsites
* Theft in homestead gardens
* Poaching in fishponds

5.   Environmental Design Aspects and Mitigation Measures
As outlined in the previous chapter, the project has the potential of various impacts on the
enviromnent, both temporary and pernanent in nature. The following identifies suitable mitigaton
measures with respect to road design to avoid and/or minirnise these impacts and/or to enhance the
positive impacts for the bettennent of both the bio-physical environment and the conmnunities living
with and nearby the new road.
5.1   Environmental Criteria for Optimising the Road Alignment and Final Selection
The Initial Alignment as defined in the Feasibility Study (CIECC, 1993) was projected at
recognisable points in the field from aerial photographs using permanent structures like buildings,
paved roads, etc.. With this method, however, a fair number of villages are bisected or at least
severely affected, not to speak of other areas which are sensitive in ecological and cultural aspects.
5.1.1 Alignment Considerations Relating to the Bio-phlysical Environment
Above all, the alignment should match the particular hydrological conditions governing the
floodplain. The alignmnent should also take all biological and ecological assets into account as long
as they represent valuable habitats and spots of relative high biodiversity. The Baseline
Environmental Survey yielded as one result the classification of characteristic terrestrial and aquatic
habitats. Taken from this observations, superimposed on an approximately 100 m corridor along the
CL, the project is likely to affect different groups of biota with different intensities. The diagram
(Fig. 4.3.1.1) gives an approximate estimate of the magnitude of interference with local biota when
certain habitats will be affected.
5.1.2 Alignment Considerations Relating to the Human Environment
Road alignment was designed in such a way that no cultural heritage will be disturbed/destroyed.
This was equally observed while selecting provisional sites for borrowpits.
Besides, the project does not affect scenic qualities or other aesthetic elements and architectural
structures. The general conclusion is that the cultural continuity in the Project Area remains
unaffected.
In order to avoid the set of social, psychological and economic impacts associated with involuntary
displacement and resettlement, it is foremost intended to keep the number of homesteads affected by
the CL and the ROW as low as possible.
Constraints for identifying a minimum risk and impact road corridor appear essentially in those
zones with a high population density. As the area crossed by the new road is prevailingly of
agricultural nature, and the CL was selected to the maximum possible to by-pass human settlements,
the entire project requires apparently limited displacement of population. Likewise, the destruction of
valuable habitats will be small in comparison to the area of paddy fields taken up by the road
corridor. The following diagram summarises the estimated percentage of both natural and human
systems that are likely to be affected by NHBNR.

5.1.3  Final Route Alignment Selection Process
The exercise of defining the final route alignment as presented to the Client is based on both
empirical and analytical steps, illustrated in Fig.5. 1.3.1. The rationale of the final alignment choice
was to minimise any impact risk and loss of assets in bolh the short term and long-term range, be it
during the construction phase or when the road will be in operation. Care was also taken to keep the
costs of necessary preventive and mitigative measures low while making the choice for positioning
the CL in situ. The CL selection process combines the classification and weighing of all parameters
outlined hereunder:
Selection Criteria Relating to Technical Considerations
* Standard design criteria for engineering (e.g. curves, bridges, interceptions)
* Sufficient free sight distances
* Geometric design: Obtaining a straight alignment between chainages to the extent possible
* Hydraulic design and dimensioning of bridges and culverts
* Distance between construction site and borrowpits
* Speed reducing elements like curves where villages are approached (if required)
* Siting of supplementary structures in relation to construction work site (access roads,
campsites, equipment storage, workshops).

CL Selection Criteria Relating to the Bio-physical Environment
* minimising impacts or avoiding removal) of valuable vegetation (e.g. refuge forests, large
Banjan trees, Flame of India, Mango etc.)
* avoidance of ROW bypassing or cutting of ecologically sensitive smaller habitats (e.g. beels,
mixed vegetation stands near graveyards and embankments, fish fry wintering sites, waterbird
colony breeding sites, important stopover sites on migratory bird's flyways)
* avoidance of sites where water run-off scours are present (e.g. gullies, regressive erosion
marks at highlands, eroded river banks)
* avoidance of close vicinity to sluice gates on polder embankments
* avoidance of newly planted Sissoo tree plantations
CL Selection Criteria Relating to the Human Environment
* minimising the number of homesteads to be relocated
* mininimising loss of valuable agricultural land
mininising loss of existing rural small-scale enterprises (e.g. pottery industries, aquaculture)
* minumising impacts on existing rural infrastructure, e.g. rural roads, administrative buildings,
schools, health centres
• minimising impacts on valuable agricultural land
* keeping a miniimum distance of 100 m between CL and schools and madrashes
keeping a minimum distance of 200 m between CL and health centres
* usage, when applicable, of existing embankments or roads for alignrment
* keeping minimum distance of 150 m between ROW and local bazaars and hats
* avoidance to bisect villages (accident risks, disturbance of community bonds and contacts)
by fixing, whenever possible, the CL at the village margin
* if possible, positioning of CL passing a village at leeward side of main wind direction
* avoidance of cultural heritage sites (e.g. temples, mosques, graveyards, tombs)
* avoidance of interference with sites of extraordinary landscape aesthetics

5.2     Safety Designs and Measures in NHBNR
5.2.1    Measures to Reduce Accident Risks During Construction
The construction works require adequate safety measures against accidents. The workers may have
to handle materials hazardous to health. Proper precautionary measures must be adopted in such
cases in accordance with safety regulations. Plying of vehicles on unmetalled road will also increase
local deposit of sand, dirt and dust. Rains will create slippery road surfaces. A large part of the
construction haulage will be done over temporary roads. To avoid accidents during construction
these roads are solely to be used by construction traffic. Other traffic is to be barred from these
roads. Diversion roads are to be maintained in good condition to avoid-accidents due to poor road
surface. It is the Engineer's responsibility to assure that brakes and other safety devices of vehicles
and equipment are in good working condition. Vehicles and equipment used outside the project and
in particular on public roads are to comply with the normal roadworthiness items like lights,
indicators, brakes etc. Crossing with public and site roads are to be indicated clearly for construction
traffic as well as normal road traffic.
5.2.2    Measures to Reduce Accident Risks During Operation
The design of the road including roadmarking, roadsign, curves, lane separation, etc. will be
scrutinised by the Client on actual road safety. Precautions to reduce risks at dangerous points like
major road crossings (Hatikamrul and Bonpara) will be taken up in the design.
A major measure to reduce accidents is the design of a slow traffic lane (see Fig. 5.2.1) With a
secondary lane slow and fast moving traffic is separated. As such the speed difference between
different road users on the same lane is far less and fewer accidents are most likely.

Adequate measures will be taken to avoid mixing of slow aLnd fast moving traffic at junctions and
intersections. In case the contour of the road changes, for example from embankment to bridge, two-
tone painted pillars will be placed to indicate the changes. 'These pillars also serve as guard posts.
Sign boards are to be erected to indicate dangerous spots or possible occurrences which might
endanger traffic (junctions, schools, etc.).
Wide roads tempt users to higher speeds than narrow roads. As the pavement width of the NHBNR
will be 7.3 m, high speeds up to 80 to 100 km/hr can be expected. Also, as in the design the slow
traffic has his own lane, the speed of vehicles will be higher than on roads which also accommodate
slow traffic. Speeds over 50 km/hr are too high for built-up areas and are to be reduced. Only
placing a signboard to indicate a maximum speed will not be adequate. A driver feels that a speed
reduction from 90 to 70 km/hr is significant, but this speed is still to high in built-up areas.
Therefore, artificially speed reduction elements are included in the design. Speed bumps are an
option, but in the Consultant's opinion only as final option. lTo reduce speed in housing areas, curves
are designed in such a way that speed will be reduced to a more acceptable level.
5.2.3    Curves, Junctions, Busstops
For safe traffic sufficient visibility is required. Therefore no, trees will be planted close to junctions
and in the inner sides of curves. In curves super elevation will be constructed to maintain the
required safety. At the two major junctions (Hatikamrul and Bonpara) roundabouts are projected as
additional safety measure. All other junctions with existing rural roads will be made with
perpendicular crossings according to the typical design for junctions (see Fig. 5.2.2). Busstops will
be made to separate parked busses from the moving traffic. AUl major villages or connecting roads to
major villages will be provided with busstops. The actual busstop will be separated from the main
road by large kerbs.
5.3    Sensitive Areas that should be Protected fromn Borrow Activities
Generally, all wetlands in Bangladesh have been recognised as extremely endangered by various
adverse impacts, partly due to natural catastrophes (e.g. storms, flooding, high sedimentation,
drought), but mainly due to man-made interventions (e.g. land reclamation for agriculture,
settlement, and overexploitation of certain species). As the NHBNR will also bisect the lowland
depression between Padma and Jamuna rivers it will, to some degree, inevitably take its part in being
responsible for the overall decline and/or deterioration of Bangladesh wetlands.
5.3.1 Environmental Criteria
Next to the selection of an enviromnentally acceptable corridor for the route alignment the
Consultant paid special attention to selecting suitable sites for both sand and clay borrowpits. Both
structures will be substantial in size as the new road construction requires some 4 mio m3 of sand fill
and another 1 mio m3 for clay cladding.
Basically the selection process for borrowpits was undertak:en with a similar approach as specified
earlier for selection of road aligmnent (see previous sections and Fig. 5.1.3.1). The assessment was
based, above all, on a comprehensive soils and land survey to identify all potential localities where in
relative close distance to the future construction sites the required material would be found in
sufficient quantity and quality. The rationale for selecting borrowpit sites was primarily that the
project should contribute in the national efforts to avoid destruction and maintain the intactness of
sensitive habitats. The identification of the parameters which would attribute to ecologically and
socio-culturally sensitive are derived from the comprehensive baseline survey carried out under this
assigmnent (see Report).

Taking these objectives into consideration, guidelines to select sites versus protecting specific sites
from borrow activities were as follows:
>     avoid habitats known to be homestead for rare and/or endangered species
>     avoid habitats with refuge forests and homestead gardens
>    avoid habitats with large and/or rare trees (]Banjan trees, Flame of India, Mango)
>     avoid habitats/landscapes which have scenic value
>     avoid areas which would be functional transient areas between ecologically
sensitive smaller habitats (e.g. beels, mixed vegetation stands near graveyards
and embanlanents, fish fry wintering sites, waterbird colony breeding sites,
important stopover sites on migratory bird's flyways)
>     avoid areas which locate cultural assets (e.g. mosques, prayer fields, temples)
>     avoid graveyard sites
>     avoid sites which are in close vicinity to densely populated settlements (mainly
applicable for sand borrowpits)
>     if possible, positioning of the borrowpit site at leeward side of main wind
direction in relation to adjacent village
v     avoid areas of newly planted Sissoo tree plantations
>     avoid areas where water run-off scours are present (e.g. gullies, regressive
erosion marks at highlands, eroded river banks)
0    avoid  or minimise  the  relocation  of small-scale  enterprises  and  rural
infrastructures, including rural roads
>     Siting of supplementary structures in r elation to construction work  site
(accessory roads, campsites, equipment storage, workshops).
>     avoid sites of close vicinity to sluice gates on polder embankments
>     avoid sites of close vicinity to schools and health posts
5.3.2 Selection of Borrowpit Sites
The following maps (figs. 5.3.1 to 5.3.3) illustrate the result of the fact finding and selecting process,
i.e. the location which would combine to the maximum extent the above technical and environmental
criteria. The maps only show the sites identified for sand excavation. Each of these borrowpits will
be about 3 to 4 ha in area, excavated to depth between 3 and 7 m.
As for the sites for clay borrowpits".survey maps have been made which also refer to the suitability
of these sites for becoming transformed after completion into fish farms (see Chapter 7.4). It is
assumed that in the entire NHBNR project this option is given preference over the conventional
method of having narrow borrowpits all or most along the roadside. Not only would this result in
substantial more land acquisition (estimated 550 ha, see Embankment Report) but also have
inevitably more environmental impacts.
' about 40 in number, each of rectangular size and 11 to 1.5 hectare in area, to be excavated to the
required depth of 1.5 to 2.5 m.

5.4    Control of Air Pollution
With respect to noise and air pollution the final alignment has been selected in a manner to avoid
human habitat vicinity as far as possible for affecting less by air and noise pollution both during and
after the construction. While during the Feasibilitv Study the selected route still passed at close
vicinity or even bisecting villages, the new final alignment tried to minimise this long-term effect.
Nonetheless, short term impacts during construction phase, particularly in the close vicinitv of
borrowpits and construction campsites wvill be unavoidable.
During construction phase, special preventive measures will be included
* to contain the air pollution through dust emission created by asphalt plants. This can be achieved
by collecting dust by using cloth filters, cyclones etc.
* to control soil dust (particularly during the dry season) by spraying water wherever applicable
and necessary
* to airclean equipment in the night and use covering whenever applicable.
Motor vehicle emissions from heavy traffic will be the rnajor source of air pollution after completion
of the road. By designing the road with a fast and a slow traffic lane separated, a more constant
traffic flow is maintained which will considerable reduce the relative air pollution. Speed limits are
also incorporated in the design to avoid, among others, excessive emissions of NO. gases.
Unless the use of lead free fuels and a higher standard of exhaust emissions are introduced by the
GoB air pollution impacts will inevitably remain high due to reduced traffic speed and possible
traffic congestion at busstop locations and junctions. Mitigation of these impacts, however, are
beyond the control and scope of this project.
5.5    Control of Noise Pollution
Since the sound level around the construction site is expected to exceed the limit of noise standard
levels, measures have to be taken during the construction phase. However, the effect of these
measures on the project costs and the planning schedule will be an important consideration as to
whether or not apply these noise reduction measures. For example, sound from a power generation
plant can be reduced to an acceptable Level without excessive cost by installing the generators inside
a sound proof building. Many noisy transport equipment can be furnished with adequate silencer
boxes. Construction materials should be handled during daytime and not in the night. On the other
hand, although dredging piling works or crushing operatlons may be confined to daytime, it will be
virtually impossible to meet the required schedule. Moreover, the unit price of per cubic meter
dredged sand will increase considerably if continuous dredLging is restricted.
Special consideration will be given to protect workers from harmful and long exposure to noise
originating from construction machinery. The wearing of ear muffs for compressor and crushing
operators is obligatory.
The road design includes large-scale plantation of the embankment with trees and bushed. Such
natural barriers will reduce to a certain extent the lateraal transmission of noise which affects the
nearby settlements. Signboards will be established to prohibit the use of horns and to limit speed. It
is beyond the control of this project, however, to predict the effectiveness of these measures.

5.6.      Environmental Measures Relating to Construction
5.6.1     Safe Deposit of Construction Material and 'Wastes
During construction phase of the road, soils of different: consistence, asphalt, fuels, hazardous
chemicals and general waste matters have to be handled and deposited safely. Site selection for
establishing the campsites and adjacent stackyards will basically followv the environrmental criteria
that have been set up for selecting sites for borrowpits. Organised storage and handling and strict
monitoring can reduce the chance of accidental spillage of the above mentioned contaminants.
If necessary, waste deposit sites have specially construction elements (e.g. sealed and covered
containers) to avoid seepage of hazardous liquids into surrounding surface and groundwater.
Garbage, rubbish, construction wastes, etc. (solid wastes) may pose additional health threat and
nuisance. Propagation of rats and breeding of flies may occur if the waste disposal site is not covered
properly. Waste dumps have to be fenced and guarded against public interference, particularly from
children roaming through hazardous material. Guarded stackyards will be required where handling
and depositing of these materials will be mainly confined. The construction management will need to
take necessary precautions and ensure the effectiveness of an environmentally appropriate waste
collecting and deposing system.
5.6.2     Rehabilitating Campsites after Completion
The contractors will require several sites to accommodaLte their equipment, offices and camps.
Additional sites will be established to accommodate the Engineers. These sites will be of temporary
use during construction period. The remaining of the campsites after construction are to be removed
and the site is to be left behind in it's original condition as before the construction works, or in such
a state that all negative effects of it's use are rehabikitated. The condition of the campsite after
construction is one of the factors for reimbursement of retention money.
As discussed in Chapter 4, the sites for equipment like asphalt plants, concrete mixers, workshops
bear various risks for environmental hazards, such as pollution of the soil, ground water and air.
Although it will practically be impossible to avoid completely pollution events during the
construction activities, the project has to make all efforts to minimise them. The main measure taken
into account is to prescribe in the Contract Documents technically and environmentally sound
procedures which follow the regulations and standards.
Special care will be taken to minimise the uncontrolled disposal of both solid and liquid waste
material. Disposal procedures will be elaborated in the Contract Documents according to the nature
and toxicity of waste materials.
5.6.3 Rehabilitation of Borrowpits
Sand Borrowpits
The project will create (five to seven) large waterbodies as result of the excavation of sand
borrowpits. These borrowpits will become permanent lakes (dighis) due to their depth and
dimension. The shape and depth of these structures will be defined by plot borders, sand layer depth,
etc. The lakes are to be rehabilitated after construction while taking both environmental, landscaping
irrigation and fisheries aspects into account (see Chapter 7).

DHV Consultants BV
Depending on the grading and composition of the sand, the natural slope will be reasonable flat. For
example, fine sand with a 20 % mica content will give a natural slope of 1:7. In cases where the
slope will be to steep, additional levelling of the slope is foreseen. The rationale of having rather flat
slopes is to establish various belts of (depth-depending) wetland vegetation at the periphery of these
artificial lakes to facilitate fish spawning and shelter. After establishment of a biological equilibrium (3-
4 years) and proper fish stocking and management, it is expected that these newly created lakes will
enhance the local fish production. In addition, they will add toD the landscape aesthetics.
Clay Borrowpits
Few dozens of clay borrow pits will be created due to excavation for the cladding of the slopes. For
this cladding also the topsoil from the clearing and grubbing will be used. Suitable for cladding will
also be a part of the overburden from the sand borrowpits. However, this material will not be
sufficient and/or too expensive to transport to the required location. Therefore, additional borrow
material is to be acquired.
The project envisages an innovative approach in linking the rehabilitation of these borrowpits with
the crucial need to find adequate land and income generating facilities for the PAP's. The
Environmental Management Plan foresees the modification of these clay borrowpits into fishponds
with adjacent resettlement plots. Further details referring to design and management considerations
are given in Chapter 7 and Annex C.
5.7     Mitigation of Social Tensions
Much of the social work dealing with human interference and potential social conflicts between local
communities, foreign labour and undesired external influrnces associated with modemr construction
sites is to be addressed by the NGO working in the area to implement the RAP (see also Chapter 9).
The key to reduce social tensions and disturbances lies in communication between the project and the
affected communities. Regular village meetings between representatives of the communities, PAPs
and the construction personnel, as well as public awareness campaigns in the area should mitigate
possible social disruption which is anticipated from the large labour force employed in the project.
These labour group will come mostly from outside the project area with better econoniic condition
and may disrupt the local economy and social order. Social tension may be reduced through better
planning and setting up markets, mosques, etc. around the campsites.
It remains to further decision whether a part of the campsites will be used by the maintenance
personnel and rest of the facilities will be dismantled. The respective conditions will be settled in the
Contractor Documents.

6.      Management of Water Resources, Flooding and Navigation
6.1     Provision of Stable and Safe Drinking Water Supiply
Local drinking water resources, mainly drawn from groundwater by tube-wells, need to be
safeguarded. The project aims to minimise to the extent possible impacts (loss, removal,
disturbances, disruptures) of all kind of rural infrastructures that are important for safe drinking
water supply. To avoid excessive groundwater drawdown thie tube-well capacities in each location
(chainage) will separately calculated and adjusted to the actual requirements, also taking temporary
additional water supply for construction campsites into account. For drinking water supply, no
surface water from ponds, ditches and borrowpits are to be used.
Care is to be taken, via the Contractor's obligations specified in the contracts, to remove and
newly establish adequate deep-well pumps. The Contractor will be requested to submit an advance
planning as to location and number of deep-well pumps he will install prior to setting up
campsites and starting construction. This plan is to be scrutinised by the supervising agency to
warrant within a corridor of at least 100 m from the ROW safe and sufficient drinking water
supply for the both the villages adjacent to the road and the anticipated number of external labour
forces. The presence of coliforn bacteria in tube-well water identified in quality tests conducted
in 1993 by CIEC is attributed to contamination at the well head. It therefore requires special
attention to construct, protect and maintain the well-head a[rea. Shallow tube wells are sunk into
the sand aquifer at 30 m or more depth, so direct surface infiltration of contaminated water
should not be a cause of the problem.
The Contractors is to take suitable measures to avoid excessive drawdown of groundwater in areas
where deep drainage is required (e.g. while constructing bridges and culverts).
6.2     Control of Erosion, Siltation and Scour
Rivers of the deltaic region flowing through alluvial soil generally cause erosion of river beds and
scour of bed. If the river banks are formned of clay, little scour is anticipated. The soil in the project
area is mainly composed of clayey material. The river becls show deposits of medium fine sand
and silts. From the river bed deposits characteristics, the Atrai River may be classed as a quasi-
alluvial river. The Nimaicharai Khal shows deposits of course sand and the Kaladuha River
showed deposits of fine sand and silts. This makes both also quasi-alluvial rivers. The alluvium
deposits in the river beds is carried away by the floods during monsoon and deposited again and
the end of the monsoon season. The Mora Boral River is cut-off from its original source and acts
now only as a local drainage system. This made the river bed silted up and made the Mora Boral
loose its conveyance capacity.
Loose soil particles are carried away by the surface run-off waters to nearby rivers or canals. Run-
off waters often cause erosion in roads, embankments and slopes. This type of erosion is also to be
expected in the Project Area. Erosion and scours in watenvays are generally expected during the
falling and the rising of the water levels. With the on-rush of flood flows, the river bed is scoured
and the material is carried downstream till the water velocity is reduced to such a speed that the
water cannot carry the soil particles anymore. During these floods the thalweg of the rivers may
undergo changes. If a high current happens to impinge on a river banks, bank erosion may occur.
This phenomenon makes river meander. The Atrai River is a meandering river and causes bank
erosion of comparative lesser magnitude.

Design Considerations
For the design of bridges piers and abutments due consideration has been given for handling bed
scour and bank erosion. Calculation of scour has been done by various methods and several
measures will be taken to combat the scour and erosion.
Elevated water velocity during peak discharges will occur in the "Green River" at Nimaicharai khal
Bridge and the Hamkuria Bridge. Also the Harinchara khal has an elevated water velocity during
peak discharge. In these localities additional slope protection is foreseen with matting and
interlocking concrete blocks (see Embankment Design). Notwithstanding, erosion of the embankment
needs to be observed and is therefore included in the monitoring plan.
Due to the construction of an embankment perpendicular on the drain-off direction of the project
area, change in waterflow will occur. Despite the fact that numerous bridges and culverts are
projected, changes in flow pattern will occur. In some places this will lead to increased water
velocity which may result in erosion. Especially sandy soil is prone to erosion. The soil investigation
of the alignment learned that sandy/silty soil which may be sensitive to erosion only occurs at Ch.
9+500 to Ch.l 1+000. However, if the no excessive flooding occurs, i.o,w. the regulators at the
Kaludaha are functioning, water velocity will be within acceptable limits. In all other areas where
elevated water velocity may occur, the existing soil is clay and erosion will be minimal. (see
Hydrological Study). Elevated water velocity during peak discharges will occur in the "Green
River" at Nimaicharai Khal Bridge and the Hamkuria Bridge. Also the Harinchara Khal has an
elevated water velocity during peak discharge. Erosion control of the embankment needs attention at
the above mentioned places. Here additional slope protection is foreseen with matting and
interlocking concrete blocks (see Embankment Design).
Scour Depth in River Beds
Scour depths for all the bridges where velocity of flow is significant, have been computed by Lacey
& IRC method and also by the following the calculations; made by the Hydraulic Modelling Study.

Erosion Protection
Once the route choice was done and topographic survey of the road corridor completed, fixation of
design flood level was taken up. A two way approach was adopted for this. Analysis of annual high
flood level of nearby water level stations was done first and levels at the road crossing points of the
channels established from slope and distance. These resullts were then compared with the level
established from Surface Water Model. The output from the surface water model was considered
more acceptable and adopted for road design.
To determine the design water level or discharge for any stnrcture data are required for an adequate
length of time, otherwise, large error of estimate in extrapolating statistical parameters might be
introduced in computations. For the road embankment 25 year return period flood levels are required
and for the drainage structures 50 yr flood levels are required. No water level or discharge
measurements are available near the future area of NHBNR for a period long enough to predict a
flood of such magnitude with confidence. For this reason, the one dimensional model*) was used to
generate water levels and discharge for a period of last 30 years.

*) Hymos, a hydrological data management and processing package developed by Delft Hydraulics has
been used for flood frequency analysis for the present study. The package uses five probability
distributions viz. Normal distribution, Log-Normal distribution, Gamma distribution, Gumbel
distribution and Log- Pearson type III distribution. Of all these distributions the Log-Normal
distribution gave the best fit and has been considered as appropriate for statistical analysis of annual
maximum water level and discharge in the area.
From frequency analysis, water levels for 5. 10 and 25 years return period have been computed These
levels have been compared with annual peak water levels frcm 1965 to 1995. At all locations the water
levels of 1991, 1974 and 1987 correspond flood events of 5, 10 and 25 year return period respectively
with an error of 0 to 13 cm. Model runs were executed for these three years to. simulate flood
scenarios of design return period. Table ### shows the simulated annual peak water levels and water
levels computed for various return periods. A complete list of structures and their recommended
design parameters have been presented in the Bridge and Culvert Design Report.

Design Criteria taken into Account as Result of the Hydraulic Modelling Study
The Hydraulic Modelling Study undertook detailed investigations of the with and without project
scenario under various hydrologic and hydraulic conditions in the study area. A one dimensional and
two dimensional model has been employed. The study was supported by using Geographical
Information System (GIS) to determine the impact of the proposed project in terms of depth and
extent of inundation. While analysing the potential impact of the intervention by the road project in
an area of highly complex flood and flow conditions, the Study came to design recommendations for
culverts, bridges and the road embankments which have been fully incorporated in the technical
design of NHBNR, referring to
>     number, location and opening of various structures;
>     design discharge, velocity, scour depth and water levels for the culverts and bridges;
>     design peak water levels and wave run-up for the road embankment.
The Study pointed out that structures along the proposed road between Hatikamrul and the proposed
Kaludaha bridge will be threatened if the Kaludaha offtake fails (opening due to natural or human
interference) The situation will be more critical if aL Jamuna River breakthrough occurs at
Mathurapara to Bangali river. Technical solutions to protect the structures are ruled out under the
budget and scope of this project. A causeway of 500 m reduces the impact on the bridge (velocity
reduced from 2.1 to 1.2 mls) but will force around 500 cumecs to flow overland and thus will cause
extensive damages to crops and infrastructures. The solution to the problem is to close the Kaludaha
offtake by permanent structural measures.
The velocity at the Nimaichari bridge was found high (2.7 m/s) in simulation # 1 which might be
critical in terms of scouring and erosion at this location. H-ere, the floodplain depression drains large
flow volumes in the monsoon. Therefore, an additional bridge is proposed over the Hamkuria
depression between Nimaichari and Atrai rivers to alleviate this imminent problem and to reduce the
flow volume through the Nimacharai khal. The Haikuria Bridge, together with bridges on
Chakroyhali khal and the Khalkola depression, will assist to reduce the anticipated impact of flood
waters on the Nimaichari Bridge, reducing the flow velocily there to an acceptable 1.27 mI/s.
6.3    Design Provisions to Mitigate Flooding Events and Drainage Congestion
With reference to MPO/WARPO land classification the road alignment falls within the following
land categories:
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... .....W.,;..........

The road embankment height was fixed according to these flood elevation data. Seven kilometre of
the road falls in the very deeply flooded area where road embankment height has to be
correspondingly higher. It appears that 30 km of road falls in the F3 land category by flood phase of
20 years recurrence interval. It means that the said category to land goes under water ranging 1.80 m
to 3.60 m during the flood of the magnitude of 20 year return period.
Technical safety and mitigation measures to prevent floodi.ng impacts:
The first four kilometres of the road lie within the influence of the Jarnuna River spills. Due to
breaches in the right Embankment flood flows hit this portion of the road, as a result the culverts are
damaged. The west bank of the Brahmaputra is continually rnoving towards the west. It is now only
a few hundred meter away from the Bangali River flowing parallel to it. In the event the Jamuna
contacts the Bangali, its flow w"ill increase tremendously and a substantial amount of flow will go
into the Kaludaha River and its basin. To mnitigate to the extent possible the expected flooding
impact - and to give a reasonable protection to the newly created highway - to include the
reconstruction of the dilapidated regulator at Bhuyagati to maintain a regular and controllable flow
at its offitake at Kaludaha River is a must.
Siltation will occur in some places but it will be to a limited extend as envisaged in the Hydrological
Modeling Survey.
Bridges
After thorough investigation and surveys of the road alignment, bridges required to be built along the
road are shown in Table 4.3.2. It may be mentioned that though initially it was envisaged that four
bridges will be built on four waterways, notably: Kaludaha, Nimaichari, Atrai and Mora Boral, but
subsequent field verification and hydraulic survey confirmed that bridges are to be constructed at
additional points, details of which are shown in Table 6.3.1.
Water way openings or length of bridges have been computed from various considerations viz. from
Lacey's regime equation based on design discharge and also by application of a Hydraulic Model.
The results obtained by the methods were close enough. Tle application of model established that
there will be substantial flow through the Hamlkuria depression with quite high velocity. As such a
150m bridge is recommended for that location.
The breakthrough condition (Jamuna breaks through into Karatoa [Bengali] River) will create a
havoc situation in the Kaludaha and its basin. As such regullator on the offtake point of Kaludaha is
a must. Bridge openings on Nimaicharai, Hamkuria and Atrai were defined at 150 m each. Mora
Baral does not receive any upland flow. As such, its present flow is very low. Bridge opening has
been recommended as 30 meter. A complete list of bridge and culverts locations and design
parameter is provided in Table 6.3.1.

Culverts
In addition to the bridges recommended for the road, culverts of adequate numbers are required to be
provided for proper drainage. The issues at stake were studied form different angles. The results
obtained from the Surface Water Modelling Study is considered more realistic and acceptable.
The Surface Water Modelling Study showed the amount of discharge and velocity of flow according
to a selected design condition. Based on the above result length of openings was determined
considering the velocity and area influenced. The locations of culverts were finalised on the
longitudinal section of the road alignment after i) thorough scrutiny of the topographic survey
sheets, ii) survey findings on ground elevations, and iii) final site inspection by a survey team.
6.4    Embankment Protection
The proposed embankmnent is situated in an area subject to inundation. This fact requires
embankment protection.
Three locations were identified by the SWMC where elevated water velocity will occur during peak
discharges. In areas with deep water inundation like the "Green River" wave run-up will occur. The
design height of the embankment has been adapted at the pLaces where wave run-up is expected and
an additional 1.60 m is added to the embankment height. The increased embankment height is
foreseen between Ch. 24+100 and Ch.30+000. The Consultant has designed a interlocking concrete
block slope protection not only to protect the slope from erosion but also to reduce the wave run-up.
In addition to the increased embankmnent level, this concrete block slope protection with wave run-up
reducing surface will be added to critical places.
Trhe places with elevated water velocity are:
Harinchara Khal             1.48 n/sec
Nimaicharai Khal            1.27 n/sec
Khalkola Bridge             1.14 rnsec
Three possible options, elaborated in detail in the Embankment Design Report, are envisaged to
protect the embankment from erosion:
*   Concrete block slope protection
*   Matting
*   Plantation of grasses, shrubs and trees (see also Chapter 8)
Concrete Block Slope Protection
For Harinchara Khal Bridge additional slope protection by concrete blocks is required over an
estimated distance of 50 m on each site of the abutment. between 50 and lOOm from the abutment
additional geo-matting with grassing is required
For the Nimaicharai Khal Bridge concrete block slope protection over 25 m from the abutment is
estimated to be required.

Geo Matting Slope Protection
Geo matting will be placed in some locations which are strongly exposed to heav flood, wind and
wave actions.,This type of slope protection comes in-between embankment plantation and concrete
blocks The proposed geomatting is a polypropylene filament wire mat for soil erosion protection
from rainfall and flooding. This matting is laid on the slope an planted or sewed-in with grass to
obtain a uniform mat. (see embankment design)
6.5     Provisions to Maintain Unobstructed Navigation Routes
The Atrai is the main river in the project area. It was a good navigable intemal river some 40-50
years back. During monsoon it remains navigable and considerable boat traffic use this route.
As such navigational clearance as per IWTA'S route standard has been recommended for the bridge.
The standard clearance for this route is 100 ft. horizontal and 25 ft. vertical clearance. Considering
standard high water level at the site as 12.11 and structural depth 1 .75m and Navigational clearance
25 ft. (7.60m), the bridge deck level comes to 21.49m PwD.
The placement of buoys and navigational instructions to cargo vessels will ensure least possible
interference.

7.      Fisheries Mitigation Plan
The NIBNR Project is not expected to cause significant changes and/or losses in the regional fisheries
sector, although some impacts will occur which relate to the following facts:
* About 50 households with fishing as main or additional source of income are among the PAP, (being
estimated with an estimated average 53.6 kg of fish/household/year)
* 44 ditches and fishponds of different size along the road alignment are to be removed within 25 m of
both sides of the CL. Many of the fishponds, however, have low production due to low level of
management. Many of the ponds remain submerged during monsoon.
* Local reduction of drainage will have effects on fish migration
* Local siltation will have adverse effects of fish populations
The mitigation plan addresses these environmental problems to the extent possible and justifiable
with the scope of this project. A clear distinction was dravvn between mitigation and compensation
strategies*). Mitigation measures are designed to reduce or avoid losses to capture fisheries. In contrast,
compensation measures rely on aquaculture and culture-based techniques to increase fish production and
thereby compensate, to varying degrees, for the lost tonnage of fish due to flood control and/or removal of
fishponds.
7.1    Mitigation of Impacts Affecting Fish Migration and Ecology
No important dry season fish habitats such as perennial beels are affected by the road alignrent. Thus
there will be no negative impact of this project on fish production caused by loss of winter and pre-
monsoon habitats. On the other hand, new perennially watered structures (borrowpits) will result from this
project which will have positive impact on the regional fisheries sector (see below).
The project also considers the rehabilitation of channels nearby the alignment which currently have been
severely reduced by flood control activities and siltation. It is anticipated that canal re-excavation work will
be applicable in higher land areas where connections to some rivers (Atrai, Mara Boral; Karatoa) can be
made via rehabilitating old canal systems. Such measures will positively influence both acive and passive
migration of fish whose life cycle depends on seasonal movements between different riverine and
floodplain habitats.
Unplanned rural road development in the Project Area have resulted in several locations in blockage to
floodwaters and fish on floodplains. To reduce the adverse impacts the project made provision to construct
additional culverts or rehabilitating them in the near vicinity of the ROW, particularly wherever they cross
existing canals nearby.
' The organisation and monitoring of the single components are discussed in Chapters 9

The construction of the main road embankment intends to avoid to the maximum possible negative impacts
on the migratory pathways of commercially important fish. Therefore, an adequate number of bridges and
culverts have been incorporated in the NHBNR alignment. Special care was taken in site selection and
technical design of these structures along the most critical stretches of flood events (see Technical Reports
on Bridge and Culverts). Openings in the embankment have been calculated according to the flood
simulation models provided by the SWMC. The structures are designed to allow drainage to an extent
close to that without project. It is anticipated that this measure would maintain the actual species diversitv
as the migratory adult and juvenile fish would be able to reach floodplains together with hatchlings brought
in by passive downstream drift.
The Consultant bad been asked to assess the necessity to include fish passes in the embankment design
which may facilitate fish migration. Fish passes need apparendy not to be installed as the
upward/downward nigration of adult and juvenile fish will be sufficiently secured by the incorporation of
80 culverts and 12 bridges in the new construction design. It is noteworthy that culverts are sufficiently
present particularly in those areas which are deeply flooded and, correspondingly, major habitats for
migratory fish. As most of the rivers in the Project Area rum from North to South, while the alignment of
NHBNR is from East to West, it is expected that the lateral migration of both adult and juvenile fish from
rivers into khals and floodplain depressions and vice-versa would be lirnited.
7.2    Fish Stock Conservation Measures
Uncontrolled exploitation of fish poses a general threat to the fish communities in the region. In places
where fish become concentrated due to drainage congestion. or drawdown in depressions, fishing activities
often increase. The use of gear that eliminates all fish frorn a certain water body is not uncommon. The
project will take measures to control these unsustainable practices wherever there is a linkage to its
structures.
Fisheries Conservation and Catch Control Structures in Front of Culverts
Culverts tend to block or delay movements of fish thereby increasing their susceptibility to easy capture.
Culverts should be classified as prohibited fishing zones. Fishing from the structure itself and from a set
distance upsteam or downstream from it should be made illegal. Distances will vary depending on the size
and location of the structure and the size and nature of the regulated water course. Respective regulations
should be enacted through the local fisheries authorities.
Fisheries Conservation in Dighis
Control of fishing activities and prevention of overexploitation is of paramount importance if the newly
established lakes shall become functional and viable for fish production. The management scheme should
therefore incorporate respective measures, e.g. declaring the lakes (or part of it) as temporary fish
sanctuaries dunng certain periods. Enforcement can be aclieved by regular controls by members of the
entitled user group and by installation of large katha which prevent most opportunistic fishing methods
and provide shelter for fish.

Fisheries conservation: protection of river (duar)fisheries
Studies carried out by the Flood Action Plan throughout the region have demonstrated the great
importance of river duar (scour holes) as winter refuges for large species of fish, particularly catfish and
major carps. Duar are presently included in riverine jalmahal where they are intensively fished by
leaseholders during the dry season. FAP has recommnended prohibition of fishing duar during the dry
season and the establishment of river patrols by DoF to enforce protective fisheries regulations. This
measure needs to be taken in due consideration in the area where NHBNR crosses the Atmu River as a
means of conserving important overwintering broodstock of high value species which form the basis of
both riverine and floodplain fisheries.
Awareness Campaign
The project emphasises that the local NGO's implementing the RAP and training programs contact
schools, educational personnel, construction management personnel, construction workers representatives
etc. to launch environmental awareness programmes, with emptasis on fisheries and wildlife conservation.
The campaigns should focus on basic understanding of the water requirements within each natural
resource sector, linking both fisheries and agriculture. The awareness programs also should address
adverse impacts of flood control and various methods of mitigation against such impacts.
7.3    Culture-Based Fisheries Schemes in Dighis
To encounter to some degree the anticipated losses in catch fisheries the mitigation measures focus on
newly created fishing grounds which will be established in the former large-sized sand borrowpits. With
appropriate arrangements and organisation of water-user groups (preference to PAP's) these schemes are
considered to provide greater and more extensive potential increases in catch which can be shared more
equitably between the members of newly established groups.
Rehabilitation of Borrowpits to Suit Fisheries Purpose
To create an enviromnent in the new dighis that is conducive to fish production, the slopes
descending from the embankment will be rather flat. An inclination of min. 1:7 will be maintained
after completion of excavation work. The rehabilitation will also require to refill the borrowpits with
the remaining overburden and former topsoil to facilitate vegetation growth. It is assumed that the
overburden contains sufficient clay material to reduce the permeability of the dighis. Fertilising the
slopes will be required to initialise vegetation growth and stimulate phytoplankton development once
the lake is waterfed.
Stocking and Fisheries Management of Flooded and Non-Flooded Dighis
Depending on the degree of seasonal flooding, the lakes will be stocked with varying densities of
fingerlings of fast growing carp species such as Major Indian Carps, Thai Shorputi and Tilapia.
For lakes that are not regularly flooded it is advisable to stock fingerlings of Major Indian Carps,
Silver Carp and Grass Carp. The suggested ratio of stockling would be according to the following
scheme (Tab. 7.3.1). The stocking would be performed under a regional DoF aquaculture promotion
program. For ecological considerations it is not recommnended to stock these lakes with exotic species
(e.g. Thai Shorputi, Tilapia).

b) based on stocking with advanced fingerlings, size 100-150mm
c) if intensive gorwth of macro-vegetaion occurs, stocking rate might be higher
Ideally, the advanced fingerlings are reared in pen cultures placed in a well-prepared shallow part of
the lake. The pen structures are set out at the end of monsoon. Regular and thorough net clearance of
predators is required before stocking the pens Aith fry and fingerlings, available from April to June.
As pen culture is only productive when a certain soil and water quality can be established, it might
be necessary to rely on the conventional rearing of fingerlings in nearby ponds. The ponds (V2 to one
ha in area) would include sealed dikes, levelled bottom, drainage canal and/or water supply pipe and
pump, and outlet structures including a harvesting box. These ponds should be drainable by gravitv.
For those lakes that are seasonally flooded no fry should be stocked due to active and passive out
migration and the increased pressure from migrating predators (mainly catfish). In such
circumstances it may be considered to stock advanced fingerlings of species with a short life cycle
like Thai Shorputi and Tilapia only. Stocking rates for this type of lake may be 5.000 to 8.000
fingerlings per ha.
Fish attracting devices (FADs) are recommended for enhancing the bio-productivity and fish
production in seasonally flooded dighis. These devices, introduced at different depths, will attract
migrating fish when passing during the flood season the lake area. The Fads consist of dry plant
material (bushes, palm fronds, sticks etc.) which are inserted in clusters in the lake. These structures
will be soon overgrown with small algae (periphyton) which will provide additional food supply for
the fish and other aquatic organisms. They will offer, at the same time, shelter from predators and
prevent to some degree fish poaching. FADs established in shallow water zones will be fished with
encircling nets and replaced seasonally.
All rearing operations, particularly when advanced fingerling production in pen culture is involved,
make proper training and technical advice through regionally operating NGO's working in close
consultation with the DoF and the Joyshagar Fish Farm in Neemgachi mandatory.
In the newly created lakes control of fishing is essential to mnaintain the sustainability of the fish stocks.
Closed seasons and restriction of fishing gear are the two main measures to increase the survival of fish
broodstock duning the dry season, a critical period in their life, when they are vulnerable to over-fishing in
flood controlled areas. Increased survival of broodstock should result in a greater recruitmrent of juveniles
into the folowing year's fishery which in turn should lead to increased fish productivity. Good care of the
vegetation belts is also essential to provide shelter and natural food resources for fish fry.

EcononucBenefits
Being rather an innovative approach in culture fisheries it needs to be stated that stocking of open water
bodies, particularly when they are regularly flooded, has yet to be proven successful in Bangladesh
(Rajts/IFADEP, pers. comm.). Estimates based on small reservoir in India wtth similar climatic conditions
show that yields of 400 and more kg/la/yr can be anticipated when stocking reservoirs that are rarely or
never flooded. In regularly flooded lakes production may be less due to less suitable species that can be
stocked, out-migration of fish, limited control of predators and outwelling of nutrients.
To reach economic dimensions for fish production, however, the number of beneficiaries (members of
water user group) should be adjusted to the anticipated yield. In order to establish viable sustenance it is, at
this stage, foreseen to allocate about 1.5 ha of mean annual lakewater surface to one fishing household.
Notwithstanding, the suggested production rates need careful assessment since production depends on a
number of variables such as stocking density, size of stocked fingerlings, fish mortality (natural,
poaching), growth rates, development of nutrient level and bioproductivity, and last but not least on
fisheries management.
Environmental Benefits
The vegetation belts around the new lakes that will be naturally established and, if necessary,
supplemented with planted trees and bushes will provide habitats for both aquatic and terrestrial
wildlife. Depending on the flooding condition, fish and waterfowl will find shelter and food in these
habitats.
It is understood that part of the habitats and vegetation losses due to the road project can be
naturally compensated. It is also believed that part of the wildlife which has left the area during
construction disturbances will retum. Last but not least the newly created lakes-will add to the
landscape aesthetics and may be of value for future tourism projects (e.g. at the Mora Boral)
following the overall development of the region after becoming linked to the national highway
roadnet.
7.4     Aquaculture Development in Modified Clay Borrowpits
In previous progress reports and discussions with the Client the Consultants have proposed to
acquire the land for the clay borrowpits so they can be converted to fish ponds for PAPs. To avoid
resettlement far from the present housing of PAPs, the location of these borrowpits are to be defined
(within an economical acceptable range) after the PAP census.
The borrowpits will be rehabilitated according to standard clesigned fish farm units, each comprising
4-5 large rearing ponds and a set of nursery ponds for fry/fingerling production of Major Indian
Carp. Ponds will have a maximum width of 30 m to facilitate net harvesting. Pond bottom will be
levelled and provided with drainage channel and box, if circumstances allow. Dikes will be
compacted, outer and inner dikes will have different slopes, depending on exposure to flooding. The
dikes will be planted (see below). In junction with the rectangular shaped fish farm (see diagram)
there will be two elevated highland platforms on which both. new homesteads, working sheds, storage
room and, if applicable, a mini-hatchery will be established. The platforms, too, will be planted with
useful vegetation. The fishfarm unit will also have an access road/embankment to link it with the
nearby highway. This will enable the aquaculturists easy transport of materials and products to and
from the farm.

Basic Production Features of the Fish Farms
Like in the large lakes that will be created by sand excavation activities the newly established clay
borrow pit fishponds will be two categories, depending on the ground level and height of the dikes.
Type a) Seasonalponds
Ponds which can only used for intensive fish culture after flood recedes. It will then
depend on the soil permeability whether this pond will be perennial or if it will dry
out. Notably seepage will be reduced after few years of production.
Proposed stocking:   Thai Shorputi and Tilapia
Stocking Rate:       5.000 to 6.000 (fingerling, size 50-60 mm)
Production Potential: 800 kg/ha (first year) to 1.500/ha (third year)
Type b) Permanentperennialponds
Ponds which can only used for intensive fish culture throughout the year. Water is
replenished by pumping and/or rainfed.
Proposed stocking:   Polyculture with Major Indian and Chinese Carp (Catla,
Silver carp, Rui, Mrigal (and possibly Grass Carp)
Stocking Rate:       8.000 to 10.000 (fry, size 10-20 mm)
Production Potential:  1.500 kg/ha (first year') to 2.500/ha (third year)
Other potential:     Ponds can be used for fingerling production; Fishfarm can be
managed as integrated aquaculture scheme like duck-cum fish
Details about operation (water supply, feeding, fertilising, pond treatment, sampling, harvesting), fry
production options and operating costs for different types of fishfarms are described in Annex C.

Planting of the Dikes
Dike planting programs will be promoted through the RAP. It is recommnended to plant the dikes
with plants that fulfill similar criteria as those specified for roadside plantation (see Chapter 8). Of
distinctive value for dike plantation are fruit trees (e.g. bananas), silkworm trees, coconut palms and
medicinal shrubs). Stabilisation of dikes not planted with one of these types of vegetation should be
made with Vetiver grass.
Produdion Target
In conventional carp polyculture and under stringent supervision of the responsible NGO production
should reach in the first year 1000 to 1500 kg/ha which will gradually increase to 2500 kg/ha in the
third year. The net income for both seasonal and perennial type fishponds are illustrated in Annex D.
It needs to be noted that additional income from rearing cash crops and livestock in the diked area
will give aditional economic benefits to the user group.
Environmental Benefits
Apart from income generating facilities (see below) the planted trees and bushes will provide habitats
for wildlife, particularly good shelter for migratory and resident birds. With this environmental
enhancement a good deal of the losses of habitats and vegetation due to the road project can be
mitigated.
7.5     Additional Income Generating Facilities
The proposed action plan makes provision of new skills and credits for the development of activities
and small rural businesses that are in combination with, the above mentioned. The process of
selection will be left fully to the discretion of the groups aLnd the NGO's working in the area. The
development of such schemes will require comprehensive training and follow-up through appointed
NGO's.
Possible income generating facilities are integrated aquaculkure schemes such as
*     Paddy-cum-fish-culture
*     Duck-cum-fish farming
*     Duckweed culture and duckweeed-based fish culture
*     Development of mini-hatcheries to produce carp seed.
Depending on the response and skill developing in the different groups small-scalefish processing
enterprises can also be considered as a valuable opportunity to upgrade the cultured product and
open new marketing facilities.
With the allocation of funds integrated aquaculture schemes include a variety of income generating
facilities through well-managed horticultures associated with the fish farms. For example, viable
sources of income can be generated from adequate dike plantation with a well-balanced mix of
useful plants.

8.    Forestry Schemes
The NHBNR project offers various possibilities to combine design elements on
* the road embankments,
* roadsite habitats,
* rehabilitated borrowpits and
* newly constructed homestead sites,
with the development of forestry schemes that are beneficial both to the technical structure and the
biological and sociological environment. Embankment plantation and other planting activities
associated with the RAP represent a major component in the effectiveness of the EMAP. The
incorporation of the planting activities is to make part of the social forestry scheme designed for the
PAP income generating plan. Its linkage with the RAP and organisation are discussed in Chapter 9.
8.1    Embankment and Roadside Plantation
The objectives of embankment plantation are
>    natural slope protection against wind and wave action and mechanical impacts
>b   mitigate to some extent the loss of plants removed by the project
>    prevent illegal encroachment (establishment of squatters) on embankment
>    provide useful commodities for PAP's and EP's (timber, fuel, food, medicine)
>    create tree habitats to enhance ecological properties and landscape aesthetics
8.2    Selection of Suitable Species
For afforestation on the slopes (average 7.5m) of the NHBHNR, eight species were selected for both
environmental and economic importance. Selection criteria for these species were on the basis of
* habitat preference and suitability   only locally occurring plants were chosen
* adequate rooting system         to support embankment stability, slope protection and
to control erosion
* canopy structure                to support undergrowth and ecological niches, and
to provide sufficient traffic security
* good timber quality             to provide income generating commodities for EPs
* good fuelwood quality            to provide general commodities for EPs
* fruit bearing                    to provide food resources for EPs
* medicinal properties             to provide plant rnedicines for the community
* other marketable uses            to provide, for instance, paper pulp production

In places where erosion is to be expected from rainfall and wind grasses are proven means for
natural slope protection. Grasses with extensive and deep rooting systems are required. Such
properties are ideally combined in Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides), a grass common in the Project
Area. This grass has proven ability to fulfill a cost-effective erosion control, soil compacting and
slope stabilization, especially in canal-bank erosion, gully erosion, protection of abutments of
stream and river bridges as living wing walls, outside of irrigation canal bunds and at entrances to
reservoirs (World Bank, 1988). Vetiveria zizanioides is rapid-growing, yet non-invasive. It forms
densely growing hedges which filter out water-borne eroded material whilst reinforcing adjacent
soil preventing local slumping associated with constructed terracing systems. Vetiver is also not
competitive to adjacent plants, due to its tapering or conical root architecture. It can be harvested
in without affecting its root stability, and it yields a variety of products ). The grass is also tolerant
to intensive rainfall and tt a wide range soil types. It can be established on soils with pH ranging
from 4 to 8.5, and it also grows on infertile polluted soils. Once established, Vetiver grass is
resistant to drought, fire and livestock. It is able to resist flood and inundation due to its deep roots
and strong leaves and stems (Grimshaw, 1988).
*)     Among commercial uses are oil extracted from roots, stems and leaves are good for mulching
purposes, prevents spread of creeping grasses, stop pests such as snakes and rats

Vetiver planting should be synchronized with the monsoon, i.e. by the end of August. Care must
be taken to ensure that slips transferred from nurseries do not dry out either before or after
planting in well prepared furrows. One hectare requires 150,000-225,0000 slips for planting; each
slip consisting of about 5 tillers, cut to 300 mm blade length with roots trimmed to a length of 200
mm (CIEC, 1993). Vetiver needs three or four tomes weeding in the first year and two or three in
the second. Nurseries need to be set up locally adjacent to the project road - or even within the
Project site boundaries
8.3    Plantation and Harvesting Scheme
The plantation will not follow the rather dense plantation of monoculture as was done in
Nagarbari-Bogra Highway. The option is rather a mix and balance of species which combine the
desired properties to give sufficient protection and provide a wide range of commodities to the
EP's involved in this planting scheme,
The general establishment of embankment vegetation belt according to the outlined design would
be timed to follow the initial priority planting of vulnerable areas-such as flood openings, culverts
and other exposed areas and the general grassing of large slope surfaces. The proposed roadside
plantation design for NHBNR will have a dense canopy of a well-balanced species mix which are
planted with specific spacing.
Each row is duplicated such as I and 1'; 2 and 2'; 3 and 3' and so on. To start plantation, 7
seedlings will be planted in each row with a spacing of 1.2'i m. The distance between the rows will
be initially 1.5 m; after harvesting the duplicated rows in year 4-5, the distance between the rows
to be kept will be 3 m. The proposed plantation design is illlustrated in Fig. 8.2.1.
The position of the seedlings in the vertical line will be harvested after 4-5 years; this measure will
warrant not only the first economic return but also enable good growth and girth size for the
remaining trees. This will allow the plants of (0) circle position to establish and grow successfully
with four plants in each row. Accordingly, the final distance between the plants in each row will
be 2.5 m. The plants of the duplicated rows (1', 2' and 3') will be harvested after 7-9 years. The
plants of rows 1, 2 and 3 (marked as x in Fig. 8.2.1) will further remain to be cropped only for
specific products and/or slash wood. In every second row, 2nd position and third row 3rd position
from top of the slope the additional plantation of Fan Palrm (Borassusflabellifer) is suggested for
the following reasons:
i)   the plant is common in the Project Area.
ii)  it has monopodial branching, hence will allow the surrounding plants to
spread unhindered their canopy.
iii)  the fruit juice of this plant is very popular in this region and is used not
only for the preparation of brown (solidified) sugar, but also for the
preparation of cake in the months of AuguLst and September. The plant is
also commonly used in local rituals and festivities.
iv)  the leaves are widely used for making hand fan, an appreciated
commodity in this region.

Plants of wide canopy were kept in the middle positions of the row. On the top of the embankment
only those plants will be considered which will not impede with their canopy the traffic view.
Plants which meet such requirements are Acacia, Syzizium and Azadirechta.
Dalbergia and Erithrina are among the flood tolerant plants chosen for the bottom of the slope.
These species would best fulfil the physiological requirements to adapt to temporary waterlogging.
It is worthwhile to mention that (Daincha) Sesbania canabina, an annual woody, flood tolerant
shrub is cultivated for fuel not only in low lying areas of the borrow pit but also on the boundary
partitions of cultivated plots. The slope's margins at borrowpit sites would be appropriate sites for
planting this species which is a useful fuel wood resource. This plant is less suitable for
embankment plantation as every season renewal of plants is required.

9.      Organisation of the Environmental Management Plan
9.1     General Organisation and Framework of Institutional Responsibilities
As the environmental management of this project requires the right mix of expertise in technical,
physical, hydrological, ecological and sociological disciplines, the organisation has to supply the
corresponding specialists and institutions to become functional in achieving proper and timely
execution of EMAP. Thus, the management of the proposed elements and activities of the EMAP
will be an interdisciplinary approach, involving various components of co-ordination, supervision,
training and monitoring.
The three-level organisational arrangement of the EMAP is illustrated by the organigramm (Fig.
9.1. 1). It also shows the line of responsibilities for each of the respective components.
The overall organisational responsibility for implementing and monitoring the EMAP will rest
with the Government of Bangladesh, Roads and Highway Department through the Project
Director and his Senior Superintendent Engineer/Chief Resettlement Officer (SSE/CRO),
represented by the "Engineer". For the Land Acquisition the responsibility lies with the DC's from
the Natore and Sirajgonj District.
The Engineer heading the Engineering Team will be given the responsibility of the supervision of
all project activities in
1) the technical field   (represented by-the Technical Supervision Team/Contractors)
2) the environmental field  (represented by the Environmental Management Team), and
3) the socio-economic field (represented by the ResettlementTeam/NGOs).
His -main duty is the supervision of the four Contractors working in four sections of road
construction. In liaison with the Environmental Management Team he will ensure environmental
quality and observance of all ongoing activities in accordance with the standards and measures
outlined in this report and subsequently in the Contract. He also will oversee the monitoring
program with respect to the single components. The third complex of his duties is to link and
control all technical and environmental issues with the work program implemented by the
Resettlement Co-ordinating Team which is implementing the resettlement plan through two
selected NGOs.

9.2     Tasks and Organisation of the Technical Supervision Team /Contractor
The obligations and tasks of Contractors with respect to appropriate implementation of the project,
particularly the environmental mitigation measures during construction works will all be specified
in the Contract Documents.
To a large extent the Contractor will be need the approval of the Engineer (and/or his appointed
representatives and affiliated experts) who will focus on and examine the following work
components:
* Assurance that all construction works in accordance with the design, specifications and
methodology outlined in the Contractor Documents;
* Verification of the Contractor's performance while rehiabilitating all structures and physical
interferences related to the work to conditions same as prior to the work, if not better in
environmental and socio-economic terms.
The Engineer will, after consultation with the Client, approve the four the contractors working in
assigned sections the locations their construction camps, offices, stores, labour dormitories,
canteens, workshops and facilities. Special wishes of the Contractor and adaptations to local
conditions will be determinant factors for the final location of these sites.
The Engineer will also organise, in consultation with the Resettlement Co-ordinating Team and the
NGOs, site meetings at specified intervals for evaluating the progress of the Contract and for
discussing matters pertaining to the Contract, and to the compliance with the technical, social and
environmental requirements of this project. He will verify, through authorised representatives of
GoB, the correct removal of houses, walls, fences, poles of utility services and other objects within
the right of way of NHBNR.
The Engineer will frequently liaise with RHD and the sponsor to report on the works progress and
issues that may arise during the work. As for issues discussed in this EMAP, he will consult the
Environmental Expert(s) to elaborate specific strategies and solutions to mitigate (or, if
unavoidable) to reduce adverse environmental impacts. This applies particularly for final selection
of borrowpits and campsites, access roads, drainage works, excavation works, and establishing of
hazardous machinery (e.g. asphalt plant, crusher).
Tasks of the Contractor, with Special Reference to Environmental Issues
The Contractor will be basically the sole responsible for accurate and environmentally benign
execution of all works associated with the construction of the road. For any change in
methodology and design specified in the Contract Documents he has to consult the Engineer for
approval. The Contractor shall submit in advance to the Engineer for approval full details (design
plan) of campsites, access roads and facilities he proposes to build. He shall take into
consideration the prevailing wind direction to secure a minimum of nuisance to neighbouring
houses, schools and general rural economic activities.
Should the Contractor wish to use land other than the area approved by the Engineer for storing or
keeping material or equipment required for the construction of the permanent works, it will be
subject to the following:
* the Engineer approve any area selected for this purpose.
* such land be physically separated and suitably fenced in.
73



DHV Consultants BV
* the area used for the aforesaid purpose be surveyed by the specialists affiliated with the project
* he shall enter into contract agreements of lease with the owner of such land
Prior to starting with construction, the Contractor shall start with establishment of new water
supply and sanitation facilities specified by contract. The Contractor himself shall make
arrangements for procuring, transporting, storing, distributing and applying the water needed for
construction purposes.
Where campsites, access roads and diversions shall be constructed so as not to damage or displace
property or ecologically sensitive habitats (for definition, see Chapter 5). In exceptional cases
where this is not possible the Contractor shall notify the Engineer and the Environmental
Specialist in good time so that he may arrange to have assessed potential impacts and respective
mitigation measures.
For any kind of necessary temporary drainage works such as side drains, catchwater drains, mitre
drains, culverts, etc., the work activities shall only begin after approval of the Engineer and in
consultation with the Environmental Management Team's Specialist.
If not specified differently, the Contractor must remove, on completion of. the work, all
constructional plant, buildings, fencing and other temporary structures or premises. In such cases
the sites of constructional plants, haul roads and any other sites and plots used for the Contractor's
services, are to be restored to its original condition and left neat and tidy.
Precautions and responsibilities Relating to Safety Considerations
For safety considerations, the contractor shall be responsible for
* the physical and mental safety of all persons engaged in the execution of the works and shall
take such safety precautions as are generally accepteid as good civil engineering practice.
* carefully protecting his labourers from injury by rain, flooding, heat or inclement weather, all
likely to happen in the Project Area.
= protect the environment from pollution due to the works, particularly avoiding spillage of
(gas)oil, paint, and bitumen. In his plans for the site installation, he will duly incorporate
measurements to avoid pollution.
* keeping the site and premises clean and free of hazardous waste material
In order not to interfere with public life, cultural assets and ongoing rural development programs,
the Contractor will:
* check on the site the locations of any remaining cultural items, particularly those buried. He
shall take all reasonable precautions not to damage or inflict upon cultural heritage and
religious infrastructure in the vicinity of work sites.
* work in close co-operation with the NGO appointed to execute the RAP, TA, training and
motivation programs through the IEngineer.
* work in close co-operation with private owners or public authorities controlling services which
have to be protected, moved or relocated during, before or after the Works. The Contractor
shall communicated with those concerned through the Engineer.
The Contractor is responsible for the provision of temporary drainage works such as drains, open
channels, banks, etc. and providing and operating temporary pumps and such other equipment as
may be necessary for adequately protecting, draining and de-watering the work and temporary
74



DHV Consultants BV
works. This will be in addition to any perrnanent drainage works specified and installed and in
addition to any temporary drainage works specifically paid for separately as in the case of detours.
When any part of the Works or any equipment or material is found, upon examination by the
Engineer, not conform to the technical and environmental requirements or at any stage before final
acceptance, is damaged so that it no longer conform to the requirements of the Contract, the
Engineer may order its repair or removal and replacement, at the Contractor's expense. All
materials refused or rejected by the Senior Engineer shall immediately be removed from site by
the Contractor at his own costs.
Environmental Considerations Relating to Site Preparation Works
For removal of biological resources (e.g. trees) the Contractor should make any effort to reduce
such actions to the absolute necessary minimum.
The clearing and grubbing shall consist of clearing the designated areas of all trees, shrubs, brush,
other vegetation, rubbish, and all other objectionable material. No trees with a diameter of 30 cm
girths at breast height or more shall be cut prior to the Engineers approval. The cleaning includes
grubbing stumps, roots, and disposing of all spoil material resulting from the clearing and
grubbing.
All merchantable timber within the area to be cleared shall become the property of the Contractor,
unless otherwise specified by the Engineer (e.g. to ensure the appropriate utilisation of these
resources after their removal by entitled persons). Material from the cleaning and grubbing shall
be placed on designated (dry) places and only be burned after the Engineers approval.
The Contractor is responsible for the removal, wholly or in part and the satisfactory disposal of all
other structures, old pavements, derelict culverts, paved structures (e.g. rice mills) and other
obstructions that are not designated or permitted to remain. This work shall include the salvaging
of designated materials and backfilling the resulting trenches, holes, and pits as applicable.
In the stretch between Nalka and Hatikamul, the Contractor shall remove the existing pavement of
the road sections and re-use for construction as far as feasible. All designated salvable material
shall be removed, without unnecessary damage, in sections or pieces which may be readily
transported, and shall be stored by the Contractor at approlved places on the project or as otherwise
approved by the Engineer.
Handling and Use of Hazardous Materials
The Contractor will ensure that he uses materials that are environmentally benign while
establishing paint for road markings, signboards, traffic signs, and applying adhesives.
When the Contractor encounters during the works materials within the Right of Way which are
unsuitable for the works, he shall inform immediately the Engineer who will take the appropriate
decisions.
The Contractor will submit a list of materials which will ultimately be dumped, specifying by
category and quantity, if applicable, the chemical components, possible toxicity and dilution
characteristics.
75



DHV Consultants BV
Asphalt Mixing Plant
The dryer of the AMP shall be equipped with an approved dust-collector for recycling of the fines.
The hourly production rate shall not exceed the manufacturers recommendations to avoid black
smoke. Should the Engineer determine that the equipment furnished does not meet these
requirements, the deficiencies shall be corrected by the Contractor before further use of the
deficient equipment shall be replaced with satisfactory equipment.
Disposal of Waste Material
Nonperishable material may be disposed of outside the limits of view from the project with written
permission of the property owner on whose property the material is placed. Copies of all
agreements with property owners shall be furnished to the Engineer. Basements or cavities left by
structure removal, not affecting the Works, shall be filled with acceptable material to the level of
the surrounding ground and shall be compacted in accordance with the requirements for
embankments.
All timber and all brush, stumps, roots, rotten wood, and other refuse from the clearing and
grubbing operations shall be disposed off at locations out of sight of the roadway, provided,
however, when permitted in writing by the authority having jurisdiction over the area.
The Contractor is responsible for the disposal of all deleterious material from the cleaning of
ditches, culverts and the surface of the road as part of his cleaning and construction activities
described in the following Sections.
The Contractor shall notify the Senior Engineer sufficiently in advance of the opening of any
borrow pit so that elevations and measurements may be taken of the undisturbed ground surface or
of the surface of the borrow material after stripping, so that any desired tests may be made of the
material.
Overburden and other spoil material shall be disposed of or used for purposes as dlirected. Slopes
of borrow pits shall be flattened and rounded or shapecd as required. All sand borrow pits shall be
neatly trimmed and shall be landscaped as approved by the Senior Engineer. The costs of this
landscaping will be deemed to be covered by the rates tendered and paid for the various items of
work included in the Contract
Care shall be taken not to allow material in borrow pits to become excessively wet, to keep all
completed layers properly drained, not to cause dumps of material on completed layer work to
inhibit surface drainage or to form wet spots under and around dumps, and to protect all parts of
the work against erosion by floods and rain. The Contractor shall prevent fill material from
escaping beyond the embankment slope stakes by the construction of the ditches or earth, or log
barriers at the toes of embankments, or by the other suitable methods satisfactory to the Engineer.
All stump holes and surface irregularities caused by the Contractor in the area between the slope
lines and the outside boundary of clearing and grubbing shall be filled and otherwise corrected by
the Contractor.
76



DHV Consultants BV
When necessary to dispose of surplus material, embankmerits may be widened uniformly and/or
slopes flattened as directed by the Engineer.
The Contractor will submit a plan of transport of earth matertial to the Engineer for approval, prior
to the start of the earthworks. This schedule will have to show the relation between fill and the
borrow pits. The plan of transport of earth material will indicate:
* all materials (including their quantities) to be ultimately dumped
* surplus soils
* excavation materials to be used in embankments and fill on the existing road.
* fill material to be extracted from borrow pits.
* usable vegetable soils.
Measures to Reduce Interferences with Public Traffic
The Contractor shall be responsible for the safe and easy passage of public traffic past and/or over
sections of roads of which he has occupation. The Contractor shall at all times in all his operations
and in using his constructional plant take the necessary care to protect the public and to facilitate
the flow of traffic. Need for and details concerning diversions shall be approved by the Engineer
before the construction of such diversions commences. He shall also provide and allow free-of-
charge access to persons whose properties fall within or adjoin the area over which he is working.
Diversions should include the construction of temporary gates, grid gates, fences, drainage works,
and other items considered by the Engineer to be necessary.
The Contractor, in co-operation with the Engineer, shall make arrangements for all public services
such as power lines and telephone lines to be moved where required for the construction of
diversions.
Where existing roads are to be used as diversions, the Contractor shall, after consultation with the
owner or authority having control of such road, carry out any repairs, alterations or additions to
such roads as may be required to bring them in a condition at least equal to prior condition and
suitable for traffic. All potholes shall be repaired immediately. Such roads shall be obliterated and
their surfaces properly reinstated when no longer required, all at the Contractor's own cost. In all
other cases, access roads shall removed and rehabilitated in the terrain's original or to an
environmentally improved condition as specified by the advisory personnel.
The Contractor will ensure to water the diversions to keep down dust development on temporary
access and diversion roads.
Where regulation of the Contractor's traffic does not alleviate the public traffic hazard
satisfactorily or the maintenance of the diversions cannot be or is not properly executed, the
Contractor shall, where conditions permit, divert his trafftc over construction roads provided and
maintained at his own cost,
Providing and maintain the necessary traffic-control devices, road signs, channelisation devices,
barricades, warning devices and road markings to ensure public traffic safety standards.

condition; any repairs shall be made immediately at the request of the Engineer.
Water Supply & Sanitary Installation
* Identify need (approx. I pump well per 20 households) and provide additional water supply
along the zone immediately outside the land acquisition zone and install adequate number of
these appliances at an early stage of the main construction activities.
* construction of tube-wells and latrines according to health requirements and standards
* Supervision of siting of kutcha latrines near khals, dead rivers, beels, ditches, etc.
* Control collection and deposit of night (prevent contact with surface run-off surface waters
used by the public)
* provide sufficient drinking water for labourers available to their nearby work-sheds, for their
bathing, cooking, utensil washing, washing, etc.
* Contain and counteract waterlogging in the area of construction
* Spraying stagnant pools which may temporarily develop into breeding habitats for disease
vectors
* Safe deposit and disposal of garbage and solid wastes produced from the kitchen and camp

9.3     Tasks and Responsibilities of the Environmental Management Team
The Environmental Management Team acts as interface between the Technical Supervision Team
and the Resettlement Co-ordinating Team. Its tasks, performed by full-time field officers, short-
and long-term consultant specialists and affiliated NGOs, are grouped in two major fields,
(i) to identify ad hoc environmental issues in context with the ongoing construction
work (see above, relating to the Contractor's obligations)
(ii) to oversee and manage the activities associated with the resettlement program,
mainly provide and monitor the inputs for the TA and training inputs for the
PAP in the field afforestation, fish culture, capture fisheries and applied
agriculture/ horticulture
While performing its task the Team will regularly report to the Engineer the observances and
environmental guidance which will be established in the day-to-day liaison with the ongoing field
activities. In addition, it will maintain close contacts to the head organisations and affiliated
governmental agencies of the NGOs performing the extension training (e.g. Dept. of Fisheries,
Dept. of Forestry, Universities and Research Laboratories).
9.3.1   Supervision and Verification of the Construction Activities with Respect to their
Environmental Acceptability
The Environmental Management will assess the environmental changes due to the ongoing
construction activities and convey, if applicable, its recomrmendations to the Technical Supervision
Team which will then communicate them to the Contractor to avoid conflicts and interferences
with the training and extension service working in the Project Area to assist the entitled groups in
developing income generating facilities.
The Team will also select local consultants and NGOs to implement the different sub-components
of the EMAP.
If required, the Team will supervise, verify and monitor all construction related environmental
impacts, as well as the adherence of the environrnental guidelines for construction and
rehabilitation of structures described in this report. Basically, the Team will assess and monitor all
parameters and aspects which are summarised in the tables presented in Section 4.2 of this Report.
9.3.2   Supervision and Co-ordination of Training Schemes for PAPs
The Environmental Management will assess the environmental changes due to the ongoing
technical assistance and sociological programmes and convey, if applicable, its recommendations
to the Sociological Team.
The major field of co-ordination will be the training secto!r in the different income generating options
that have been devised for the PAP. The beneficiary groups should receive training in fisheries (both
capture and culture, depending on location and resettlement options), afforestation and
agriculture/horticulture.
80

The set-up of a demonstration farm, established from rehabilitated borrowpits, is recommended. In
this farm, located in the Project Area with relative good access by rural roads, an integrated
aquaculture-aquaculture farm system should be set up to demonstrate to the trainees respective
techniques and operational aspects.
Organising the Capture Fisheries Action Plan
The sand borrowpit rehabilitation concept foresees that water-user groups will be identified (by the
NGOs affiliated with the Sociological Team) who will be entitled to the full range of benefits from
these artificial lakes. Prevailing use should be capture fisheries while irrigation purposes should be
second. Representatives from each group should form a local committee in association with the NGO
supervising the project to establish operating procedures of regulatory structures. The committee
would provide the mechanism for the establishment of integrated water management for these lakes.
Organising the Culture Fisheries Action Plan
The concept for clay borrowpit rehabilitation is that the NGOs performing the PAP census in
connection with the RAP will identify the persons who will be entitled to the full range of benefits
from the newly established fishfarms. The entitled persons will receive proper traininrg in fish culture
to ensure an economic viable sustenance. Conceived training topics are fish farm management, co-
operative business planning, water quality control, aquaculture techniques, storage, processing,
transport, marketing, access and use of credit.
If required, courses have to be organised to train trainers. These trainers will then provide day to day
"hands on" training for the beneficiary groups on a regular basis at the local site level.
The envisaged training program is to be executed by NGOs that have proven capability and records
in aquaculture development and training projects in the area, such as BAFRU/ODA, IFADEP and
Joyshagar Fish Farm in Neemgachi. The NGOs will work in co-operation and co-ordination with the
Thana Fisheries Officer. Credit lines have to be developed through the assisting NGOs to enable the
beneficiaries initial investments for operating the fish fanns (ref. Annex C) and marketing their
products.
Organising Extension Services for Horticulture, Agriculture and Planting Techniques
With the predicted local changes of floodwater levels and duration, changes in crop pattern might
be unavoidable. In order to adjust to the optimal agriculture practice specific extension will need
to be established to assist the PAP in the field of
* choice of crop and cropping techniques according to land type and land capability
* irrigation and drainage requirements
* horticulture
* planting techniques (e.g. for embankment planting on pond dikes, or at new homesteads)
Extension officers will have to train PAPs in relationship to actual changes of the environmental
setting. Changes in the agriculture practice will depend on the long-term development of the
affected area with respect to their flooding characteristics. The mitigation measures may be
oriented at the following table:

Planting advice for the large-scale embankment forestation program will require supervision of
local forestry and planting officers. They will be responsible for proper the advice on maintenance
of the newly planted embankments. Besides, they will look after the forestation of rehabilitated
borrowpits during the first two years.
The design of this forestry program lays emphasis to use readily available skills and relative
simple techniques. Like in ensuring the local communities skill in agriculture and horticulture, the
program is likely not to cause major organisational problems or failing to be cost effective.
Materials are derived from local resources, while seedlings will be produced in newly established
nurseries.
A Horticulture Specialist will be employed to give organisation and technical advice to beneficiary
groups while establishing their new homesteads and planting dikes of fishfarms. If applicable, the
project will foresee the fielding of an expert for integrated agriculture-aquaculture farming system,
who will work in co-operation with the fisheries training and extension personnel.

9.4     Tasks and Responsibilities of the Resettlement Co-Ordinating Team
(Sociological Team) with Environmental Considerations
The major tasks of the Sociological Team is to make organisational arrangements for the Non-
Governmental Organisations to conduct the PAP census to identify the magnitude of persons who
will become entitled to participate in the PAP. The response of the PAP, their perception of the
project and aspirations for new job and income opportunities will be instrumental in elaborating the
RAP. Thus the exact description of the single tasks relating to this project component and its
personnel is left to a later stage, based on the results of the census.
Aspects that might be taken into account while elaborating and organising the RAP, but not limited to
them, are summarised as below:
Identif7cation of Entitled Persons, Group Formation and Management
Selection and formation of the beneficiary groups should be undertaken by the NGO who are
contracted to provide long term support and training. While technical skills can be learnt through the
Department of Fisheries and affiliated organisations (e.g. BAFRU, IFADEP), the issues of group
formation, long terrn security of tenure, availability of credit and access to other development
opportunity are to be provided the two main NGOs implementing the RAP. The group would
normally be forned from landless, marginal farmners (less than 0.5 ha), assetless women and those
persons affected by land acquisition for the borrowpit. Selection criteria for beneficiary group
members should also give priority to those agricultural workers who have been impacted by loss of
land due to the NHBNR project.
In return for the inputs of group management, training, and the provision of credit the selected NGOs
can be paid by receiving a proportion of the net profit of the fishpond harvest. Alternatively a lease
arrangement of the fishfarm could be made in favour of the NGO who would be contracted to
provide a beneficiary group. Experience indicates that long term support from the NGO is required to
protect the rights of the beneficiary group, as well as supporting the marketing of produce. At the
present time there is no risk of market saturation for the products that will be generated by the
envisaged programs. Both fresh fish and vegetables are always in high demand. However, marketing
advice through the NGOs will be necessary to avoid exploitation of the beneficiary group by
middlemen.
Land Ownership and Leasing Arrangements for Rehabilitated Borrowpits
Beneficiary groups should be formed from members of the PAP community who live (or will live)
adjacent to the pit. If the beneficiary group is formed prior to rehabilitation of the borrowpit, they can
be actively involved in the development work (e.g. shaping the place of their new homestead area
adjacent to the ponds, see fig, p.64). In this way they are provided with short term income
opportunity while being allowed to develop a sense of group ownership. Aquaculture is quite
complex group activity and there is some evidence that successful groups are normally those which
have had chance to bond and work together. Thus the sooner groups are identified and formed the
greater the chance of success.
83

Organisation and Motivation of the PAPs to the New ][ncome Generating Programs
Aquaculture production requires a higher labour input than that necessary to achieve rice cultivation
on the same land area. It can also be combined with other activities such as ducks or livestock rearing
and vegetable growing. It can therefore provide more (approximately double) employment
opportunity than was available on the equivalent displaced area of rice paddy. A regular revenue for
approximately 6 beneficiaries per hectare can be provided. In addition improved nutritional inputs for
the group are achieved. The level of financial return is dependent on the system of production used
and the cash available for inputs.
The forestry action plan and revegetation scheme designed with this project offers the PAPs to
participate and benefit from a variety of long-term and sustaining income options. The local
population needs to be motivated and to be directly engaged in the revegetation scheme. Only by
securing their commitment to the goals of the forestry scheme for the protection of the road the
plan will have long-term success and the maintenance / replacement costs of the embankment
protection can be kept low.
It is therefore necessary to organise an efficient awareness program which will focus, among
others, to the benefits the PAPs eventually will gain in co-operating with the opportunities offered
by the project.
The entire income generating scheme (including the vast number of job opportuinities on the
construction sites and possibilities to develop certain skills) should, however, not exclude other
local inhabitants as direct participants and beneficiaries in some programs if they prove both
willingness and commitment.

10. Monitoring of the EMAP
10.1   Elements of Monitoring
Unlike civil engineering works which can readily be monitored for progress and success by
physical and financial measurements, environmental performance and associated development,
particularly in the long range, are difficult to monitor. Of prime concern will be the
(i)    Areas of intervention and application of environmental indicators
(as defined by the Environmental Team)
*     Elaborating the ToR and responsibilities for specific monitoring services
Monitoring during construction phase
*     Monitoring during operation phase
(ii)    Assignment of monitoring tasks
e     Environmental hazard monitoring
*     Environmental performance during the two project phases
*     MSI, performed by local NGO's
(iii)   Monitoring the training and personnel requirement
*      Scope

Principles for Fishpond Manageiment for
Rehabilitated Clay Borrowpits
Pond Preparation
Basically, the borrowpits which represent the structural basis of this aquaculture program will be
modified by the Contractor according to the specification provided in the Contract Documents*). As
such, all design features referring to pond bottom levelling, dikes, outlet and drainage structures will
be at the discretion of the Contractor's duties while completing the rehabilitation works. Thus, the
following is conceived on the assumption that the user group (fishfarmers being recruited from the
PAPs of this project) will receive a ready-made fish farm which can start immediate operation.
Among the pond preparatory steps, the new fish farmers will be required to
*  watering and tendering the newly planted vegetation on dikes. Additional turfing may be necessary
to give sufficient slope protection.
*  remove all predatory and other wild fish before stocking, otherwise mortality rates in fry or
fingerling may become unacceptably high.
e  take care not to overstock the ponds. If fish are stocked at nnore than 60/decimal then expensive
supplementary feeds will be required needed to give satisfactory growth rates.
Water Supply
Better fish production can be achieved if a water supply indepenident of rain and flooding is available.
For perennial ponds maintenance of the correct water level is necessary for good fish production while
for seasonal ponds the growing season may be considerably extended. The depth of water in the pit
depends on the following factors:
Physical depth of pond,
Depth of the water tabte,
Maximum depth of water at the end of the rainy season.
Evaporation loss (varies according to season/climate),
Seepage loss (varies according to soil quality),
Use of water for irrigation.
) Standard design features of borrowpit rehabilitated fishfarms:
Length of pit                     100 to 200 m
Width of pit                   :  max 50 m (to facilitate harvesting)
Dimension of rearing ponds        max 50 x 25 m (to facilitate harvesting)
Dimension of nursery ponds     :  10x 15 m
Depth of rearing ponds         :  max 2.5 m (depending on elevation)
Depth of nursery ponds            max 1.5 m (depending on elevation)
Pond bottom                       covered with clay to prevent losses due to seepage
levelled, with 5% sloping to outlet
Dike slope                     :  Sand                  1:3
Clay                 1:1M
Sandy Silt           1:2
exposed to wind/wave   1:5 (plus protection)
For drainable ponds            :  installation of drainage pipe, & harvest box
Slope preparation              :  Adding topsoil, clay & embankiment plantation, using
mix of useful plants, turfing and newly planted
grasses (see Chapter 8)
Water provision                :  if applicable, a tube-well will be sited close by;
minimum discharge 25 m3/hr to cope with
evaporation losses.
ANNEX -C, page    I



The seepage ioss of the pit or pond will reduce each successive year as a result of the accumulation of
organic wastes on the bottom, if semi-intensive fish culture practised. Seepage can be further reduced by
providing a layer of highly cohesive clay/organic soil on the bottom and submerged slopes of the pit.
The thickness of this layer must be at least 15 cm.
Planting high density Doncha on the bottom of a dried pit at the end of the dry season may also reduce
seepage by it's decomposition while over flooded. Doncha may also be mixed into the bottom soil by
ploughing.
A tube-well sited close to the pit is therefore highly desirable. Excess water from the tube-well can be
sold /used to support irrigation of the surrounding area. The minimum water discharge capacity should
be 25 cubic metres per hour, as in the month of April the evaporation loss can be as.high as 100
m3/ha/day.
Maintenance and Control of Water Quality
Part of the training and extension program which will be provided for the user group will be devoted to
regular water quality monitoring. The required water quality parameters for standard fishpond (carp
polyculture) operations are as follows:
Table C-1:    Required water quality for cultured fresh water fishes

Ferdlisation and Pond Treatmnent before Stocking
Only the use of appropriate fertilises such as cow dung, urea and T.S.P. is recommended. Application
should be at weekly doses for each pond. The colour of pond water should be as green as the colour of
grass. If it is less green add a little extra fertiliser next week. If it is more green then do not add any
fertiliser next week.
Generally, pond preparation should include the following applications
a)     Rotenone             50 g/decimal for each foot of water depth
b)     Lime                 I kg/decimal
c)     Urea                 200 g/decimal
d)     T.S.P.               100 g/decimal
or     e)     Cow dung              8 -10 kg/decimal for seasonal ponds
22 - 25 kg/decimal for nursery ponds
f)     Compost              15 - 20 kg/decimal
g)     Sumithion            8 ml/decimal for each m of water depth
For later weekly routine operation the following fertilising scheme proved to yield good results
(BAFRU, Northwest Fisheries Extension Project NFEP, 1995):
i)     Cow dung             8 -10 kg/dec/week
ii)    Urea                 75 g/dec/week
iii)    T.S.P               50 g/dec\week
iv)    If cow dung is not available, a further adding of 50 g of urea with 25 g T.S.P. per
decimal per week is recommended.
Choice of Species and Mode of Operation
Depending on the pond setting (seasonal or perennial culture piossibility) the choice might be either
polyculture (rearing) of fry or fingerlings to market-sized fish within one season, or to have a
combination of nursery and rearing ponds. In the second case, design provisions have to be made by
using the technical assistance of fisheries extension services to set up mini hatcheries for the nursery
purposes.
The choice of species depends on the availability of fry and fingerling, the expected growth rate and
the physiological properties of the species. In the NW Region, good results have been obtained with
polyculture of Major Indian and Chinese carps (BAFRU and Joyshagar Fish Farm experts, personal
communication). Carp polyculture, using several species each of which occupy a different
environmental niche in the pond, is recommended for both seasonal and perennial fresh water ponds.
Carp polyculture integrated with duck is another profitable approach because a high level of natural
foodstuffs of carp is provided by the duck droppings.
*) Note: Rotenone is available for pond preparation from the NFEP. However some farmers prefer
to use phostoxin tablets. In this event farners must be warned that phostoxin is poisonous
to humans and livestock. Phostoxin must be used very carefully and must not be stored in
the house. If used, I - 2 tablets are required for each foot of water depth.
ANNEX C, page 3



For the recommended aquaculture program, a combination of six species fulfils the criteria mentioned
above:
Catla:       Fast growing carp, abundant, river breeder, can reach 1.2 kg in one year; surface
water filter feeder (zooplankton), readily takes prepared feed.
Mrigal:       Slow growing Indian Carp, attains 500 g in first year. Bottom feeder, omnivore
(worms, decaying plant material, insects, zooplankton. Takes prepared feed and is
easy to spawn.
Rui:          Popular fish in NW Region; not so fast growing, attains 500 g after one year
under natural riverine conditions. Omnivore, feeds on a variety of plants and
insects, but also prepared feed. Reaches matarity at 2 kg after 2 years.
Silver Carp:   Adapted to a riverine life, introduced into Bangladesh in the 1970's. Successful
spawning of these species has been possible since the early 80's. Column
phytoplankton filter feeder; reaches a size of I - 2 kg in a year under good
conditions. The fish will not generally take pelleted foods but will take fine feeds
such as rice or wheat bran.
Grass Carp:   Stocked in ponds primarily for the control of aquatic weeds; feeding on soft
submerged or floating aquatic vegetation; capable to will take cut grasses due to
well-developed pharyngeal teeth. Requires atbout 40 - 60 kg of aquatic weeds to
reach 1 kg of weight, and can attain 2 - 3 kg in one year. If vegetation is not
available it will also feed on insects, worms and prepared feeds.
Common Carp: Introduced to Bangladesh in the 1960's. Orimivore bottom feeder on worms and
insects; can attain 1 - 1.5 kg in one year. Increases stirring up of surface bottom
layers and thereby enhances nutrient development and fish production. The fish is
easy to breed and unlike the Indian Major Carps or Chinese Carps will breed
naturally without application of hormones.
For further development of the aquaculture program, two more species might be considered which
have successfully been introduced for culture purpose in Bangladesh since more than 2 decades:
Tilapia:     Three types are common in Bangladesh (Mozambique Tilapia, Nile Tilapia and
Red Tilapia); Feed on a wide variety of plant and animal material including
phytoplankton (trapping in mucus produced on their gill rakers and then swallow
both mucus and plankton); able to cope with high stocking densities while
maintaining standard growth rates; capable to endure poor environmental
conditions such as high itemperatures and low oxygen. Breeds naturally and
proliferous in ponds.
7hai Shorputi: Fast growing, will reach market size in 4-6 mronths; Herbivorous, good growth on
duckweed diet; accepts supplementary food (rice bran). Best yields are obtained
when raised in monoculture.
ANNEX C, page 4



Stocking Rates
The rate of stocking depends on the type of pond operation (nursery / rearing), the fertility of the pond
and the measures adopted to increase the bioproductivity in the pond by manuring, fertilising and
supplemental feeding. Negative effects might be resulting from excessive stocking densities. For
rearing purposes, hood results are obtained with average stocking rates for carps of 5.000 - 6.000. fry
or fingerling per ha. Practical recommended (indicative) stocking rates for different types of culture
ponds are:
For NurserX Ponds                               for Seasonal Rearing Ponds
a) Carp species  20 g/decimal            a) Indian Major Carp 50 g/decimal
or b) Thai shorputi 10 g/decimal            b) Chinese Carp     lOg/decimal
Source of Fry and Fingerlings
As with most river breeders the carps specified for pond culture will not readily breed in ponds. Eggs
and milt are formed by the fish but they will spawn. The fish must Ibe induced to release eggs and milt by
hormone injections. However, hatcheries have now been established all over Bangladesh, which will
supply fish to local pond owners. In the Project Area, viable fry supply can be obtained from hatcheries
in Neemgachi (Joyshagar Fish Farm) and Ullapara.
Development of Carp Mini-Hatcheries
In addition to aquaculture development through the envisaLged aquaculture program may be
opportunities for the production of Carp and Tilapia fry and fingerlings. This would apply for most of
the newly established fishfarms as no other similar hatchery is within a range of 20 kilometres. The
additional costs of building a hatchery on a reshaped borrowpit are relatively small (Rajts, pers. comm.)
since a tube-well and fingerling / brood stock ponds will already available. Such hatcheries can
contribute substantially to the income of the user group, particularly in post-flooding conditions by
quickly producing fry and fingerlings to restock regional ponds. The work in this sector can also be
undertaken by women.
The basic criteria to develop a carp mini-hatchery are as follows:
*             The beneficiary group must be specially trained and routinely producing fish
fry and fingerlings.
*             A tube-well is required producing at least 50 m3/hr (0.5 cusec) of fresh water.
*             A 2 bigha pond is required for the carp mini Ihatchery. These should be sited
inside the fishfarm.
*             The construction cost for the carp mini hatchery is approximately 100.000
BDT excluding tube-well and ponds. The construction cost for the prawn
hatchery is 200.000 BDT excluding tube-welll and ponds.
For the first 3 years hatcheries require that an experienced fish culturist be
engaged. A target group member with low level of education can only
*             successfully operate a hatchery after approximately three years experience.
The output of a standard type carp mini-hatchery is 50,000,000 hatchlings per year from which
approximately 600 tonnes of table fish can be produced in 300 ha of local ponds.
ANNEX C, page 5



Supplementary Feed
Different feeding schemes are applicable in nursery and rearing ponds. The scheme depends on the
physiological requirement of the cultured organisms, adapted to their actual life stage.
Natural feed items collected from the vicinity (or planted dikes) are optimal to feed fish once or
twice per day. Thai Shorputi and Common Carp grow well on rice bran, duck weed and chopped
green leafy vegetables and banana leaves.
An exemplary feeding schedule in a nursery pond after sitocking is illustrated as below (Source:
BAFRU Northwest Fisheries Extension Project, 1995/96):
Day 1                    No feed.
Days 2 - 3               2 egg yolks + flour, at twice the weight of spawn or hatchlings
stocked. Divide the food into 2 halves and feed half early in the
. moring and half late in the afternoon.
... .. .. .. ..........   ....   _.....................................   ................................
Days 4 -7                Fine rice bran + mustard oil cake (in equal amounts) at five
times the weight of spawn or hatchlings stocked. Divide the food
into 2  halves and feed  half early  in the  morning  and  half late in
-                 . .       .      .      .     .       .     .      .      ..the afternoon ..
Week 2                   Fine rice bran etc. at 10 times the weight of spawn or hatchlings
stocked. Divide the food into 2 halves and feed half early in the
morning and half late in the aftemoon.
........................ ........... ............................. ........... ............................................................. .....................................
Week 3                   Fine rice bran etc. at 15 times the weight of spawn or hatchlings
stocked. Divide the food into 2 halves and feed half early in the
moming and half late in the afternoon.
Week 4                   Fine rice bran etc. at 20 times the weight of spawn or hatchlings
stocked. Divide the food into 2 halves and feed half early in the
morning and half late in the afternoon.
Week 5+                  Fine rice bran etc. at 3 - 7% of body weight of fish stocked-
Divide the food into 2 halves and feed half early in the morning
and half late in the aftemoon.
For a seasonal rearing pond, an exemplary feeding schedule after stocking would be like (NWFP):
1 st month              Rice Bran, 20 g 9 dec I day
2nd month             . Rice Bran, 25 g / dec / day

Thinning and Harvesting
All netting is executed by cast or seine net. The thinning and harvest scheme should be 20% of the
stocked fish in November, while selecting out the biggest fish and this will allow the smaller fish to
grow more quickly. Reducing the-number of fish in the pond will also help prevent the occurrence
and spread of disease. Generally, a mortality rate of more than 60% (at a culture period of 4-6
months) is desirable standard to be achieved in the envisaged aquiaculture program.
A typical thinning scheme in seasonal ponds, as propagated by the NFEP would be every 15 days,
stocked at 450 - 600/dec (15,000 - 20,000/bigha) into another pond.
In a season with early rains and no flooding, a pond can be used for two or crops.
Production Targets
The production target with carp polyculture in seasonal ponds should be, for the first year in the range
7-9.0 kg./dec, with possible increase in the subsequent years. I)etails on potential production rates,
including a breakdown of costs and benefits for 6 different types of fish culture are given in Annex D.
Flooding Risks
The Project Area is prone to intensive flooding. Therefore, one total loss of input and harvest should
be assumed when estimating return on investment for each 15 year period of operation due to
extraordinary flood events (e.g. the scenario following a break of the BRE). The quantity of actual fish
stock lost by migration will depend on the height and duration of the flood but under most
circumstances some residual stock would remain. At the same time the flood would allow an inward
migration of predatory fish into the fishfarm which cause further damage to stocks. In addition to loss
due to migration and the introduction of predators, some species are better able to adapt to sudden
environmental change than others. In this regard Tilapia are more resilient than the other species.
Disease
Good water quality management will normally prevent the outbreak of fish disease in ponds. To avoid
the introduction of infectious fish diseases and fish parasites to the pond, the source of fry or
fingerlings should be carefully checked. Under no circumstances should fry or fingerlings from natural
sources be used. Care should also be taken to prevent entry of water from adjacent lands since the
water may contain undesirable predators, competitive wild fishes, as well as infectious diseases.
Prevention of Theft
Theft of cultured fish stock is a major problem in Bangladesh. While physical measures are sometimes
used such as the use of twigs and branches to prevent netting, these frequently promote the
reproduction of parasites and are not recommended. It is advisable that provision is made for some
members of the target group to guard the pond on a 24 hour basis. Theft can reduced, however, when
beneficiaries are housed next to the fishfarm, as foreseen in the rehabilitation design of the borrowpits.
ANNEX C, page 7



Alternative Culture Techniques
The selection of fish species for culture is also dependent on the availability of fish seed, the demand in
the local market and the skills of the beneficiary group. Hence, culture of other and additional species
(e.g. Tilapia, Macrobrachium) and integrated agriculture/aquaculture schemes may remain for further
consideration when the aquaculture program has settled.
Other possibilities include Tilapia fish seed production which is relatively easy to be achieved without
building a hatchery since this species breeds naturally in pondls and borrowpits throughout the year. A
pond situated inside the fishfarm would give annual production of 5 to 8 tonnes per hectare (Rajts,
pers. comm.). This represents from 500,000 to 800,000 fingerlings which is enough to stock 25 to 40
ha of ponds. These figures assume 75 % will be fry / fingerlings and the remainder table fish. The pond
should be netted every two weeks to remove part of the Tilapia stock. Fingerlings of different sizes can
be selected by using different mesh sizes, and the larger ones over 50 gm would be sold as table fish or
breeders while those less than 10 gm would be sold to restock ponds.

1      Introduction - General
The environmental impacts of roads and highway construction are divided into two types. The first
type is the environmental impact during construction, maintenance or rehabilitation The second type is
the traffic using the road. E.g. (a) during construction phase and (b) during running phase. The
significant impacts are many, of which air pollution is prominent. Air pollution may affect air quality
of the road side areas causing adverse impacts upon natural environment and human health. Air
pollution may cause the diseases like allergy, asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, heart disease,
respiratory diseases, headache, cough, shortness of breath, pulmonary tuberculosis and aggravates the
sick persons already suffering from chronic bronchitis, coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular
diseases. So to protect the health of the recipients within the impact zone of two sides of the road
alignment, the assessment of traffic load and probable air pollution impacts at different stages deserve
detailed studies.
During construction phase the main pollutants are dust and black smokes from crushers, asphalt plants
and other construction equipment. During running phase, the pollutants are mainly from vehicular
traffic. The vehicle exhaust emissions are composed of CO, HC, NOx, lead compound, SO2 and
smoke which affects the community environrnent and human health. In Bangladesh, air pollution from
vehicle exhaust emission is particularly important in urban areas where thickness of traffic is high. In
rural areas where highways passing through villages with few sensitive areas this may not have yet
created major air pollution problems due to low traffic density. After bridging the existing big rivers
and canals and improvement of communication systems the traffic: density in rural areas is expected to
be increased and thus air quality of road side areas may be deteriorated by vehicle exhaust emission,
effecting the road side sensitive areas. Therefor air pollution deserves proper assessment and
appropriate mitigation measures is required.
2      Objectives
After the construction of the "Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project", traffic loads will be increased
considerably for the Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara road. Under the envirornmental issues in the ToR
special attention is asked for the pollution during the operation phase. The outcome of this study is to
be implemented in the environmental management and monitoring plan to reduce the adverse impact
of the construction of the road. This study also assesses the air po:llution during the construction phase.
3      Policy, Legal and  Administrative Frameworks on  Enviromnental Pollution
Control in Bangladesh.
The following policy papers, acts and standards are implemented in this study.
1)     Environmental policy 1992 and implementation activities Ministry of Environment and Forest,
Bangladesh.
In the above policy, the clause (4) and 11 mentioned regarding control of emitting smoke and
sound of motor vehicles, plying on the road, by controlling lead mixed patrol and sulfur
mixed diesel.

2)     Highway Act, 1925 and Amendment of the Act in 1994 (Ministry of Communication), Govt.
of Bangladesh.
In this Act, some rules have been framed on (a) new road construction,(b) maintenance, (c)
road boundary, (d) borrow pits etc. But nothing has been mentioned regarding environmental
pollution control of vehicular traffic.
Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has not yet framed any Acts or Rules and
regulation on air pollution and noise pollution control from road traffic. But a "Motor vehicle
Act" 1984, is under operation by the Road traffic sector at present. In chapter 10, Clause-
(139)-horn and noise, Clause (85)- & (142) speed lirnit, Clause (150)-black smoke emission,
Clause (154)-overweight etc. are relevant in connection with air pollution caused from
vehicular traffic, but it deserves strict enforcement to achieve the objectives.
3)     Draft Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) for Bangladesh prepared by the Department of
Environment, July 1991.
In this draft EQS standards have been set for air and Noise pollution. This is the first time in
Bangladesh to make such standards for such vital environmental issues. After approval of this
draft proposal by the government, Acts/Regulations will be framed for implementation.

4     Alignment Study.
The tentative alignment of this road project. recommended in the feasibility study report e.g. Route 1
has been optimized during this present study phase by an expert environmental team. The final
alignment has been studied in the light of air pollution and noise pollution impact zone up to 200 m
and 300 m respectively from the center of the road. During this ;study it was found that route corridor
of about 50 km in length and 100 m wide has crossed over the vast Chalan Beel area, affected mostly
paddy land with some 35 villages and 118 house holds or 60 homesteads. The impact zone of air
pollution of 600 m wide corridor has been surveyed and 590 households were recorded affecting
3,540 people approximately with few schools without any health center, hospitals, and archeological
spots. The field survey result has been shown in Table 1. Again a key map of route corridor showing
the impact zone of air and noise pollution is shown in Figure 1.

5      Air Pollution Impacts
Air pollution impacts caused by the new road project are assessed in two stages such as: (i) during
construction phase (temporary impact) and (ii) during running phase (permanent impact).
5.1    During Construction Phase (Temporary inpact)
Type of air pollution during construction:
a)     Dust raised from earthwork activities and unpaved road surface
b)     Dust raised from crushing of rocks and bricks and asphalt mixing.
c)     Smoke from the asphalt plants, earth carrying vehicles and construction equipment and
machinery.
*      Soil dust:- The soil dust is raised during earth filling of road embankment and from the
unpaved road surface blown by the vehicles. This can pose health hazard to the road side
people till the road pavement is completed. Dust is a real health hazard and should be
minimized as far as possible. Soil dust-also affects the :road side vegetables, fruit trees and
agricultural crops etc. which effects the earning sources of the road side people.
*      ..Dust:- Dust is also raised from other road construction activities at sitedue to equipment and
especially by rock and brick crushing. This has impact on the occupational health of the work
site laborers and other people in the environment.
-      Black smoke:- Black smoke and vehicle exhaust emission may be caused fromvarious
vehciles, construction equipment, asphalt plants etc. cluring the whole road construction
period. This air pollution has direct impact upon the occupational health plus the community
health of the project site..
5.2    During Running Phase (permanent impacts)
During running phase the main sources of air pollution will be from (a) Road transport emission from
the vehicular traffic.
5.2.1 Motor Vehicle Exhaust Emissions.
The combustion of fossil fuels with air produces mainly carbon di-oxide (CO2), Nitrogen Oxides
(NOx) and Water (H20). But combustion engines are not perfectly efficient, so some fuel is not burnt
or only partly burnt which results the following pollutants in the exhaust emission;
a)     Carbon di-oxide              CO2
b)     Nitrogen Oxides              NOx
c)     Assorted Hydrocarbons        HC
d)     Carbon Mon-oxide             CO
e)     Lead Compounds               Pb
f)     Black smoke                  (soot)

DHV CES DDC DUL
g)    Sulfur di-oxide      (SO2)
Out of above pollutants, petrol-powered motor vehicles discharges CO, CO2, NOx, HC and lead
compounds which take part in chemical rea_tion with the influence of sunlight and produce secondary
pollutants whose environmental effects are different. Some of which are more severe than those of
primary pollutants.
But diesel engines, an attractive alternative to petrol powered motor vehicles in many countries, have
the advantage that they produce virtually no hydrocarbon (HGC) that can take part in photo-chemical
reactions and no carbon monoxide (CO). But they can produce black smoke, SO2, odour and noise.
5.2.2 Exhaust Emission Characteristics.
The typical speed related emissions of CO., CO2 and HC from light duty petrol vehicle were found
highest in congested and slow moving traffic, while the highest emission of NOX are found during
high speed driving conditions. However large variation in emission rate results from the engine
condition and nature of maintenance. The motor vehicle ernission pattern is shown in TABLE 2
below.

5.2.3 Effect of Pollutants upon Environment.
i)     Lead Compound
Tetra-alkyl lead compounds have been added to petrol since past to improve its combustion properties.
To clear the lead compound residuals from the engine scavengers are also added, which react with the
lead additives during combustion to form relatively volatile lead compounds that are expelled in the
exhaust gas. The inorganic lead compounds are emitted as fine particles which can penetrate deep into
the lungs and ultimately into blood and other body tissues. On the other hand a small portion of lead

compound is emitted as volatile organic lead compounds which are very toxic and rapidly absorbed by
the body as they dissolve in fats.
ii)    Carbon Mon-oxide (CO)
Out of total vehicle emission, CO holds the highest percentage. It is rapidly absorbed by the blood,
reducing its oxygen carrying capacity. It is relatively stable compound that takes part very slowly in
atmospheric chemical reaction. It contributes indirectly to the green house effect by depleting
atmospheric levels of hydroxyl radicals.
iii)    Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)
This pollutants is emitted as nitric oxide (NO). In the air it is oxidized into Nitrogen di-oxide (NO)
which is very toxic, affecting the respiratory system. NOx is important in atmospheric Chemistry
contributing to "photo-chemical smog" formation and acid deposition. Nitrous oxide (No) is a very
powerful green house gas.
iv)    Assorted Hydro Carbons (HC)
This volatile compound are created by the incomplete combustion of fuel and a mixture of all organic
compounds emitted and embraces many hundreds of different compounds. Some are toxic and
carcinogenic. Their reactivity varies widely but they are important precursors of photo-chemical
smog, acidic and oxidizing compounds. The composition of HC emission is strongly influenced by the
composition of the fuel.
v)     Smoke (particle matter)
The black smoke are mainly emitted from diesel vehicles and are carbon particles into which a wide
range of organic and other compounds are absorbed. Diesel exhaust particle in very high
concentration causes lung cancer. They have a high staining power on soils, buildings and other
materials.
vi)    Sulfur di-oxide (SO2)
This pollutant is emitted from the diesel vehicle, linked to the sulfur contained in the fuel. This can
remain in the atmosphere from a few hours to several weeks. SO:, is a water soluble gas that act as a
powerful irritants to the mucous membranes of the eyes and the upper respiratory tract causing cough,
shortness of breath and spasm of the larynx.
vii)   Carbon- di-oxide(CO2)

It is a major product of the combustion of all carbon containing materials. But very minor percentage
of C02 is produced from motor vehicle. It is considered to be the least harmful of the major
greenhouse gases, for a given volume but the largest contributor to total greenhouse gases in the
atrnosphere
5.2.4 Air Pollution Standard of Bangladesh
The air pollution is caused from different sources such as: (i) Motor vehicle exhaust emission (ii)
industrial emissions (iii) emission from different types of plants, factories and workshops. (iv) and
obnoxious odour from different raw material processing industries such as tannery processing
industry, fish processing industries, wastage of slaughter houses, solid waste dumping depots, night
soil trenching grounds etc. Out of above sources, the air pollution by motor vehicle emission and
industrial pollution topped the list. The motor vehicles emit CG, NOx, HC, S02 and smoke which are
most detrimental to human health. The industrial plants emit S02 and emission of toxic substances etc.
the concentration level of all the air pollutants when increases in the air, this affect human health by
increasing mortality and morbidity of the related diseases.
Many developing countries fixed allowable limits of concentration of air pollutants particularly for
GO, NOX, HC, SO2 and smoke etc. to protect the human health. But these standard values vary
country to country due to different factors such as geographic position, climate, tolerance habit of the
people etc. Air quality standards of different countries and organizations are shown in the Table - 3.

In Bangladesh no such air pollution standard has yet been sel: up for the safety of the human health,
particularly in urban areas. But the DOE, Bangladesh prepared one draft EQS, 1991 wherein (a)
ambient air Quality standard and (b) Motor vehicle emission standard have been set up, as shown in
Table 4 and Table 5.
To assess the total emission concentration and the quantity of pollutants emitted per year, no standard
vehicle emission rate for both LDV and HDV has been determined in Bangladesh. As such air
pollution assessment study of any new road project in this country is difficult and no other solution
remains than following the standard procedures of other countries where intensive research of air
pollution by vehicles has been executed..

6      Air Pollution Assessment for Traffic
After construction of the Jamuna bridge, road traffic in the project area will be increased. The traffic
load per day has been assumed from the traffic survey of the feasibility study, 1993 and in the Traffic
Survey as executed under this project. Air pollution assessment has been done for three traffic load
criteria as follows:
Case-I        Base year traffic-1993 (without Jamuna Bridge);
Case-2        Base year traffic + Jamuna. Bridge - Aricha Ferry, (1996) and
Case-3        Base year traffic + Jamuna Bridge - Aricha Ferry, (2015)
(a summary of traffic survey is given in Table-6).

To asses the air pollution it is essential to know when the severest pollution will take place.
The Traffic study has made a forecast for 20 years. Technology on cleaner vehicles has progressed
rapidly over the last decades and it might be expected that the emission of pollutants per vehicle will
decrease. It can be expected that with the current rate of air pollution in Bangladesh and especially in
Dhaka, very soon the GoB has to take measures to reduce emission. Most of the cars now available in
Bangladesh are able to use lead-free petrol and in the future it will even be that the fuel injection
system of a new vehicles is to be changed to accommodate leaded fuel. This will automatically
introduce lead-free petrol in Bangladesh.

As it is the intention of the GoB to implement measures to reduce the axle load to the legal limits,
automatically the truck engines are less overloaded and the ejection of unburned fuel will be reduced.
It is also expected that with an improved infrastructure the type of vehicles will change and the
number of trucks with more than two axles and greater engine output (Horse Power) will be increase.
This will renovate the national truck park and consequently the fuel efficiency of the engines will be
improved.
On the other hand it is expected that the traffic will rapidly increase as shown in table -6.
Air pollution will have its greatest impact in zones where speed is low or zero and where different
traffic flows come together. The queuing of traffic and slow movement of vehicles at this junction will
emit maximum exhaust emission resulting high pollution concentration in this vicinity, affecting the
surrounding recipients. The pollutants will disperse rapidly within a close proximity to the road where
duration of exposure is likely to be prolonged affecting the susceptible people. Thus, the junctions
with busstops at Hatikamrul and Bonpara are the most affected places. Second in line will be the
junctions along the road side to villages and towns like Baraigram etc. Therefor the first air pollution
assessments are based on the situations prevailing on the Hatikamrul and Bonpara roundabouts.
For this air pollution assessment a speed of 10 km/hr over a distance of 100 m at each side having
receptor distance 40 m from the center of the road surface, have been considered. This assessment has
been made both for (a) Localized air pollution assessment and (b) Overall air pollution assessment
following the standard procedure of "Design Manual for Road and Bridges, Vol.-11, Environmental
Assessment, Department of Transport, UK-1993"
6.1    Localized Air Pollution
In this localized air pollution assessment, the vehicle emission concentration of CO, HC and NO, is
calculated both for light duty petrol car and heavy duty vehicles on the basis of standard graphs, tables
at multiple stages. The main criteria of this assessment procedure is the values for no of vehicles as
given in table 6 per day at the speed of 10 km/hr; from which concentration at design speed and
distance has been assessed per vehicle and then adjusting the result with the US National Ambient Air
Quality Standard. The fmnal result of assessment is presented in table below:

The assessment shows that the emission concentration level at different stages of traffic flow is
substantially below the now prevailable standards.
6.2    Overall Air Pollution
In this assessment, the net contribution to overall changes in air quality after the completion of the
project, has been forecast. As no emission rate (g/km) for vehicles of Bangladesh is available. The
annual volume of emission of CO, HC, NOx has been determined following the standard emission
rates of UK. for 1990 for light-duty petrol car and heavy duty vehicles diesel trucks, operating with an
av. speed of 80 km/hr. The net effect of the scheme on total traffic emissions is presented in table
below:
TABLE- 8    Annual Vehicle Exhaust Emission
Total emission (ton/year)        Remarks
CO            HC            NOX
Case-1. 1993         16.16          1.1.34         4.08
Case-2. 1996         18.48          12.27          4.48
Case-3. 2015         45.88          29.45         11.00
The result of annual volume to emission shows that the quantities increased with the increase of traffic
load at different stages of the project. The emission rate will be reduced appreciably due to change of
fuel specification, modification of engine design and replacement of old vehicles by new vehicles with
improved engines. But this assessment has been made considering the emission factors of 1990 to
1995 of U.K, adjusting to Bangladeshi vehicles extending up to 2015. Because old vehicles of 10 to 15
years of age will ply on the road of this country for future decades without any significant changes.

But this annual emission rate may be reduced if the condition of engines are improved along with strict
enforcement of existing rules and regulation.
7.    Mitigation Measures
The air pollution impacts caused by the road project, can be mitigated or reduced as follows:
7.1    During Construction Phase
i)     Soil dust:- This pollutants is raised from earth fills and unpaved road surfaces. As a
mitigatory measures, water spraying required to be done, by the contractor during the dry
period from time to time. The embankment is to made with (hydraulic) sand fill. Sand is
courser than silt and/or clay and as such contains less fine elements. This type of embankment
construction will reduce the air pollution considerably. As the sand is gained by hydraulic
dredging, the sand is wet and thus only a little dust will be thrown in the air. Transport by
axle is minimized and as such the soil dust pollution.
ii)    Dust:- Dust is raised while crushing stone and/or bricks. During crushing water should be
added to catch the dust. The cleaning of construction equipment at site can be mitigated by
doing cleaning work in the night and by putting necessary covering. Asphalt plant are to be
furnished with the necessary dust collecting equipment.
iii)    Black smoke:- This pollutant may be caused from asphalt plant and other construction
equipment at site. As a mitigatory measures asphalt pLnts are to be set at a vacant place on
the road alignment, not in the neighborhood of settlements. Smoke emitted from the plant may
disperse in the vast air without affecting any recipients of the area. A efficient burning of the
fuel is required and environmental friendly production is to be prescribed in the tender
documents.
Burning of bricks is avoided as no burnt brick gravel is taken up in the construction. This will
reduce emission of black smoke in the vicinity of the project.
The above temporary impacts can be managed by the contractors at site and these can be included in
the tender documents as a special terms and condition in the contract of the implementation phase. The
supervision is to adhere strictly to these prescriptions.

7.2    During Running Phase
Different factors influence the air pollution from traffic. The condition and the tuning of the engine
has an important impact on the emission of pollutants. Also certain design measures can influence
emission of air pollutants. If motor vehicles can maintain a constant speed, pollution will be less from
hydro carbons. A slow traffic lane is suggested for maintaining a constant speed of vehicles.
7.2.1 Measures to be taken by the GoB
Reducing air pollution from vehicles is to be regulated by law and strict enforcement of these laws. It
is beyond the capacity of the Consultants to implement these laws. However the Consultants have
recommended in their report for enforcing the existing regulations and laws. Nevertheless, to reduce
air pollution from traffic, the competent authorities should implement air pollution measures by strict
enforcement of existing environmental policy, Rules and Regulation of Motor vehicles Acts, Traffic
Rules and EQS of DOE Bangladesh as follows:
(i)    Motor vehicle emission rate :- This may be controlled by annual vehicle test from a
standard testing laboratory to enforce the EQS standards.
ii)    Changing fuel specification :- The use of Lead and sulfur mixed fuels may be
controlled gradually to make the vehicle exhaust emission free from poisonous lead
compounds and SO2.
iii)    Speed limit :- High speed emits more NOx gasses from a vehicle, which causes
serious environmental impacts. Maximum vehicle speed should be limited in the
highway, to reduce the extent of NOx pollutants.
7.2.2 Measures to be taken in the Design
Mitigation measures to reduce the impact of air pollution by vehicles can be implemented in the
design. As shown in Table-2, the emission quantity per lkm is considerably reduced if a constant
average speed is maintained. To remove the slow traffic from the mainroad, acceleration and
deceleration of the fast traffic is reduced and consequently dte emission quantities of hydro carbons. If
constant speed is maintained the dispersion of pollutants covers a larger area due to the generated air
movement by the vehicles.

Vegetation acts as a good filtering media for air pollution. It traps particles and dust of air and can
reduce the envirornmental impacts. Thus planting of vegetation along the two sides of the road may be
implemented as a best mitigation measures to reduce the impact The local species of trees which are
bushy and of medium height (3 to 6 m), like acacia, tamarind, badam, banyan, pakur, karoi,
mahogany, shishu, rendi, latim mongosteen, bokul, uri-gab, dumur, khaibabla and neem, are
recommnended for plantation in rows at the embankment of the road. The Consultants will implement
adequate embankment afforestation in the Contract.
A notion of filtering role of road side vegetation is shown in Fig - 2.

8      Conclusion
Air pollution assessment of this new roacl project has been made in accordance with the guidelines of
the 'Design Manual for Roads and Bridges", Environmental Assessment, Departrnent of Transport
UK, 1993. The vehicle emission rate of UK. is not equivalent to Bangladeshi vehicles because about
90% vehicles of Bangladesh are of 10 to 15 years of age. These vehicles plying the roads emit
excessive exhaust from unburned fuels. Such status of vehicles is expected to continue in this country
for several decades. So the emission rates of UK. 1990, 1993 and 1995 have been used, equivalent to
Bangladeshi vehicles for the year 1993, 1998 and 2020 respectively to make this assessment more
viable. Again by optimization of the road alignrment, very less numbers of villages have been
intersected, leaving minimal recipients within the impact zone of 300 m from the center of the road.
This has been confirmed by the detailed field survey of impact zone for air pollution and noise
pollution. The result of air pollution assessment raised from the road traffic, for critical condition,
shows the concentration level of air pollutants are substantially much lower than the UK.Standard at
the different stages up to the predicted period 2015. Moreover, adopting possible mitigation measures
and its strict enforcement, as suggested,, will be quite sufficient to protect the community environment
along this road side area, for the near future.

1     Introduction
Noise pollution is a problem for populated urban areas. The sources of noise are many in the city, of
which noise from vehicular traffic, industrial plants, mechanical workshops, construction sites and
other man-made activities are notable. The road traffic noise has been recognized as a significant noise
pollutant for community environment. Noise pollution has an adverse impact on the human health,
affecting the people mentally, physiologically and sociologically. In Bangladesh, traffic noise pollution
is becoming problematic in big cities like Dhaka and other major cities, due to rapid population
growth and increase of vehicular traffic. In rural areas, noise pollution has not yet become a problem,
because of thin population and low traffic flow.
To meet the growing demand of the increasing population all over the country, the traffic is increasing
on the existing national highways for transporting necessary commodities everyday from one place to
another. In Bangladesh heavy duties vehicles like trucks and buses are found more in number on the
road than light vehicles. Moreover, majority of these heavy vehicles are 10 to 15 years old with poor
engine condition, which produce more noise during their movement.
With the completion of Jamuna Bridge, the new road under study will have an almost similar traffic
load as the Jamuna Bridgealong with overall increase of traffic load in the road network of this North-
Bengal zone. So, the noise level from road traffic will be invariably increased along this alignment. A
key map showing location of the proposed Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road is shown in Appedix
C. Besides this, new road project will cause temporary noise impact during construction phase. The
people living along the road side will have to face discomfort out of these noise impacts, during the
above mentioned two phases, These impacts requires a detailed study for the interest of conmmunity
health of the project area.
2      Perception of Noise and Measurement Units
The response of the ear to noise depends on the sound pressure. The intensity of the response is
related to the logarithmic function of a sound pressure. The amplitude of audiabie pressure 2 x 10-5
2
N/mi is considered as the weakest sound pressure dectectabe by an human ear under very quiet
condition and maximum sound level is considered above 103 N/M2. By taking logarithms of these two
levels, scale is reduced to 0 to 15 Bels or 0 to 150 deci-bels or dB. The notion of decibel is
insufficient to take the sound sensation efficiently perceived by the human air into account. To take
sensitivity of the human ear into consideration, a series of weighing filters has been developed, out of
which weight "A" filter has a wide spread use. Therefore, the dBA scale (decibel with A weighing)

enables a sound or a noise to be synchronized by taking the reactions of the human ear into account.
In practice, a noise level from 30 to 50 dB(A) considered as ambient level of a calm surroundings.
Again the frequency of sound is the rate at which a sound wave oscillates, measured in number of
cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). With regard to frequencies, the auditory field of the human ear
extends from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Hearing sensitivity increases with the higher number of hertz and
reduces with the low number of Hertz. The threshold of hearing varies with the frequency of sound.
But the characteristics of audiable threshold is that it differs very little between 1,000 Hz. and 4,000
Hz. The audibility threshold at 4,000 Hz. is such that it occurs in the early stage of hearing
impairment.
Again, the noise from a traffic stream is not constant but varies from moment to moment and as such
it is necessary to use an index to arrive at a single figure estimate of the overall noise level for
assessment purposes. The index adopted by the U.K. government to assess traffic noise is LAIO,18 h,
which is the arithmetic means of the noise levels exceeded for 10% of the time in each of 18-one hour
period between 6 am. and midnight. This index showed a very good correlation between resident's
dissatisfaction with the existing traffic noise.
The index LAeq is the equivalent continuous sound level, used for measuring fluctuating noise, for
example to assess noise from construction and demolition sites and from railways and aircrafts.
A scale which is sometirnes used to describe background noise levels is LA90, which is the level
exceeded for 90%  of the time. This index may give a mcre realistic indication of noise changes in
rural areas at a considerable distance from a new road because the main noise effect is likely to be on
background noise level. But its usefulness is uncertain at the present time.
Out of above sound measuring scales, L.q of dBA scale is suitable for measuring traffic noise. Road
noise is variable in the course of time, and it is not possible to express all these sound frequencies by
an instantanious level. Therefor, road noise is characterized by a mean value over a given time. L.q
(equivalent acoustic level) is the sound level of a stable noise which contains the same energy as the
variable noise over the same period. It represents the mean of the acoustic energy perceived during the
period of observation. The period usually considered is that from 08.00 hrs. to 20.00 hrs. The
equivalent acoustic level will be Leq (08.00 hrs.-20.00 hrs.). Sound level measured in dBA scale,
caused from different sources, at different environments are presented in the Figure-2 and Figure-3.

2.1           Road Noise Sources and Characteristics.
2.1.1         Sources
The main sources of road noise, is caused by the vehicular itraffic and the traffic noise is again
influenced by the factors as follows:
a)     Noise from engine, exhaust pipe and horns
b)     Density of traffic flow
c)     Noise from vehicle speed (wind)
d)     Noise of rolling tyres on the road surface
e)     Road surface characteristics and road gradients
2.1.2         Road Noise Characteristics.
On road noise characteristics the following remarks are applicable:
i)            The noise from a traffic flow is not constant but varies from moment to moment and
thus          road noise is characterized by a mean value over a given time. The equivalent,
acoustic      level (Leq) is a stable noise level which contains the same energy as the variable
noises        over the same period.
ii)           The traffic noise at a particular reception Tpoint, received from  many vehicles at
different     distances for a given time, do not add up according to conventional arithmetic rules,
since         the decibel is a logarithmic function of the acoustic pressure.
iii)          Propagation of traffic noise to a reception point depends on the characteristic of the
surroundings such as obstructing walls, fencing, barricades, soils, wind and climatic
conditions.
iv)           The sound level decreases with the distances. Any doubling of distance of a linear
source        is expressed by reduction in the sound level of 3 dBA.
v)     Doubling the energy level (for example, the volume of traffic) increases noise level by 3
dBA.

3      Effects of Road Noise Upon Human Health.
The effects of noise have been recognized as a significant impact on the community environment and
also on human health. The impact from noise pollution has a long-term effect which can be perceived
very slowly in course of time. The effect of road noise upon human health can be manifested in
number of ways, such as auditory fatique, loss of sleep, mental stress, increase of heart diseases,
increased of blood pressure, diminution of hearing communication etc.
4      Standards for Noise Pollution:
Normally 50 dBA is considered as standard value for noise pollution by the international experts e.g.
WHO experts but L,q of 60 dBA may be considered as maximum limitation value for rural areas as
suggested by the experts of World Bank's Environmental Department, USA, 1992.
With the rapid development of the infrastructure in Bangladesh, the traffic load has been increasing
both on the urban roads and on the highways passing through the rural areas. In trunk roads the
percentage of HDV is higher than the LDV. This implements also that the road noise level is
increasing more than average every year. To control the ever-growing problem of noise pollution in
Bangladesh, the DOE has promulgated an Ambient Noise Standard Level for Bangladesh and noise
standard level for vehicles, in 1991. These are presented in Table-1 and Table-2 below.

S     Alignment Study
i)    Horizontal alignment:
The route alignment of this new road project of about 54 kcm. in length. For this study it is divided
into two sections, notably:
(i)    section 1 from Chanaige 0 to 4+000, (this portion starts from the existing Nalka bridge and
ends   at the Hatikamrul junctions.
(ii)   section 2, Chanaige 4+000 to 54 +000 (e.g. from Hatikamrul junction to Bonpara junction).
Section 2 is a new to be constructed road. This alignment passes through vast Chalan beel area passing
a few scattered villages. Therefore, most of the alignment will not have any recipients for noise
pollution within impact zone of 300m width, at both sides of the road except the villages involving 484
households and 2904 people approx. and 2: rural primary schools.
ii)    Vertical aligmnent:
The vertical alignment of the route corridor has been surveyed and it was observed that the ground
elevation of villages is 10.85 RL (PWD) average as per recent topographic survey record, The
proposed road surface level will be 13.70 RL average (PWD). Therefore, there will be a level
difference of approx. 3 m. between the road surface and the existing households, along two sides of
route corridor. This has a great influence of noise impacts upon the recepients along the road sides, as
shown in a picture below.

6      Noise Impact Assessment, For the Proposed New Road Project.
The proposed new road project generates noise pollution in two phases:
*      during the construction phase
*      during the running phase
6.1    During construction phase
During this phase, the main sources of noise pollution can be divided into two components.
(a)    earth embanlanent construction as per geometric design of road which include earth
excavation, carrying, dumping, compaction, levelling, etc.
(b)    road pavement works which include stone crushing, paving, levelling, etc.
For the above two components of works the following construction equipments, machineries, plants
and vehicles will be used e.g. excavator, bulldozer, grader, sheep-foot roller, earth removing trucks,
stone crushing plants, pile driving equipments, road roller, aphalt mixing plants etc. The activities of
above construction equipment will continue for a period of 3 years (approx.) and will create noise
pollution, affecting the occupational health of the site labours andi surrounding environment. The noise
produced during the construction phase will not be constant but of intermittent nature, ranging from 70
dBA to 90 dBA (approx.). This will create discomfort and sleep disturbances to the working staff at
site plus surrounding people, inflicting adverse impact upon their health.
6.2    During the Running Phase.
During running phase, the main source of noise will be from traffic. This has been discussed in details
in para (2.1) of this report. This traffic noise will be of permanent nature. The intensity of noise level
will vary with the traffic density, speed of vehicles and distance of the recipients from the noise
sources.
6.2.1 Stages in the Assessment of Noise Impacts.
Stage-I: indentification of ambient noise level in the project area before construction
Ambient noise level is defined as the level of noise in an area before the change produced by the
scheme. It may include traffic noise, as well as noise from other sources.

As the new road alignment is passing through a thinly populated rural area, including vast agricultural
land. At present there is practically no traffic noise perceived around the route corridor, except few
motor-cycles, and bullock-carts in the day time. In the night there is almost quiet except noises from
some domestic and wild animals and birds. Therefore, the ambient noise level will be very normal
similar to 40 dBA and 30 dBA for the day and night respectively, as per standard sound level chart
shown in figure-2.
Stage-Il: identification of noise related sensitive locations within impact zone
The noise impact zone is delineated by a 300 m wide strip from the centre of the road at both sides.
This 600 m wide band is considered as the impact zone. Each 300 m strip is divided into 3 parts of
100 m each. The strip neares to the centreline is again divided into two parts, one of 40 m and one of
60 m with the 40 m wide strip closest to the centreline. Thus creating four strips at each side of the
centre line, notably:
A   0-40m
B     40 - 100 m

Stage-Ill: Identification of traffic on the proposed new road.
The rural people living within the impact zone of the road alignment are experienced with the ambient
noise of rural areas at present. After the construction of this new road, the vehicle movement will
start on this road with a certain volume of traffic per day. This traffic density will be increased
gradually within the space of time in future. To assess road noise level, the role of this traffic load per
day or traffic density per hour, speed of vehicles, types of vehicles etc. are very essential. The traffic
load at different stages, assessed for this proposed road by the traffic studies, have been collected in
connection with noise impact assessment, is presented in the Table4 below:

Stage IV      Forecasting of Noise Level and Measurement For This New Road Project
To forecast the noise level of the new road, the basic data were obtained by using formulae developed
by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), Department of Environment, under the
Department of Transport, UK, 1977.
Secundary data were like wind impact were calculated following (I) the guidelines of the World
Bank's e.g. practical guide - Technical data Sheet On Road Infrastructures, 1992, (ii) Design Manual

consulting the related data, charts, tables, figures, reports of above agencies and collecting
informations from other secondary sources the noise impact studies has been performed as follows:
The noise level can be determined in L1o (18 hrs.) of dBA scale and L1o (I hr.) of dBA scale by the
following formulae:
LIO (18hrs.) =  - 40.7 +  10 log10 Q+  33 loglo (V+40+500/V) +  10. log10 (1+5
p/v)+0.2G .... (1)
and
L1O (1 hrs.) =  - 27.6 +  10 loglo q+  33 log2o (V+40+500/V) ±  10 log1o (1+5
p/v)+0.2G ... (2)
Whereas:
L1o (18 hrs.)    av. LIo for the hours between 0600 to 2400 hrs.
Q             = Total traffic flow between 0600 hr. to 2400 hrs.
L1O (1 hr.)   = LIo level for any one hr.
q               Total traffic flow in the hour considered.
V             = Mean traffic speed in km/h.
p             = Percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic flow.
G             = Gradient of the road expressed in %.
Considering the following values for this proposed new road,
1996          2015
Q =   Total traffic load/day        =     4006           10915
V =   Mean traffic velocity/h       =     50 km          60 km
p =    % heavy vehicle              =     75%            75%
q =    Traffic flow/hour            =     223            608

The value of Llo (18 hrs.) for 1996. Comes 70.92 dBA and 76.33 dBA for the year 2015. These
values may be considered at the edge of the road. To determine the noise levels at distances, it
involves some other factors such as distance correction factors, vertical alignment factor, effects of
soil, air and wind etc.

In this new road project, the traffic density has been considered for the year 1996 (considering as
opening year) and predicted density in the year 2015 as described in stage - 3 of this report. The
percentage of heavy vehicles has been considered as 75% for the year 1996 and 2015 respectively.
Average speed of traffic flow have been considered 50 km/h and 60 km/h for the year 1996 and 2015
respectively. Considering the above criteria for the proposed traffic flow, this has been compared with
sound level contour ranges chart of TRRL (Shown in Appendix-A) and contour ranges of sound level
prepared for the Jamuna Bridge Access Road Project, 1996 (Shown in Appendix-B), a forecasted
noise level contour ranges for this New Road Project has been prepared as shown in Table-5.

For this study, 50 dBA noise level has been considered as standard level for rural residential areas in
Bangladesh. In the year 1996, the noise level L1O (18 hrs.) of 70 dBA may be produced at the road
edge. Due to its lower intensity as result of low traffic density and traffic velocity, this level is further
reduced with the distances and 50 dBA will be perceived at 200 m distance only.

DHV CES DDC DUL
In the year 2015, the noise level L1o (18 hrs.) of 76 dBA is produced at the road edges, but as its
intensity is higher due to its higher traffic density and higher speed, the noise level of 50 dBA may be
perceived at distance 300m. A key map showing the impact zone of the proposed road along with a
motion of impacts of noise pollution, is shown in Appendix-C.
The recipients within first 100 m strip is about 93 households, they will get a noise impact of 55 dBA
in the starting year of this project and 60 dBA in the predicted year 2015, which are within the
ambient standard level of Bangladesh.
7     Noise Mitigation Measures
The mitigation measures can be adopted to reduce the noise level caused
(i) during construction phase and
(ii) during running phase for the new road project
(i)    During construction phase
-      EEar muffs to the site workers should be provided by the employer(s) along with providing
shielding for generators compressor and other construction equipments and silencer boxes in
trucks and other equipments where applicable.
Construction materials should be handled in day time and not at night time.
Noisy operations like pile driving, crsrushing, etc. should be restricted to day time only.
(ii)    During running phase:
By the GoB:
To control induced development along the road sides, Highway Act, 1993, for land use
control, to avoid constructions within 10 m from the road boundary.
To enforce the existing Motor Vehicle act and the standard setforth by the DOE to control
vehicle sounds in the road.
-     To control or banning of loud air horns which are conunonly used by buses and truck
By the Consultants to be implemeted in the design:
-     By optimizing the horizontal alignment to avoid households and sensitive locations to save
them from noise pollution.

Plantation with trees and bushes on the earth mounds along the road in front of sensitive
locations and households, may reduce the noise pollution to some extent.
8      Conclusion
Road noise is recognized as a source of pollution to the community environment. This problem has a
permanent nature affecting people living along the road side. Noise pollution is a relative new issue in
this country and DOE has not yet developped any approved methods for assessment of road noise
except direct measurement of sound level at different points by noise level meter. Again no data in
relation between noise level and distances are available in Bangladesh. So to perform the noise
pollution study for this road project, the standard methods of World Bank's practical guide line,
Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Vol XI, Env. assessment, Department of Transport, UK, 1993
and TRRL, Department of Enviroment, Departrnent of Transport, UK (TRRL Supplementary Report
425, 1978, for rural traffic noise prediction were followed.
The protective measures for reducing the noise impact for rLral areas have been suggested of which
vehicle maintenance and annual testing of motor vehicle should have the priority for strict enforcement
to achieve the DOE's Standards for sound level for vehicles.
The noise level of road traffic may rise fromn 70 dBA to 80 dBA at road at the road side, but this noise
is not constant and moreover the households along the road sides are located at appreciable distances,
so this road traffic noise may not have so much effect on the rural people except a discomfort of
tolerable nature. Regarding for the predicted year 2015; although the traffic volume will be increased
by several times compared to the base year, the noise level will not increase by more than 3 dBA and
will still remain within the currently accepted limits.
