FOREWORD
This review is based on the preliminary environmental assessment, completed in September
is by its nature an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), and the draft Environmental
Management Plan for the Rehabilitation of Dhaka-Sy,het Road compieted by Mouchel &
Partners Ltd. in February 1998.
Following the mandate given by the Bank and the Client the other two RRMP3 components
referring to the Environmental Management Plans for both Feeder Road A and Dhaka-
Sylhet Road were reviewed and consolidated. The review was undertaken following the
Bank's and the Client's instructions and guidance by the environmentalist seconded by
DHV Consultants BV.
Due to absence of the Environmental Expert of Mouchel & Partners Ltd. who previously
was occupied with the IEE and EMP it was not possible to ensure cross-reference and share
responsibilities for concluded matters.
The consolidation efforts for this component included (i) focusing on additional
investigations on specific alternatives and/or points of environmental sensitivity (ii) giving
consideration to a broader the scope of impact analysis wherever considered necessary, (iii)
consulting and cross-checking, including field inspections, with the engineer team and
hydrologists to address the most significant concerns relating to possible options for either
new alignments in the proposed corridor, (iv) analyse the trade-off between land-
acquisition, resettlement needs, flooding incidents and design requirements in some of the
more sensitive sections (v) addressing to the maximum extent possible the need to mitigate
the impacts commonly associated with extraction of large quantities of fill material, both
from borrow pits in flood-prone lowlands and in hil sites.
Thorough consideration was given to the possible need of further environmental and
design studies as well as confirming the environmental category of this project component.
Additional recommendations were included relating to institutional strengthening of the
Technical Wing / Environmental Unit of RHD in view of the countries further need to
assess and monitor environmental impacts associated with road constructions.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
DHAKA-SYLHET ROAD PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is part of the environmental documentation for the
Improvement/Rehabilitation of the National Road between Dhaka, Sylhet and Tamabil on the bordcr.
This Project is a component of the Third Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP3) of the
Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB).
This document has been prepared following two studies of the route - Second Road Improvement
Project Feasibility Study (SRIP: Renardet et al. 1991) and Special Assistance for Project Formulation:
Route 2 Improvement Project (SAPROF: 1994) - RHD commissioned a consortium of Consultants ("
to update the earlier studies for a 256 km section of the route from the Sitalakhya Bridge near Dhaka as
far as Sylhet (Figure 1), and to prepare detailed engineering designs, cost estimates and tender
documents for rehabilitation of the road.
The decision for the present route choice is based on cost-benefit analyses taking into account trade-offs
betwveen political preferences, travelling time, economic return, linkage of commercial centers. socio-
economic as well as environmental impacts.
The project is being sponsored by the World Bank ("the Bank"), and therefore must comply with
relevant Bank policy and procedures with respect to environmental issues, as well as domestic
regulations in Bangladesh.  In line with the two key Bank Operational Directives OD  4. 01:
Environmental Assessment and OD 4.30: Resettlement (World Bank 1991a, 1990), the Terms of
Reference for the study specified the preparation of an Environmental Assessment. an assessment of
resettlement requirements, a detailed Environmental Action Plan and a Resettlement Action Plan.
1.2  REVIEW AND CONSOLIDATION
The Environmental Management Plan wvas reviewed and consolidated, as requested by the Bank and the
Client, by the environmentalist seconded by DHV Consultants BV. The review was undertaken
according to the Bank's instructions and guidance. Review methodology included consultation and
cross-checks with environmental specialists, sociologists, hydrologists, engineers and botanists
affiliated with the consortium of Consultants ("), DHV Consultants, Surface Water Modelling Center
and the University of Dhaka. In addition, environmental analyses of regional/project relevance
were consulted, such as FAP-6 and FAP-15 studies relating to FCDI. hydraulic modelling.
ecology, fisheries, remote sensed information and socio-economic conditions.

1.3  ELA LEVEL OF EFFORT AND RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REPORTS
As required by the Terms of Reference, environmental and social considerations have been integratcd
into project design through the preparation of an environmental assessment. an assessment of
resettlement requirements, an Environmental Management Plan. and a Resettlement Action Plan. These
tasks have been undertaken by subject-matter specialists working as an integral part of the overall
design team during both phases of the study - Feasibility Studv Update and Detailed Design.
The environmental assessment was completed in September 1997 and is prcsented as Volume 2.
Environmental Aspects, of the Feasibility Study Update (Mouchel er al. 1997b). As a preliminary
environmental assessment it largely reflects the format suggested by applicable domestic guidelines for
an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), -and includes an outline Environmental Management Plan,
together with recommendations focusing on additional investigations on specific alternatives and/or
points of environrnental sensitivity.
The assessment of resettlement requirements was presented in Volume I of the Feasibility Study
Update (Mouchel et al. 1997a), essentially as a cornparative analysis of social disruption and cost
between the various routes then under consideration. .A Preliminarv Resettlement Action Plan is under
preparation as a separate volume of the Final Report.
T-his report is an Environmental Management Plan (:EMP) for the Dhaka-Sylhet Road Rehabilitation
Project, intended to fulfil the requirements of the Consultant's Terms of Reference for an
"Environmental Action Plan .... in accordance with Wiorld Bank Operational Directives..." (Task B. 1
during Detailed Engineering). The document is a systematic description of the measures to be taken
during project construction and operation to avoid, minimise or compensate for significant adverse
impacts, plus the actions to be taken to implement the measures,.
A major drawback affecting the timely completion of the Environmental Management Plan relates to
the fact that the final choice of route referring to the alignment in the decided corridor were not made
until mid October 1997. Accordingly, surveys including sorne specific environmental examinations
could not be performed earlier. This refers particularly to those aspects described in Annex C of this
document.
However, given the scope of examinations that could be performed during this consolidation process it
is concluded that this document represents the consolidated EIA, including the consolidated
Environmental Management Plan for the Dhaka-Sylhet Road Project. This EMP also includes
enhancement measures, actions *which although not essential to the project will. at lowx cost. bring
appreciable social, environmental or developmental benefits.
Much of the contents of this EMP have already been integrated into other project documents submitted
to the Client, such as (i) designs into the Technical Specifications, (ii) Drawings, (iii) Bill of Quantities.
(iv) controls on the contractors into the Conditions of Particular Application; (v) costs into the overall
project budget.
Items not discussed or presented elsewhere, being addressed in this report include:
* the organisational framework for environmental management,
* roadside tree planting
* borro%Npit rehabilitation measures
* environmental monitoring
* institutional strengthening programmes.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                 Environmental Management Plan
It needs to be stressed out that the most significant direct impacts of upgrading the road relating to
social aspects, caused bv land acquisition are described and assessed in detail in the project's
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) during the early implementation phase. In this EMP a number of
social and socio-economic impacts as well as mitigation and management measures associated with
land acquisition and income-generating possibilities linked with the project design are not dealt with in
detail, as these matters are subject to be consolidated along with the RRMP3 Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) currently under preparation by a contracted NGO. However. in the interest of complcteness.
these matters are briefly referred to where appropriate.
Presently onlv indicative figures and assumptions on people affected and extend of land acquisitions arc
available, currently prepared under a document called "Preliminary Resettlement Action Plan" be
L.G.Mouchel & Partners, to be submitted with the Final Project Design Report due in near future.
1.4    RESPONSE TO ACTIONS CONCERNING  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
In addition to a variety of tasks to be carried out during Detailed Design, the Preliminarn
Environmental Assessment identified further actions to be followed up. These actions need to be
addressed partly because they relate to loan conditions, partly to the critical path and the budgetting of
the project.
1.4.1 Actions to be taken by the Client
1.    Since it is on the project's critical path, RHD should establish a task force to develop
appropriate project-specific land acquisition and compensation procedures and an implementation
programme. This item concerns resettlement policy and practice in Bangladesh, which continue to
evolve. A entitlement and compensation policy has recently been developed by a NGO (CCDB) and
accepted by RHD as being valid for RRMP3. Following discussions with the Bank, RHD has prepared
a compensation policy matrix to direct the land acquisition and compensation process during RRMP3.
2.     Unless incorporated in the institutional strengthening programme for RHD in junction wvith
RRMP3 this project does not include any provisions for tackling the growing sectoral problems of air
and noise pollution, or for enforcing roadside development controls. A decision should be made as to
the extent to which responses to indirect effects should be incorporated in the rehabilitation project:
prime candidates are (i) road safety; (ii) roadside development control. Indirect effect monitoring also
include noise and reduced air quality, driver behaviour. Such problems commonly related directly and
indirectly to road construction and to traffic performance, but which can only be partially mitigated by
good road engineering. RRMP3 includes a Road Safety Programme, specifically for engineering wvorks
for traffic calming on main roads and to improve accident blackspots.
Accordingly, decisions are required on the extent to which the project should be used as an opportunity
for capacity building, particularly within RHD (as described in this report, Chapter 6.4). Prime
candidates are (i) land acquisition procedures; (ii) bioengineering: (iii) road maintenance and (iv)
environmental monitoring, e.g. air and noise pollution, accident frequency, success/failure of roadside
plantation schemes. At this stage, the EMP recommends the inclusion of an independent environmental
review, as outlined in Chapter 6 and costed in Chapter 7.
1.4.2 Certification of the Environmental Category of this Project
In previous meetings, as well as stated in the consolidated EIA submitted on 18 October 1997 it was
indicated that it needs to be clarified to which extent both the Bank's environmental guidelines and ne%N
government regulations on environmental assessment apply to this project. and therefore whether a
formal IEE and/or EIA should be prepared.

Dhaka - Svlhet Road Project                                    Environmental Management Plan
The present report is assumed to facilitate the decision to obtain domestic environrnental clearance. It is
underlined that the consultants, after thoroughly consulting the key adverse impacts likely to occur in
context of this project came to the conclusion that this project can remain under categorv B once the
focal points flagged out in this report are properly and timely addressed. It is ascertained that with the
countermeasures and discussed altemnatives described in the managcment and mitigation plan the need
to reduce, limit and offset the identified key adverse impacts (mainly in section 109 and 115) is
sufficiently addressed to justify this project remaining under environmental category B.
2.  THE PROJECT
The geographic setting and delineation of the six contract sections are illustrated in Fig. 1. 1.
Major engineering activities along the approved, shortened alignment (221.5 km) would be:
* Raising of embankment crest levels to provide protection from I in I 0-vear floods.
* Widening of embankments to achieve the required crest widith (15.8 m). and flattening of side slopcs
to achieve stability.
* Minor realignrment to improve sight lines and reduce the radius of curvature on sharp bends.
* Construction of bypasses around towns, bazaars and busy road junctions.
* Construction of railway overpasses.
- Rehabilitation and/or replacement of existing culverts and bridges.
* Pavement improvements.
* Roadside plantation as integral part of the project design.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                    Environmental Management Plan
The overall project will be divided into 6 construction packages varnin, from 28 to 44 km each
Construction in the different sections wvill bc in twso stages (T-able 2.1). The contract duration %xill be
36 months. It is likely that contracts IA. IB. IC. and 2C are implemented first. whilc Contracts 2A
and 2B wvould possibly nced prior to commencement additional environmcntal investigations or even
identification of alternative alignment surveys within the selected corridor due to considerations outlined
in this document. The same holds true for identifying additional sites for excavation material. bc it in
lowland floodplain or hilly environs.
The construction work wvill bc supcrvised by international consultants and carricd out under contracts
let followving National Competitive Bidding.
The construction documents are in FIDIC format, with Conditions of Particular Application tailored to
suit local conditions. Contractors have been invited to prequalify, tenders will be invited, and contracts
will be awarded followving normal GOB procedures for World Bank contracts.
Rehabilitation of the remainder of the highNvav from immediately south of Sylhet as far as Tamabil on
the border wVith India is the subject of a separate study.
Closely-related transport infrastructure projects include:
* Reconstruction of 4 of the bridges on the route under the UK-funded Bridge Improvcment and
Maintenance Project Phase 2 (BIMP2) (ongoing).
•Construction of a major road bridge over the Meghna River from Bhairab to Ashuganj, the Bhairab
Bridge (project under appraisal by the UK's Department for International Development [DFID.
formerly ODA]).
* Upgrading of the road from Sylhet to Tamabil on the border with India including a possible Sylhet
bypass (study recently commnenced wvith funding frorn Kuwait).
*Improvement to the district road from Habiganj to Mlithapur Junction by RHD wvith GOB funding.

3.  SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS
3.1  SCREENING AND SCOPING
If not mitigated, the project could have a number of significant environmental impacts, particularix in
two of the six sections). Impacts of different nature and magnitude are likely to occur at differcnt stagcs
of the project. These are shown in the Impact Matrix (Tab. 3.1) and summarised below. together w-ith
notes on other potential impacts which rcquire action by thc projcct. Chcckboxes wNhich have bccn left
blank indicate that the impact analysed wvere identified as non-significant.
As the project crosses at some sections a major floodplain and hill area with substantial run-offs during
peak rains, it is expedient to address also potential adverse effects which could bc causcd by the
regional hydraulic regime. The project is also located in an area prone to earthquake.
3.2  POSSIBLE IMPACTS ON THE PROJECT CAUSED BY THE ENVIRONMNIENT
3.2.1  Flooding and Erosion
The major portion of the Dhaka-Svlhet road is located in or at the margin of large loz%-lying floodplains
wvhich are subject to regular flooding and drainage congestion. Accordingly. waterlogging. embankJment
erosion and inundation of rural roads are common impacts known for this region.
Temporary transport and depositing of fine sediments in the coursc of flash floods in some of the
crossed rivers and irrigation canals can be a significant source of impact in some of the road sections
wvhich will newvly be established along rural district roads (i.e. Section 109 and 1 15). In those sections.
villagers commonly report ponding of water between the existing rural road (the currentlx assumed
alignment) and the foot area of the hill chain running parallel to this road in case peak rain condition.
Ponding is aggravated by flash floods running through deep-trenched gullies from the adjacent hill
chain, carrying peak loads of lateritic and fine sand sediments towards the nearby rural road and
adjacent paddy lands.
Should it be decided to upgrade and raise the height of the existing road to the required flood level and
highway standard the risk of increasing the above described effects of water ponding are likely to
increase, even Xwhen more culverts and drainage openings wvould be included. Community severance
and suffering from prolonged times of inundation in local bazaars and other public places including
mosque terrains would almost certainly occur. It is anticipated that such conditions. even if pertaining
for several days only, are largely met with disapproval by the public. Thus. where necessary. road
embankment alignment and levels %vill be need to be adjusted to avoid unacceptable
hydrological/hydraulic impacts from potential increased ponding levels.
It is therefore recornrmended to re-examine specifically these sections along road sections # 109, 114.
104C, 1 15 and 112 with respect to the hydraulic regime and risk of inundation and ponding. It needs to
be studied wvhether the mentioned environmental impacts can be mitigated by either shifting the
proposed alignment in respective sections westwards into the lowxlands. or bypassing locations which
may be identified as critical in terms of flooding, ponding and erosion.
Other technical mitigation options would include extensive erosion protection works. It is recommended
to undertake a detailed hydraulic modelling study referring to the most critical locations in order to
avoid public hardship and costly future damage corrections.
Another special concem is the likely event of embankment break of Khowai River near Shaistaganj
(CH 159). Investigations may be necessary to identify the inclusion of embankment rehabilitation
works in this section in order to protect the highw%ay against flooding hazards.

3.2.2    Seismic Activities
The north-eastem zone has experienced in the past earthquakes of moderate to high intensity. The great
earthquake of 1897 which had its epicentre in the Shillong Plateau of India caused widespread
damages. Two other major earthquakes, the Bengal earthquake of 1885 and Srimongal earthquake of
1918 caused severe damages on limited areas surrounding their epicentres.
According to BNBC (1993) Bangladesh is located in zones of different seismic activities. all of which
can have substantial impacts on infrastructures, particuIlarly on bridges, culverts and high embankments
associated wvith road construction.
The Dhaka-Svlhet Road Project Area falls within the limit of two zones X ith moderate and medium
seismic activity respecively (Fig. 3.1). The south-wvestern part of the Project Area fall in Zone 2. i.e.
moderate seismic zone. The The northern half of the Dhaka-Sylhet Road lies within Seismic Zone 3. i.e.
moderate to medium seismic zones with regular shocks tci be observed.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
3.3  PRE-CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS
3.3.1   Land Acquisition
Given the actual alignment, the project will have significant land acquisition requirement - estimated
some 250 ha. The exact amount phvsically needed wvill not be known until completion of detailed design
and final choice of alignment. At the time being the amount of land requiring expropriation is
considerably less than the total land physically required since much of it falls within the formal Road
Reserve. Nonetheless. the number of PAHs is likelv to be verv high. It is assumed that the extent of
impact will be higher than in the Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Construction Project due to the much
higher population density and the fact that the rehabilitated road section traverses built-up areas.
Land acquisition associated with this project would occur in the following instances:
*  Widening the existing 5.5 m pavement to 7.4 m with an additional paved non-motorised vehicle
lane of 1.5 m on either side, for a total paved width of 1[0.4 m in accordance with RMSS design
standards for a Type B National Road.
• Raising the existing embankment where it is presently inundated by high floods, including a
freeboard determined by the hydrologist accordine to the I in 10 yrs flood level.
* Widening the embankment base to accommodate the extra pavement width and additional height.
-  Re-aligning the route in certain sections along existing rural roads to give a shorter overall distance
between Dhaka and Sylhet (saving 34.5 km).
*  Bypassing congested areas.
* Railway overpasses.
* Replacing bridges and culverts as necessary.
In case any further land acquisition is required in conjunctioni with the project's Resettlement Action
Plan, together with numbers and location of households affected. reference is made to the respective
documents under preparation.
Problems associated with loss of landholding
As for land acquisition and individual losses in those sections xvhere substantial widening. heightening
of embankment and bypasses are foreseen (e.g. sections 115, 109, 114 and 104C) it is anticipated that
only a relative small portion of the individual's landhcilding is affected. In analogy to Feeder Road B
projects it is presumed that in those sections which are somewhat comparable about (i.e. 2A and 2B)
two-thirds of affected households will lose less than 5% of their holding, about one-third less than 10%
and only 1.5% more than 20%. As for the other sections, no data were available yet from the socio-
economic survey at the time of this reporting.
3.3.2 Diversion of Services
There is a large requirement for diversion of existing services (the majority electricity and telephone.
with some water and gas reticulation) to accommodate road wvidening and embankment raising

3.3.3  Loss of Roadside Trees
Road widening and embankment, raising will necessitate removal of a large number (>27.000) mature
and semi-mature roadside trees.  These havc economic, biological. ecofunctional and aesthetic
significance, with a few (banyans: Ficus spp.) having some cultural importance. An inventory of trees
requiring removal is attached at Annex A.
RHD's Arboriculture Unit estimates a possible 9-month duration for official trce enumeration.
acquisition of felling permits, auctioning, felling and disposal, and points out that trce enumeration was
a line item in the RRMP2 loan.
3.3.4  Other Impacts
Other potential negative impacts during the pre-construction phase include:
-    inducement of uncertainties and stress in roadside residents associated with surveys and the
subsequent land acquisition and compensation procedures;
-    stimulation of new construction purely to obtain (fraudulent) compensation.
3.4  CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS
3.4.1 Construction Materials
Tlhe project ,xill have substantial earthworks requirement in the range of 6.2 million m3 (almost entirely
fill materials for embankment), plus some 1.5 million m3 of coarse and fine aggregates for pavement
construction and concrete. In addition, there is a need for steelwork for the major structures and
bitumen for paving.
Fill for the embankments will be supplied by the contractors from outside the Road Reserve. A pre-
selection of borrow sites is listed in ANNEX C. Borrow pits alongside the road shall generally be
ruled out, mainly to protect vulnerable embankments and to avoid unresolved future user conflicts.
Sources for fill material could include extended road cuttings, agricultural land, khals, river banks and
dredgings. It needs to be investigated to which extent surrounding hill material (near Mirpur and near
Nawapara) could be used, last but not least to reduce the amount of crushed bricks and stone
aggregates imported from Dhalai River north of Sylhet (see below).
Invariably, impacts associated with borrow pits will be site-specific and need to be carefully addressed
when extraction sites are confirmed. The same holds true for disposal of unsuitable waste material in
lowland areas exposed to seasonal or chronic flooding.
The total area of borrow pits will depend on the average depth excavated and whether any is sourced
from dredging; as an illustration, if the average depth were 5 m, the total borrow would comprise a loss
of agricultural production from 100 ha, unless the pit was subsequently used for fisheries.
Associated impacts could include temporary loss of livelihood for tenants and agricultural labourers
and land damage from access tracks. Shallow borrows (max. 1.5 m) are likely to have less or no
permanent effect on cropping since soils are deep and uniform, and the reduced field levels might
slightly improve irrigation water availability in some locations. The disadvantage of shallow borrows.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
however, is that a much larger number of land will be affected, including more complicated and lengthy
negotiations with land owners. Apart from that, flish floods and other erosive processes may cause
further undesired development in the shallow borrow area, rendering them less suitable for crop culture.
Fine aggregate in the form of sand is generally readily available from floodplain deposits and river
channels. Wherever possible, dredging is recommended as extraction method which most likely will
cause the least environmental impacts.
For economic considerations, coarse aggregates used in this project will include both crushed brick and
crushed stone. Brick wvill be used for sub-grade, and crushed stone for sub-base and base. Bricks will
be sourced locally, creating employment, but with potential negative impacts due to the illegal use of
wood as fuel. Unless strict controls are exerted during the contractor's supervision the widespread illicit
use of timber in brick kilns will accrue the already critical deplction of forest resources, particularly in
the nearby border area with India where uncontrolled. cutting and smuggling of timber into Bangladesh
is causing major environmental hazards. The following table illustrates the likely impact of brick
making assuming that 50% of the required aggregates (total 1.5 million m3) Will crushed brick.
Tab. 3.3:      Potential Impacts Caused by Brick Making
Production              Fuel Source required for
Source of Fuel    Unit (kg)  Output                 750.000 m3 aggregates
Timber      60 to 75      1 m3       45 million to 56.25 million m3
equivalent to approximately
12 to 14 million mature trees
Coal        25 to 30      1 ni3      12.5 million to 15 million m3
equivalent to approximately
11.000 to 15.000 m3 NO and SO, emissions
Even when coal is used as prescribed by Government Regulations for firing the kilns, the land used for
brick making will be largely unsuitable for future agricultural uses. In addition, air pollution from coal
firing kilns may cause locally substantial interference with public health and traffic safetv. At present.
no data for emissions from coal-fired brick kilns are available.
As for stone aggregates the main source is likely to be the quarry is at Bholaganj (Jaflong) on the
alluvial fan of the Dhalai River north of Sylhet. By extracting additional material from these quarries.
the project %xill accumulatively contribute to adverse environmental and other impacts associated wvith
the ongoing activities, being (i) increase of fine siltation, (ii) change of current pattern and increase of
river current, (iii) increased downstream bank- erosion, and (iv) border and user conflicts.
3.4.2   Construction Traffic
The project is large, and will temporarily generate large volumes of heavv traffic. In addition to noise
and dust, this traffic could create or exacerbate safety hazards, and could seriously damage feeder
roads if used by heavy vehicles.
Transport of embankment fill materials and brick will be by truck, unless distances are verv short (up
to 200 m), in which case labourers with head pans or other local transport means might be used. There
is a potential for severe damage to any district or feeder roads used by haul trucks since these are not
designed or built to carry heavy traffic.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
Transport of coarse aggregates is likely to involve both river and road transport, with trans-shipment
being carried out at the nearest site convenient to the works.
3.4.3 Employment
It is assumed that the labour force employed will be fairly large. probably at peak construction timCs
some 24,000 - 36,000 spread between the six contractors. This large amount of temporary employment
mav causc several impacts and social conflicts. Major labour camps are anticipated to be located at
bypass construction sites, such as Madhabdhi (#101), Nowapara (#109). Shaistaganj (#114) and
Bahubal (#1 15).
Anticipated adverse impacts of low to moderate magnitude caused .b. tbis labour force concentration
would include
sanitation problems and pollution
drinking water shortage
increased pressure on local markets and food supply
increased insecurity and social imbalance in among the local residents
* increased crime rate
* friction and individual conflicts
Additional employment of skilled wNill be created in the suppliers' industries (steel, cement, bitumen
etc.), and in services.
3.4.4 Other Impacts
Other low or possibly moderately significant short-term, localised and/or reversible impacts associated
with the construction phase have been identified as:
e increased pressure on local services;
* fuelwood depletion;
* loss of income, fuel and construction wood from roadside trees:
increased fishing efforts at culverts, and impeded fish migration;
increase of stagnant wvater areas being potential breeding places for waterborne disease vectors:
temporary land take for camps, stores, diversions;
land unsuitability on at contractor's sites if not properly cleared/restored after use,
interruption to navigation during bridge construction;
relocation of some cultural assets;
interference with schools (noise, accident risks, air pollution);
* air and soil pollution from asphalt plants and use of bitumen.
All these impacts are prior to mitigation. It is assumed that all of the above mentioned impacts are of
such nature that they can be controlled to an acceptably low level through the adoption of suitable
mitigation measures outlined in this document. Residual impacts (see Section 3.7) are expected to be
lowv in most cases, providing that the proposed mitigation measures are fully adopted.

3.5  POST-CONSTRUCTION LMPACTS
3.5.1 Accidents
*The increased width and, in particular. the smoother surface of the ncew road .ill encourage highcr
speeds. In addition, the embankment will be higher. Thus. * hcn accidents do occur. a proportion w-ill
be more severe than at present.
Upgrading the road through approximatcly 140 settlements or bazaars will also increase accident
risk, especially to pedestrians. In Dhaka pedestrians accounted for two-thirds of all reported road
accident fatalities in 1996 (195 out of 308). and are thought to have a high involvement ratc in rural
areas as well (National Road Safety Council 1997). Unless driver behaviour changes radically. over
the long term accident frequency on the road wvill increase in line with increasing traffic levels (around 8
% p.a.) and expanding roadside development.
3.5.2 Air Pollution
More important in the long terrn will be the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in congested
areas. The pollutants of most immediate concern are lead, which has yet to be phased out in
Bangladesh, smoke (from excessive oil in twvo-stroke engine fuzl mixtures and unburnt diesel), and very
small-diameter airborne particulates from diesel engines which carry carcinogenic compounds.
Although air quality is becoming a major pollution issues in urban areas in Bangladesh, there are few
reliable data, and virtually none on air qualitv pararneters for non-urban areas. The onl physical
measurements obtained by this study wvere carried out recently along the Dhaka-Chittagong Road as
part of an EIA study for a new power station at Meghnaghat (Mott Ewbank Preece et al. 1996).
Ambient air quality monitoring for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide at 8 locations, almost all either
30-50 m from the main road or in small villages wvith "very little traffic", recorded levels of these two
pollutants generally well wvithin permissible limits (Table 3.4).

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                 Environmental Management Plan
These data are not thought to represent actual exposure conditions for road travellers or roadside
residents due to the distance of the sampling locations from the road. In manv locations it is obvious
that air quality experienced by roadside residents and shopkeepers is unacceptable and a probable
health risk. At the same time, these risks must be placed in perspective. the context being the numerous
other health hazards experienced by the public in Bangladesh.
Control of vehicle emissions is a complex sectoral issue which must be based on hard data. and %%hich
requires action at national levcl on a wide variety of inter-related issues such as fuel and engine type.
vehicle maintenance standards. education, taxation and enforcement.
3.5.3  Increased Economic Activity and Induced Development
The road is likely to result in increased economic activity - and indeed is intended to. However. one
consequence of the improved access is likely to be accelerated unplanned roadside devclopment in some
areas, since building controls in Bangladesh are weak and easy to circumvent.
One obvious location for such development is Sherpur on the Kushiyara River, a strategic inland
waterway. As noted in the FAP 6 Water Transport Study (SNC et al. 1993), Sherpur could become a
growth centre due to the juncture of main road and waterway.
3.6  IMPACTS WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO OCCUR IF PROPERLY MiTIGATED
3.6.1 Impacts on Hydrology
The present assumption forvarded by the Consultant's EIA Expert is that this project is considered
unlikely to have significant negative effects on hydrology, since, except for the 15.5 km of new
bypasses, it follows existing alignments.
Raising the existing embankments will increase the tendency of the road to act as a dam in extreme
floods. This has been taken into account in the design of the new bridges and culverts, which will have
a larger xvaterway area than the present drainage structures (Table 4.4).
Erosion of lands, adjacent to the road and belowv the road bed, receiving concentrated runoff from open
drains from nearby hill chains may be relevant for some sections of the Dhaka-Sylhet road. It needs to
be stressed out that additional information may be needed to mitigate ponding between the (existing
low) road embankment and the adjacent foot hill area within the Section betwveen Mirpur Bazaar (CH
151+3) and Chota Barak River (CH 179). Under unfavourable flood and wveather conditions the
additional raising of the embankment in the respective section may lead, in spite of insertion of culverts,
to backponding within the village sections entrapped between the new (raised) embankment and the
nearby hill chain.
3.6.2 Impacts on Biological Resources: Wetlands, Fisheries, Forests
The project is expected to have no significant direct effects on biological resources - wetlands. fish
migration, foresis - although in some locations there will be minor losses to fisheries due to the partial
or complete filling in of some roadside ponds (previous borrow pits). Howvever. this loss could be
partially or completely offset by the potential for fish culture in the project's borrow pits as designed in
this EMP. Fish migration may be marginally improved due to the improved cross-flows possible after
replacement and enlargement of the culverts and bridges (Table 4.4).
Page 16



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                         Ehvironmental Management Plan
It is probable that fish resources will be subject to increased harvesting pressure during receding floods
when intensive netting is done by most fishermen at culvert sites where fish tcnd to concentrate.
The approved alignment is a considerable distance from  either of the two hoor (wetland) areas
identified bv Flood Action Plan (FAP-6) surveys as bcing of international importancc undcr Ramsar
Convention criteria, Hail Haor and Kawadighi Haor (see SNC et al. 1995). and will not affect them.
The project does not cross significant forest areas.
Betwveen Jagadishpur and Shaistaganj the currently approved alignmcnt affects a very small area of
plantation (eucalyptus, rubber and teak) and highly degradcd natural forest. Land take here for the
road's only cuttings will not be significant either ecologically or economicall-.
3.6.3  Impacts Unlikely to be Caused by the Project
Depending on where and how they are built, roads are commonily associated with a long list of negative
direct and indirect effects. The Dhaka-Sylhet Road F'roject is considered unlikely to cause anv of the
impacts or accelerate any of the processes listed in Table 3.5.
Table 3.5 Impacts which are Unlikely to Occur as El Result of the Dhaka-Sylhet Road Project
Direct
*      Major increase in sediment in streams affected by erosion at construction sites and fresh road cuts.
fills and waste dumps: almost no cuttings on route; embankment fills will be vegetated.
*       Major landslides, slumps, slips and other mass movements in road cuts: the planned road does not
traverse hilly terrain, although it passes nearby in some sections.
M       Alteration of overland drainage (where road cuts intcrcept perched water tables, springs. etc.): not
relevant - road does not traverse hilly terrain.
*      Destruction or damage to terrestrial wildlife, habitats, biological resources or ecosystems that
should be preserved: none traversed by road.
*      Alteration of hydrological regimes of wvetlands by causeways with harmful effects on these
ecosystems: road follows existing alignments across floodplains.
*      Interruption of migratory routes for wvildlife and livestock: not relevant.
*      Increased collisions with wild animals: not releva-nt - large mammals are extinct in the area.
*      Transmission of communicable diseases from workers to local populations and vice versa: a good
portion of workers will be local; STD's from prostitution around camps are a special case.
*      Creation of temporary breeding habitats for mosquito vectors of disease. e.g., sunny. stagnant pools
of water: many exist already.
*      Creation of transmission corridor for diseases. pests and weeds: road already exists.

3.7  RESIDUAL IMPACTS
Among the positive and negative long-term impacts of residual nature the following have been
identified:
-    Uncertainties with Land Acquisition: Adoption of the policies and the principles set out above
will go a long way towards minimisation of impact, but is not expected to provide total
mitigation, and there will probably be some residual adverse impact for most affected
households, especially those who need to move house or substantially rebuild the remains of
housing.
- Uncertainty remains to which extent the borrow pit rehabilitation proposal will meet full
support by the implementing agencies Provided that the mitigation measures outlined above are
implemented, residual impact is considered to be low. If no satisfactory solution to reshape and
reinstate the large and deep borrow areas into productive agricultural (aquacultural) land.
environmental, socio-economic and public health aspects wNill remain a subject of major
concem.
Improvement in living conditions is very likely in some towns and villages due to construction
of bypasses, or by sympathetic road design through built-up areas;
Further benefits may be accrued from a revised management of roadside tree plantations to
include ownership by or benefit sharing with local communities and user groups; The proposed
planting programme should result in a significant increase in the number of trees along the
project roads, to the benefit of all roadside communities. It w&ill also make a significant
contribution to local employment opportunities for the poor, the destitute and women.
the larger, faster road will make living conditions worse in some places, in particular by
increasing communitv severance, the creation or intensifying of a physical and psychological
barrier between two halves of some 140 communities;
an expected increase in air pollution and noise in areas which remain or becomc congested as
traffic levels increase.

>  Impact minimisation: where impacts cannot be avoided. implementing mitigation measures to
reduce the impacts to acceptable levels.
= Compensation: where impacts cannot be avoided or sufficiently mitigated, arranging compensation.
for example cash and other services for people affected by land take; extensive roadsidc tree
planting to replace lost trees.
E Enhancement: measures which at little cost to the project give appreciable social or developmental
benefits, e.g. the provision of bus stops and institutional strengthening.
The Environmental Management Plan has been elaborated in the highlight of the different project
phases - design, construction and post-construction. Table 4.1 sumrnarises the main activities described
in the remainder of this Section.

4.2  MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION MEASURES DURING
PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE
4.2.1   Mitigation Measures Relating to Land Acquisition
Impacts which are likely to be of considerably less importance but need to be observed, last but not
least because of lessons leamed in the past and/or other RRMP2 and RRMP3 projects refer to the
inducement of uncertainties amongst the local population, regarding such matters as w-hether or not
land and other assets will be subject to compulsory purchase by government. the extent to which the%
will be affected, the form and adequacy of compensation arrangements. and the date by w%hich affected
land and property will have to be vacated. all of which disturb family life and can promote social
unrest: the consequences of the latter being directed larglyv towards the officials involved in the
acquisition process and contributing to making the process more difficult and time-consuming.
Another typical problem associated with land acquisition is the stimulation of new construction solely
with the aim of fraudulently obtaining compensation, which commonly has the effect of reducing
compensation payments to those with genuine entitlement, either on this project or indirectly on others.
as a result of constraints on the available budget.
For both problems, the mitigation measures would include:
(i)    Minimise the area of land needed in connection with the works, as acceptable to design
standards.
(ii)    Raising the embankment to heights less than the I to 10 yrs flood level, i.e. accepting certain
risks that this national highway to be flooded for certain periods.
(iii)   Timely announcement of land acquisition, and accurate and relevant information promulgated
through the NGO appointed by RHD, in close co-operation with the local authorities
(iv)   Timely, accurate and published documentation (photo, video) of existing settlements and
assets which will be affected by land acquisition and/or construction w orks. Such
documentation will be used to refute any fraudulent compensation claims. Provided that the
existence of the visual record is publicised by both the NGO and local authorities, and it is
made clear that fraudulent claims will not be entertained by the authorities, and may be
considered as grounds for legal action, it is expected that the incidence of such claims will
be low.
Mitigating problems incurring to smallest landholders and sharecroppers
The high level of agricultural landholding fragmentation over many sections in the Dhaka-Sylhet road is
expected to result in land acquisition having only marginal effects on all but the smallest landholders.
sharecroppers and the relatively few people who rent agricultural land. The incomes of most
agricultural labourers are also unlikely to be affected significantly, partly as a result of fragmentation
of the holdings on which they work, and partly because labour is normallv draun as needed from a
large floating pool of workers, and few labourers have permanent relationships with specific parcels of
land. In addition, many agricultural labourers derive a large part of their income from work outside
agriculture.
As for mitigation measures, payment of compensation for acquired land and other assets is expected to
reduce the financial effects on PAHs to an acceptably low level, provided that the compensation paid
truly reflects the financial losses incurred, whether these relate to wealth (in the form of asset loss) or
Page 20



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                   Environmental Management Plan
income, or subsistence. Support to PAHs, in various forms, will be provided under the RRMP3 RAP
programme, which will include elements relating to families, individuals and groups who are both
directly and indirectly affected by the land acquisition process. The plan. which is currently under
preparation, shall be designed to make specific provision for identifving and supporting vulnerable
groups, including women, the poor, the destitute and the landless.
Resettlement and provision of income-generating opportunities for PAP's
Resettlement issues, closely related to land acquisition, are not dealt with in this rcport. however there
is a linkage between environmental considerations, choice of alignmcnt altemativcs whcre applicable
and, consequently, the number of PAPs. infrastructure and services that are affected. Accordingly, thcre
is vast need for co-ordinating the management and mitigation measures, not onlv in terms of
compensation but also in view of developing temporary and long-term income-generating opportunities
and structures that could be associated with this project. Prime candidates for the latter are
-     Social Forestry Schemes
-     Development of integrated aquaculture schemes in rehabilitated borrow pits
as described in separate sections of this document.
4.2.2 Alignment Design
Alignment design measures adopted on this project to avoid and minimise environmental impacts and
social disruption include:
*  Following existing roads rather than creating new alignments
Minimising land acquisition
Not raising embankment height through some built-up areas
. Bypasses
* Widening one side only where feasible
* Avoiding interference with cultural heritage assets
(i)    Following existing roads rather than creating new alignments
The final route for detailed design between I)haka and Sylhet was approved by RHD in
October 1997, and follows existing roads throughout. Of the 221.5 km between the project's
start and end points, 154.9 km (70 %) is along the existing busy main road, although the
remaining 66.6 km (30 %) follows much smaller and quieter district roads.
(ii)    Minimising land acquisition
RHD owns the land under and to a varying extent on both sides of the existing main road.
although not the land under the district roads. As far as possible - given geometric constraints -
the widening works have been contained within RMD's ownership boundaries where these could
be confirmed from road reserve maps or other records.

(iii)     Not raising embankment height through some built-up areas
One of the road design criteria is improved protection against flooding, necessitating raising of
the embankment in most locations. In many built-up areas raising the grade to these new  levels
would result in an unworkable situation with the road one or morc metrcs above the roadside
shops and houses, causing a safety hazard and drainage nuisance and exacerbating noise and
air pollution. The design team's solution to this potentially serious impact was to retain
existing grades through some settlements which would othenvise have been affected.
Note:
This issue has still to be resolved as it require to decide between trade-offs, i.e.
retaining the standard FL height throughout Dhaka-Sylhet highwvay not to allow temporary flooding,
or
accept to certain degree flooding where the embankment would be lowered in densely populated arcas
where villages/bazaars are transgressed.
It therefore remains to decide upon a revised alignment in certain sections.
(iv)      Bypasses
The road passes through some 148 settlements of varying sizes Some of these are heavilv
built-up and congested, either on market days or throughout the week. To minimise social
disruption, reduce compensation and resettlement costs, and for safety reasons, the busiest of
these areas are to be bypassed. The total length of bypass is 17.7 km  (Table 4.2).

(v)        Widening one side only where feasible
Road widening can be carried out on one side of the road. or on both sides equally. In theonr
widening on only one side of the road gives environmental benefits by reducing the number of
households affected and allowing retention of the trees on the unaffected side. The same holds
true for sparing a considerable number of trees of both economic and ecological significance
Pagc 22



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                      Environmcntal Management Plan
However, in practice, the centre line of the widenecl road is largely controlled by the many
existing bridges which are to be retained, and at which the new centre line has to match the old
in order to avoid unsafe road geometry. In acldition, in many locations central widening can be
carried out without the need for formal land acquisition by RHD, since the toes of the widencd
embankment remain within the-road reserve. This is not the case with onc-side w idcning.
These over-riding practical considerations nzcessitated adoption of ccntral widening as the
basic design philosophy, but with a flexible approach allowing widening on one sidc where this
is practicable.
4.2.3  Safety
In terms of road hierarchy and function, the Dhaka-Sylhet Road is a primary distributor. but has man,
facilities located along its length and also serves social purposes, e.g. as market and meeting place.
During severe flood conditions the highway is likely to serve as refuge, with temporary settlement of
poor people at the crest of the road.
The Dhaka-Sylhet road, like many other highways in Banglaclesh, suffers from a major but common
conflict betwveen mobility - movement along the road - and local access. This conflict has implications
for road safety, and can only be partially resolved by engineerirng measures at reasonable cost. In some
cases design features will only provide full safety benefits when combined with changes in driver
behaviour; for example, priority junctions and bus lay-bys need to be properly used.
The most important safety-related features incorporated in the engineering design (l) are:
Improved road geometry
Improved junction layout
* Segregation of rickshaws
* Provision for pedestrians
* Modified road designs in built-up areas
* Bypasses
*  Bus stops
•  Traffic signs and road markings
*  Railway overpasses
(i)    Improved road geometry
-    At present both the horizontal and vertical geometry of the road are sub-standard in some
locations, particularly where tight curves and steep bridge approaches combine to -create
hazardous conditions. The project will remove these hazards, and will also improve sight lines
and provide superelevation on bends where needed.
(ii)   Improved junction layout
The new road will include a number of major and minor road junctions. Additional junctions
will be created due to the construction of bypasses. Each junction has been purpose-designed
as a priority intersection to permit safe traffic access and i. -raction, including staggering
(offsetting) of cross-roads where feasible and widening to allow protected turns.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                          Environmental Management Plan
(iii)    Segregation of rickshaws
The existing road is too narrow to permit passage of two large vehicles at speed when there is a
rickshaw on the carriageway. This is highly dangerous. RickshawNs will be in use on surfaced
urban and rural roads in Bangladesh into the foreseeable future '2  In responsc, the project's
approved carriageway design (RMSS Type B) includes 1.5 m sealed rickshaw lanes on either
side of the 7.4 m, two-lane central carriageway. Thcsc lanes will remove rickshaw-s (but not 3-
wheeled auto-rickshawvs ("baby taxis") from the central traffic lanes on the fast. open strctches
of the highwav between built-up areas, permitting two buses or trucks to pass in opposite
directions or overtake without being obstructed by rickshaws. '3
The rickshaw lanes will be continued over the new road's culverts. which will be extended as
necessary. However, despite the Consultant's recommendation, they will not be continued over
the road bridges since, firstly, the 35 existing bridges which wvill be retaincd are too narroxw
and secondly because the project has been directed to design the 59 new" arid replacement
bridges in accordance with current RHD standards which do not allow for rickshawk lanes, and
instead have a narrow (1200 mm) raised footway on each side.
For safety reasons it would be preferable to avoid building-in these long-term constrictions. It
remains our recommendation that bridge decks should be sufficientlv wide to carry the main
carriageway and the rickshaw lanes (10.4 m plus any clearances), together wvith provision for
pedestrians (see below).  The preferred design solution would be to place the pedestrian
footway outside the main bridge deck to give physical separation betwveen road traffic and
vulnerable pedestrians and livestock.
(iv)    Provisionforpedestrians
For longitudinal movement, the embankment cross-section provides an 1.8 m wide strip of
shoulder doxvn each side which can be used by pedestrians. All replacement bridges will have a
pedestrian footway on each side, although in accordance with RHD standards these are narrow
(1200 nmm), unguarded, and provide no physical separation between high-speed traffic (e.g.
buses at around 100 kmlhr) and persons on foot (see above).  This is dangerous and
intimidating.
For transverse movement, as yet no decision has been taken on specific engineering features to
assist pedestrians in crossing the road at grade. In rural areas sight lines will be good and safe
crossing a matter of pedestrian judgement. In built-up areas, it can be observed that any
pedestrian crossings wvhich are established by road markings are completely ignored by both
drivers and pedestrians.  A useful physical feature would be pedestrian refuges between
opposing traffic streams, but at present the road design for built-up areas does not include
central barriers in wvhich to place refuges. Decisions on these small but important design
elements can still be taken during project implementation.
Grade separation may be possible in some locations by providing a berm under bridges or in
culverts to allow drv-season pedestrian and livestock access through the embankment under the
road. Again, decisions can be made on a site-specific basis during project implementation.

In built-up areas the rickshaw lane will be widened from 1.5 m to 2.7 m to give an increascd
allowance for non-motorised vehicles.
Countermeasures against increased traffic speeds through built-up areas could include w%arning
signs, rumble strips, and road humps and road narrclwing. No decision on implementation of
these measures has been taken at present, given the large number of villages/bazaars w%hich this
national highwav still traverses after rehabilitation and. new alignment will be completed. In this
context it needs to be noted that bumps and rumble strips are often a matter of conflicts on
national highways as villagers tend to construct these speed limiting devices on their own
discretion after fatal accidents occur. Governrent (RHD) efforts to remove these unauthorised
and poorly marked structures are commonly met with disapproval by the local communities.
(vi)    Bypasses
Six bypasses wvill be built - see Section 3.2.2 and Table 3.2 above. Access points to the new
bypasses will be limited, to discourage use by local trafic.
(vii)   Bus stops
At present buses stop on the main carriageway to pick up passengers. This obstructs the
highway and is a safety hazard. The project includes provision for bus stops to be built as
required, comprising a lay-by with single or rnultiple bus bays and a bus shelter. Bus stops
will be located after rather than before intersections to maintain intersection visibilitv to
approaching traffic. The lay-bys will give a physical opportunity for safer bus operation. but,
as noted, their benefits will only be felt if drivers can be persuaded to use them, a matter of
education and enforcement.
(viii)   Traffic signs and road markings
The project includes provision for both traffic signs aund road markings. Signs will include
kilometre posts and advance waming of bridges, junctions and other potential hazards.
Markings will comprise centre and edge lines on the main road and stop lines at junctions.
Delineators (marker posts) will be used on the outside of curves.
For improved safety at night, all signs and markings wvill be reflectorised, including reflective
plates on bridges and other hazards.
(ix)    Railway overpasses
The road crosses railway lines at grade in five locations, four of which are single-track main
lines and one a single-track local line. At present some of these crossings are unguarded.
These grade crossings will be replaced with overpasses which will improve safety for cars.
trucks and buses. Rickshaws and baby taxis tend to have difficulty negotiating inclines (uphill:
inadequate power; downhill: excessive speed resulting in stabilitv and braking problems), and
are likely to continue to use the old crossings at grade. The design should therefore take
rehabilitation, where necessary, of separate level crossings for rickshaws etc. into account.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
4.2.4 Hydrology
The road design includes numerous features to accomnmodate various aspects of hvdrology:
*  Prevention of overtopping
*  Prevention of saturation of formation
*  CrQss-drainage
*  Protection against scour
*  Wave protection
(i)    Prevention of overtopping
As mentioned in Section 3.2 (see Tab. 3.2) the existing Dhaka-Sylhct road is subject to
overtopping in some locations in extreme floods. The new road grade has been set in relation
to a theoretical I in 10-year flood based on probability analysis of extreme events from gauging
stations ("High Flood Level"). As confirmned by available data and discussions with local
residents, this level is generally slightly above the 1987 flood and below that of 1988.
Once embankment height is adjusted to the required level the road will be safe against
overtopping by a much more severe flood, since the Finished Road Level (crown) has been set
well above the 1 in 10 year flood level to protect against capillaritv and wave action (sce
below).
(ii)   Prevention of saturation offormation
The road formation (sub-grade, sub-base, base and pavement) is a major investment, but wvill
lose strength and may suffer from damage if sufficiently wvetted. Water can penetrate the
embankment and affect the formation through capillarity and as a result of wave run-up. To
prevent this, the Finished Road Level has been set 1.5 m above the High Flood Level. This
decision, however, is subject to the trade-off in some sections with other set-backs related to the
close vicinity of built-up areas, bazaars, houses etc., all in level vith the louer embankment
(see Box, p. 22).
(iii)   Cross-drainage
The road includes many cross-drainage structures of three basic types: pipe culverts. box
culverts and bridges. Of the 372 structures on the approved alignment, some 250 require
replacement (Table 4.3). The remainder are in fair to good condition and of adequate width.
and wvill be repaired and/or extended as necessary (some of the culverts will require extensions
because of the widened embankment).

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                                Environmcntal Management Plan
As noted in Chapter 3.2, raising the embankments will increase the tendency of the road to act
as a dam  in extreme floods.  In designing replacement structures the need for generous
provision for cross-flows is paramount.  Tle new  bridges and culverts will have a larger
aggregate waterway area than the present cross-drainage structures (Table 4.5).
(iv)    Protection against scour
Scour is a major hazard to bridges and drainage structures in Bangladesh ovwing to the abscnce
of strong materials in riverbeds. In addition to the construction of foundations of adcquatc
depth, all replacement bridge openings have been designed so as to limit water velocitics to 0. 
m/s, or under exceptional circumstances a maximum of 0.8 ni/s. and will be protected against
scour by rip-rap.
In specific, road design will select where necessary among the following types of protective
works (Tab. 4.4)

difficulty for fish passage.

(v)     Wave protection
In some areas the road embankment will be subject to erosion from wave action. The design
includes two responses:
-      a minimum increase in embankment height of 750 mm to allo%x for wave height and
slop (run-up), based on a 10 km fetch over open water 2 m deep.
-      inclusion of a variety of hard and soft slope protection measurcs in the Technlical
Specifications and Bill of Quantities. Thesc will bc installed as required. The basic
protection will be a full, vigorous grass cover. Further studies and/or comparison with
other RRMP-3 design solutions will be made to idcntifv grass species that have proven
protective properties. Where neccssarv, wave protection mcasures will also include
rip-rap or concrete block protection. In extreme cases, and based on detailed field
survey, provision of an additional berm might bc considered.
In addition, the roadside tree planting programme which will bc carried out after construction
will allow the establishment of purpose-designed erosion control plantings should these be
necessary or have other benefits. As for plant species selection and their specific
properties/functions and usefulness in embankmnent protection, reference is made to the other
RRMP-3 Project being the "Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road Construction".
4.2.5 Seismicity
Since the project lies in a seismically moderately active area. an appropriate factor of reasonable safety
against seismic acceleration has been incorporated in the design of all structures.
4.2.6   Navigation
The road crosses numerous rivers, streams and canals (khal) used by boats during part or all of the
year. Where bridges are to be replaced b) the project, appropriate navigational clearances for country
boats (1) have been determined by:
*  Field survey
•  Consultation with competent authority
* Consultation with boat owvners' organisations
(i)    Field survey
At this stage, no navigation traffic counts on the waterways crossed by the project havc been
conducted.
According to RRA and surveys conducted by the sociological team, villagers in Banti, Barpa.
Golakandail (all located in Section #101), Protom Pasha (Section #108), Jagidashpur (Section
#109), Hamid Nagar (Section #115), and Andhiura (Section #104A) claimed that there is
currently at least one bridge too low and the navigation of country boats during monsoon is
hampered.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                    Environmental Management Plan
All bridges and culverts scheduled to be replaced bv the project have been inspected in the field
to assess the need for inclusion of navigational clearance. In some locations clearances are
controlled by nearby railway bridges. However, 27 watervavs were considered in need of
navigational allowances. the amount of clearance depending on the typc and size of boat traffic
(see Tab. 4.6).
In smaller channels a minimum clearance of 1.5 m above flood level will provide for passage of
traditional fishing and country boats.
(ii)    Consultation with boat owners' organisations
The interests of the non-formal inland water transport owners and operators are looked after by
hvo parallel organisations with the same staff, one registered as an NGO and the other as a
commercial organisation.  These are the Bangladesh Country Boat Owners' Association
(BCBOA) and the Bangladesh Engine Boat Oners' ASsociation (BEBOA).
Senior officers of these organisations recommended that, in the absence of other information, a
blanket approach of a 3.00 m clearance from high water levels on channels used by countr-
boats should be sufficient to provide for the largest boats wNhcn unladen.
(iii)    Consultation with BITWA
No data about navigation traffic in waterways affected by the project are available.
The agency in charge of inland water transport is the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport
Authority (BIVWTA). Inter alia, the authority classifies major rivers and establishes minimum
navigational clearances for each class, together with recommended minima for non-classified
rivers. The project is replacing a bridge over only one classified river, the Bijna Gang at Km
29+250 on Section 115, Mirpur to Mithapur. This river is BIWTA Class IV and qualifies for
a 5.00 m minimum clearance above Standard HEigh Water Level.
Followving discussions with BIWTA officers and the field survev, BIWTA was asked to supply
minimum navigational clearances and the associated Standard High Water Level for ten rivers
considered by the environmental team to be of potential importance as perennial watenvavs.
As yet this information has not been received, and bridge design at these sites is proceeding on
the basis of a 3.00 or 5.00 m clearance, as appropriate.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project
4.2.7   Cultural Heritage and Archaeology
The project's approach to the preservation of built cultural heritage includes:
*  Avoidance of mosques, temples, ritual ponds and graveyards
* Protection of ancient monuments
* Avoidance of cultural trees
* Watching brief on archaeology
(i)    Avoidance of mosques. temples, prayer places and graveyards
The road passes near many features of cultural or religious significance, in particular mosques
and graveyards. In all cases the road design has been adjusted to avoid an!.. direct impact on
such features and to give an adequate horizontal clearance to avoid nuisance.
Lessons learned from the other RRMP-3 project (NHB) will be taken into due consideration to
avoid later claims of formerly unconcerned parties with respect to religious places.
(ii)    Protection of ancient monuments
Enquiries at the Directorate of Archaeology revealed that the road does not cross the known
historical site of Sonargaon (the mediaeval "Golden City"), and that there are no scheduled
monuments along or in the vicinity of the road except for one. This is an ancient brick bridge
situated immediately east of Bridge No. 118 (Km 90+425), near the Titas River between
Brahmanbaria Junction and Jagadispur. The single-arch bridge has been restored by the
Directorate and vfill need to be fully protected during construction.
(iii)    Watching brief on archaeology
Although Bangladesh has been settled for many centuries, the use of brick rather than stone and
the dynamic nature of the fluvial environment have resulted in few ancient buildings surviving
to the present day. West of the Meghna River there is only a small chance that earthworks
could uncover items of archaeological interest.
East of the Meghna River, two sections of the road run along the boundary between hills and
wetland - Section 109, Jagadispur Junction to Nasratpur Junction, and Section  15 , Mirpur to
Mithapur Junction.  Typically such sites were preferred by prehistoric peoples for their
settlements. Although unlikely, there is a possibility that earthworks could reveal or disturb
prehistoric remains.
In view of the small but real possibility of uncovering archaeological remains, the Directorate
of Archaeology requested that they be given an opportunity to:
(a)    brief the Engineer and contractors for relevant contracts (IA. 2A, 2B. 2C) as to what
to look out for (such as terracotta shards and underground brick structures).
(b)    carry out a reconnaissance survey (visual inspection) of the areas to be affected bv
physical works (Contracts 2A, 2B) following setting out.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project
4.2.8  Services
The road is paralleled by or crosses a variety of services including low and high-tension power lines.
telephone lines, low and high pressure gas pipelines, water supply pipes, and possibly sewers.
Interference with these services has been minimised or avoided as far as possiblc by:
(i)    Avoiding impacts
Central widening has been changed to off-centre widening where a minor lateral shift in thc
centre line of the improved road would avoid the need to relocate a service.
(ii)    Relocation of services
Where relocation of services is unavoidable, GOB will pay for relocation. If an! services have
not been moved in advance of the works, the Contractor will arrange and pay for their
relocation by the owners, subsequently reclaiming the costs together w ith an administration fee.
for which a provisional sum has been included in the project budget.
4.2.9  Infrastructure Enhancement Measures
The project includes the following infrastructure enhancement features associated with the road
rehabilitation:
(i)    Bus stops
Bus stops are described at Section 4.2.3 above.
(ii)   Improvements to ferry ghats
An allowance has been made for short-term improvements to the existing ferr termninal areas
on each side of the Meghna River. At present these are unsurfaced. Improvements will consist
of grading to improve drainage and providing a seal coat. Longer-lasting measures are
unnecessary since plans for construction of a major bridge over the Meghna with DFID
funding are well advanced - although any permanent improvements would benefit boat users
who would continue to use the busy inland ports of Bhairab and Ashuganj.
(iii)   Rest stops (Optional - not yet finalised)
Preliminary design discussions with the Client have yielded a proposal to include a number of
rest stops in the newly rehabilitated highway. No decision has yet been taken on the form,
location or number of rest stops.
This matter will need to be reviewed in the highlight of additional impacts which are potentially
associated with such structures, ranging from safety considerations. air and noise pollution.
sanitation and garbage problems to congestion and travel delays. Moreover, it might be
unnecessary to add more rest stops as the road traverses a large number of bazaars offering
refreshment and food. The establishment of in the close vicinity of the highwav should
preferably be left to the private sector, and excluded from this project design.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project
4.3  MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION MEASURES DURING CONSTRUCTION
PHASE
4.3.1   Controls on the Contractor
The activities and obligations of the Contractor are established in the projcct's Contract Documents.
These have been are structured for international competitive bidding (ICB) following standard World
Bank reconmmendations. The Conditions of Contract are in two parts. the General Conditions which
are the standard conditions published by FIDIC, and the Conditions of Particdlar Application (COPA)
which qualify and over-ride the General Conditions. The Bill of Quantitlies (BOQ) lists pay items. and
the Technical Specifications define materials and construction methods.
As is nornal for ICB contracts, the documents for the Dhaka-Sylhet project contain numerous clauses
relating to social welfare and the protection of the environment. They also establish penalties for
infringements of the conditions, and permit the Engineer to direct that certain works bc carried out.
General Conditions relevant to environmental protection and social welfare are listed in Table 4.7

19.2          Employer's Responsibilities
23.1          Third Party Insurance
24.2         Insurance against Accident to Workmen
26.1          Compliance with Statutes, Regulations
27.1          Fossils (and Items of Archaeological Interest)
29.1          Interference with Traffic and Adjoining Properties
30.1          Avoidance of Damage to Roads
30.2          Transport of Contractor's Equipment or Temporary Works
30.3          Transport of Materials or Plant
30.4          Waterborne Traffic
32.1          Contractor to Keep Site Clear
33.1          Clearance of Site on Completion
34.1          Engagement of Staff and Labour
45.1          Restriction on Working Hours
The majority of the provisions are unpaid obligations of the contractor, but there are two pay items
included in the Bill of Quantities as percentages - Clearance of Camps (10 % of camp construction
costs) and Clearance of Diversions (20 % of diversion construction costs). These have been included to
give the Contractor an additionar incentive to clear the site, thereby ensuring proper restoration of all
land used to a productive condition.
For this project, environmentally and socially-related amendments to the General Conditions have been
made in the Conditions of Particular Application as follows (Table 4.8):

Completion                  - reminds Contractor of possibility of difficult weather conditions and
flooding;
- obliges him to prepare and adjust his work programme to cope with
these.
4.3.2 - Borrow Pits - Site Selection and Possible Post-Use
(i)    Requirement
As noted in Section 3.3.1, there wvill be a large requirement for fill materials for the embankment. There
is little which can be done in terms of adjustments to designs to reduce the quantities of borrow required
if the design standards needed to achieve long-term embankment stability and flood protection are to be
met, although a possible decision that no or little embankment works will be carried out in built-up
areas will reduced borrow quantities to some extent.
The aggregate area of land which is expected to be affected by borrow pit development and the
consequent reduction in productivity is high. On the assumption that the maximum economic haul
distance is 2 km, individual pits would need to be of 20000m1 capacity which, if they are excavated to
about 2.5m depth, vould have an area of 0.8ha. The overall programme would require of the order of
310 pits, covering a total area of approximately 250ha, which is almost equal to the overall permanent
land acquisition requirement identified for this project.
In Bangladesh, fill is generally sourced from a longitudinal borrow adjacent to the road embankment.
the necessary land being acquired by government. RHD's policy for the Dhaka-Sylhet project wvill be
different: to avoid the administrative complications of extensive land acquisition and to guard against
possible endangerment of the toe of the embankment, excavation within the Road Reserve will generally
not be permitted The fill material will be obtained! from pits developed by the contractors. under
private arrangements wvith individual landowners. GOB/RHD  will not acquire land needed  in
connection with borrow pit development.
The degree to which such private arrangements can reasonablJy be controlled by RHD is limited. The
Consultants made a pre-selection of potential borrow sites as listed in ANNEX C
(ii)    Environmental Isszes Associated with Borrowpit Development
Above all, appropriate site selection is recognised as a crucial measure to confine andlor minimise
environmental impacts causing additional rehabilitation costs. Avoidance of sensitive areas for borrowN
pits is thus a fundamental requirement when applving environmental measures in this project.

In reviewing borrow proposals, the supervision consultant will apply the criteria for avotding scnsitivc
spots located at or nearby the following sites:
*              Mosques, temples, eidgahs, graveyards
*             Villages, other settlements, incl. areas of specific value for minorities
*             Schools, clinics
*             Structures such as flood control embankments. sluices, gas pipelines
*             Reserved Forest, plantations
Large mature trees
*             Know n habitats for rare, endangered species
*             Wetlands
*             River banks
*             Archaeological sites
Contractors working on road rehabilitation projects in Bangladesh commonly remove material to a
relatively shallow depth (approximately Im in many cases) from fields on both sides adjacent to the
road. This results in a reduction in agricultural productivity related to removal of the topsoil. which
contains the bulk of the organic matter and plant nutrients in the soil profile. and forms the rooting
medium for annual crops. In addition, the resultant lowering of ground level means that drainage
conditions become worse in the root zone in locations where the water table is at a relatively shallow
depth (which situation applies to most, if not all, sections of road included in the project during the
main cropping season). The net result is that large areas of productive land become. significantly less
productive.
Most landowners, and especially small landowners, already operate at or very close to subsistence
level, and even marginal reductions in productivity are likely to be significant in termns of reducing
family food production, or income in cases where a surplus is available for sale or trade. Payments
made under lease agreements for use of land for borrow pits are most unlikely to reflect the long-term
consequences of productivity reduction, and consequent losses will therefore be largely uncompensated.
unless measures are adopted to minimise these adverse effects.
In addition, there are likely to be problems associated with soil compaction on temporary haul routes
which connect borrow pits with the roads, again in terms of a reduction in productivity. Most farmers
use simple country ploughs for land preparation, which are capable of working the soil only to a
shallow depth, and it seems likely that this would not be sufficient to break up compacted layers caused
by the passage of heavily-laden trucks. Even where mechanical rotovators are used, these only work
the soil to a depth comparable with that which can be achieved with a country plough. Although the
effects of such compaction in terms of productivity reduction are unlikely to be as severe as those
associated with borrow extraction, they will nevertheless be significant unless suitable measures such
as shallow subsoil ripping are adopted to restore the land after borrow extraction ceases.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                    Environmental Management Plan
To summarise the main mitigation measures as an environmental safeguard
for this component, the following provisions are made
-    Technical Specifications relating to borrow pit acquisition and modc of
extraction include environmentally-related clauses in the contracts, most
importantly as shown in Table 4. 10;
-    The contract documents require the Contractor to liaise with  local
communities with respect to large developments such as borrow pits and
haul roads (large borrows will also require the permission of the local
authority, and in the case of "hill cutting" these could be referred to the
District Commissioner who may in turn seek advice on the application from
the Department of Environment);
the Contractor must submit his proposals for temporary facilities and
haulage to the Engineer, who may disallow certain methods if these might
cause nuisance or harm, and must leave all sites in a safe and stable state
including relief of compaction under trafficked areas;
Clauses will be included in the construction contracts as a means of reducing
the possibility of exploitation of unsophisticated landowners by unscrupulous
contractors, minimising the area of land affected, and to facilitate post-use
rehabilitation;
The Engineer may inspect the Contractor's agreement with any landowvner (to
confirn the conditions agreed in it), and reserves the right to restore any
borrow site not adequately reinstated by the Ccntractor, at the Contractor's
cost;
It is proposed that a suitably qualified and experienced national NGO should
be appointed by RHD to advise and assist landowners on matters related to
borrow pit lease arrangements and to plan, oversee and manage post-use
reinstatement support. Local NGOs should also lbe appointed on each section
of road to assist in implementation of the reinstatement process on a day-to-
day basis, where these are in a positioni to provide the necessary technical
expertise.

2.6     Borrow Pits
2.6.2   Acquisition and Use    GOB's present policy is for contractors to find and supply their own
of Borrow Pits         materials for fill from outside the road reserve. This clause:
- establishes the Contractor's obligation to make his own arrangements for
supplying fill material,
- reminds the Contractor of his obligation to obtain any necessary permits
for borrow pits from the competent authorities;
- notes that borrow pits may not be permitted in hill areas,
- establishes the Engineer's right to a copy of agreements made with any
landowners.

2.6.4    Construction Methods  Reminds the Contractor to apply his duties and obligations under the
(for borrow pits)      Conditions of Particular Application when winning and working borrow
materials, especially with regard to public safety, haul routes, liaison with
local residents, and site restoration.

- leaving borrow pit slopes in a safe and stable condition;
- relieving compaction under heavily trafficked areas.

2.6.5    Reshaping of Pits      (Pending Issue, to be negotiated with Client/Bank), as discussed below
Note:   For more technical details, reference is made the clauses explained in the EMN
for the Feeder Road Type A
(iii)    Borrow Pit Rehabilitation Options
If applicable and subject to further discussions with the Client and the Bank, certain types of borrow
pits could be rehabilitated into fish ponds, i.e. re-shaping them into aquaculture ponds following the
design of a fisheries expert, and in close consultation with fisheries extension services operating in the
area.
Such options, including clauses in contracts where applicable, should duly be taken into consideration
wvhile developing a RAP. It needs to be identified to which extend borrow pits located on private land
could be negotiated to become rehabilitated for aquaculture use. Both fish culture and resettlement arc
theoretically possible, but the first depends on the specific interest of the landowner, and the second on
secure tenure arrangements, i.e. purchase by government for onward leasing or sale to the resettlers.
It is anticipated that the borrow areas to be used for the project will mostly be located on private land.
Landowners may wish to use the excavations for fish production. In the Northeast (Shaistaganj -
Sylhet), however, this is likely to be constrained by the rigid and stratified social and land tenure
structure of rich absentee landowners and very poor agricultural labourers. There is reported to be
little likelihood in this region of interest in hands-on development of new ventures such as pond
fisheries, since profits can continue to be had from traditional (albeit declining) capture fisheries.
Elsewhere along the road the land tenure system is more egalitarian and some development may be
possible.
As for borrow pits located in public lands. however, a design clause should be included for future land-
use option as fishponds in junction with resettlement sites for displaced persons.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                    Environmental Managcment Plan
(iv)    Fisheries Extension and Technical Assistance
Given the importance of minimising the effects of borrow extraction in relation to the overall
environmental performance of the project, and the likelihood that RHD may find it difficult to obtain
local financing for the programme, since it represents a departure from the convention. it is proposcd
that:
C The Bank should finance, as a supporting TA project. the costs associatecd w ith involvement of/hk'
managing NGO, together with the costs of providing speciyic specialist technical support. cIncd
part of the costs of local NGO involvement. especially those relating to a4qzuacuiltulre training.
Fisheries extension is carried out by the Fisheries Department and by a number of NGOs. e.g. CARE.
which is running pilot projects on cage aquacultire in the Northeast. -and Friends in Village
Development Bangladesh, one of CARE's partner organisations in Sylhct. The World Food Programmc
has a "Feeder Project" promoting fisheries in borrow pits.
Other options to rehabilitate and re-use large-sized borrow pits is for catch fisheries. In such cases.
fisheries extension would be required to ensure optimal operation and benefit from such schemes. In
this project region owners of low-lying lands already modify their land by digging small depressions
(kuas) in which fish becomes concentrated once the flood water recede from the surrounding floodplain
(SNC. FAP-6, Fisheries Specialist Study, 1994). However, there is little scope for developing such
extensive catch-fishery scheme where multiple land ownership for a borrow pit are involved.
It is recommended that the opportunities for increased iFish procluction from borrow pits be investigated
by a fisheries specialist during the early stage of construction in order to avoid too much extra
earthworks in connection with rehabilitation works for borrow pit sites.
4.3.3 Employment Opportunities and Public Relations
Employment opportunities for the local population is likely to be a substantial benefit, as works w ill
involve to a large degree unskilled labour. With this respect there will be considerable opportunities for
the poorest segments of rural society to participate, including the landless and w omen Enhancement of
employment opportunities during construction will be achieved through the construction contracts
requiring contractors to maximise local hire of labour; to carry out a specified percentage of the works
(as measured by contract value) by hand labour; to take positive steps to recruit women, the poor and
destitute and the landless as labour; and to ensure that at least 30% of the unskilled labour force
employed at any one time is female.
To minimise disturbance to residents during construction it uill be important to establish and maintain
good communications with local communities. Mechanisms set up under the RAP at two levels:
-    establishment of forrnal links between the supervision consultant and affected communities.
-    an obligation on the contractors to liaise with residents and report any problems to the
Engineer.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                    Environmcntal Management Plan
4.3.4 Tree Planting Programme
The loss of roadside trees which will be substantial in this project (see Annex A) will be mitigated by a
major tree planting programme, which will result in more trees being planted than are removed in
connection with construction. The essential features are that mixed species planting of 2500 to 3500
trees/km and subsequent maintenance will be carried out by groups comprising PAPs as well as thc
most disadvantaged elements of local communities, organised by an experienced NGO. and that thosc
responsible for planting and maintenance will share the benefits with RHD.
As the project itself is the direct cause of tree removal, and subscquent environmental and socio-
economic effects, the roadside tree planting programme should be included in the project budget
Designed as a social forestry pogram it would the the followving features:
(i)    Objectives
*      Replace the trees to be felled with an adequate number of young trees
(e.g. five 1.2 m plants per tree removed)
*      Maximise productive use of the Road Reserve
*      Restore livelihood for PAPs
*      Provide benefits to poor, particularly to poor women
*      C-ontribute to embankment protection and maintenance
Reduce / avoid embankment encroachment (spacing the new trees sufficiently densely)
-      Assist erosion control and wave protection
a      Contribute to ecological diversification
*      Improve aesthetics and shade
In addition, roadside plantation with suitable spacing will discourage squatter occupation of the
embankment wvhich would both affect the embankment stability and lead to future social problems when
further widening or adding paved slow traffic lanes is necessary to increase road capacity.
(ii)    Approach to the Programme, and Identfi cation of Beneficiaries
Over the last decade tree planting on embankments has been carried out by several organisations in
Bangladesh, in particular RHD, LGED, the Forest Department, the World Food Programme, and a
variety of NGOs. All have attempted some form of "social forestry", i.e. benefit-sharing uwith persons
other than (but including) the landovner. These schemes have met with varying degrees of success
Not surprisingly, reviews indicate that:
(a)    the key factor is tenurial: "who gets the benefits?", and
(b)    public participation in planning, design and implementation is essential.
Considerations for successful scheme design are:
*             Benefit sharing, tenurial rights
*             Public participation in scheme planning. design and implementation
*      .      Involvement of all stakeholders
*             Group selection
*             Degree of motivation
*             Choice of species
*             Plant establishment and protection
*             Dissemination of technical knowledge

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
As for beneficiaries the focus will be on those groups, mainly comprising very poor women, who
depend on existing roadside plantations for leaves and small branches used as their domestic fuel. or
who sell a proportion to derive income. The extensive tree felling which is needed in connection with
implementation of the works will deprive such groups of the resourcc which they currcntly exploit. The
programme will also be open to others representing the most disadvantaged elcments of rural societ.
such as poor or destitute males and females. together with the landless or functionally landless X ho
have limited opportunities for income generation
(iii)   Selection of Co-ordinating NGO
The question of whether the NGO rcsponsible for assisting RI-ID in implementation of the RAP. should
also be responsible for managing the tree planting programme has been given careful consideration
Two factors were given particular attention:
• RAP implementation will very largely take place during the pre-construction phase for each road
section, while the main work related to the tree planting programmes will take place towards the
end, or immediately after completion of the construction wvorks on each section: i.e. some 15 to 24
months later, when the RAP teams on each section have moved away to other sections
* there are grave doubts that the RAP implementatlon NGO has the staff resources, technical and
organisational skills, local contacts and credibility, to undertake this geographically widely dispersed
programme, which will also involve provision of continued support over a relatively long period.
Consequently, the programmes have been planned on the basis that they will be implemented through a
country-wide operating national NGO with considerabile experience in the relevant technical fields. and
who already have a well-established local presence in the areas concemed, rather than on the basis of
implementation through the RAP NGO.
(iv)    Group Formation
In the interests of efficient management it is recommended that a single large and experienced NGO
should be appointed by RHD to oversee and manage the planting programme. It is essential that the
NGO or NGOs concemed should have proven capability to organise and manage extensive
programmes. Appointments need to be made well before (at least 12 months and preferably 15-18
months) before actual planting is scheduled to commence, since an adequate lead time will be neccssar
in order to:
• identify, establish and brief groups
* arrange benefit sharing agreements between RHD and the groups
* ascertain group preferences regarding tree species to be planted
*develop detailed implementation plans and planting schemes, taking into account group preferences
and the overall objectives of the schemes
* establish sapling nurseries
On each section of road, a number of groups will have to be established, each with responsibility for the
fixed length Nvithin their local area, so as to minimise problems associated with members travelling to
sites in connection with planting and subsequent maintenance, the need for wvomen in particular to be
near their homes etc. It is important that each group should comprise members from a single Union
Parishad and should operate only in its omvn Union, so as to avoid difficulties betwveen communities
from different jurisdictions.
Page 45



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Enmironmental Management Plan
Potential group members should be identified by the organising NGO. through discussions with the
Chairmen of the Unions concerned, and should comprise the poor, the destitute. the landless and others
who are socially or financially disadvantaged. with preference being given to women wvho fall into one
of these categories. Other aspects being equal, first prioritv should be given to those disadvantaged
persons who have been directly or indirectlv affected by the project land acquisition process or by
felling of existing trees on embankments. This identification process wvill require consultation and co-
ordination with the NGO responsible for RAP implementation.
Once potential group members have been identified, it will be necessary to sclect those who .%ill
actually become members of active groups. since it is vital that numbcrs in each group should be
limited, so that a reasonable return on their labour can be achieved. If a group is too large. there is
always a danger that an individual's share of benefits will be so small as to make participation unviable
in terms of making a significant improvement in living conditions possible. and lack of commitment
may result. On the other hand, groups which are too small may be incapable of carrying out planting at
a sufficient rate to achieve completion in the relativelv narrow planting window between the onset of the
monsoon rains and the start of the flood season. In addition, the objective of improving living standards
for the optimum number of families mav not be met. In some cases. a compromise may be necessarn
between the numbers of people wanting to participate in the programme and optimum numbers related
to significant improvement in living standards for those who participate..
As part of the detailed planning process, the NGO responsible should determine the number of groups
needed on each section of the road, together with the optimum number of members in each, taking all
relevant factors into account. Current RHD practice is for groups to comprise around 10 members/km
of road, but this should only be taken as indicative of the optimum number, which may! well vary within
and between sections. Through consultation with the Parishad Chairmen, criteria for the selection of
group members should be developed, with high priority being given to those individuals in greatest need
of support.
Preliminary assessment suggests that approximately 25 groups will need to be established in connection
with implementation of each year's planting programme to be executed over a period of 3 years. on the
basis that:
* a 3km section will be allocated to each group (this is a reasonable distance for travel to planting
sites for women, who will need to be fairly close to their homes so that work does not unduly
interfere with domestic commnitments)
* 75% of the total length of the road project will require replanting, giving 60 km to be planted each
year over a 3 year period
*actual planting to take place over a two month period each year (June-July). before the onset of the
flood season
* approximately 10-12 persons in each group, of whom about half would be directly involved with the
planting, and the other half involved in nursery activities, planting hole preparation etc.
(v)    Benefit Sharing Agreements
RHD's plantations are established and managed by its Arboriculture Unit. which has been involved in
some benefit-sharing schemes since April 1992. The Unit has carried out replanting under both
RRMPI and RRMP2, engaging contractors from the official list and using RRMP funding (although
the RRMP2 funds fell short). In 1994 the Arboriculture Unit drafted roadside planting gulidelines
including standard lease agreements (RHD 1994: unofficial English translation at Annex B).

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                       Environmental Management Plan
In accordance with RHD's roadside planting guidelines agreement will have to be reachcd between the

responsibilities of the various parties concerned anid preciselv how benefit sharing of plantation
production will operate. The current guideline form of agreement devcloped and used by- the
Arboricultural Unit gives a maximum of 50% of the benefits to social forestrn participants. which is
lower than the 55% proposed for the forthcoming ADB Forestry Scctor Project for roadside planting
The selected NGO should assist RHID in developing a modified form of agreemcnt. broadlh similar to
that proposed for the ADB Forestry Sector Project (') Local beneficiaries should receive I 00% of the
benefits arising from any thinning 6 years after planting. and oftthc trimmings (= fuclwood) arisin, over
the planned 30 year rotation cvcle, in return for caring for the trecs and doing simple routine
maintenance to the embankmcnts. When the trees are fclled after 30 ycars, the agreements should make
provision for felling revenues to be distributed between IRHD, the local authorities. and local
beneficiaries and a tree replanting fund, with at least 55%  going to local planting groups. The
agreements should also make provision for payment of a proportion of plantation establishment costs
(probably around 15%) to the responsible NGO as a service charge. to mcet administrative:
management and other costs associated with setting up beneficiary groups and supervising nursery
establishment, planting etc. The agreements should also involve Union Parishads as beneficiaries. since
a share in the felling revenue will promote long-term interest in and security of the trees. RHD should
be responsible for providing the NGO with the funds necessary for procurement of seeds. fertiliser and
other materials, including simple hand tools needed for plantation establishment, and for payments to
group members for their labour.
In this latter respect, it should be noted that the groups, being made up of the poor etc, are in need of
immediate rewards in the form of cash for their efforts. If the; programme is based solely on benefit
sharing in return for labour, there is likely to be little enthusiastn for a scheme which effectivclv delavs
receipt of rewards for. 6 years, at which time proceeds; from the first thinning would be available for
distribution. Cash payments for labour should therefore be part Df the programrnme.
Followving construction, the whole road embankment will belong to RHD. In most areas RHD's
owmership will only extend down to the toe of the embankment and not beyond. since land acquisition
will be the minimum  necessary and no extra land will be acquired for borrox  pits (suippl- of
embankment materials is the contractors' responsibility - see Sections 3.3. 1 and 4.4.2).

their embankment lands to the Forest Department under a Mlemorandum of Agreement with the
following distribution of benefits:

The roadside planting programme will cover approximately 150 km of the road, betwveen settlements
Planting will be done on either one or both sides of the embankment.-according to need. To maintaii

timber; fuelwood; permanent and/or ornamental. fruit; medicinal. Reference is made to the selection of
suitable plant species identified for the NHB project. In a limited number of locations. other categories
may be appropriate, e.g. Barringtonia acuitangula (Hijal) for its ecological value in wet areas. and
Ficus benghalensis (Bot) which is traditionally planted at bridges. Some of the most popular candidatc
trees for roadside planting are listed in Table 4.12, but some experimentation may be necessary since.
unlike most road embankments in Bangladesh. the Dhaka-Sylhet embankment will bc properly
compacted and therefore less hospitable to tree roots.
Plant nurseries will need to be established at an early ciate in order to grow seedlings on until they reach
the required height for planting out (I to I .m). While existing RHD nurseries could supplx saplings.
these could be located far from the project roads. thus increasing transportation costs and introducing
difficulties in maintaining regular supplies to planting sites during the short planting season.
Furthermore, existing nurseries have their own programnme commitments to meet, and may not have the
spare capacity to produce the sapling numbers requiredl to a tight time schedule.
The responsible NGO should determine the most appropriate nursery strategy for each section of the
road, taking into account such factors as the length of the section, and the numbers of trees to be
planted at various locations. While there are advantages in making each planting group responsible for
its own nursery, in terms of skills development reaching a larger number of people. ease of transport of
planting material to work sites, promoting a sense of (group responsibility etc., large numbers of small
nurseries may prove to be difficult to manage efficiently, and the altemative of fewer but larger
nurseries may have to be adopted.
Whatever strategy is adopted, the nurseries should be set up so as to produce approximately 50% more
planting material than is required by the planting plans. This vvill make allowance for partial planting
failures, but more importantly, sale of the excess by those participating in nursery operations will
provide additional income support at marginal cost. Some of' those who develop tree raising skills
through involvement in nursery production on this project may find that they can subsequently operate
a viable small-scale business based on the homestead, thus extending the long-term benefits of the
programme.
The nurseries will need to be located near to or on the project roads, to facilitate transport of planting
material to worksites at the beginning of the wet season. They should have sufficient area and
production capacity to meet the requirements of the individual planting schemes that they have been set
up to supply. Simple shade sheds may be necessary for raising certain species, and in all cases an
assured supply of water will be necessary, which may involve provision of a shallow tubewell equipped
with a pump. Security, in the form of a night-wvatchman may be needed in some locations. In selecting
locations for nurseries, consideration should be given to the utilisation of khas land where this is
available, as a means of reducing costs. Discussions with the local authorities will be necessary in this
respect.
Planting designs would vary according to silvicultural and road. safety requirements. Presently RHD
recommends close spacing (dow-n to 1.25 m), followed by thinning after six years. Cost savings may be
possible by using wider spacing, giving fewer plants per km. The trade-off is that with wider spacing
there is less physical barrier against embankment encroaching which, in tum, could have significant
negative impact in flood-prone areas.
All new plants (min. 1.2 m tall) should be staked, and will need to be protected from  livestock.
particularlv goats. This is most effectively done when local "ownership" of the trees is established b\
participatory methods such as social forestrv.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                 Environmental Managemcnt Plan
(vii)   Timing
Planting will be carried out in the first planting season (earlv monsoon) following construction.
necessitating advance planning and organisation. For the Dhaka-Svlhet road. RHD's Arboriculture
Unit has proposed a 50/50 mix of direct plantings (through rcgistered contractors) and "peoples'
participation", othervise replanting will be "too slow".
RHD will need to confirm its preferred institutional mechanism for planting on the Dhaka-Sylhet road
in 1998 in order to permit contracting as necessary and forvard planning for raising of the necessary
seedlings. It is recommended to include the supervision of the initiation of the planting schcmes (e. g.
nurseries development, site and species selection, planting techniques) the task of the environmental
supervision group of the contracted consultant, together with a qualified social forester (national).
working with the RHD Arboriculture Unit, Forest Department and appropriate NGOs.
(viii) Technical Assistance and Organisational Support
If social forestry is the preferred developmental solution associated with this project, this implies a need
to strengthen the RHD Arboriculture Unit to increase its capacity for implementing social forestry. not
only for RRMP3.
Technical skill as well as a high level of planning and organisational skill will be required to ensure
successful implementation' of the afforestation schemes. In view of the importance of the planting
programme in mitigating one of the major adverse environmental impacts of the project, and the fact
that no provision has been made in the TOR for the construction supervision consultant or elsewvhere
for specialist inputs connected with the programme it is recommended that Technical Assistance will be
provided to the planting schemes through both intemational and national experts employed under this
project.
The TA should comprise provision of the services of a specialist in social forestry. The expert should
be equally experienced in group formation and organisation. Service wvould be required for an overall
period of 4 months, split into 3 inputs, being 2 months in connection with the first vear's programme
and I month for each of the second and third year programmes.
4.4  MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION MEASURES DURING POST-
CONSTRUCTION PHASE
4.4.1 Maintenance Work for Roadside Plantations
Following planting, roadside plantations will managed by the lando-vner. RHD. through the agreed
benefit-sharing mechanism, i.e. local beneficiaries formed into user groups by RHD's Arboriculture
Unit or the Forest Department and/or NGOs.
4.4.2 Road Maintenance
Road maintenance will be carried out by RHD. which under RRNiP3 will begin a far-reaching
reorganisation designed to improve road maintenance nation-widc. Accordingly. this will not be
considered in this EMP.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
4.4.3   Other Post-Construction Activities
(i)    Road safety
As part of RRMP3, RHD's capability to collect: analyse and respond to accident data "vill be impro' ed
and extended into the regions. Other aspects of road, safetv such as driver training. public education
and vehicle inspection are components of the recently approved National Road saf!ty Strategic Action
Plan (National Road Safety Council 1997).
(ii)    Roadside development control
Unplanned roadside development on the improved road will reduce average vchicle speeds and increase
accident risk sooner rather than later. This aspect of' social 2nd economic development is difficult to
influence, but improved controls are needed if the benefits of the road investment are not to be lost. It
is recommended that this subject is followed up, perhaps by a technical assistance input or working
group under RRMP3.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                 Environmenta] Management Plan
5.  ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
5.1    RATIONALE
Environmental monitoring is an essential tool for environrmental management as it provides the basic
infornation for rational management decisions.
The prime objectives of environmental monitoring are:
*      To check on whether mitigation and enhancement measures are actually being adoptcd. and arc
proving effective in practice.
*     To provide a means whereby impacts wvhich were subject to uncertainty at the time of
preparation of the EMP, or which were unforeseen, can be identified. and steps taken to adopt
appropriate control measures.
To provide information on the actual nature and extent of key impacts and the effectiveness of
mitigation and enhancement measures used on the project, in order to improve the planning and
execution of similar projects in future.
*      The monitoring plan also includes long-term benefits monitoring related to social forestry and
other employment enhancing efforts designed under this project.
It should be noted that the long-term monitoring program costs are not budgeted in the EMP as this
program is suggested element of the overall environmental monitoring efforts undertaken by RHD
Environmental unit supported under this RRMP3
Monitoring has two components:
Compliance monitoring, which checks whether prescribed actions have been carried out.
usually by visual observation and the use of checklists.
*     E.ffects monitoring, which records the beneficiary and adverse consequences of activities on the
biophysical and social environment. This is often by repeat measurements of a set of
objectively verifiable indicators.
Road projects invariably have a much higher emphasis on compliance rather than effects monitoring
since the greatest potential for direct environmental damage occurs before and during construction, and
impacts during these stages can be predicted and consequently controlled by design adjustments and
constraints placed on the contractors' activities.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                       Environmcntal Management Plan
5.2 COMPLIANCE MONITORING
5.2.1   Pre-Construction
Compliance monitoring during the pre-construction phase of this project has three components:
(i)    Checking the project design
This component comprises checking that the project's design incorporates appropriate measures
to avoid or minimise negative impacts, as identified in the projcct's environrmental assessment
report and subsequently approved or modified.
This task has been the Consultant's responsibility as part of preparation of the Detailed Dcsign.
The process involved extensive interaction between the Environmental Specialists and other
design team members, as well as liaison with RHD and other GOB agencies for guidance on
policy. The measures taken are described in Section 4 of this EMP.
An important item yet to be covered is amendment of the supervision consultants' scope of
works to include the environmental tasks defined in this EMP.
(ii)    Checking the contract documents
This task comprises checking that appropriate environmental protection and social welfarc
clauses have been included in the contract documents.
The Consultant included a variety of environrmentally and socially-related clauses in the draft
contract documents submitted to the Client - see Section 4.
(iii)    Checking the land acquisition process
This component of pre-construction compliance monitoring comprises checking that
(a)    the project has a realistic land acquisition and compensation plan which complies with
both GOB law and Bank policy and is properly staffed and funded,
(b)    that the approved plan is being implemented in a, timely and effective manner.
As part of Detailed Design, the Consultant currently prepares a Preliminarv Resettlement
Action Plan intended to meet the requirements of itern (a) above. The proposed RAP will
require checking and approval by both GOB and the Bank tQ ensure compliance wvith their
respective requirements.
The second part of this component - monitoring the land acquisition, compensation and
resettlement process - will be the responsibility of an NGO/consultant team to be appointed by
RHD to facilitate implementation of the RAP. The monitoring will involve consultation Vwith
entitled persons (EPs) and project-affected persons (PAPs) in the field, as wxell as with the
various government teams involved, and is described in the RAP.
The Terms of Reference and ReN.est for Proposals for tCIe supervision ontract wero issued in late N,ven,ber
1997, four months in advance of scheduled completion of Lhe project's Environmr,ntal Managemn,nt 'lIn.
Page 53



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
A second level of oversight of all three pre-construction compliance tasks wvill be providcd by the
Bank's review of the project documentation as part of loan preparation and approval.
It should be noted that all these components will also be checked by the Dhaka-Svlhet supervision
consultants to be appointed by RHD in 1998. as part of thcir review of the project's design and contract
documentation.
5.2.2   Construction
This part of the monitoring program primarily involved monitoring physical impacts on the
environmental conditions associated with the contractor's works. Compliance monitoring during the
construction will comprise the following activities:
(i)    Review of contractors 'proposed designs and working methods
This task comprises a review at project start-up to ensure that the designs and working methods
proposed by the contractors have taken account of the environmental constraints specified in
the tender documents (geotechnical, ecological, social, heritage features. safety).
(ii)    Site-specific review of contractors' temporary facilities
This activity comprises review and inspection as necessary, to ensure that the Contractors'
arrangements regarding temporary facilities are satisfactory.
(iii)   Regular site inspections
During construction, regular (and unannounced) inspections to ensure that the stipulated
procedures are being followed with respect to, e.g., pollution control. liaison with local
communities, construction traffic, protection of waterways, protective clothing. and similar
requirements.
This will include systematic observation of site activities using checklists to be developed by
the supervising consultant's Environmental Specialist, and evaluation of any monitoring data
provided to the Engineer by the Contractor under the terms of the contract (e.g. in the monthly
returns on labour and accidents).
(iv)    Certification of site clearance and restoration
Prior to completion, a check that all requirements regarding clean-up and reinstatement have
been met, especially with respect to temporary access roads, borrow pits, camps, and working
areas.
(v)    Checking on implementation of roadside tree planting
After completion of construction, monitoring to ensure timely and effective implementation of
the roadside tree-planting programme.
The first four activities will be the responsibility of the Engineer and the Enginecr's Representative. as
part of their day-to-day activities on site.
P;agc 54



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
It should be noted that the compliance monitoring system described here is fully controlled by the
project proponent; it is not independent, instead relying on professional objectivity for a balanced
consideration of all viewpoints, and professional competence for effective implcmentation   If
considered necessary. an independent viewvpoint could be provided by external agencies such as the
Department of Environment, university departments, NGOs and consultants.  This would require
adequate funding and the establishment of a suitable reporting and management mechanism.
The tree-planting programme falls outside the scopc of the civil wvorks contract. and thcrcfore w-ill be
the direct responsibility of the RRMP3 Project Implementation Office (PIO) *which *-ill arrange and
supervise implementation.
5.2.3   Reporting
(i)    Pre-construction                   -
With respect to project design and contract documentation, proposed environmental protcction
measures are reported to the Client in this EMP.
With respect to land acquisition, compensation and resettlement. the proposed process is
reported to the Client in the project's Resettlement Action Plan.
(ii)    Construction
Environmental matters tend to be downgraded or forgotten on construction sites. To avoid this.
it is essential that reporting procedures on environmental matters, as on health and safety. are
formalised and integrated into normal supervisory activities. This means at a minimum placing
relevant environmental and social topics on the standard agenda for the Engineer's regular
project management meetings, and including the same items as a standard section in the
Engineer's or Representative's monthly reports to the Employer.
The development and use of appropriate inspection checklists, compliance and non-compliance
certificates, and reporting forms should be a component of the project's quality assurancc (QA)
system to be developed by the supervision consultant.
5.3 EFFECTS MONITORING
5.3.1   Pre-Construction
Prior to commencement of the civil works, environmental effects monitoring will be limited to activities
required by the RAP.
5.3.2   Construction
For practical reasons, on linear construction sites with relatively low and transient direct physical
impacts, effects monitoring tends to be visual and subjective. and is carried out as a subsidiar- activit\
within overall compliance monitoring. For example, if pumping for dewatering a work site is creating
an unacceptable sediment plume in a watercourse, an efect, then this should be spotted during normal
supervisory inspections and halted as a matter of compl.rance.

Dhaka - Svlhet Road Project                                       Environmental Management Plan
On Dhaka-Sylhet, an important mechanism for effects monitoring wvill be the communitv liaison
process to be established by:
(a)    the Contractor, in relation to his facilities and operations,
(b)    the Engineer, as part of day-to-day project management.
Some of the parameters typically associated with this type of project which can be uscd as objectively
verifiable indicators of unacceptable effects, and  therefore of matters requiring  compliance
enforcement, are listed in Table 5.1.
Table 5.1 Indicators of Unacceptable Environmental Effects during-Construction
Environmental Effect                        Objectively Verifiable Indicators
Deteriorating condition of roads used    physical degradation of hauling/access roads, pavement crackJngs,
by construction traffic            embankment subsiding, increased number of accidents
Excessive delays to normal traffic  hours delay as compared with previous travel time for same distance
Unreasonable frequency of work     records of number and nature of accidents, compared with records of
accidents                          similar construction works in Bangladesh
Excessive airborne dust            direct measurements of dust particle concentration; reports on
increase of respiratory problems among local communities and

Decline of fisheries resources     Sample catches at fish migrating and nursing sites, and comparison
to previous fisheries data
Evidence of unacceptable effects will become available from  normal supervision  inspections.
Contractor's returns, and community liaison meetings.
Borrow Sites - Environmental Sozndness and Rehabilitation
Environmental checks on the possible site-specific impacts of borrow sites, particularly in connection
with the hydraulic regime and drainage pattem, will constitute a major component in the task of the
Environrental Specialist responsible for the Project Supervision. Where applicable. the Environmental
Specialist will regularly monitor the rehabilitation of selected borrowv pits into fishponds, and call for
advice of fisheries experts whenever necessary.
Air Pollution
During construction the principal air pollutant will be dust raised bx vehicles. The Conditions require
contractors to avoid dust nuisance, which will be achieved limiting construction vehicle speed through
settlements, routing vehicles around rather than through villages where feasible, watering the road and
other work sites as needed, and other measures including e.g. the sheeting of loads. Hot-mix plants will
be at least 500 m from settlements and will be fitted with dust suppression equipment.
Following construction, dust will continue to be a problem in settlements where bazaar and parking
areas off the road are not paved. This is a matter of town planning and developmcnt.
Page 56



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                   Environmental Management Plan
Noise Polltiton
During construction, noise levels will be controlled by application of the Conditions of Contract which
limit working hours, require all vchicles and machinerv to be fitted with silencers. and other%xise
obligate the contractors to avoid nuisance. There may be some need to carry out piling w orks at night
to meet construction schedules, but the impacts will be short-term and localised.
5.3.3  Post-Construction
Post-construction monitoring will include the following elements:
(i)    Monitoring for road maintenance
When the improved road is operational, it will be necessary for RHD to establish a monitoring
programme to permit planning and implementation of routine and periodic road maintenance.
This programme will cover at least:
- pavement condition;
- embankment condition;
- condition of structures;
and will be developed by the Network Manageiment Wing of RHD to be established through the
RRMP3 Institutional Development Component (see RHID 1997 for a description of the agreed
RHD Reorganisation Programme).
(ii)    Roadside planting programme
The condition and management of roadside plantings will be monitored directly by the agency
selected to implement the planting programme. either RHD's Arboriculture Unit, or the Forest
Department, or an NGO (see description of options in Section 4.4.4).
(iii)   Indirect effects
As traffic levels increase following construction there will be a number of indirect effects
associated with the road. These will include accidents, increased noise, reduced air quality, and
roadside development. At present there has been no decision to include specific responses to
these effects in the project. Relevant notes are:
national accident data will be collected by RHD for entry and analysis by its nexN
micro-computer accident analysis system (MAAP), established under RRMP2 and to
be further developed under RRMP3's road safety programmre;
noise and air quality monitoring fall under the remit of the Department of Environment.
which has very limited capacity;
roadside development, long recognised Ito be a major factor affecting road performance
and safety (see TRL 1991), requires control by both RHD (within the Road Reserve)
and by local authorities, under the District Commissioners.

Dhaka - Svlhet Road Project                                   Environmnenal Management Plan
(iv)   Social and environmental impact evaluation
The Dhaka-Sylhet Road Rehabilitation Project is a large infrastructure project. When such
large ventures have been completed and operated for some time. it is helpful for institutional
development purposes and to assist future planning to carry out a post-construction evaluation
or audit. This exercise looks at the whole project cycle from initial identification through the
pre-feasibility, feasibilitv, design, construction and early operational stages. Its purpose is to
identify areas where improvements could be made. e.g. by improved intcgration of
environmental considerations with engineering and economic analysis at carlier stages. so
shortening the project cycle and increasing developmental benefits.
Such an exercise, which could be carried out in conjunction with the development of the
Technical Wing of RHD, namely the Environmental Unit carried out during 2001-2002. would
be an important input to RHD's corporate strategy for improved efficiency and effectiveness in
project design and implementation.
(v)    Air Quality Monitoring
The project itself has no provision for air quality monitoring activities unless specific budget is
provided for. Ambient air quality monitoring will be one of the elements that need to be
focused on while developing the RHD- Environrnental Unit.  In close co-operation wvith
national environmental agencies this institution will then define policies -and measures to
contain this impact, not only on this highway.
(vi)   Noise Monitoring
Following construction, noise levels are likely to increase in settled areas on the Dhaka-Svlhet
Road in line with increasing traffic levels. At preselnt noise levels along roads in congested
areas in Bangladesh are very high, almost entirely due to the excessive use of air homs on
trucks and buses. This has become part of driving culture, and pedestrians now expect road
vehicles to announce their presence and intention with prolonged horn use. Behavioural issues
such as this cannot be resolved by engineering, and the climate and building standards prevent
the application of mitigation measures such as installing double-glazing to sound-proof
buildings.
As with air pollution, any approach to dealing with the issue of noise must be based on hard
data. Therefore, the first element in any strategv to combat noise pollution wvould be to
measure it. Similarly, this approach would require the provision of appropriate technical skills
and equipment to the Environmental Unit of RHD and/or the Department of Environrment.

6.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EMP
6.1 EMBEDDING OF THE EMP IN THE ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR THE DHAKA-SYLHET ROAD PROJECT
The Dhaka-Sylhet Road Project is the largest component of RRMP3. and at an estimated cost of SI 80
million (excluding resettlement costs) comprises some 40 % of the project's total civil works budget.
Construction xvill be spread over 220 km of highway over a period of 3 - 4 vears, with six separate
multi-million dollar works packages being implemented concurrentlv by up to six separatc contractors
Effective supervision will thus require appreciable staff and logistical resources, and tight management.
It is understood that the Third Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP3) will be
implemented by the Ministry of Communications (MOC), co-ordinated by a Project Steering
Committee chaired by the Secretarv, Roads and Railways Division, and given day-to-day oversight by
a Project Team comprised of MOC, Inspector General. of Police, Ministry of Finance and the Planning
Commission.
Under this superstructure RHD vill manage RRMP3's civil wvorks programme for road construction.
rehabilitation and maintenance. To do this, RHD will establish a Project Implementation Office (PIO)
in Dhaka, with the Project Civil Works Director (PCWD) in charge of the overall implementation of the
new construction and rehabilitation works, being the responsible Engineer to the six contractors and
liaising with the Supervision Consultant.
As "the Engineer", the PCWD will appoint an RHD Project Manager for the Dhaka-Sylhet project, who
will have a supporting staff. RHD will also commission thz Supervision Consultant to act as the
"Engineer's Representative" in dealings with the contractors. This consultant will be a joint venture
lead by an experienced intemational consultant, selected through intemational competitive bidding. The
supervision consultant w,ill establish a head office in Dhaka, and will place resident engineers and other
staff at each contractor's base camp for contract supervision.
The PCWD will be assisted by three Resettlement Officers. Environmental matters will be followed up
at RHD level by the newly established Environmental Unit, staffed by one senior local Environmental
Specialist. At the same level, tree plantation schemes will be under the control and advice of the
Arboriculture Unit.
In terms of environmental management, the key links are those between the Envirornenital Engineer
forming the triangular relationship between the Supervision Consultant (the Engineer's Representative).
the tree plantation schemes, the borrow pit selection and rehabilitation programmes, and the co-
ordination of these activities wvhere applicable with the RAP implementing team. The Environmental
Supervision Expert will also work closely with the contractors, local authorities and communities
affected by the works.
An outline of organisational relationships for implementation of the Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project. and
particularly with reference to the Environmental Management Plan. is shown in Figure 6. 1.

6.2    RESPONSIBILITIES AND PHASING,
Executive responsibility for the Environrnental ManaLgement Plan involves a number of organisations.
each with specific responsibilities for particular activities during the pre-construction, construction and
operation and maintenance phases. The supervision consultant's environmentally and socially-related
tasks are summarised in Table 6.1.

EIA Trainer, and assistance to p[programmes where applicable.
*             Reporting on environmental/social issues.
6.2.1   Pre-construction Phase
Environmental management during the pre-construction phase is largely concerned with ensuring that
environmental matters have been adequately recognised and addressed in project plans, designs and
contract documents. Specific activities prior to construction relate to:
=>   Environmental assessment
>    Preparation of Environmental Management Plan (E.MP)
>    Preparation of detailed designs with due consideration of environmental issues
Preparation of tender and construction contract documents w -ith appropriatc environmental
and socially-related clauses
>   Preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
=>    Acquisition of land and property, and implementation of RAP
>    Enumeration and disposal of trees to be felled

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
Some of the above activities have already been completed, but are subject to review. Matters relating
to land acquisition and preparation and implementation of the RAP have been excluded from the EMP.
since they fall very largely outside the scope of mainstream environmental management activities,
although they obviously are related with respect to the two major componcnt of mitigation programs
associated with this project. By mid March 1998 the status of pre-construction phase activitics %%as as
follows:
* A Consolidated Environmental Impact Assessment (= present report. including man\ aspects
mentioned in the EIA submitted in October 1997) which concludes that the naturc and scopc of thc
works to be carried out on all road sections within the project would not give risc to unacceptable
levels of environmental impact, provided that appropriate, specified mitigation measurcs are
adopted and fully enforced, and that certain issues flagged out in this report are duly addrcssed.
The conclusion of categorising this project under Environmental Category B is, however subjcct to
review.
*  Preparation of a detailed Environmental Management & Monitoring Plan (EMP). This activity -,ill
be completed on submission of this report, which constitutes the project EMP.
*  Preparation of detailed designs which give due consideration to minimisation of adverse impacts
and benefit enhancement. This activity will have been completed by the Consultants by the end of
March 1998 (subject to review, in case alignment modifications are required due to environmental,
economic, resettlement and compensation considerations).
-  Preparation of tender and construction contract documentation which contains appropriate clauses
to allow control of impacts arising from construction activities. The current status is as indicated
above for detailed designs.
*  Review of Phase 1 environmental reports, designs and contract documents, to confirm  that
appropriate conclusions have been drawn from the environmental studies which have been carried
out, and that suitable measures have been incorporated in the EMP, designs and documentation to
reduce adverse environmental impacts to an acceptable level. This activity wvill be carried out by
the CSMC, as one of the priority tasks following mobilisation.
*  Responsibility for social assessment and identification of land-acquisition/compensation lies with
the contracted NGO providing the service to RHD.
•  The assessment of compensation for land and property xill involve a Joint On-Site Inventory and
Verification Team (JIV), the District Conmmissioner (DC), Roads & Highways Department (RHD)
and the Project Implementation Office (PIO). The Ministry of Lands has to sanction the final land
acquisition plans.
*  Enumeration, valuation, the acquisition of felling pemits, auctioning, and award and supervision of
felling contracts for roadside trees will be carried out by RHD's Arboriculture Unit, who wvill liaise
wherever applicable, with local authorities and any concerned NGOs or user groups.
6.2.2 Construction Phase
Environmental management during the construction phase is essentially concerned with controlling
impacts which could result from the activities of the contractor, through enforcement of those contract
clauses which relate to environmental protection (compliance). In this respect. it is important to
recognise that successful mitigation of construction impacts can only be achieved if the environmental
protection measures, as set out in the construction contracts, are properly enforced-

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                     Environmental Management Plan
Overall primary responsibility for construction supervision and contract management. and therefore for
environmental management during construction, will lie with tihe Engineer as defined in the construction
contracts i.e. the PCWD. Howvever, certain powers relating to day-to-day supervision will be delegated
by the PCWD to the Engineer's Representative (ER) i.e. the Team Leader of the CSMC. The ER will
work closely with the Environmental Supervision Expert and will have responsibility for ensuring that
all site environmental management and monitoring aspects are dealt with promptly and properly by his
staff, including the Resident Engineers and other site staff. The site supervision staff will be responsiblc
for environmental management and monitoring at the lowest organisational levcl, but their rolc in the
management chain is crucial if effective impact control is to be achieved.
The CSMC Environmental Specialist will be responsible for identifying the necessary procedures for
effective environmental management and monitoring, and will make reconLmendations to the ER for
their incorporation in the overall construction supervision and monitoring framework. This will cover
matters such as the development of checklists of key points wvhich should be monitored on a routine
basis during construction and reporting mechanisms for ensuring that appropriate action is taken.
should monitoring reveal that this is necessary.
Particular attention will be paid to establishing procedures whereby emergency action can be taken by
site staff in the event of the contractor acting in a manner which will cause immediate and significant
environmental damage, for example through the fellingr of trees which are protected under the contract.
interference with utilitv services, or contamination of groundwater or surface water through
inappropriate handling of contaminating substances.
If requested, the Environmental Engineer will also be responsible for providing basic training in the
management and monitoring of environmental aspects to REs and site staff, to be carried out prior to
the commencement of construction, and on a refiesher basis during construction.  Subject to
requirement, initial training course could include matters such as:
• an introduction to the concepts of environmental management and monitoring, the aims and
objectives, and the relationship with other construction supervision and monitoring activities
* a review of impacts which will be managed during construction, and the mechanisms wvhich will be
adopted in impact control, with particular reference to key impacts
. the role of monitoring as an environmental management tool and the procedures uvhich will be
adopted, including the way in which site checklists are to be used in routine monitoring
- procedures to be adopted in the event of emergency action needing to be taken to prevent
environmental damage occurring, or to minimise the effects if damage has already occurred
The content of refresher courses will be determined largely on lhe basis of the periodic review- findings
of the Environmental Engineer, as referred to below. In general terms, these would focus clearly on
specific aspects of site level management and monitoring whichl have been found to be unsatisfactory.
for whatever reason.
During his periodic visits to the sites, the Environmenial Engineer will carry out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of environmental management and monitoring, and will make recommendations to the ER
for modifications to procedures, the need for adoption of additional control measures, and on any
necessary actions to be taken regarding remedial measures etc, on the basis of his review findings.
The Environmental Engineer will also have a role to play in relation to liaison with the NGOs
responsible for RAP implementation and the tree planting and borrow pit restoration programmes
However, in view of the fact that his overall input will be relatively short (approximately 6 months in
total), and his periodic visits during construction will necessarily have to be short and infrcquent
(probably twice a year for about 3 weeks), responsibilities in this respect will have to be shared with the
Page 6,



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                  Environmental Management Plan
ER at Dhaka level, and the REs at site level. Consequently his liaison function will be morc concerned
with the broad integration of NGO programmes with other project implementation aspects, than 'with
day-to-day site-specific matters.
Basically all monitoring of implementation of the RAP will be carried out by an NGO to bc appointed
by RHD.
6.2.3  Post-Construction Phase
Routine and periodic maintenance will be the responsibility of RHD. Continued enjoyment of thc
benefits arising from implementation of the Dhaka-SvIhet project will only be achieved if effective
routine and periodic pavement and embankment maintenance is carried out in a timely manner.
Environmental management and monitoring in this respect will be the responsibility of RHD
maintenance units, with implementation being carried out through the zonal and district offices.
Maintenance of the roadside trees which will be planted under the project will be the responsibility of
local groups organised by the RHD Arboricultural Unit, through the zonal offices. In general. it is not
expected that much maintenance will be required once the trees are established. apart from thinning at 6
years, and routine pruning at intervals as necessary.
Environmental management relating to fish ponds and other measures related to borrow  pit
rehabilitation programmnes will be a matter for the private individuals and groups concerned. In the case
of fish ponds operated by groups, long term support over the lease period will be provided through the
local NGOs concerned with initial establishment. In the case of reinstatement measures for agriculture,
it is expected that no long-term management measures will be needed.
6.2.4 Summary of Management Measures and Responsibilities
Table 6.2 summarises the potential impacts which are to be controlled. the mitigation measures which
are to be adopted, the environmental management actions which are to be implemented. and indicates
which organisations and individuals within those organisations will be responsible for ensuring that the
management actions are efficiently implemented.

6.3  STAFF REQUIREMENTS
6.3.1   RHD: Dhaka-Sylhet Project Implementaticin Unit
For land acquisition and implementation of the approved RAP, the Dhaka-Svlhct Projcct
Implementation Unit of the RRMP3 Project Implementation Office will rcquire a dedicated team of
Resettlement Officers, together with the services of an NGO. Details are to be presented in the RAP.
During construction, RHD  engineering staff will be required  to  respond to any environmentally-related
issues raised  by the Engineer's Representative. for example in  relation  to  borrow  pit proposals or the
design of speed countermeasures through settlements. These are considered to be general engineering
duties, not requiring a dedicated or specialist environmental offlccr.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                 Environmental Managemcnt Plan
The supervision consultant's (the Engineer's Representative) workload comprises five major elements
being design, supervision, co-ordination, certification and measurement. Many of these tasks are
environmentally related (ref Tab 6.1 and 6.2).
The socially-related tasks will require specialist inputs as detailed in the RAP. he environmentally
related tasks are estimated to require the equivalent of one intemational and three national staff full-
time. Actual personnel requirements for environmental tasks will vary according to the split of duties
between staff. and the degree of integration of environmental compliance duties wvith other cngincering
supervision tasks.
Co-ordinative tasks refer to liaison with the RHD. the PCWD, the RRMP3 Steering committee. the
local authorities, the contracted NGO's and the members of, the Technical, Environmental and
Resettlement Supervision/Implementation Teams.
The requirement for specific science-based environmental skills is limited, and could probablh be mct
by a 4-6 month input by international specialists. This limited requirement for international expertisc
presupposes a full-time commitment by an intemational engineer and local engineering staff to the
many other tasks listed in Table 6.1, and excludes any time required for formal staff training.
6.4  INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
6.4.1 Taking Organisational Changes within RHD into Account
As a road design, construction and maintenance organisation RHD has to deal with a large number of
social and environmental issues. However, its present organisation and staffing do not permit any
effective response: RHD has an Environment Unit headed by a Superintending Engineer. but the unit
has no staff, mission statement or operating budget, and the Head has no environmental training.
Proposals for the creation of environmental capacity within RHD date back a number of years. and
were agreed components of RRMP2 (see RRMP2 Project Proforma of Sept. 1994). Detailed proposals
were made in RRMP2's Environmental Management Report (SMEC et al. 1995), and are understood
to have been updated recently by DHV (pers comm., M. Mastaller).
Under the 1997/98 Interim Reorganisation (see RHD 1997), RHD will create a Technical Services
*ving (Figure 6.2). Within the wNing there would be a Roads and Environment division, in turn
comprised of three units: Road Design, Road Safety, and Environment and Resettlement. Arboriculture
would remain a separate division xvithin Technical Service, along with Bridges (East). Bridges (Wcst).
and the Bangladesh Road Research Laboratory.
In addition to ensuring that project plans meet donor guidelines, an important element of the work of the
newv Environment and Resettlement unit will be meeting the requirements of domestic environmental
law. Under Department of Environment (DOE) regulations which became effective on 28 August
1997, major road construction and rehabilitation projects require environmental assessment and DOE
clearance before implementation.
6.4.2 Technical Assistance and Training
The Dhaka-Sylhet Road Project, and more generally RRMP3 as a whole. provide an opportunity for
the creation of an environmental management capacity within RHD. The logical vehicle for such
institutional development is the Institutional Development Component (IDC3). Subject to approval it is
recommended that IDC3 include provision for TA and training in
Page 68



Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                   Emnironmental Management Plan
*    Environmental assessment (including  methodology  of environmental pollution
measurement and monitoring)
*    Environmental policy development for the roads sector.
*    Road safety
Another focal point for institutional strengthening relates to the Arboriculture Unit. At present RHD's
Arboriculture Unit is headed by a Chief Arboriculturist with the rank of Superintending Engineer.
supported by a small professional staff of foresters at senior engineering grades and a larger technical
staff totalling 72 nationally. The Unit is a poor relation when compared with the rest of RHD. and
suffers from major logistical constraints such as lack of transport as well as from the generic
complaints of inadequate office equipment, staff training etc. Adequate training and institutional
support may therefore considered as one of the targets within the IDC3 components.
6.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ACTION SCHEDULE
Table 6.3 lists all actions which need to be taken at each stage of the project to ensure that the
recommendations of this report are implemented. The schedule assumptions are based on information
obtained by beginning of March from RHD. Nonetheless, all dates shown in this list are to be
respected as provisional, and require review once the overall project schedule has been finalised.
This final section of the EMP is a table listing actions which need to be taken at each stage of the
project to ensure that the recommendations of this report are implemented.

Dhaka - Svlhet Road Project                                   Environmental Management Plan
7.  ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND MONITORING COSTS
7.1  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Many of the costs associated with implementation of thle Environmental Managemcnt Plan have already
been, or will shortly be, included in the project budget, as an integral part of specific cost items For
example:
* the incorporation of mitigation measures in designs and contract documents is covered in the cost
item for consultancy services for the Implementation Phase
* the costs of environmental monitoring during construction by CSMC are covered in the item for
construction supervision and monitoring consultancy services
* construction cost estimates incorporated in the overall project budget will reflect the marginal costs
which will be incurred by contractors in complying with the environmental clauses introduced into
the contract documents
the costs of actual tree raising and planting, as well as the service fees to the managing NGOs who
organise planting groups, are included in the overall itern for tree planting in the project cost
estimates
The costs of the borrow pit reinstatement programme (excluding managing/co-ordinating NGO costs)
will be met from private sources (lease payments and/or micro-credit arrangements) and. as such.
should not be included in the project budget.
Incremental costs associated with implementing the EMP, which are not provided for under other items
in the project budget are:
. NGO costs related to the provision of planning and implementation management/co-ordination
services for the borrow pit reinstatement programmes
* costs of provision of technical support to the planning/co-ordinating NGOs for both the tree planting
and borrow pit programmes
e costs of implementing an independent environmental review
In view of the importance of the tree planting and borrowv pit programmes to minimisation of two of the
three key adverse impacts of the project, and therefore to overall environmental performance. together
with the desirability of having a completely independent environrmental review during the construction
phase, it is proposed that the costs of the above items should be rnet wholly by the Bank.
7.2  . COST ESTIMATE FOR BORROW PIT REHABILITATION  PROGRAMME
The cost estimates (in US$ at an exchange rate of US$1==Tk45) in Table 7.2 are based on the followving
assumptions:
* that the programme will commence as soon as the first contractor commences mobilisation. and will
extend over a period of 48 months; this allows 1.2 months, following completion of the last
construction works within the three year construction period, for the borrow pit programmes to be
implemented at those sites where extraction ceases at the end of construction year 3
* that there will be no cost inflation in US$ terms withirn the programme period

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Project                                   Environmental Management Plan
*that the managing NGO has local offices which can be used as bases by the field teams. and a head
office where the Team Leader/Co-ordinator will be based: the allowance made for general office
costs assumes that only marginal incremental costs at existing offices are incurred by the field teams
* that, given the geographic spread of the programme. the field teams will operate from 2 offices. one
located in the northern, the other in the southern section of Dhaka-Sylhet road.
* the two field teams will each comprise a Project Manager/Sociologist and a Fisheries Specialist

7.3  SUPPORT TO NGO MANAGERS
The provision of managerial and technical training support to the NGOs who will be involved with
managing the tree planting and borrow pit programmes is considered to be vital, if the programmes are
to be executed efficiently and to schedule. Both programmes cover a wide geographical area, and
proper planning and co-ordination are necessary for success. The larger Bangladesh NGOs generally
have adequate technical skills and experience to implement large programmes, but are relatively weak
in planning, particularly for schemes which must be implemented over a relatively short period. and
need careful co-ordination with other aspects of project implementation. The proposed TA support
would be focused on strengthening capabilities in these respects, but wvould also include a technical
support element.
The support programme would run over a period of three years, with the main inputs being in the early
stages of the first year of construction: it being assumed that adequate transfer of knowledge has taken
place over the preceding three years, for the fourth year programmes to be planned and executed
without external guidance and assistance.
The cost estimates in Table 7.3 are based on the following assumptions:
* that the Bank will recruit individual, freelance experts, rather than drawing on staff members from
consulting firms
* that the specialists will be mobilised from Europe
* that there is no cost inflation in US$ terms over the support programme period

7.4  COSTS OF AN INDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The estimated costs of an independent environmnental review are based on the following assumptions:
that the Bank will recruit an individual, freelance specialist, rather than drawing on Bank staff. or a
staff member from a consulting firm
* that the specialist will be mobilised from overseas (E,urope)
* that there is no cost inflation in US$ terns over the support programme period
• that the Bank office in Dhaka will provide all local transport

PREFACE
It is a world wide concern to keep balance with environmental conditions w hile promoting development.
Tree plancation and maintenance can help in keeping sustainable socio-economic and environmental
benefits. The importance of trees is multifold: They influence weather and rainfall, and each singlc tree
enhances fresh air quality. The global environment is affected seriously because of careless use of
natural resources. The human being responsible for the survival on earth has widely exploited and
mismanaged these natural resources. There are many reasons whv many species have disappeared. The
contributing factors are natural disasters, increasing population, industrial revolution, diminishina
cultivable land, increased desertification and so on. Besides the green house effect has increased the
average global temperature which have further adverse global impacts in the next few years according
to many specialists.
Ten percent of the total world forestry has already been destroyed and further twenty five percent arc
under threat. Industrial and urban development destroys seven million hectares of land in every minute;
at the same pace 44 hectares of fertile land is currently changing into desert and 22 hectares of forest
land is destroyed. Particularly tropical countries, vital for global oxygen production, arc loosing
forestry at a rate of one percent every year.
As for Bangladesh, its total area is 143,980 sq.km and the population is 120 million (rcsulting in a
density of 900 persons per sq.km. Forests covers only nine percent instead of twenty five percent in
comparable environmental settings. Since there is great deficit in forest coverage, the government is
planning for forestry improvement in engaging rural people in different activities of trce plantation.
Thcre is no unused land in a highly populatcd country like Bangladesh. Neither it is easy to mcct the
requirements of forestry, but using the limited resources substantial improvement and development
towards forestry can be achieved. Thcrefore, the Government is undertaking afforestation efforts in the
land adjacent to roads, highways, railways and all kinds of embankments, as well as in public and
private office yards.
GoB is encouraging public participation by offering share of forestry benefits. Therefore. roadside
afforestation is becoming a main motivation issue nation wide.
Considering the above circumstances, Secretary, Ministry of Communication and Chief Engincer. RHD
decided to plant trees by RHD's Arboriculture Division on at least 200 km of roads every year. while
another 2 km of roadside plantation will be undertaken by the Sub-Divisional Engineer. As a result of
this decision each year the RHD will plant trees for 450 km of roads which will contain 0.9 million
plants on both sides of the roads. The planted trees shall be well cared and maintained. Trees destroyed
*vithin the planted areas shall be replaced first in the next year. For tree plantation purpose every vear
the cost will be provided under 168-road, bridge, and maintenance account and for the new road 2%
provision shall be made in the Project Concept Paper (PCP).

Criteria of Planting Trees on Both Sides of Roads
1.     Trees are to be planted as such manner that no obstruction is created to the drivers.
2.     At least 10.00 m distance from culverts or bridge approaches shall be left free from any trees.
Road bends are equally to be kept free of trees.
3.     Trees shall be planted in sufficient distance from the road shoulder so that in need vehicles can
be parked on the road side without disturbing smooth traffic movement.
4.     Trees like Mahogany, Sissoo, Adune, Jarul, Jackfrmit, Koroi, Neem and Akashmoni are among
suitable species to be planted along road side. Shnubs are to be discouraged for plantation on
side slopes and at the verge as they are likely to get out of control and become harmful to the
roads. Mulberry, Banana and Papaya cultivation are also not recomrnmended for cultivation on
slopes.
5.     Every year by the 30th July tree plantation shall be completed. Growth and resistance against
animal grazing of newly planted trees will be enhanced if they arc cultivated bcfore the end of
July. Generally, plants of 2 years of age are more strongcr than younger oncs. Whatevcr
method of plantation is adoptcd, if the plantation is entrustcd and maintained by local people in
granting them due shares there will bc less possibility of destruction and failure. Thcrefore
people shall be directly engaged in such plantation scheme.
Project success apparently will depend on the agreement and engagement of local people for
maintenance of all these trees after the first or the first two years. In this wvav local people will learn to
appreciate "their" trees and their responsibility for these forestry resources will be strengthened. In
cases where there is no road side villages and/or people do not show any interest in tree maintenancc.
such plantation agreements are not applicable.

Dhaka - Sylhet Road Rehabilitation Project
IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIALLY SUITABLE SITES FOR
BORROW SOURCES
1.    Background
The Dhaka - Sylhet Road Rehabilitation Project involves the substantial upgrading of about
230km of highway between Dhaka and Sylhet.
The principle design objectives of this Project are to:
* upgrade the traffic capacity of the present highway (generally by substantial widening of
the existing pavement and associated embankments),
* reduce the frequency of flooding of the highway (by raising the present level of the
highway and associated embankments).
To achieve these objectives more than 6 million cubic metres of new fill material is required.
The estimated fill quantity requirements along the selected highway route are indicated on
Figure A.
Inevitably there will be a substantial physical and environmental impact associated with
acquiring such a large quantity of fill. To maximise flexibility in selecting suitable borrow
sources, the detailed embankment design and associated technical specifications allow the
use of a wide range of material types (clay, silt, sand). However, in selected zones of the
embankment particular material types have been specified, for example:
i where fill is required to be placed underwater,
e the zone immediately below the proposed pavement structure.
For this project, RHD has decided that primary responsibility for locating and arranging
borrow material sources will lie with the physical works Contractors. The Contractors will be
required to submit specific proposals for borrow sources to the Engineer (RHD Project
Director) for each Contract who will check the acceptability of each proposal with
advice/assistance from the supervision Consultant.
The Contractors will be responsible for obtaining all other necessary approvals for the
borrow works such as may be required from landowners, local Government agencies and
Government Departments.
Guidelines and requirements relating to borrow source selection and operation will be
included in the technical specifications for each Contract to guide the Contractor and
Engineer and to ensure that the complete borrow operation can be controlled to the
necessary standards (including environmental impact mitigation and rehabilitation of borrow
areas).
RHD has indicated that obtaining fill from within the Road Reserve area should be avoided
where practicable.

Preliminary Identification of Borrow Sources                     10 March 1998



In view of the above it is not practicable nor required at this stage to identify precisely all
borrow sources that will be utilised along the highway -oute. However, it is necessary to at
least tentatively identify potentially viable borrow sources which could supply the required
quantities so that a meaningful environmental irnpact assessment can be carried out and to
enable the Tender Documents to be appropriately formulated. To provide this information a
detailed desktop study has been undertaken supplemented by site inspections, and
sampling and testing of potential borrow materials.
2.    Borrow Source Options
There a number of options for sourcing borrow materials for this project. However, along
some sections of the proposed highway route, the options are very limited and substantial
physical impact is unavoidable. The main borrow options that have been considered are
presented briefly in the following sections.
2.1   Low Hills and High Ground Source
The main advantages of this type of source are:
. the borrows can be operated for a longer period each year than low-lying sources which
are usually inundated during the monsoon season,
e material from this type of source usually requires less moisture content adjustment to
produce a satisfactory compacted fill.
In several locations along the project route hills are close to the site which have already
been borrowed and it appears reasonable to consider those areas for further borrowing.
However, before specific hill sources are approved several important issues should be given
due consideration. Such issues include:
* crops, trees, etc. that would be damaged,
. soil erosion and slope stability,
* future land use.
2.2 Sediment from Waterways
Existing rivers, streams and drainage/irrigation channels in the vicinity of the highway can be
a significant source of fill material in some sections. At several locations there are already
commercial sediment mining operations in place.  If these operations are effectively
controlled, significant benefits can result from sediiment removal. Some pretreatment of this
sediment (stockpiling, drainage, drying) is normally required before the material is suitable
for placing in an engineered embankment.
Free-draining sand material required in some parts of the Project works will probably be
supplied from such sources.
Dhaka - Sylhet Rehabilitation
Preliminary Identification of Borrow Sources                       10 March 1998   2



Before approval is given to utilise such sources, adequate safeguards will be required to
ensure that removal of sediment does not result in unacceptable water quality problems or
waterway channel instability.
2.3    Material from Existing Borrow Pits
At some locations it is likely that useful quantities of fill could be obtained from existing
borrow pits both within and outside the present road reserve without significantly increasing
existing impacts on land use. With careful planning it appears feasible to actually improve
the configuration of some existing borrow pits and make them more viable as fish ponds or
irrigation/water storage reservoirs. Some of the existing borrow pits could provide fill
material which is relatively dry as they are not inundated during the Dry Season. Other
borrow pits will provide fill material that will require substantial pretreatment (mainly to
reduce moisture content) before it can be placed in an engineered embankment.
2.4    Material from New Borrow Pits/Areas
A large proportion (likely to be more than 50%) of the fill required in this project will have to
be supplied from new borrows located in low-lying ground near the highway alignment. To
reduce the adverse impacts of this type of borrow source, the detailed configurations of new
borrow pits/areas must be confirmed in consultation between the Contractors and
landowners after considering the most appropriate end use of these borrow pits/areas. The
Engineer to the physical works contracts should only give approval for such borrow
proposals after it has been demonstrated that a potentially viable end use will result.
Potentially viable end uses include:
* lowered land which can continue to be used as rice paddy fields,
* fish ponds,
- irrigation water reservoirs/tanks.
3.    Tentative Schedule of Borrow Sources Along Route
A tentative schedule of borrow sources capable of satisfying the estimated fill requirements
of the Project is summarised in Table A on a section by section basis. The road sections
are those illustrated on the Location Plan (Figure A). A commentary supplementing the
information in the Table is provided as follows:
3.1    Section 101
A 33km length of the road from the beginning at Katchpur to near Narsingdi. Approximately
1.15 million m3 (Mm3) of embankment fill is required (35,000m3 per kilometre). The section is
mainly on the floodplain of the old Brahmaputra River. The principal sources of material are
new and existing borrows in floodplain soils (sandy and clayey silt). At present the proposed
borrow areas are used mainly for paddy rice cultivation.
Dhaka - Sylhet Rehabilitation
Preliminary Identification of Borrow Sources                      10 March 1998   3



Existing borrows are extensive along both sides of the road and most have permanent
ponds. Material can be won by lowering existing pt floors (e.g. by about lm) or by
extending the pit margins it the direction away from the road. It is also expected that some
material can be sourced in the nearby Lakhya River.
3.2   Section 102
A 38.5km length of the road from Narsingdi to Bhairab bazar ferry (Meghna River).
Approximately 0.6Mm3 of embankment fill is required (15,600m3/km). This section of the
road is mainly on floodplain soils (see Section 101) but includes. a 15.5km length through
low hills (km 49 to km 64.5). The low hills are predominanitly sandy materials with a laterised
surficial layer that has a higher clay content.
Sections of the low hills have been extensively borrowed in the past. It is expected that the
bulk of the fill in Section 102 will be from the lovw hills (up to 33%) and existing floodplain
borrows (up to 32%). Some sandy fill may be sourced from the Meghna near Bhairab Bazar
(12%) with the balance comming from new floodplain borrows.
3.3   Section 103
A short (12km) length of the road to the east of Asuganj (Meghna River) that ends at the
intersection to the Brahmanbaria road near Sarail.   Approximately 0.325Mm3 of
embankment fill is required representing an average ol about 27, 000m3/km. This road
section crosses the Meghna floodplain and the soils are silts with a variable proportion of
fine sand and generally minor clay. Existing landuse is principally paddy rice.
Borrow pits forming long khals are extensive along the northern side of the road and these
are utilised heavily as a source of water for irrigating adjacent paddy fields. Borrow pits are
less extensive and generally shallower on the southern side of the road. Where pits are dry,
either due their shallowness or because they have been drained, they support paddy rice.
Embankment fill sources along this road section include sandy sediment from the Meghna
River near Asuganj (up to 8%) and existing borrows (up to 52%) and new borrows (40%) in
the floodplain soils. It is envisaged that material from existing borrows would be won by
extending the pit margin in the direction away from the road either at the level of the existing
pit floor (and therefore extending the pond area) or at a higher level that would allow dry
season paddy rice production. New borrows in the paddy fields can be deep (eg 2m to 3m)
or shallow (eg less than 1 m) depending on the end use requirements of the landowner.
3.4   Section 104(A)
A 31km length of the road from the Brahmanbaria junction to Jagadispur. The preliminary
estimate of embankment fill quantity is 1.075Mm3 representing about 34,700m3/km. The
section of road crosses floodplain soils similar to those in Section 103 although east of the
Titas River the silty soils have a clay content that is higher than in Section 103.
The location and configuration of existing roadside borrows and their current use both as
irrigation water reservoirs (khals) and for growing paddy rice is similar to Section 103. It is
expected that the main sources of embankment fill in this section will also be similar to
Section 103.

Preliminary Identification of Borrow Sources                     10 March 1998  4



River sand may be available from both the Titas and Meghna Rivers (up to 7%) with the bulk
of the fill expected to be from existing (up to 56%) and new (37%) floodplain borrows.
3.5   Section 109
A 20km long proposed diversion from Jagadispur to near Saisteganj village that is adjacent
to, and on the toe slopes of low hills for much of its length. Approximately 60,000m3 of
embankment fill is required (3,000m3/km) to upgrade the existing feeder road.
The hills comprise very poorly cemented, very weak sandstone that is weathered to clayey
silt to about 3m depth. In road cuttings the exposed sandstone is mainly loose sand with
minor silt and clay, material that is susceptible erosion by running water if not adequately
protected. At many locations gentle slopes appear to have been formed by natural erosion
of the sandy hill sediments with the material deposited as a series of gently sloping fans at
the toe of the hills. The existing road crosses a number of the fans.
The road is on floodplain soils at the southern and northern ends of Section 109.
Excavation into the adjoining hills to widen the road is expected to produce about 20,000m3
of fill with the remainder from borrows in the hill soils (20,000m3) and floodplain (20,000m3).
The borrows in hill soils will have to be carefully selected and operated to minimise erosion
both during and after construction. Establishing borrows in the gentle toe slopes (fans) may
be preferable as it will minimise the creation of steep slopes and borrows can be more easily
rehabilitated with a vegetation cover following construction.
3.6   Section 114
A short (6km) section that mainly comprises the proposed by-pass of Saisteganj village.
Approximately  0.26Mm3 of new  embankment fill is required  representing  about
43,300m3/km, most being required at the by-pass. This section is located on the floodplain
of the Khowai River. The floodplain soils are clayey silts with some sand.
Embankment fill sources include sand from the Khowai River (4%) and existing borrows in
the floodplain soils (4%). It is also conceivable that some hill materials from the adjacent
section (109) will be imported into this area (2%). It is expected however, that because
most of this section is new road, the bulk of the fill will be from new borrows in the floodplain
soils (90%).
3.7 Section 104(C)
A short (5km) length of the road between Saisteganj and the beginning of the Srimangal
diversion at Mirpur village.  Approximately 0.14Mm3 of embankment fill is required
representing about 28,000m3/km.
The road is located on the floodplain of the Khowai River and the soils are expected to be
clayey silts with some sand. Some material would be expected to be won from Khowai
River (up to 7%), however the majority of the material is expected to be from existing (36%)
and new (57%) borrows in the floodplain soils (paddy fields).

3.8   Section 115
A 34km length of the road from Mirpur village northward to near Auskandi village. The
southern quarter of the road is on the Khowai floodplain-and the northern quarter is on the
Kusiyara River floodplain. The middle section is adjacent to, and in places on, the gentle
toe slopes of a low north/south oriented ridge. Approximately 0.95Mm3 of fill is required to
upgrade the existing feeder road embankment and for new embankments on a number of
by-passes. The average fill requirement along this section is 28,000m3tkm.
The floodplain soils are clayey silts with variable sand content. The geology of the hills is
similar to Section 109 (very weak sandstone weathered to clayey silt to a depth of about
3m), although they are less steep and appear less eroded than the slopes at the northern
end of Section 109.
Some material is likely to be available from carefully located and operated borrows in the
hills although this source is not expected to supply significant quantities (2%). Of particular
value from that source is likely to be cohesive soils (clayey silt) that can be used in selected
parts of the embankment. The bulk of the fill is likely to be from existing roadside borrows in
floodplain soils (46%) and from new floodplain borrows (52%).  Fill for the by-pass
embankments is most likely to be from new borrc,ws in floodplain (paddy) soils.
3.9   Section 112
A 9km length of the road from the intersection near Auskandi to Sherpur bridge (Kusiyara
River). Approximately 0.3Mm3 of embankment fill is required to upgrade the existing feeder
road. This represents an average of about 33,300m3/km.
The road is located on the floodplain of the Kusiyara River and the sediments are clayey
silts with variable sand content. It is expected that the existing borrows in the floodplain
paddy soils will provide the bulk of the fill (53%S/) with new borrows in the paddy fields
providing about 37%. The Kusiyara River is a potential source of sand and an estimate of
10% has been made for supply from this source.
3.10 Section 108
A 36km length of the road from Sherpur bridge to Sylhet. Approximately 1.32Mm3 of fill is
required for the embankment (36,700m3/km). The road is on the floodplains of the Surma
and Kusiyara Rivers. The floodplain soils are mainly silts with variable but small proportions
of clay and sand. Low hills were noted in the area of the northern part of the route but none
are on the road alignment.
Existing roadside borrows are relatively extensive but generally are shallow and cultivated
during the dry season. It is expected that the low hills could provide small quantities of fill
(about 1%) and the rivers about 2%. Expansion of existing roadside borrows in paddy soils
is expected to provide up to 60% of fill requirernents with the balance (37%) from new
borrows in paddy soils.

4.    Characteristics of Potential Borrow Materials
Specific potential borrow sites, and floodplain (low-lying paddy) soils, were sampled for
laboratory tests. The floodplain soils were sampled at regular intervals along the route to
assess the range of mechanical properties that could be expected for these materials. The
soils will form the bulk of new borrow pits/areas (Section 2.4) that typically are at distances
of up to 200m from the highway alignment.
A summary of the sampling locations, material types and laboratory tests is given in Table
B.
The materials from all sources are dominated by silt and fine sand with a variable but
generally low proportion of clay. River alluvium is mainly fine to medium sand and the hill
soils are fine and medium sand with variable silt and clay. In the weathered zone the
proportion of clay in hill soils is more significant.  The soils of the paddy areas are
predominantly floodplain sediments deposited by the Brahmaputra River when its former
course flowed to the east and south of Mymensingh to the Meghna River. The sediments
are principally fine sandy silt and, less commonly, clayey silt.
