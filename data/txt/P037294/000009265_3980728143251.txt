A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objecthe and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The projects overall objective is to reduce the total cost of road transport on Banigladesh's most
traveled roads. These objectives would be achieved by: (i) providng and improving critical road links
('bottlenecks') in the overall trsport system i.e. new road link Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara Road;
rehabilitabon of Dhaka-Sylhet Road; improvement of the Feeder Roads 'A' network, and widening of
critical narrow bridges on the national and regional road network in Northwest and Southwest regions of
Bangladesh; (ii) improving the institutional capacity of the Roads and Highways Depamnt (RHD) in
road maintenance ad improved financdal management; (iii) improving road safety by developing the
institutional capacity in RHD to identify hazardous locations and to design and implement physical
measures to reduce road accidents at these locations while at the same time improving police capacity for
better enforcamet of traffic rules and regulations; (iv) promoting private sector development (i.e. medium
sized contrac ) through contating out FRA road works now undertaken by smaller and less
sophisticated contators; and (v) wherever conditions permit, use labor-intensive methods for road
construction and maintenance to create employment and reduce poverty.
B: Strategk Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17453-BD dated March 6, 1998.
Te latest CAS for Bagladesh states that improved physical infastructure and related services are
a prerequisite for both ineratonal competitiveness and growth of agricultural and rural imnomes. It
encourages projects that promote growth through macro-economic stabilization, that involves private sector
initiative and participation, and assists in human resource development and capacity building. The national
road network in Baladesh has covered the country adequately, but suffers fromn backlog of road
rehabilitain, lack of proper maintenance and poor quality of feeder roads.  Furthermore, weak
management of road maintenance and planning by the Roads and Highways Dpartt (RHD) needs to be
addressed. Continued efforts are needed to improve maintenance of the national and rural road network;
encourage greater participation by local communities in project selection; increase resource mobilization;
adopt national standards; and strengthen local medium size contractors. The Bank's support to Bangladesh
in this area recognizes that feeder road improvement and rehabilitation and maintenance of national roads
will give rise to increase in the output and marketing of agricultural products, contribute to poverty
reduction through job creation, and spur private sector investment through a strengthened infrastructure.
One of the objectives of RRMP-III is to reduce transport costs and inefficiencies. This is in line
with the outcome of the 1998 CAS stakeholder consultations which underlined the importance of the
provision and maintenance of adequate infiastructure to facilitate economic growth. In Bangladesh this
inevitably means removing critical bottlenecks in the overall transport system through systemic
improvements in the key link roads, provision of missing structures and sustainable maintenance of roads
for the efficient transport of agricultural, industrial, import and export goods. Investments proposed in
RRMP-M will help establish a sustainable mechanism for the improvement of a safe roads network, and its
sustainable maintenance through an effective maintenance unit at RHD; and continue with past efforts
ained at developing a viable and stable local construction industry to assist with the development and
maintenance of infrastructure.

2. Main sector issues and Governnent strategy:
iplementing the Road Master Plan: The government finalized a Road Master Plan in
1991 for the national and regional road network which includes both construction of new roads
and improving existing national and regional links. Over the years various multilateral and
bilateral donors have been assisting the GOB to implement this plan and most of this work is
complete except for minor segments (Nalka-Bonpara-Hatikamrul Road).
hming the Fder Roads: Bangladesh's economy largely depens on agriculture sector. There
are about 15000 kam of Feeder Road Type A cocting distict hdqurters (hana) with arial roads,
and 18,000 kn of Feeder Road Type B (connecting Growth Center Markets), most of which are in poor
condition. LGED has already started improving FRBs under several donor financed projects. So far RHD
has improved only 3000 km of FRAs with GOB financing leaving 12000 km of FRAs still to be improved.
GOB has, with assistance from IDA under RRMP-II prepared a Plan to improve the Feeder Road A
network and is seeking donor assistance to implement this plan in a phased manner.
Imroving Mainnce Capacity:  The government's ability to carfy out an effective and
sustainable maintenance of the road network is hampered by inadequate staff experience and the absence of
a maintenance nmnagem    unit at the HQ level at RHD. Under the ongoing IDA financed RRMP-H
project under which the DFID, U.K. is supporting a major Institutional Development Component (IDC-2
valued at about US$10 million), a HDM unit has been established to carry out traffic and road condition
surveys for planing RHD's maintenance program; reorganized RHD in Dhaka and prepared plans for the
overall RHD   anizatin to improve the maintnance function. Under the proposed RRMP-ElI the
government has obtained DFID support to continue and augment these activities.
b=mviW Financial ageAm62 : At the moment, RHD has an inadequate financial management
system which needs improvement. Given the large investments in the sector and the major reorganization
envisaged in RHD, GOB is seeldng IDA and DFID support to undertake a comprehensive strengtming of
RHD's financial managent capacity.
imroving Road Safety. Axle Load Control and Traffic Management: Bangladesh continues to
have one of the worst road safety records in the world with 39 deaths per 10,000 vehicles in 1995. This
poor perfornce is attributed to increased use of old vehicles; poor vehicle and driver registration and
licensing procedures; high traffic growth; lack of enforcement; and predominance of slow moving vehicles
along built-up areas on national highways. Comprehensive road safety work has already been started
under the ongoing RRMP-II, i.e. development of a strategic road safety action plan, implementation of
computenzed road accident recording and analysis system, where road safety awareness is bemg created
through workshops and seminars. Under this program, a National Road Safety Council has been
establishAd; and a National Road Safety Strategy has been formulated. ADB's Second Road Improvement
Project has also undertake a major initative in improving the road safety siuaion. Under RRMP-lI,
implementation of the strategic national road safety action plan has been included to further improve the
road safety situation in Bangladesh. GOB's success in the expansion of the national and regional road
network combined with increased economic development, has led to substanial growth in heavy vehicular
traffic. This in turn has resulted in serious overloading which poses a threat to the integity of the
substanti  invesnents made by the GOB. A comprehensive axle load control progam has, therefore,
been prepared under IDC-2 to address the situation and GOB has sought DFID/IDA assistance for its
implementation. As the road network and traffic have increased, the need for improved trffic
measures (i.e. standardized traffic signs and road markings, equipment for traffic management and training
of police) has been idefied by the National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan as requiring serious
attention. The GOB has given priority to these efforts and is seeldng assistance for their impla.

3. Sector Issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposd project is large and constitutes a substantial porton of GOB's planned invm
in the road  cor in the net 4-5 years. Technical Assistance under on-going IDA/DFID projects have
undetake numerous activities to address most of the pendg institutional issues. As such, in addition to
the major physical components, the GOB and the cofinanciers have agreed to use this project as the main
vehie fir addressig the man  sector issues identified by the GOB (see para. 2 above). The vision
underlying the proposed projeoct therefore, fully supports the GOB's aims and objectivs for the sector.
Under the physical components, the project will assist in: (i) completing the rmaing missing link in the
naional road network (N-H-B Road); (ii) srengt   and upgrade the Dhaka-Sylh:t Road which is part of
the Trans-Asian Highway network (iii) provide fimds to improve about 500 kan of the highest priority
Feeder Roads A in Westem Bangadesh, and (iv) provide funding for rehabilitation, penodic maintenance
and to remove bottnecks on major natonal and regional roads in Western Bangladesh, some of which
have been rehabilitaed under pmrious IDA funded projects. As to the institutional issues, a micro-
reorganiion of RHD was carried out as part of project preparation and a comprehensive RHD
Reorganization Plan was prepared by GOB, to be implemented during the course of the proposed project.
A major thrust of the reorganization plan is to convert RHD from a "construction" oriented organization to
an "asset mainea" organizaton. Development of a new financial management system has already
started which will be implented during the course of the project. Similarly, issues related to road safety,
axle load control and traffic management have been studied under the on-going project and action plans to
address these  sues have been prepared and agreed with the GOB with active participation of the

2. Key policy and instiutional reforms supported by the project:
(a) RHD's mstal capacity will be enhanced considerably through the proposed DFID
financig to be provided under the IDC-3, focusing on implementg the agreed reorganization of RHD,
and in particular, on maintenance, road safety and financial management issues. Specifically, the IDC-3
will: (i) provide assistance to RHD in implementing its rvised organizational structure as designed and
agreed under IDC-2; (u) continue to assist and improve the capacity of the HDM Cell in preparing annual
plans for periodic and routine maitnance; (in) develop the capacity of RHD's Resettlement and
Environm t Unit; (iv) assist the development of a rvsed accountig and financial management sysem,
pilot its instaa    in the projec area, train new staff in its operation and following successful experience,
replicate it in the remaining RHD operations; (v) assist RHD's newly created Road Safety Engineering
Unit to implement the ITF financed physical components for improvement of black spots and introduction
of traffic calmng measures, and in procurement and installation of related equipment; (vi) prepare a plan
for traffic police training and assist the Inspector General of Police to implement this plan; and (vii) assist
RHD in impleentg the agreed reconmmndations of the studies carried out under IDC-2 for rationalizng
RHD's existing ferry operatons and its equipment and workshops operations.
(b) Three boal Project Advisors will transfer skills to RHD staff in the fields of: (i) procurement
of civil works contracts and project management; (ii) environmental management and resettlement
activities; and (iii) financal management. Contract delivery will be further improved by the development
of skills in the use of prequalification of contractors, competitive bidding and work supervision.
(c) Opportunity for increased involvement of the private sector will result from regular availability
of high standard civil works contractors in upgrading and maintenance of major national and regional roads
as well as feeder roads. At the same time, the quality and capacity of the private sector will be enhanced
through increased work opportunities and improved supervision.
(d) A National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan (NSSAP) has been developed under RRMP-II
project. This proect will provide for the establishment and sustained operation of a Secretariat for the
National Road Safety Council and support the implementation of the various road safety reconmendatons
in the NSSAP.
3. Benefits and target population:
The investments identified for 1TF financing are a part of a network-wide investment program to be
undertakn under the Road Master Plan (RMP), which was prepared with IDA assistance. These
investments are expected to yield substantal benefits, mainly in terms of vehicle operating cost savings
resulting from improved road conditions. Infrastructure cost savings would also arise as a result of timely
investments which will prevent further road deterioration to a point where full reconstruction would be
required. Since many of the selected roads are located in regions of good agricultural potential and/or serve
as major inmport-export corridors, most of the vehicle operating cost savings would directly accrue to truck
operators and to agricultural-related transport service providers. Most of these savings are expected to be
passed on to the consumers.
The likely economic impacts, benefits and beneficiaries of the project are: (i) lower freight and
passenger transport costs, with resulting benefits in fares, the price of goods, marketing of products and the
reduction of transport bottlenecks affecting economic development. This will have direct benefits for the
traveling public, agricultuzal and industial producers, consumers and local communities having improved
access to health and education services. The impact on poverty reduction will be indirect - from passing on
of savings in transport cost to the farmers through higher farm-gate prices; (ii) more effective managenent
and sustnab  maintenance of government's road assets, including better utilization of existing traffic

capaciy, improved traffic safey, improved value-for-moey of government expenditure on roads, and
better connectionaccess from rurwal feeder roads to national and regional roads; (iii) steady flow of fiulds
over a five year period for high standard civil works and maintenae contracts, enabling local construct
industry to develop firther and modernize their plant and equipment; and (iv) improved physical
environent along project roads and improved attention by government to enviromntal and social
impacts of road works. Roadside coununities and non-motorized road users are expected to benefit from
improved shoulders, tree planting and new drainage facilities.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Ex            i Agecs RHD under the Secretary, Roads and Railways Division (RRD) of the Minisby of
Communcatons will have the overall responsibility for project implementato. The project will be
primarily managed and implemented by the road agency RHD and its various sectons and zonal (regional)
offices under the Chief Engineer. The road safety components, excluding civil works, will be implemented
by the Bangdesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the traffic police training cmponet wil be
implemnted by the Office of the Inspector General of Bangladesh Police (IGP).
Project Coordinaton: RHD will establish an Office of the Project Director (OPD) for RRMP-L, which
for the impltion of new construction and rehabilitation works will be staffed by a Project Directr
(PD), two Rsettlment Officers, two Deputy Chief Resettlemnt Officers and one Executive Engineer, five
Project Managers (PM), three Resettlement Officers and supported by the HDM Cell of RHD. The PD
will also be supported by three local advisors: (i) highway engineering and project mnagement specialist
(ii) resettlement/nvironmental advisor and (iii) financial management advisor. The appointnt of the
three local advisors will be a condition of ITF Credit effectiveness. For the execution of the improvements
of Feeder Roads A, reconstuction of narrow bridges and the annual periodic maintenance program, the PD
will be supported by the zonal offices headed by the respective Additional Chief Engineers (ACE) and the
Planning an Maintenance Wing of RHD. RHD program coordination, including the coordination of TA
and the multi-donor support and interests and sector policies will be coordinated with the Minity of
Conununication (MOC), Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Planning Commission. Civil Works contracts
will be awarded through inteatonal and national compeiive bidding, as appropriate, in accordance with
the provision of the IDA Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995,
revised January and August 1996. All associated supervision, as well as technical assistance coltant
services will be awarded in accordance with IDA Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, rewsed September 1997.
Project O ih (poliy guidance. etc.): A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Secretary,
Roads and Railways Division (RRD) of MOC will coordinate project imple ton. The existing
Instituonal Review Conunittee (IRC) will monitor the progress of the institutional development component
of the project. The civil works program for the main roads will be managed by the RHD, with other
campnents of the project managed by relevant government agencies such as Bangladesh Road Transport
Authority (BRTA) for road safety and Inspector General of Bangladesh Police for traffic police taining.
For all components, private sector contractors (local and foreign) and cosultans Oocal and foreign) are
expected to be used to the fullest extaent. The GOB, through MOC, will develop a project implem
framwork to be agred with the Adminitor, detailing project objectives and major outputs, a project
implementation scheule and resources plan, a component procurement plan, a proect implementation
management structure and a project monitoring and evaluation plan with verifiable perfonnance idicators.
RHD will be responsible for reviewing the plans for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance
developed by the implementing agencies, and developing plans for raising the necessary local resources.
The plans will be finalized under the overall supervision and guidance of the Secretary, RRD before
submission to the Association for agreement.



Th*d Read Rb    widn Mnd _ mpa ageS
During t  first two years of the project implemenation, three supervision missions will be
required annuay, fillowed by two such missions during each of the last three years of te project. Each
mission will usually be staffed by a Highway Engieer, a construction/pavement expert a procurement
expert, and another specialist such as economist and/or institutional specialist, environmenta/resettlement
specialist, trainig expert or road safety specialist. Missions will review the progress in implmentation of
the physical conponents and the institutional and policy development measures under the project, and
agree on remedial actions, if necessary. The mission reviews will be guided by agreed targets. Supervision
of the project between missions will be assisted by Transport Specialist in the World Bank Dhaka Office.
One of the supervision missions will be carried out in the last quarter of each implementation year to assess
progress during the year and reviw the work program and budgeting allocations for the following year. A
project launch workshop will be held within two months of Board approval of the project and a mid-term
review involving relevant Borrower agencies and the Association will be carried out in October, 2000.
Accouting. financial renoring and auditing arrangements:  A review of the financial management
capability of the implementing agency (RHD) has been undertaken, and it was found to be inadequate to
meet the financial managenBt requirements under Bank's operational policies OP 10.02, dated August 6,
1997. Therefore, the new project will include provisions for appointment of a locally hired Financial
Management Advisor (FMA) under the Technical Assistance component of the project. The accounting for
all Special Account tansaction and for all other project-related accounts will be maintained in accordance
with the World Bank "Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook" (January 1995).
Alhough the project is not covered by LACI, in anticipation that LACI might become mnatory for all
Bank projects during the implementation period of this project and to provide efficient financial
management information in accordance with OP 10.02, RHD will establish and maintain a computerized
project financial management system for the project which will show actual versus budgeted expenditures
and generate the Schedule of Withdrawal of Proceeds and Statement of Expenditure forms, including all
the LACI fonrs of reporting, required for IDA processing of withdrawals fromn the credit. Auditing will be
carried out in accordance with the IDA Guidelines for SOE, against which loan disbursemnts will be
made. The project accounts will be audited annually in accordance with standards of auditing acceptable
to the Administrator, by accredited private auditors appointed by RHID. The OPD will have a full-time
deicated finance and accounts professional to work as a FMA, who will be responsible for financial
accounting, reporting, submission of withdrawal requests to the Administrator and GOB. The Financial
Advisor will be a qualified accountant and experienced finance professional and will be assisted by full-
time accounts assistants.
Monitoring and evaluation anents: The OPD, assisted by the consultants, will prepare quarterly
progress reports in accordance with the format described in the Project Implementation Plan. These
reports will cover: (i) physical progress achieved against agreed implemetation and disbursement
schedules and key performance indicators, including number of contracts awarded, kilometers of roads and
number of bridges under contact or completed, (ii) issues and problem areas, reconmendig actions and
comm _entig on progress in resolving previous reconmendati, and (iii) work programs and cost
estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project. Specific monitoring of the institutional aspects,
road safety, envronmental and resettlement aspects of the project will be included in the implementation
plan and quarterly reports. These reports will be forwarded to the Administrator and the relevant
authorites associatod with the project within one month after the end of each quarter. The main purpose of
these reports will be to provide managers with tmely and updated information on implementation of project
cmponents, highting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and cmmenting on progress in
resolving previous reco    ns.  A mid-terrn review will be held 24 months after the date of
commen ent to review procrmet and implementaton progress against agreed schedules and
implemtaton capacity. RHD will also, within 6 months of the closing of the project, prepare an

Implementation Completion Report for submission to the Administrator. During negotiations, agreemnt
will be sought with the Government that they will : (i) prepare quarterly progress reports to be sent to the
Adminisr   witin one month after the end of each quarter, and (ii) prepare an Inplentaon
Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with the Association Guidelines.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(i) Searate investments for national and regional roads and feeder roads (FRAs and FRBs): Snce
RHD is rosibl for constructia  and maintenance of national and regional roads and FRAs, and LGED
has similar responsibilies for FRBs and rural roads, it was felt appropriate to consider parallel but
separate opaons for these two agencies in order to avoid complexities related to institutional overlap.
Other donor agencies are also following the same approach. However, sectoral issues conmmon to both the
agencies, e.g. inegting the development and maintenance stategies, technical specifications, financial
management, environmenal mitigation and resettlement policies are being handled in an uniform manner.
(ii) Program approach for road development: Although program approach is not being followed in
totahlity for projects undertaken so far, nevertheless adherence to the Road Master Plan (carried out by
GOB in 1990 with IDA assistance) in formulating projects indirectly underscores the program approach.
IDA's involvement in road sector for the last decade has resulted in an informal program approach through
successive road projects like RRMP-I, RRMP-II, and now RRMP-Ell. ADB, the other major donor agency
financing road development has also followed IDA's strategy in financing successive Road Improvanent
Projects (RIPs). IDA, ADB and other donor agencies are working hand in hand to develop the road sector
in Bangladesh. Under the proposed RRMP-III, something similar to a program approach is being folkowed
for the improvement of FRAs in the Northwest and Southwest of Bangladesh to maximize the benefits of
already completed national and regional road projects under IDA financing. It is expected that IDA, ADB
and other donor agencies will finance a series of FRA Improvement Projects in Bangladesh over the next
decade.
(iii) Selection of specific road sections for the project began with the Road Master Plan (RMP) to
provide an overall assessmnt of the existing road conditions and traffic botdenecks on the national and
regional road network, forecast of expected traffic growth with associated deterioration of this road
network, and an asses_ment of road investment needs. This provided a basis for agreement betwen GOB
and IDA on identification of high priority roads using the HDM model to determine roads to be either
rehabilitated or for receivig periodic maintenance treatment as a "holding" operation before
re;ost1cto. GOB undertook feasibility studies of the various secions of the project roads, including
review of potental enviromental and resettlement impacts.
The widening and strengthening component of the project focuses on one of the busiest national
roads (Dhaka-Sylhet Road) which is experiencing substantial bottlenecks. This road forms part of the
Asian Highway through Bangladesh. Technical alternatives that were evaluated during the feasibility of this
road included strengthening of existing pavements without widening, widening the cariageway to fit
existing formation widths, widening the pavement and shoulders to increase capacity. in addition to major
route diversions, several smaller by-passes at highly congested townships were evaluated as options to
relieve congestion and minimize disruption to roadside development. Altematives not yielding economic
rates of return equal to or greater than the opportunity cost of capital (12%) were rejected.
In the case of Feeder Roads A, other criteria such as geographic distribution, regional intgraton,
access to social amenities and markets, connection to main road network, etc., were also considered in the



Third Road R_ohlikeIn and Malbar_e                                                  Pap 10
upgrding opto  and periodic maintenance options on some roads so as to cover a larger area of FRAs,
yielding overall net benefits.
Varitons to the overall scale and timing of the project were considered, and the final size of the
project was detemined to match GOB's implementation capacity and conunitnent to ownership by
increased budgetary provisions and or onal changes of RHD. If the project is not implemented, the
Bangladesh economy will conue to be hampered by inadequate road infrastructure in certain regions of
the country, and potential improvements in sector efficiency will not be achieved.
2. Major related projects financed by the IDA and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing
and planned):
Over the last decade the IDA, other bilateral and multilateral aid agencies provided a total of about
US1200 million to finance road projects in Bangladesh. This aid was mainly used for rehabilitation of
national, regional and feeder roads; and construction of several major bridges. The main road projects
funded by different donor agencies over the last decade are given below:

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Past experience in projects undertaken by RHD and financed by the Associatio, shows that the
projects suffered from: (i) poor quality of projects at entry; (ii) weak institutional capacity in project
management and adminis        (iii) delays in procurement decisions; (iv) delays in handing over work
sites to contros; (v) lack of road safety initiative; and (vi) lack of sustainability in mantainig the
capital investent completed under past projects. As a result of the experience gained the following
measures have been inrporated in the design and implementation of this project: (a) engineering, social,
envirmntl and institutioral aspects of the project are comprehensively prepared, reviewed, discussed
and agree with the clent before starting implementation of the project; (b) any required sbtrengtening of
basic instituinal capacities for effective project management, is implemented early in the life of the project

(i.e. estalishmet of Office of Project Director, highway maintenance unit in RHD, mini-reorganization of
RHD  were conions of ngtiions  and appointment of experts in engmeeri&  finance and
envromne / _ra anat to support the OPD, and appoinatent of all supervision consutants, etc. are
condions of credit effctiveness); (c) procurement capabilities strengthened with first year's con ts for
NHB road under the project ready for award as soon as the ITF Credit is approved; (d) the Rsettlent
Action Plan (RAP) for NHB road has been finaized and approved by the Governnment and IDA and road
right-of-way is secured for substntial part of the project prior to the award of coats; for Dhaka-Sylhet
Road and FRA, the entiment policy matix has been approved, and sice the detailed design of these
project cmponents has not been finalzed, the socio-economic surveys of the PAPs for these roads will be
carried out in a phased manmer; (e) inter-agency coordination is ensured by establishing and empowering a
Project Steering Committee (PSC) of high level officials from all GOB organizations related to the project;
(f) commtmnt received from GOB to provide adequate funds for maintenance throughout the life of the
project to eniure road network asset sustainability; (g) encourage the development of competitive and
skilled local contactors and consulting firms through effective packaging of contrcs, improved project
management and better contract administration; and (h) improved legislation for axle load control of heavy
vehicles have been proposed, axle load control equipment procured, institutional fiamework established and
trning providd to axle load control personnel.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
GOB has taken initiative under the ongoing IDA financed RRMP-I in completing the detailed
design and tender documents for the Nalka-Bonpara-Hatikamrul Road, updating the feasibility and
compkting the detailed design of Dhaka-Sylhet Road, completing the pre-investnent study of Feeder Roads
'A' and final design and tender documents for the first-year package of 250 km of roads. GOB has
recommended the appointment of the supervision consultants for Nalka-Bonpara-Hafikamrul Road and the
Adminisra  has approved this appointment pending nTF approval of the Credit. The appointment of
cosltants for the supervision of Dhaka-Sylhet Road and Feeder Roads 'A' copnents of the project is
expected to be in place before the ITF Credit is declared effective.. The consultants for the preparation and
implementatin of Resetement Action Plan (RAP) have also been appointed and the draft plan has been
completed. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies have been carried out for each of the three
major componet of the project (Nalka-Bonpara road, Dhaka-Sylhet Road and Feeder Roads A). A
consoidatd ETA report for these components has been completed. GOB has also implemented the 'micro-
reorganizaion' proposed by the Institutional Development Component (IDC) consultants under RRMP-II
project, to improve the organiion structure of RHD before credit negotiation.
GOB has embraced the project preparation and implementation framework designed to enhance the
RHD's absorptive capacity by outsourcing most of the engineering design and supervision functions for the
project, and implementation of civil works by contractors of proven experience from overseas or from other
previous road contrcs for RHD under donor funded projects. RHD will implement major detailed
insiutional reform recommendations and action plans being developed by the IDC consultants for the
ongoing RRMP-II project during the project period.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
(i) The World Bank has supported the development of the Bangladesh road sector since 1981 and
has mantained a policy dialogue on key issues in the development and maintenance of the sector; (ui) The
World Bank was the major donor intrumental in focusing GOB's attention on the need to increase
matenance fiding to the level required for a sustainable road network; and (iii) GOB values IDA's
worldwide experience in infrstructure modernization and safety issues, not only in terms of sector specific
issues, but also on overall coordination of such programs.

In general, the Assoiato is well placed to respond to the opporunities and challenges faced by
the infiasu      sector by: (a) providing and catalyzing the critcal long4term capital needed to support
accelerated grvwt (b) using the leveage of its lending volume and its advisory capacity to accelerate the
instutioa and poicy reirm process, and (c) assuring that social and environmental concerns are fully
reflectd in the growth process.
Based on previous successfil road sector project experience in Bangladesh, the Association has
assisted GOB to develop a modern approach (using HDM-model) to improve road investent, management
and financing which is reflected in the project design and implementation. Furthermore, since the
Association has been involved in the preparation and implementation of several road projects in
Bangladeh, a true partrship between GOB and the Association has evolved so that both parties have
learned valuabl lessons from past experience which are reflected in the preparation of this project. The
Association will emphasize best pracice in road construction, rehabilitation, maintenance and management
by sporting the employment of highly qualified consultants and NGOs to carry out: (a) appropriate
design and supervision of construction and maintenance works; (b) procurement; and (c) social and
environiental activities.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$11,344 million; ERRs
Dhaka-Sylhet Road                 : 30%
Nalka-Hatikamnrul-Bonpara Road    :15%
Feeder Roads - Type A             :27%
Narow Bridges                     :10-50%
Maintenance of Natl. & Reg. Roads    : 75%
The economic analysis of the project is based on consultant reports, which cover the pre-feasibility
studies and designs for rehabilitation, widening and reconstruction of the roads and bridges & structures.
For Dhaka-Sylhet road, six route options were considered and the cheapest and shortest route was selected.
EIRR of this comonet was 30%. Furthermore, while it is recognized that railroad and inland water
transport could provide alternative modal choices to the Dhaka-Sylhet Road, it is difficult to carry out
naningful analysis of these modes given the uncertainty in both the timing and cost of these altenatives.
Instead, sensitivity analysis of "decreased benefits" has been carried out which still shows the ERR to be
robust. For Nalka-Hatikarul-Bonpara Road, six options in two contexts, i.e. with and without Jamuna
Bridge, were considered and Option 1 (57.5 kIn) was selected, since it is cheapest, straighter and
envonmenlly sound compared to other options. EIRR of this component was 15%. For Feeder Roads
"A", the fill schedule of 11,010 km was screened.  All roads were ranked to provide an initial
prioritization. The resultant zonal spread of the priority roads was checked against the populations served
to determine whether an equitable result had been achieved, and certain adjustments were made. EIRR of
this componet was 27%. For narrow bridges, 43 (out of 88 candidates) were initially selected, as their
ElRRs were 12% and above (up to 50%). 10 more marginal bridges were later selected, although their
ElRRs were 10-1 1/o, since they were evaluated as part of packages and the EIRRs of each of these
pacages exceeded 12%.
h1aintenance Cxgmpgn: The total length of national and regional roads to be maitined by
RHD is about 8,000 km. For these roads to be maintained to an acceptable standard, the pavement will
require asphalt surfice treatnent and asphalt overlays to protect the considerable investmets made by the

GOB. The roads that have been improved duing the last 10 years and the data from recent road
inventories and conition surveys show that at least 500 kn of roads will annually require periodic
mantan  (about 300 kn of suface treatment and about 200 kn of overlays). The cost and benefit
analysis under "with" and "without project cases was applied to assess the economic benefits of the
d;fferent treaunent opos, taking into account savings in vehicle operatng costs, travel time, and future
maineance costs. The overall EIRR of the maintenance componet is 75%.
Otbler C&  b:g=    Other components include road safety, equipmet and technical assistance
(TA) for policy support, institutional development and project preparation and imp     .
Impleentationof the specially designed and separate "road safey" component would involve
improvement and/or redesigning the intersections or road sections (particularly those which are identfied as
black spots or hazardous locations, etc.). It would facilitate smooth and faster travel and reduce the
number of accidents for both passenger and freight vehicles and thus, minimize the offseting effects of
improved road standards and expected higher travel speeds. Equipment items, namely, for axle load
control, rfledoized traffic signs, reflectorized thermoplastic road markings, and traig equipment will
be procued to improve usage and maintenance of the roads and better management of the traffic system.
Benefits of supervision consultancies will be achieved through improved quality and timely
completo  of works and these benefits are included in the above evaluation.  Other insbtoal
development components, particularly technical assistance and trainmg, are necessary to ensure smooth
implementation of the project and sustainable future maintenance. In addition, institutional strngteing
will lad to improved efficiency in road administration through more effective plannin, budgeting and
management, all of which will be beneficial to road users in terms of reduced transport costs.
2. Financial Assessment
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$528.5 million, to be spent over 5 years starting with
fiscal year 1999. Of this cost, about US$457.5 million can be classified as development costs and the
re_m ningUS$71 million as maintenance costs. The cost of the project is expected to be financed as
follows: IDA - USS273 million (52%); DFID, UK - US$22.8 million (4%/o); and GOB the remaining
US$232.2 (44%). The Italian Govenmnent has expressed interest in providing about US$3040 million
towards the cost of the Dhaka-Sylhet Road. Agreement with the Italian Govt. is expected to be finalized
during 1998 and, once secured, will reduce the GOB contribution.
GOB's actual expenditures during the last five years and its projected budgetary allocations for
RHD during the next five years is as follows:

Third Road R.hablO WA M.Wanao                                                       Pag 14
GOB's overall allocabons for the RHD have grown steadily over the last few years, and
particularly so for maintenance. This is consistent with the growth in vehicular traffic over the same years
and the inportance GOB has given to the road sector. According to the assessment carried out in the
Bagladesh Transport Sector Study (1995) the present level of maintenance fuing for RHD is adequate.
Another positve feure has been the fiact that all routine maintenance is fimded entirely from GOB's own
funds and GOB's share of funding for periodic maintea   has also increased to about 80%.  In the
futre, GOB intends to maian these trends in maintenance cost funding, with project aid being used
almost exclusively for development costs. In the two previous IDA financed road projects, GOB has
allocated all the necessary coterpart funds in a timely fashion and this is expected to continue.
The development cost element of the IDA financed project (US$457.5 million or Taka 21045
million) which will be impl_mted over the 4 year period FY 1999 - 2002 constitutes about 37% of
RHD's planned budgetary allocation for development over the same period. The periodic maintenance
componet of the project is estimated to cost US$71 million (Taka 3266 million). Based on the age and
condition of RHD's present road network, about 500 km of roads would annually require periodic
maintenance (about 300 km surface treatment and about 200 km of overlays) all over Bangladesh. The
IDA project will finance about 200 km of periodic maintenance annually for a total of 1000 kn over the
five year period FYs 1999 - 2003. RHD's projected allocation for routine maintenance during those 5
years is Tk. 11309 million and the IDA financed project will utilize only about 29% of the overall
albocation. Given the relatively modest claim that the project would make on RHD's projected allcaion
for both road development and maintnance, the project will not crowd out other vital investments.
GOB's overall financing plan for the road sector (for both development and maintenance costs) for
the next 5 year assumes that about 40% of the overall costs will be covered from GOB's own sources and
the remainig 60% will be financed from external aid. The financing plan for this project, particularly once
the Italian funds are secured, will be consistent with this planning parameter. GOB's record of providing
sufficient countrpart fmud in a timely fashion has been highly satisfactory and the Bank's assessment is
that the project is affordable in the context of the country's overall budget.
3. Technical Assessment:
The implementation of the main components of the project do not require complex design or
construction techniques and are well within the capability of the implementation agency -and the private
sector. Design, technical specifications and procurement documents have been prepared under the guidance
of experienced intemational consultants working in close coordination with local consultants. Bid packages
will be suitably sized and pre-qualification criteria prescribed so as to be of interest to well-qualified
contractors, and construction supervision will be the responsibility of consultants to ensure adherence to
quality and timely completion of the project.
The maintenance practices presently followed by RHD need improvements as the agency moves
from a road construction organization and becomes more of a maintenance oriented organization. At
preset, maintance works are mosdy carried out by labor intensive methods and need improvement
through inrducti  of new mainenance techniques. The project builds upon RHD's current practice of
contractig out mntenance works to the private sector, and on reorganizng the structure of RHD by
establishing a mantenance unit within RHD, and also includes technical assistance for development and
implementation of a financial management systems and road safety activities. It is anticipated that by the
year 2000, the mainuteance works will be progressively contracted out to the private sector.

4. Insfitutional Assessment:
a. Exacing Agemci:   RH  is responsible for the management of the main road network,
including costuctin and maitenance of national roads, regional roads, and feeder roads Type A (FRA).
RHD has 12 Additional Chief Enginrs reporting to the Chief Engineer who in turn is responsible to the
Secretary, Roads and Railways Division (RRD) of the Minstry of Communicabons. RHD enploys
approximately 7,000 "regular" staff (including about 600 engineers and other professionals) and a firther
11,000 temporary staff. Regular staff salaries are paid from the Department's annual approved budget.
RHD field operations are divided geographically into 7 "zones" with about 17 sub-regional divisions
("circls"). Furthermore, there are units for Planning and Developnt, Mechanical, Bridges and 2 units
for foreign aided projects (IDA & ADB).
RHD is essentially a field based organization focused on construcion, rehabilitation and
maintenance activities, with a relatively small HQ staff focusing on overall planning, budgeting, policy
making and donor coordination functions. The functioning of RHD and its work culture has changed
considerably over the last decade and the senior management of RHD and the GOB realize that it has to
evolve much fiuter. The DFID financed IDC-2 played a major role in the evolution of RHD. Under the
IDC-2 the following activities were undertaken: (i) in recognition of RHD's urgent need to upgrade the
skills of its staff, a training institute was established where almost 5000 staff have received training locally
and another 125 received training abroad; (ii) to strengthen the maitenance function of the RHD, a HDM
Cell was created and 5 members were trained abroad to staff this Cell who prepared the mainance
component of the proposed RRMP-I.; (iii) a Planning Unit was set up in the RRD to follow-up and
monitor the various activities of RHD and based on the experience contibute to the formulation of more
appropriate policies to be adopted by the GOB in the road sector; (iv) assisted in the fonnulation and
implementation of the micro-reorganization and the formulation of an overall reorganization plan of RHD
where the strategy is to amphasize issues of strategic management and increase private sector parficipation
in the road sector, i.e. more use of local contractors for maintenance activities an consultants; (v) iniiated
the developmeat of an improved accunting and financial management system for RHD; (vi) prepared the
studies and developed action plans for road safety, axle load control and traffic management, with active
participation of concerned stakeholders; and (vii) prepared proposals for rationalizing RHD's ferry
operations and its equipment and workshop operations (a range of options have been suggested starting
fron outright privaization to management contracts).
The institutional strategy being pursued under the proposed RRMP-3 is to continue with the work
stted under RRMP-2. This strategy is underscored by the fact that the GOB has provided and is planning
to provide RHD with very substantal resources for the development and maintenance of the road network
in Bangladesh. It is essential, therefore, that RHD develops institutionally in a manner which will enable it
to ensure that its growming assets are maintained efficiently. With maintenance becoming RHD's principal
focus, the vision for RHD's institutional development over the project period is as follows: (i) the HDM
Cell in RHD is continuously strngthened enabling it to plan all of RHD's maintenance activities; (ii) the
Accounting and Financial Magmet System being developed under the previous project has bee
implemented and institutionalized in RHD thus making it more accountable; (iii) the action plan on axle
load control has been fully implemented to prevent early damage of the road network and reduce economic
losses; (iv) the physical road safety measures developed under the previous project has been filly
implemented to save human lives and reduce loss of property and road safety audit procedures filly
instituonalized within RH); (v) traffic police training center established and e initial batch of officers
trained in modem enforcemet techniques; (vi) the Environment and Resettlement Unit established under
the eaier project would be fully staffed and enabled to filfill their oversight responsibilities on all RHD's
environment and resettlemnt related activities; (vii) RHD's ferry, equipment and workshop operations
fully rationalized. DFID have agreed to provide continuing support for RHD's institutional development

under the RRMP-11. Armnt between GOB and DFID to finance the institutinal development
componant is a condition for ITF Credit effectiveness.
b. Project Manat: Project implementation will be the responsibility of the RHD with
oversight by the Project Steerng Committee. A Office of Project Director (OPD) has been established
within RHD, headed by an Additional Chief Engineer (ACE) designated as Project Director (PD) to
manage the project. The OPD will be responsible for planning, budgeting, procurement, implemntatin,
coordination, management and monitoring of the project components. The PD will be assisted by three
local technical advisors for implementation and coordination of the project, in particular: (i) project
managemet; (ii) resettlement and environmental aspects; and (iii) financial management. The PD under
the guidance of the Chief Eqnpneer will be responsible for appointing and maintaining suitable staff in the
OPD during the life of the project. The OPD will also be staffed by high quality staff from within the RHD
as well as specialists from other govemment departments as needed.
A project organization chart has been developed for the project under which it is proposed to
appoit seveal Project Directors for major phases of the work. For each contact or a combination of
contracts within the project, a Project Manager from RHD will be appointed. In addin, S i
Engineers assised by Executive Engineers in the respective zones will also assist the PD in cdinion,
management and monitoring of the project.
For the Instiutnal Development Component, the Additional Chief Engineer/Planning and
Development (RHD) will be responsible for managing the institutional reform process and the
implementation of the reform activities agreed with Administrator and DFID.
5. Social:
Civil works in three components of the project involves acquisition of private and public lands and
other assets. This will cause a general reduction in earning capacity of the displacees and, to some etent,
homestead loss and impact on groups and local communities. It has been demined that a satisfactory
Rsettlement Action Plan (RAP) in compliance with the OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement is required
to adequately mitigate these impacts. An overall resettlement framework has therefore been developed for
the project, containing principls of cmpensation and other entitment policies for different impact
categories, rehabilitation programs, implementation mechanisms; procedures for local consultation and
participation, informatin campaign and grievance redress procedures, and monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms.
This approach has been developed based on detailed socio-economic sudies of the potenially
affected people under the Nalka-Hatikamrul- Bonpara (N-H-B) road, completd in October 1997. Ths
new road is likely to require land acquisition of approximaely 287 hectares from 3,187 plots in the districts
of Sirajgo and Natore. This will displace some 2,966 households, comprising of 16,190 peopleh from
their properties. The project-wide Restemnt Action Plan covers all components, and it has been agreed
that impac categoies, support  canisms, and institutional measures will be common across the project.
For the oter two comonents ()haka-Sylhet Road, and Feeder Road A), pending alignment finalization
and, hc, the deaed SESs, the RAP contains estimates based on extrapolation of the available
informtion. The exact mnmbers of the affected people in the different impact categories will be appeded
to the d   ta    as they become available.

The compensation and entitlement policies developed are based on the following principles:
*  Wherevr possible, the engineering design process will incorporate measures to avoid or nimze
social, including resetement, and environmental impacts;
* Unavoidable impacts shall be mitigated and the compensation for private lands and other properties
shall be paid at their current market price and/or replacement value;
* Displacees from the homesteads shall be relocated and be assisted in the process of relocation;
* Rehabilitation programs shall be undertaken to avert deterioration of living standards of the PAPs;
* Particular support shall be given to socially and economically vulnerable groups;
*  Inpacts on groups and communities, particularly the vulnerable ones, shall be mitigated; and
* Affected people shall be involved in decision-making through consultation mechanisms.
The project consultants for the different components have coordinated among themselves to
prepare the basic Resettement Action Plan for the project as a whole and the component-specific details.
The final Resettmet Action Plan for the NHB road was completed in April 1998.
It is noted that institutional capacity to successfully implement resettlement programs is weak in
. Land acquisition requires utmost cooperation of district land administrat nd several other
Guovernment agencies that are often not adequately responsive. Tbis adds an extra dimension of risk to
overall project implementation due to delays in land acquisition and the consequent increases costs.
Careful attention will be given to this issue during implementation and adequate resources have been
allocated to supervision and additional assistance to the local institutions carrying out this part of the
project.
6. Environmental Assessment: Environmental Category [x] A   []B   [] C
The project has an environmental rating "A" and Environmental Assessments (EAs) for the
different components of the project were undertaken by RHD Consultants as per the guidelines of Bank's
Operational Directive OD 4.01. For the Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara Road and the Dhaka-Sylhet Road, a
complete Envirnental Impact Assessments (EIAs), including Environmental Management Plans (EMPs),
have been prepared, which meets Association requirements. The EIA for the Dhaka-Sylhet Road has
identified increased risk of ponding at certain sections of the highway. This issue wil be further studied
and mitigation plans prepared before bidding documents are issued for those sections. For the Feeder
Roads "A", the roads that will undergo improvement have been identified. A sectoral EIA has been
prepared which concluded that there are no potential environmental impacts.
Since implementation of the EMPs is critical, the project proposes to strengthen the newly created
Enviro   t and Rettlement Unit of the Roads and Highways Dqeprent. The TA will also contain
provisions to support the RHD, involve local NGOs, and provide specific technical support to rehabilitate
and reclain borrow pits for agricultural use or for use as fish ponds.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; f
participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable]:
The main afieted groups are those people and communities living along the road corridors,
parclarly those losing land or whose livelihoods may be threatened in other ways. For those affected
negatiwvely, an entidtemet fiamework containing different compensation and support mechanisms has been
developed (see section 5, above). This framework has been developed in consultation with affected groups
and cmmunte, using a variety of social assessment tools including focus group meetings.

It is worth noting at a particularly innovative approach to detnrining degree of vulnerability for
the affitd populatin has been developed for this project, based on different criteria such as poverty,
landessnss, gender issues, demographic factors, and other dimensions. Appropriate support mechansms
for these different groups have been developed, and will be implemented with the help of local NGOs and
community based organizations.
F: Sustaiuability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project will enhance the capacity of the RHD to plan, finance and implement road and bridge
reabilitatin and nmintenance and therefore ensure sustainability by: (i) increasing the efficiency of
construction and maintenance through better design and supervision of roads and bridge works; (ii)
involving loal conactors for construction, rehabilitation and   aintenance; and (iu) inprove
environmental management and mitigation of social impacts.
Successful project implementation should lead to Borrower appreciation of the benefits from
improved roads and bridges as well as institutional reform, which, in tum should contribute to project
sustinability.
Improved sustainability of roadworks also requires more effective nunagent of maintenance
practices on the ground to ensure timely preservation of assets and value-for-money for works undertaken.
Tbese are being addressed through assistance for srengthned road management procedures, which go
beyond office planning tools to address decision-making, quality control and accountability practices.
Sustainability of the institutional impacts of the project will be strengthened by demonsated success of
improved contracting, consulting and maintenance management procedures and the resetement and
environment action plans, by the involvement of a wide number of RHD staff in project implntat  and
taining. The advantages of project-related measures such as the Project Steering Conmittec (PSC), the
Institutonal Rsview Comittce (IRC) (which was already established for the ongoing RRMP-II project),
the Office of Project Director (OPD), introduction of road manant system and establishment of new
Financial Management System, are expected to be carried through to other GOB programs beyond the life
of the project.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The Association has suggested that improvements should be made in the road financing system,
particularly by increasing the taxes paid by operators of heavy vehicles towards financing the cost of
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads. GOB has agreed that heavy vehicles should pay higher road user
taxes since considerable damage to the road network is caused by these overloaded vehicles. A concem of
the GOB is that substantial increases in road user taxes will be strongly opposed by the road transport
industry. The degree of potential controversy is rated as moderate.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
The project includes five civil work cmpnents and their esimaed total cost is US$432 milLion. Their
IRRs vary from 15% for the construction of Nalka-Hafikamrul-Bonpara road (17% of US$432 million) to
75% for the maitnance of naional roads (16% of US $432 million). lbe largest project cmponent is the
rehabilitatimoOf the Dhaa-Sylhet road (US$178, or 41% of US $432 million) for which the IRR is 30%/.
Detais of the eoonoAc analyses are descrbe in the foowig consultant rxepos: (i) NaIka4Haiarul-Bonpar

Study and Debd Dpesign of Feeder Roads Type 'A'; (iu) Rehabilitin of Dhaka-Syet Road - Feasibility Study
Update; and (iv) Pro-feasbity Study for Narow Bridge Replacenent on Main Roads under RRMP m. The
ecom c analysis of the Maintenance of National & Regional Roads in the Project Area has been pWared by
RHD usag the Highway Design and Maintnance (HDM) Model Im and on the basis of dteir cur    road
maintenance cost estimates. A copy of each of these studies is in the project fle. Key f*aures are:
The average unit re/consuctin  and rehabilitation costs were based on the recent actual bids received for IDA and
ADB financed Natoa and Rwal Rads prjects, except for nmamance., whih has been pared by the HDM
lnit of RHD. The unit rates have been adjusted to allow for iflaton, hlmp sum itms and c. The
average unit costs ofthe five main project coonens are as follows:
(i) Nalla4iatikamrul-Bonpamm Road: The average unt cost of the rehabiltabon secion of this road is US$1.2
million and for the new section US$1.4 million per ldlometer respectively.
(u) Feeder Roads type "A": Unt costs were obtained from contc  currently under IDA financed Second Rural
Road and Maintenance Proect and adjusted for iflation, lump sum items and contsngec. The average unit oost
per linear kldometer is US$192,000. It was possible to esfimate the aveage bridge and culvert size for each zone,
whch combined with te number of structures per lklometer and unit rates pemitd preparain  of an estimate
indicatg the cost per kdmiow for new costuction, rpairs and protecion wodrs.
(iii) Dhaka-Sylbet Road. Unt rates obtained frorm corts cury under RRMP-2, adjusted for inflaton, lump
sum itms and            . The average unit cost per linear klometer is US$799,000. It was possible to estimate
the average bridge and culvt costs per secion, which combined with the unit rtes pemitted preparation of an
estimate indicaig the cost per kloimeter for new constuction works.
(rv) Maitenance: Unit rates obtained fron the contacts under RRMP-2, provided by the HDM unit of RHD.
The average unit cost is US$ 70,300 per inear idlometer.
(v) Narrow Bridges: Unit rAes estimated an the basis of the actual cost of a recnly completed similar project in
Bangadesh and adjusted for pnce coningcy.  The uit/average cost per linear meto of bridge costucton,
including al fondation, tsuucture and superstructure works, is about US$15,000.
Not benefits were estimated on the basis of the folbwing assumptions:
reduced travel distance and thus, savings in travel me for road users and freight;
increased travel speeds by allowig more opportnties for traffic to pass, especially if there are unnous
bicycle carts, oxe cart or heavy trucks and buses in the traffic stream;
safer travel and fewer costly accidents;

From similar studies in odter omries, it is etimnated that t    mnitude in eo uc tems is lkely to be modest
rdeave to odher user coo. However, a secaly designed and sq,atre "road saW  compont has be included

Tie beefits of (w) construction, imp o t rehabiliatio and/or Wining the roads and bidges and paving
die shoulders were included in the analysis though speed-flow equatios based on lane and shoulder width. Speeds
predcted by the HDM  model were consstet with observations of speeds on the roads.  The effects of
nanow/rough roads, nonmotized traffic, pedeians and roadside activities were reflected in a "fritin" factor
affecting taffic speed. TIhe benefits would cotibute significantly to unminted & faster travel (re: delays and
low speod due to narrow brdge/road/other vehicle crossings) and reduced acciderts (re: loss of human lives &
property and damage of vehils, freight, etc.).
Traffic growth rates used for the first ten years, in line with currn traffic projectons, will continue to grow at the
crat 8%/ per anmun, fag to 6% over the net five years and then 4% for te following five years.
The base case without e project assumes that the roads are maintained (potioles patched anmially and reseals
every th   years), but not imroved over the 20 year evaluation period. In the with-project case, the roads are
maintaind (reseals only) every sev years. Roads are designed on the basis of currat lvels of bus and truck
overladig, recognng the subsantial lak of success m introducing improved load enforcemet or bus/ tuck
fleet mdnizatio in Baglesh.
For NaIka4iamru-B4onpara road, HDM-II programs were used. Traffic input cawe from the SATURN
taffic model with sonie siplification. to take account of HDM-Irs limit of 20 traffldd links per run. This new
road will also be a statecay significant segmet of an itegrted natioaal highway nework once the Jamuna
Bridg is opeed and eventaly a part of the Asian Highway Network, which is not captured in the ecnomic
analysis.
For Feeder Roads type "A" (FRA) and Dhaka-Sylhet road componts, a cmputer model calld CARTS has been
developed for Bangladesh. The model was built for the FRA feasibiLty study and covers the whole cantry. The
program is prinarily a model to evaluate a network of road improvenlts in a regional development setting and is
sutable for foecsn  traffic demand, for esimatng costs and for the economic evaluaton of nial road
improvt programs. Furwrmore, for Dhaka-Sylhet Road, while it is recognized that railroad and inland water
transport oould provide alenative modal choices, it is difficuk to carry out _menngfil analysis of these modes
given the unc  ty in both the timnug and costs of these alternatives. Insad, sensitivity analysis of "decreased
benefits" has been caried out which stfill shows the ERR to be robust.
For the narow brdes conpont, dhe narrow bndge model, whih is a part of the Road and Bridge Econic
Modeling System (RBEMS) has been used. The model calclates delays to vhicles passig over narow bridges
accordig to the test set of empirical rdaonships based on the Road Master Plan research whih relates die daily
traffic volume to dte expected nWmber of vehicles nounted  on the bridge. Ecounters are modeed in three
cateories: (i) motoized vehice meeting anoter motorized vehicle; (ii) motoized vehicle meeting a ricksaw or
cat; and (iii) motorizd vehicle folowig a rickshaw or cart The model assumes that all motrized vehicles
aproachig the bridge will slow down even if they do not encOnter anodier vehicle frmn an aveage speed of 60

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Disbursemen under the proposed Credit will be made as indicated in Table C, which indicates the
percentages of financing for different categories of expenditures under the project.
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs):
Full documentation for all conacts requinng Bank's prior review will be sent to Administrator in support of
withdrawal applicat. Expenditures for individual contacts of goods and services, for which prior review
by Administrato is not required, will be disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs); all reds
evidencing sh information must be retained by RHD unti at least one year after the Bank has received the
audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Credit is made. All withdrawal
aplicatons in respect of civil works will be accompanied by certificates from the Supervision Consultants
atesting that the works and materials meet the design standards and specifications agreed by Administrator,
and that the payments are in aordance with the completed works. Accredited private auditors will conduct
financial audit, including sample checks of payment certificates.
Special Account:
A Special Account of US$25 million will be established at the Bangladesh Bank to mee anticipated
expendicures of about four mnths. Eligible paynmnts greater than one third of the Special Account amount
