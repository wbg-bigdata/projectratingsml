                                P097975
                           IDA GRANT H2350


1.      The proposed changes to this operation are: (i) a nine and a half months extension
of the Closing Date from June 15, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and (ii) a reallocation of the
proceeds of the Grant.

2.       The extension of closing date is requested so that the technical assistance and
environmental clean-up works contracts may be procured and completed and other
activities under implementation may be completed as well. Project implementation was
progressing reasonably well until the occurrence of a military coup, which triggered OP
7.30 on April 17, 2012 and led to the suspension of disbursements until December 2012.
This situation led to a disruption in project implementation, including delays in procuring
technical assistance and environmental clean-up works contracts.

3.     This will be the third extension of the project amounting to two years and nine
months. A first extension from June 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012 was granted in the
context of a deeper project restructuring, followed by a second extension from September
30, 2012 to June 15, 2013. The second extension was granted during the OP 7.30
suspension of disbursements. A third extension of nine and a half months is proposed
extending the Closing Date of the Guinea-Bissau Multi-sector Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project, IDA H2350/ P097975, from June 15, 2013 to March 31, 2014.

4.       The reallocation of proceeds among disbursement categories is necessary to: (i)
accommodate the additional operating cost related to the extension of the closing date;
(ii) reflect the latest procurement plan, including the outcome of signed contracts; and
(iii) accommodate a slight increase in the cost of works, training and goods, compensated
by savings in consultant services.

5.       The project’s disbursement rate is 79% and progress towards its development
outcome and implementation progress are rated moderately satisfactory1. Project
objectives continue to be achievable and rapid completion of project activities is expected
now that disbursements have resumed, as the project implementation unit is experienced
and proactive. The Task Team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing
Dates) have been met, specifically, (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable;
(ii) the performance of the Borrower is satisfactory; (iii) the team agreed with the PIU on
an updated procurement plan during the recent supervision mission to complete the
project within the revised closing date; and (iv) there are no outstanding audits, or IFRs
for the Grant.

1
 In the last approved ISR, the monitoring and evaluation performance of the project was rated
unsatisfactory, because of lack of reporting on results indicators. The PIU has since then provided recent
data on results indicators and this rating will be upgraded in the next ISR.
                                                     4
6.      Results achieved to date: as of December 31, 2012, PDO indicators of electricity
and water sectors performance are generally above the annual targets, except for the
collection rate for electricity bills and direct beneficiaries of water supply services, which
are below the annual target. Overall there are some doubts about the accuracy of data for
these indicators as provided by the power and water utility EAGB; the team will work
with EAGB and the PIU to improve the quality of results indicators reporting. Regarding
intermediate results indicators, installed power generation capacity owned by EAGB and
the number of prepayment meters installed were significantly below target as some
generation capacity experienced break-downs and the pace of installation of prepayment
meters has been slower than expected due to low capacity at EAGB. Please see the table
below for more details:

7.      Most project activities have signed contracts and are either completed or under
implementation. The main exceptions are: (i) an extension of the technical assistance
contract with Sénélec, which is signed but needs to be implemented further to the
resumption of disbursements by the Bank; (ii) an environmental clean-up of Bissau
power plant site for which terms of reference are being finalized, procurement and
execution should be completed within 5 months and three specialized firms have
expressed their interest; (iii) a tariff study for electricity and water supply, for which
terms of reference and a shortlist of firms have been finalized; (iv) three TA studies for
the National Directorate of road transport for which an evaluation report of expressions
of interest has been prepared; and (v) a diagnostic study of hydraulic drilling in the city of
Bissau, whose budget has been adjusted further to a first tender process, which revealed
that the estimated budget was insufficient.

8.     The Task Team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates)
have been met, specifically, (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the
performance of the Borrower is satisfactory; (iii) the team agreed with the PIU on an
action plan during the recent supervision mission to complete the project within the
revised closing date; and (iv) there are no outstanding audits, or IFRs for the Grant.

9.      Proceeds for Guinea-Bissau Multi Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project
will be reallocated as follows:

     the Project)
 (3) Consultant’s services              3,300,000         2,860,000

10. Note that disbursement category (5), which was present in the original project, had
    been eliminated during the first project restructuring in July 2010. During the current
    reallocation, it was noticed that a small expenditure had already happened before the
    first restructuring; the category was therefore reintroduced to account for that
    expenditure.
