MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on India
Second Farakka Thermal Power Project (Loan 2442-IN)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the India: Second Farakka Thermal Power
Project (Loan 2442-fN, approved in FY84) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office; Part II was
received from the Borrower, the Government of India, and from both the implementing agency, the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and the current owner-operator of the transmission lines
component (PowerGrid).
The Loan, in the amount of US$300.8 million equivalent, was closed on April 30, 1994, more
than two years after the original date. US$54.7 million equivalent were canceled after all the eligible
expenditures had been submitted. It was the ninth Bank-financed operation to assist the power sector in
India. The main objective was to provide additional least-cost thermal capacity in Eastern India to help
eliminate power shortages. Another objective was to promote regional power systems leading ultimately
to a national grid. The physical components consisted of construction of two 500 MW coal-based
generating units for a total of 1,000 MV additional capacity and of 640 kms of high voltage
transmission lines.
The project was plagued with delays, most beyond NTPC 's control. There was an
initial one year delay in effectiveness due to labor unrest on the plant site; then the delivery of
construction materials was delayed by suppliers; finally, implementation was delayed by a heavy
monsoon, a cyclone and difficult soil conditions on the plant site.
The project's physical components have been substantially completed. The plant is not yet
operational, however, because of problems with the equipment and civil works (overheating boiler and
vibrating turbine). The PCR notes, however, that the project benefits will materialize after these
problems are solved by the end of 1996. Given NTPC's and the contractor's experience, this is a
reasonable expectation. The PCR anticipates a 17 percent rate of return. It rates the project as
satisfactory and the sustainabilitv of benefits as likely since NTPC's tariff formula allows the recovery
of capital and operating costs plus a profit, and sector policy reforms have strengthened NTPC's finances,
including the collection of bills.
The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) agrees with the PCR that the project outcome is
satisfactory, that its sustainability is likely, and that its institutional development is partial. The PCR
provides adequate information about implementation and construction delays.
No audit is planned.

SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2442-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Farakka Thermal Power Project in
India, for which Loan 2442-IN in the amount of US$300.8 million equivalent was approved on June 14,
1984 (FY84), signed on June 29, 1984, and made effective August 30, 1985. The loan closed on April
30, 1994 vis-a-vis the original loan closing date of December 31, 1991. The loan in the amount of
about US$246.1 mnillion equivalent was disbursed by September 13, 1994; about US$54.7 million
equivalent was canceled as it was not required. Cofinancing was provided by the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), Germany, Government of Italy, Bankers Trust Company, and the Exim Bank of
Japan. The balance amount was met by equity contributions and loans from the Government of India
(GOI) as well as by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) from its own internal resources.
The loan, made to the GOI, was onlent to NTPC for implementation. The physical components
of the project comprised the installation of two 500 MW generating units and about 640 km of
associated, high voltage transmission lines.  The main objectives of the project were to provide
additional least-cost thermal capacity in the Eastern Region to help in gradually eliminating power
shortages in., the region.  Also, through participation in financing the project, the Bank had the
opportunity to promote the development of regional power systems in India that would ultimately lead to
a national grid,"and to assist in the development of the Indian power sector in such areas as organization
and policies for the operation of regional and national power systems, and long-range national power
development planning. The physical objective of the project was to assist in meeting the electricity
demand in the EastOm Region of India through the addition of 1,000 MW of thermal capacity at the
Farakka thermal power plant in West Bengal, where three generating units of 200 MW each, were
already being installed with the assistance of the Bank (Ln. 1887-IN and Credit 1053-IN), along with
associated transmission lines. The responsibility for the implementation of the transmission facilities
was transferred to the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (POWERGRID) in August 1991. The
physical implementation of the power generation project is still incomplete because of delays in
construction, as well as serious equipment problems, much of which is beyond the control of NTPC.
Transmission lines and substations have been commissioned.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was prepared by the Energy and
Infrastructure Operations Division, South Asia Country Department II, with input from NTPC. Part II
(Project Review from the Borrower's Perspective) was prepared by GOI, NTPC and POWERGRID.'
Preparation of this PCR started during the Bank's supervision missions of the project in
February and June 1994, as well as a follow up mission in November 1994, and is based, inter alia, on
the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 4967-IN), the Loan and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondences between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and the Project
Completion Report prepared by NTPC for its own internal evaluation and archives.
l   Conmnents by NTPC and POWERGRID were endorsed by GOI and sent to the Bank with GOI's letter
dated August 16, 1995, which was received at Bank Headquarters in mid-October 1995.

SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2442-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMM1ARY
Introduction
1.    At the time the project was initiated, consumption of electricity in India was
growing at an average annual rate of 8 percent over-the past two decades. In the 1950s
and 1960s, installed capacity and power generation managed to keep pace with the
nation's demand for power. Since 1970, however, the situation started to deteriorate
rapidly. Delays in the commissioning of new power plants, operating and maintenance
problems (mostly due to lower than design coal quality), and insufficient investment
under severe budget constraints led to a critical shortage of power. Specifically, the
Eastern Region at the time was experiencing a severe shortage of capacity and energy,
that had led to widespread rationing and permanent overloading of existing thermal
units-a situation that resulted in increased operation and maintenance costs as well as
high forced outage rates of these units.
Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the project were to provide additional least-cost thermal
capacity in the Eastern Region to help in gradually eliminating power shortages in the
region, and through participation in financing the project, to give the Bank the
opportunity to promote the development of regional power systems in India. It was
envisaged that this would ultimately lead to the creation of a national grid, and assist in
the development of the Indian power sector.
Implementation Experience
3.    The implementation of the project is yet to be completed.  At appraisal,
commercial operation of the two units was set at May 1990 for Unit 4 and May 1991
for Unit 5. Even though Unit 4 was synchronized in September 1992 and Unit 5 in
February 1994, it has not been possible to place the two units in commercial operation
due to serious equipment problems. The main reasons for the delay are:
(a)   Vibration in the turbine-generator units, which took a long time to
rectify;
(b)   Damage to the boiler superheater tubes of Unit 4 during commissioning,
which required extensive modification in both boilers;



ii
(c)    Failure of Unit 4 Electrostatic Precipitator support structure, leading to
reinforcement of the support steel in both units.
Sustainability
4.    In spite of the implementation delays and equipment problems, the project is
clearly sustainable because the demand for the full output of the 2 x 500 MW power
generating units exists. NTPC is addressing the equipment problems with the help of
manufacturers of the equipment and hopes to resolve them satisfactorily in the near
future. Power generated at the Farakka Superthermal Power Plant is already being
shared by West Bengal and its neighboring states. There is, however, a need for
further strengthening the subtransmission and distribution network in the region to
absorb the full output of the plant. NTPC is addressing this issue with the help of the
Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (POWERGRID). The present tariff setting
procedures for generation from NTPC stations should allow recovery of capital and
operating costs and provide a reasonable profit margin for capital improvements. The
new two-part tariff (Part I to cover fixed costs and Part II the variable costs),
introduced with effect from November 1, 1992, should provide for incentives to
operate the plants efficiently and with high availability; however, it is being
administered by the Eastern Regional Electricity Board (EREB) in a manner that dilutes
the two-part tariff to basically a one-part tariff because of the global accounting system
that also acts as an impediment to merit order dispatching. The recent policy reforms
implemented by GOI have significantly changed the commercial operations of NTPC
and increased its financial strength such as to permit raising funds in both the domestic
and international markets.
Summary of Project Cost and Financing Arrangements
5.    The actual project cost was Rs. 21,148 million (US$ 970.1 million equivalent),
including the associated transmission components and interest during construction. In
terms of Rupees, the project cost increased by almost 46 percent because of the
devaluation of the Rupee with respect to the US dollar, while in terms of the US$ the
project cost was lower by as much as 27.6 percent.
6.    The Bank loan of US$246.1 million equivalent (US$ 54.7 million canceled from
the original loan amount of US$300.8 million) provided about 25.4 percent of the total
project cost. Financing was also provided by the Kreditanstalt far Wiederaufbau (KfW,
Germany: DM  50.6 million equivalent), Government of Italy (DM  159.9 million
equivalent), Banker's Trust Co. (DM 189.1 million equivalent), and Exim Bank of
Japan (Yen 10,221 million equivalent). The balance of the project cost was met by
GOI loans and equity contributions, as well as by NTPC from its own internal
resources.



iii
Implementation Time Table
7.    Project implementation suffered due to: (a) delays in meeting the conditions of
loan effectiveness; (b) delays in procurement; (c) persistent site labor unrest; and (d)
serious equipment problems during the commissioning phase of the plant. The loan
closing date had to be extended three times to permit disbursements to be completed
against commitments under the loan.
Summary of Performance of the Borrower and the Bank
8.    The performance of NTPC was satisfactory in respect of compliance with the
covenants of Ln. 2442-IN. The covenant requiring, NTPC's accounts receivable to be
reduced to a level not exceeding an amount equivalent to the preceding two months of
billing was not part of the conditions of this loan. The covenant was first introduced
under Ln.2555-IN for the Rihand Power Transmission Project (PCR No.12640 dated
December 29, 1993). As bill collection has been a persistent problem with NTPC
because of the poor financial situation of many SEBs and the lack of an appropriate
contractual framework for the sale of bulk power during the implementation of the
Second Farakka Therrnal Power Project that affected the GOI-Bank-NTPC dialogue, it
is also described in this PCR. GOI introduced a number of policy reforms in the power
sector in FY93 which significantly changed the commercial operations of NTPC. As a
result, better collection from the SEBs and payments by GOI through Central
Appropriations (CA) on behalf of the SEBs helped NTPC gradually reduce the accounts
receivable on the current billing to less than two months.
9.    The Bank remained intimately involved in the implementation of the project,
from   preparation through completion.  It maintained good relations with NTPC
throughout the execution of the project. The Bank was instrumental in helping NTPC
correct a number of shortcomings of broader sectoral concerns in their operations, such
as, the introduction of a more comprehensive approach towards environmental
protection and resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) issues, liquidation of accumulated
arrears of SEBs, as well as establishment of a training institute to help develop human
resources. However, the Bank should have addressed NTPC's unsatisfactory accounts
receivable problem and its failure to meet the associated loan covenants in other
projects much earlier on and acted more firmly by invoking remedies under the loan
agreements of those projects to correct the situation.
Project Outcome
10.   The prirnary objectives of the project have been accomplished; viz., additional
least-cost thermal capacity in the region has been installed through the construction of
the project, regional power systems have been established, and long-range power
development planning capability through attendant organizational changes in the NTPC
has been achieved. The improvement of financial discipline in NTPC's operations has
increased its credibility and potential to borrow from commercial sources. However,



iv
the project has not yet been successful in meeting its physical objectives; the 2 x 500
MW generating units are yet to be stabilized and placed in commercial operation.
Findings and Lessons Learned
11.   Major findings are as follows:
(a)  Site selection for a power plant must be free of any political influence and
should be based purely on technical and economic merits (Part I, para 6);
(b) Prequalification of bidders should be done ftor large and complex procurement.
This ensures that invitations to bid are extended only to those who have adequate
capabilities and resources. Also, the Bank should present a power project proposal to
its Board of Directors for approval only after tender documents for the long-lead, main
packages have been prepared (Part I, para. 10);
(c) The procurement cycle, starting from issuing of bid invitation to contract
award, should be significantly shortened. Delays in the procurement cycle caused
slippage of the project implementation schedule as compared to the schedule set at
appraisal.  Being an autonomous corporation, NTPC  should also make its own
procurement decisions independent of any external involvement in the process (Part I,
para. 14);
(d) A sound financial health is a key element to the success of a utility. The project
helped improve NTPC's financial position with the improvement of financial discipline
in their operations. The financial strength of NTPC has put them in a position to raise
funds in both domestic and international markets. NTPC could exploit its current
financial capability to accelerate implementation of its investment program (Part I,
para. 34);
(e) It is necessary to set the tariffs appropriately based on merit order dispatch so
that the relative efficiencies of the power plants are reflected in their operation and the
SEBs feel comfortable tapping from the most economical sources (Part I, para.40); and
(f) The R&R aspects of a project need to be addressed as a part of the
Environmental Impact Assessment and detailed during project preparation. The R&R
issues had to be revisited again based on Bank guidelines that require the Project
Affected Persons (PAP) to be compensated for their losses and rehabilitated such that
their former living standards and income capacity were at least restored.  These
guidelines were agreed between the Bank and NTPC in 1993, towards the end of the
project (Part I, para. 41).

Background
1.   In India, responsibility for electricity supply is shared constitutionally between the
Government of India (GOI) and the States. The State Electricity Boards (SEB) and the Regional
electricity Boards are controlled by the States; the Ministry of Power of the GOI administers the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the
National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NBPC), the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC),
and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). The SEBs, NTPC, NHPC and POWERGRID are
charged with the responsibility of promoting the development of the power subsector under the
Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948.
2.    The performance of SEBs was vitiated by poor quality and persistent unreliability of
power systems. Chronic power shortages in the 1970s and the adverse effect these were having
on the productive sectors of the economy prompted the GOI to intensify its efforts to balance the
demand and supply of electricity. The strategy developed for this purpose was to supplement the
efforts of SEBs by installing large power plants, along with associated high voltage transmission
lines, in different parts of India where power shortages were acute. The emphasis was on:
(a) accelerating the development of hydropower potential and large coal-fired power plants at pit-
head locations and in the proximity of load centers; (b) improving the efficiency of the thermal
power plants and reducing losses in the transmission and distribution networks; (c) expanding the
rural electrification program; and (d) strengthening the organization and management capabilities
of the SEBs.
3.    Based on a feasibility report in 1978 supporting the location of thermal power plants near
coal mnines, GOI decided to construct four large thermal power plants of 600 MW each at
Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka. The study had concluded that the Farakka site could
support as much as 2, 100 MW of power generation (3 x 200 MW + 2 x 500 MW + 1 x 500 MW)



2
to be built in three phases. The first 3 x 200 MW generating units of the Farakka Thermal Power
Project were installed as a part of the initial program of development. The 2 x 500 MW units thus
came to be installed in the second phase of the project. Appraisal of the project was made by the
Bank in November/December 1983. Project negotiations were held in Washington from April 27
to May 8, 1984 and the loan of US$300.8 million equivalent was approved by the Board on June
14, 1984. The loan became effective on August 30, 1985. GOI was the Borrower of the loan;
NTPC was the implementing agency with the Borrower's assistance, under a subsidiary loan
agreement.
Project Objectives
4.    The primary objective of the project was to provide additional least-cost thermal capacity
in the Eastern Region to help in gradually eliminating power shortages in India in general, and in
the Eastern Region in particular which was experiencing severe power shortages, widespread
rationing, and permanent overloading of the existing thermal units. The participation in financing
the project was to give the Bank the opportunity, through its continuing dialogue with the GOI,
to help establish regional power systems that would ultimately lead to the creation of a national
grid, and to assist in the development of the Indian power sector in such areas as:
-  development of sector organization and policies for the operation of regional and
national power systems; and
- long-range national power development planning.
Project Description
5.    The project comprised the following components, as established at appraisal:
(a)   Construction of 2 x 500 MW thermal generating units, including boilers, turbine-
generator sets, electrical and mechanical auxiliary equipment, associate civil works
and common services and facilities;
(b)   about 640 km of three, 400 kV double-circuit transmission lines, connecting
Farakka with Jeerhat, Biharsharif and Durgapur; and
(c)   technical assistance for engineering and design of the power station.
Project Design and Organization
6.    The feasibility report of the project was prepared jointly by NTPC and its consultants in
1978. The project was conceived for a total installed capacity of about 2,100 MW, using coal as
primary fuel for power generation. The first three generating units, 200 MW each were installed
during the implementation of the first phase of the project under IDA Credit 1053-IN and IBRD
Ln.1887-IN from 1981 to 1990. These units are already in operation. The Second Phase under
the project loan included the two 500 MW units and associated 400 kV transmission lines. There
is provision for a third 500 MW unit to be installed on the same site, which would bring the plant
to its ultimate design capacity of 2,100 MW. However, there are serious questions about the



3
suitability of the selected site. Of the three most important factors that influence the selection of a
coal-fired power plant site, viz., availability of fuel, abundance of cooling water and proximity to
the load center, none appears to have been adequately satisfied in this case. The plant is far away
from the coal fields, there is no certainty that the cooling water drawn from the Farakka barrage
could be sustained over the life of the power plant, and the place is far away from the load center.
Technical and economical merit appears to have been relegated in favor of extraneous
considerations in the selection of this particular site.
7.    NTPC, at the time of appraisal, had a three-tier organization structure: Corporate level,
Regional level and Project level. The organization changed over time to answer NTPC's
changing responsibilities, from a fully investment-oriented enterprise towards a public utility. The
Corporation is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), who is assisted by five full-
time functional Directors in the following areas: Projects, Technical, Operations, Finance, and
Personnel. At the corporate office, Corporate Planning, Central Procurement and Vigilance
functions are headed by Executive Directors reporting to the CMD.  For the purpose of
administration and execution of work at the sites, the Corporation is divided into five regions-
North, West, South, East and National Capital-whose headquarters are located at Allahabad,
Nagpur, Hyderabad, Patna and Delhi, respectively. These regions are under the control of
Regional Executive Directors who are responsible for the implementation and operation and
maintenance of power plants in their respective regions. Each power plant is headed by a General
Manager, reporting to the Regional Executive Director.
8.    NTPC underwent a major organizational change on August 16, 1991, following GOI's
decision to entrust the transrnission assets (operation and maintenance of existing facilities, as well
as those under construction) to the National Power Transmission Corporation, later renamed as
Power Grid Corporation of India, Ltd. (POWERGRID). Subsequently, on January 8, 1993, the
NTPC, NHPC and NEEPCO  (Acquisition and Transfer of Power Transmission Systems)
Ordinance, 1993, promulgated by the President of India, provided for the transfer of transmission
systems of these entities, including all the rights, titles and other interests related to the
transmission systems of each of the corporations retroactively to POWERGRID with effect from
April 1, 1992.
Project Implementation
9.    Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup. Ln.2442-IN was approved by the Board on
June 14, 1984; the Loan Agreement was signed on June 29, 1984. Copies of signed contracts for
the sale of power by NTPC to the States of the Southern (Ramagundam) and Eastern (Farakka)
regions, and the conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the GOI and NTPC,
satisfactory to the Bank, were conditions of loan effectiveness. While a satisfactory subsidiary
loan agreement between GOI and NTPC was signed on September 21, 1984, bulk power supply
contracts between NTPC and the SEBs of the Eastern and Southern regions for the sale of
electricity by NTPC, took a long time to finalize. The last date of effectiveness of the loan had to
be extended four times to enable NTPC to satisfy this condition. The loan finally became effective
on August 30, 1985.

10.   Implementation Schedule. At appraisal, it was estimated that contract awards for the
major pieces of equipment (boiler and turbine-generator) would be signed by March 1985. The
Bank mandated that a proper prequalification should be conducted for the procurement of
turbine-generators to ensure that only those who had adequate capabilities and resources would
participate in the bidding. NTPC agreed to do so after some initial resistance. The process of
complying with this requirement caused a delay of one full year in the implementation of the
project. The contract award for the turbine-generators was made in March 1986. Commnercial
operation of the first unit (Unit 4) was set at appraisal for May 1990, to be followed by the
second unit (Unit 5) one year later, in May 1991. The overall project implementation schedule,
from  contract award for the main packages (boiler and turbine-generator) to commercial
operation, called for an elapsed time of as much as 63 months, which was far above the industry
standard of about 48 months. At this point, however, this matter is of academic interest only
since the two units are yet to be placed in commercial operation. On its part, the Bank should not
have gone to the Board for project approval before the tender documents for the long-lead, main
packages were ready.
11.   Labor unrest and unlawful practices, to the point of being a threat to the safety of the
project staff, were also major factors in the delay suffered by the project. Laborers who worked
in the construction of Stage I of the project, insisted that they must all be rehired for Stage II.
Project Affected Persons (PAP) demanded a much higher rate of compensation for the land
acquired by the project. These gave rise to serious law and order problems. NTPC officers were
insulted, harassed, physically abused and constantly threatened.
12.   Additionally, delayed delivery of construction materials by several contractors, heavier
than normal monsoon, soft soil conditions at the site and a severe cyclone that caused three piling
rigs to collapse, and finally, persistent equipment problems, were responsible for numerous
implementation delays.
13.   Serious operating difficulties were experienced during the commissioning of Unit 4, the
more important of which were as follows:
(a)    Excessive vibration in the turbine-generator during initial operation. The machine
was dynamically balanced,
(b)   Boiler superheater tube failure due to overheating. Operating procedures were
modified to overcome this problem; however, spray water injection to control the
superheat temperature is still excessive;
(c)    Collapse of one of the passes (Pass D) of the electrostatic precipitator under the
load of ash. Foundation and supports are being reinforced at this time.
14.   Procurement. All Bank-financed contracts were procured following ICB procedures.
Consultant services were also funded under the Bank loan. The procurement cycle, starting from
issuing of bid invitation to contract award, was generally too long. Also, there appears to be an
overemphasis on approvals and clearances by different agencies. NTPC, being an autonomous



5
corporation, should make its own decisions for procurement independent of any external
involvement in the process.
15.   Serious difficulties were experienced in the procurement of Generator Transformers (200
kVA, Single-phase, 400 kV) which were ordered on the lowest evaluated bidder from Yugoslavia
(M/s Rade Koncar, Zagreb). Because of political turmoil in that country, the contractor was
unable to perform and fell behind schedule with respect to the promnised delivery. The contract
for three out of seven transformers had to be canceled. The award for the three transformers was
then placed with M/s TELK of India, but they also failed to deliver on time because of delays in
the import of raw materials needed for the manufacture of the transformers.
16.   Transmission Lines and Associated Substations. Even though not funded under the
Bank loan, the associated transmission lines were a part of the project. The following 400 kV
lines were included under the project for the evacuation of power from the Farakka plant:
Line                            Actual Length (ckt. Km)    Date Commissioned

Jeerhat (WBSEB)                                        November 1994
The Durgapur-Jamshedpur line was added after project appraisal and financed by NTPC from its
own internal resources. Since August 1991, the transmission facilities implemented under the
project are being managed by the newly created POWERGRID Ltd. (para. 8).
17.   Project Costs. At appraisal, the total cost of the project, including the transmission
component, contingencies, taxes and duties, interest during construction, and a front-end fee, was
estimated at about Rs. 14,477 million (US$1,340.5 million equivalent at an exchange rate of
US$= Rs. 10.80), of which Rs. 5,627.6 million (US$521.1 million) represented the foreign
exchange cost. The actual cost of the project, including the transmission component and IDC,
was Rs. 21,148 million (US$ 970.1 million equivalent at an average exchange rate of
US$=Rs. 21.80), representing an increase by about 46 percent in rupee terms. An increase of
Rs. 9,754.2 million was due to the devaluation of the rupee with respect to the US dollar. The
cost in dollar terms, however, was about 27.6 percent lower than the appraisal estimate.
18.   Taxes and duties were estimated in the SAR at Rs. 745.2 million (US$69 million
equivalent). It is estimated that taxes and duties paid on the project amounted to Rs. 1,087



6
million (US$ 49.9 million equivalent) including those for the Transmission System. The estimate
in the SAR for interest during construction was Rs. 1,650.8 million (US$148.7 million
equivalent); the actual amount was Rs. 2,025 million (US$ 92.9 million equivalent).
19.   Disbursements. Pursuant to GOI's request, US$ 22 mnillion was canceled from the loan
amount on 5 December 1991 as it was deemed to be in excess of the requirement for project
completion. Another US$ 32.7 rnillion equivalent was canceled at project completion as left over
after disbursements against eligible expenditures were completed. Thus a total of US$ 54.7
million equivalent was canceled from the original loan amount of US$ 300.8 million. The
estimated and actual disbursements under the loan are given in Part III, Table 4. The delays that
occurred at the start of the project, coupled with equipment problems experienced in the power
plant that delayed contract closeout, adversely affected the disbursements. The actual
disbursements were thus later than the appraisal estimates which projected that the loan would be
closed by December 31, 1991. The closing date of the loan had to be extended three times, byone
year each time for the first two extensions and by four months for the last extension, to April 30,
1994, to allow for completion of procurement and disbursements. The revised loan amount of
US$246.1 million equivalent was fully disbursed by September 13, 1994.
20.   Project Financing.  The original Bank loan of US$300.8 million equivalent was
envisaged to provide for about 27 percent of the total project cost of US$ 1,122.8 million, net of
duties and taxes and IDC, but including the capitalized front-end fee. The Bank loan was
expected to cover about 74 percent of the estimated foreign cost of the project to be applied to
the CIF and/or ex-factory costs of the turbine-generator units and associated equipment, power
cycle equipment, cooling water system, coal handling and transportation equipment, electrostatic
precipitators, water treatment plant, ash handling system, condensate polishing equipment, air
compressors, stack elevator, fire fighting equipment, a combustion turbine generating unit for
standby power, instrumentation and control systems, electrical equipment, transmission line
materials, as well as consultants' services.  The balance of the foreign exchange financing
requirement, amounting to US$ 105 million, as well as the local components of some foreign
contracts, such as the boilers and high pressure piping, were to be met through cofinancing,. The
remainder was to be arranged by NTPC through internal cash generation plus equity and loans
from GOI. Financing remained basically in line with the one envisaged at appraisal (Part III,
Table 7B). The final project cost was of US$ 970.1 million equivalent, inclusive of contingencies,
taxes and duties, as well as interest during construction. An equivalent of US$ 54.7 million was
canceled from the loan. The share of the revised Bank financing of US$246.1 million equivalent
translated to 25.4 percent of the total project cost. About US$ 196.9 million equivalent of the
Bank loan was utilized for imports, and the balance of US$ 49.2 million equivalent was used for
financing expenditures in local currency.  Cofinancing was provided by (a) Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau  (KfW), Germany  (DM 50.6  million  or US$  29.1  million  equivalent);
(b) Govermnent of Italy (DM 159.9 million or US$ 91.9 million equivalent); (c) Bankers Trust
Co. (DM 169.1 million or US$ 108.7 million equivalent); (d) Exim Bank of Japan (JPY 10,221
million or US$ 76.6 million equivalent); (e) Other Domestic Loans (Rs. 4708.8 million or US$



7
216 million equivalent); and (f) NTPC's Internal Resources (Rs. 4,397.2 million or US$ 201.7
million equivalent).

The Implementing Agency (NTPC) at the Time of Project Appraisal
21.   NTPC was formed in 1975 to construct and operate large power stations and associated
transmission facilities. It sells bulk power to the SEBs for distribution. At appraisal, NTPC was
in the eighth year of an investment program under which it planned to construct and commission
by 1999/2000, several large power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 26,000 MW and
about 24,000 km of high voltage transmission lines.
22.   NTPC's net earnings in 1983/84 exceeded forecasts and yielded a rate of return (ROR) of
about 11 percent based on historically valued assets. The equivalent ROR on revalued assets,
calculated on a proforma basis, was slightly more than 5 percent. Cash generation measured as a
percentage of average annual capital investment requirements was, however, only about
3 percent, primarily because of the scale of existing operations and a very large investment
program. NTPC's debt-equity ratio at the end of FY84 was 26:74; however, it had serious bill
collection problems at the time. By and large, its overall financial performance in 1983/84 and its
financial position at year end were satisfactory.
NTPC at the Time of Loan Closing
23.   By end FY94, it is estimated that NTPC operated about 18 percent of India's total
installed generating capacity and 26 percent of the thermal capacity. Its share in India's total
power supplies reached about 22 percent of total generation. NTPC has demonstrated that
Government-owned power utilities can also be operated at acceptable efficiency levels.
24.   As a part of the Bank's ongoing dialogue with GOI and NTPC, the Government has
introduced a number of policy reforms aimed at increasing commercialization and efficiency of
NTPC's operations, as well as fostering private sector participation in the generation of power.
These reforms include:  (a) improvement of generating efficiency; (b) transfer of NTPC's



8
transmnission systems and corresponding liabilities, including associated personnel, to the
POWERGRID, created in 1989; (c) introduction of commercial and investment policies that
permit NTPC to cut off power to consumers, whenever physically and technically feasible, for
non-compliance with agreed terms of bulk power supply agreements, while delaying investments
in non-complying states; (d) undertaking projects in one region with a substantial part of the
output allocated to other regions; (e) entering into undertakings with foreign and local private
partners to develop power projects either from its own resources or those offered by others; and
(f) introducing two-part bulk tariff, comprising a fixed-cost part and a variable-cost part, which
allows NTPC to set its tariff under the fixed cost part well in line with the LRMC and pass fuel
price variations to the consumers under the variable part. The fixed-cost part of the tariff will,
however, slowly (in line with inflation) fall below the LRMC as assets are not revalued.
Financial Aspects
25.   NTPC's operating data, summarized in Table 1, reflect the high rate of growth the
Corporation experienced. During the last seven years, from FY88 to FY94, generating capacity
was added continuously at an average annual rate of 26 percent and the value of average net fixed
assets grew at an average annual rate of 29 percent. The level of capital investment, however, has
been stagnant since FY91 (except for an increase in FY92 due to the transfer of Unchahar assets
to NTPC).

27.   At the end of FY94, NTPC was in a relatively strong financial position. Only 47 percent
of its capital structure was funded through long-term borrowing, and 53 percent through equity.
In contrast, the debt capital funding in most power utilities around the world ranges from
60 percent to 80 percent.
28.   NTPC's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been increasing, and at the end of
FY94 about 60 percent of its long-term debt was denominated in foreign currencies. NTPC's net
income is protected from exchange rate and fuel price fluctuations through its cost based tariff
policy. NTPC's return on net average fixed assets in operation (historically valued) declined from
a high of 16 percent in FY88 to 13 percent in FY91 and FY93. The main reason for the decline
was the non-recovery of higher capital costs of 500 MW plants whose output was priced on the
basis of the capital costs of 200 MW plants commissioned earlier. With the notification of revised
tariffs in 1993 the declining trend in the rate of return has been reversed, and in FY94 it climbed
back to 17 percent. The returns achieved were well in excess of the rates required under the
financial covenants (7 percent through FY90 and 9.5 percent during FY91 through FY95). At the
end of FY94, NTPC's debt service coverage was 1.98 and its current ratio was 2.55, indicating
that NTPC had adequate resources to service its long-term debt and to pay off its current
obligations as well.
29.   Billing and collection have been persistent problems for NTPC for a long time, because of
the poor financial situation of many SEBs and the lack of an appropriate contractual framework.
A covenant specifying the level of accounts receivable not to exceed an amount equivalent to the
proceeds of NTPC's sales of power for the two preceding months, was first introduced for NTPC
in FY85 under Ln. 2555-IN, Rihand Power Transmission Project. But because it affected th4e
GOI-Bank-NTPC dialogue even in the context of the Second Farakka Thermal Power Project, it
is included in this PCR.  The covenant has since been repeated in three subsequent loans
(Ln.2674-IN in FY86 and Ln.2644-IN and Ln.2845-IN in FY87), but NTPC was not able to
comply until March 1993. At the end of FY91 NTPC's level of accounts receivable had risen to
5.4 months of sales equivalent. At that time Bank management decided not to exercise the
remedies available under the loan agreements such as suspension of disbursements, partly because
of concern that such action could jeopardize NTPC's ongoing construction program. However,
the Bank decided to cancel in 1990, the processing of a new loan of US$375 million to NTPC
after completion of the negotiations.
30.   To correct the situation, GOI took in June 1990 the special measure of introducing
Central Appropriations (CA) to recover an amount of Rs. 10,205 million of arrears accumulated
as of the end of May 31, 1990 over a period of four years. In February 1992, NTPC acquired the
Unchahar power station from the Governrnent of Uttar Pradesh in lieu of arrears (about Rs 4,800
million) accumulated by UPSEB. In October 1992, GOI agreed to recover an additional amount
of Rs. 7,500 rnillion of arrears through CA over a period of four years. Combined with other bill
collection efforts, NTPC was able to considerably reduce its level of accounts receivable despite
the rapid increase in sales. In FY93, NTPC realized 81 percent of billing in cash from the SEBs
and 91 percent including payments made by GOI through CA. The level of accounts receivable in
terms of months of sales equivalent was about 3.3 months, but excluding the amount still to be
paid through CA it was about 1.4 months of sales equivalent.



10
31.   During the preparation of the NTPC Power Generation Project (Ln.3632-IN), which was
approved in June 1993, GOI adopted new commercial and investment policies for NTPC which
allowed it to shut-off or restrict power to the SEBs in case of non-compliance with agreed terms
of supply. As part of the conditionality agreed under Ln.3632-IN, NTPC was to conclude new
Bulk Power Supply Agreements and tariffs had to be notified for all stations. The lack of a
transparent and agreed basis of billing between NTPC and the SEBs had been the cause of several
billing disputes, but in April 1994, NTPC had, for the first time in its history, commnercial
contracts in place for all its power stations. Under Ln.3632-IN, the Bank also agreed for the
purpose of monitoring compliance with the two months accounts receivable covenant, to exclude
the amounts still due from CA. However, during the first three months of FY94 (April to June
1993), NTPC bill collection performance dropped again to about 72 percent and there was little
evidence that NTPC was applying the newly adopted commercial policies by regulating power to
defaulting SEBs. On October 21, 1993, the Bank advised GOI that unless NTPC's level of
accounts receivable was brought down to 2 months of sales equivalent by January 15, 1994, the
Bank would, with effect from that date, suspend India's rights to make withdrawals from Ln.
2844-IN (National Capital Power project) and from the generation component of Ln.2845-IN
(Talcher Thermal Project) until NTPC was in compliance with the agreed receivable covenant.
NTPC was also informed that Ln.3236-IN would not be declared effective until NTPC was in
compliance with the receivable covenant. Ln.2442-IN and Ln.2674-IN were excluded because
the former did not include the accounts receivable clause and under the latter, which was closed
on December 31, 1993, final disbursements were already being processed. On February 2, 1994,
the Bank agreed to keep formal suspension actions in abeyance up to May 1994, in recognition of
NTPC's progress in dealing with its bill collection problems and its application of the new
commercial policies, while GOI and NTPC agreed to refrain from submitting withdrawal
applications under Ln.2844 and 2845-IN (including POWERGRID under Ln.2845-IN).
32.   From July 1993 to March 1994, realization of current bills (excluding the amounts
recovered through CA) improved to 98 percent and in the last three months of FY94, it was
105 percent. Total realization of current bills improved to 92 percent for FY94. Another round
of CA to recover arrears accumulated since 1992 was approved in May 1994 and this, combined
with improved bill collection and better application of the new commercial policies, led to the
Bank lifting the above mentioned informal suspension and declaring Ln.3236-IN effective on June
6, 1994. Although relations between the Bank and NTPC have been tense at times, the Bank's
persistence on commercial behavior by NTPC have led to positive results and is, in fact, much
appreciated now by NTPC. Although not all problems have been resolved in the Northern region
and another warning had to be issued by the Bank in October 1994, the cumulative realization of
current bills for the period April to December 1994 has been 102 percent and the level of
accounts receivable (excluding the amount still to be recovered through CA) was 1.7 months of
sales equivalent.
33.   Combination of improved accounts receivable position and a stagnant investment program
resulted in a better self-financing ratio for NTPC in FY94. Since FY90 the self-financing ratio has
been improving steadily, and in FY94, contribution of internal funds to capital expenditure (3-year
average) was 47.6 percent, well above the 20 percent required in the covenant introduced in the
NTPC Power Generation Project loan. This also brings out a flaw in the self-financing ratio



11
requirement which simply considers the ratio of internal cash generation to investment needs, and
if the investments are not growing the ratio may not be that meaningful.
34.   The financial strength of NTPC has put them in a position to raise funds in both the
domestic and international markets. Currently NTPC has the financial capability to accelerate the
implementation of its investment program, but so far NTPC has not exploited this opportunity to
expand its assets base.
Comparison with Second Farakka Thermal Power Project SAR Forecasts
35.   One striking feature of the financial projections in the SAR was the declining level of
capital expenditure after FY90 resulting in decline of both work in progress and total fixed assets.
NTPC's actual investments in the 1990s have been relatively constant, and significantly more than
the SAR projections. According to the SAR forecasts, total requirement of external funds would
have been less and less each year, and after FY93 no new external funds would have been
required to be raised through equity financing or external borrowing-enough cash would be
generated internally to meet the requirements for working capital, debt servicing and diminishing
investments.
36.   In reality, NTPC's investment program has been much more expensive than envisaged in
the SAR. Although NTPC's net income every year was more than the forecast, substantial
increase in inventories due to operational requirements and in accounts receivable due to poor bill
collection increased its current assets much more than forecasts (almost eight times in FY94).
Therefore, NTPC could not use all of its operational income to fund its investment needs, and
equity funding as well as external borrowing were necessary.  Borrowing levels were
consequently much higher than the SAR forecasts, and more so in the later years when the
investment program was projected to taper off. However, due to lower interest rates in the late
80s and the 90s, debt service became significantly less.
37.   Although NTPC's investment program was more ambitious than what was envisaged in
the SAR, delays in project implementation caused the investments to be capitalized behind
schedule. During the projection period fixed assets were generally lower than SAR. Total fixed
assets in FY94 were comparable to forecasts, but a larger portion was work in progress.
Improved plant operations (plant availability, plant load factor, etc.) allowed NTPC to generate
electricity more efficiently. In FY94, while its net fixed assets were 25 percent lower than
forecasts, NTPC's electricity generation was 2 percent higher.  But operating costs were
83.7 percent higher because of a 270 percent increase in fuel costs combined with a 45 percent
increase in costs of operation and maintenance. Since NTPC's tariffs are cost-based, average bulk
tariff was 63 percent higher. Operating income before interest was about the same as forecast,
and because of lower interest charges for external borrowing net profit was higher.
38.   NTPC's rate of return on historic assets ranged from  12.7 percent (in FY85) to
17.0 percent (in FY87), and it is in compliance with the rate of return covenant (7 percent FY85-
90, 9.5 percent FY91-95). On this project, there was no covenant for accounts receivable; it was
added to subsequent NTPC projects. However, poor bill collection adversely affected NTPC's
potential for further growth and expansion. The unsatisfactory bill collection problem not only



12
reduced NTPC's self-financing ratio, but growing concerns over the mounting arrears had forced
the Bank to informally suspend disbursements on existing loans and delay approval of fresh loans
to finance new plants in NTPC's investment program.
39.   In summary, although NTPC's operational and financial performance has been generally
satisfactory, it fell short in a number of areas. The reasons are several-there have been delays in
project implementation leading to lower levels of assets; lags in proper tariff notification have led
to lower revenues; problems in bill collection and maintaining a larger inventory of spare parts
have limited NTPC's internal contribution to new investment; while NTPC had occasional
problems receiving external financial assistance as well as raising capital in domestic markets
which further eroded its capacity expansion program.
40.   Merit Order Dispatch. In order to derive a merit order for generation dispatch purposes
it is usual to rank generating units in order of their short run marginal costs: the costs of
production excluding fixed charges associated with meeting capital requirements, operation and
maintenance costs and other fixed costs which would exist whether the units generate or not. The
cost for such scheduling purposes should only be the cost of producing the next kWh of output.
All other costs will have to be met whether or not the machine generates. In accordance with a
GOI notification, for each centrally owned power station within the Regional Electricity Boards,
the various SEBs are allocated a portion of its output. The tariff associated with the total output
of each station is set in the said GOI notification. These tariffs are notionally two part tariffs set
in terms of a capacity charge and an energy charge. However, the way these tariffs operate is
such as to make them appear as one part tariffs based on energy taken by the SEBs. Furthermore,
this apparent energy charge does not relate solely to the short run marginal cost of the stations;
instead it lumps together capital items with marginal operating cost items which makes the cost of
the next kWh of production, as seen from the SEBs, appear to be high in relation to their own real
short run cost of production. The result is that it is cheaper for the SEBs to generate on their
own inefficient units rather than to import from central stations. This anomaly needs to be
removed as early as possible.
Environment, Resettlement and Rehabilitation
41.   At appraisal, the resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) aspects of the project were not
formally addressed. The R&R issues had to be revisited again based on Bank guidelines that
require the Project Affected Persons (PAP) to be compensated for their losses and rehabilitated
such that former living standards and income capacity were at least restored. The Bank and NTPC
agreed in 1993 under the NTPC Power Generation Project (Ln.3632-IN), that is towards the end
of the Farakka II project, that NTPC would appoint consultants to conduct a socioeconomic
study of the Project Affected Families, and carry out R&R of the PAPs, in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank, through an agreed "Retrofit" program. The purpose of this program is to ensure
economic rehabilitation of the PAPs through income generation. Community outreach programs
have been given special emphasis under this retrofit program. Annex-B provides details of this
plan.

Project Results
42.   Overall, the project has met some of its important objectives of  (a) assisting in the
establishment of regional power systems, that would eventually lead to a national grid;
(b) developing sector organization and policies for the operation of regional and national power
systems; and (c) creating long-range national power development planning capability. However,
the principal physical objective of meeting the electricity demand in the Eastern Region of India
has not yet been fully realized because of equipment problems.
43.   The covenanted requirement for NTPC to reduce receivables to less than two months of
billing, which was finally accomplished towards the close of the project on current billing, helped
NTPC improve its financial standing.
44.   The literacy rate in the region covered by the project was very low.  It was even lower
than the average literacy rate in rural West Bengal. In the villages of Bihar, the condition was
worse. In all these villages, drinking water resources were meagre and communication facilities
poor. As a part of this project, a number of schools were constructed in the villages while the
existing ones were renovated, funds were provided to set up libraries, more than 50 drinking
water wells were dug, roads were upgraded and drainage facilities were improved.
45.   Economic Rate of Return.  Assuming that the power generating units would be
stabilized and placed in unrestricted commercial operation as soon as the current equipment
problems are resolved, benefits of the power station providing expansion of generating capacity in
the Eastern Regional System have been quantified based on the capital costs of the investment
program (covering generation, transmission and distribution) together with incremental operating
and fuel costs, as shown in Part III, Table 8. The benefits of the investment program relate mainly
to the incremental consumption which they make possible. A mihimum measure of benefits,
ignoring consumer surplus, was then derived from incremental sales revenue based on the average
retail tariffs in the Region (Re. 0.84/kWh) representing the minimum willingness to pay for
electricity. On this basis, the minimum economic rate of return (ERR) achieved is 17 percent, as
against an appraisal estimate of about 13 percent based on Re. 0.6 1/kWh average retail tariff
46.   Project Sustainability. The project is sustainable for the following reasons:  (a) the
demand for the output of power from the plant exists in the region; and (b) the current tariff
setting procedures and tariffs are adequate enough to permit recovery of capital and operating
costs. The new two-part tariffs, which were introduced November 1, 1992, should serve to
reinforce incentives to operate the plant efficiently and with high availability. However, repairs to
the equipment need to be completed expeditiously and the plant returned to operation with
acceptable reliability standards.
Bank Performance
47.   The performance of the Bank from project preparation through project completion was by
and large satisfactory.  The Bank had good relations with the beneficiary throughout the
execution of the project and fostered an environment conducive to increased Bank interaction



14
with NTPC. However, NTPC's unsatisfactory accounts receivable position and its failure to meet
the associated covenants under the loans, should have been dealt with more firnly and remedies
under the ongoing loan agreements invoked much earlier on to correct the situation. Violation of
loan covenants, especially those dealing with the financial health of the beneficiary, should be
addressed immediately as they occur and with firm, action-oriented plans for ensuring compliance
as soon as possible. To date, the Bank Group has assisted NTPC in implementing in all 15
projects, with a total loan of about US$4 billion. These operations provided enough leverage to
the Bank to strengthen the institutional and financial viability of NTPC through firm actions.
48.   The Bank has also continued to address a number of shortcomings of broader sectoral
concern in the operations of NTPC, with appreciable success. The major items are:
(a)    Transformation of NTPC from a construction-oriented organization to one of the
largest generating utilities in the developing world;
(b)   Introduction of two-part tariff, to help mobilization of resources from internal cash
generation to finance investment programs. However, the intended benefit has not
yet been derived due to global accounting system exercised through the regional
SEBs, as described in para. 32, which is an obstacle to merit order dispatching. A
study has been made as a part of POWERGRID operations and its
recommendations are to be implemented through the POWERGRID System
Development Project (Ln.3577-IN; FY93);
(c)   Implementation of the new commercial and investment policies, agreed under Ln.
3632-IN (FY93);
(d)   Adoption of a more comprehensive and up-front approach towards environmental
protection and R&R issues. An Environmental Action Plan, aimed to complement
earlier efforts, has already been drawn up for other power projects.
Borrower Performance
49.   Part III, Table 1, contains the review of performance of the Borrowers and the
Implementing Agencies. The performance of GOI was less than satisfactory because of the delay
in according investment approval of the project. Performance of NTPC was satisfactory in
respect of compliance with covenants, as the one requiring receivables to be reduced to less than
60 days of billing was not part of the conditions of Ln.2442-IN.
50.   The performance of NTPC in project implementation was generally satisfactory. The
equipment problems experienced by the plant were beyond NTPC's control. However, the review
process of design parameters as well as detailed design bases for the plant equipment are in
question. Specifically, there was no reason for the electrostatic precipitator supporting structure
to collapse, had it been designed properly to withstand the load of ash in the first place.
51.   Positive contributions by NTPC to the project consisted of the following:  (a) key
operation and maintenance personnel, including the engineering and managerial staff were given
intensive training and involved in the installation of the equipment during the construction phase



15
of the project, with a sharp focus on the preoperational phases of activity such as planning, design
and construction; (b) the senior management and site management of NTPC worked closely on
the coordination and monitoring of headquarters and field activities, equipment supplies,
transport, erection services and commissioning; and (c) a sound reporting system and supervision
strategy was established and daily reports from various fronts were obtained. The analysis of
these reports provided the right tool to intervene appropriately to avoid delays.
Project Relationship
52.   Despite some inevitable tensions created by the debate over receivables covenanted under
loans subsequent to Ln.2442-IN, the Bank's relationship with NTPC and with the GOI was
generally good.
Consulting Services
53.   The engineering and design of the project, as well as construction management, were
carried out by NTPC with its own in-house expertise, with minimal support from the Consultants,
Black & Veatch International (BVI), in association with Desein of India. The review of detailed
engineering was undertaken by BVI. From the initiation of the project till completion, project
engineering review meetings, development of the detailed equipment specifications, and final
layouts were held regularly in NTPC's offices in New Delhi. Later these review meetings were
also extended to the site to resolve site specific questions
Project Documentation and Data
54.   The project's legal arrangements adequately reflected the Bank's interests in achieving the
objectives of the project. The SAR of the project provided a very useful framework for both the
Bank and the Borrower during project implementation.
55.   NTPC regularly submitted quarterly progress reports for the project. These have been
used for review of physical and financial performance as well as for planning the visits of the
supervision missions to India which often included site visits in addition to review meetings at
NTPC's corporate headquarters in New Delhi.
56.   NTPC has provided a completion report for the project and subsequent additional financial
information. The NTPC report consisted of the first draft of Parts I and III of the report based on
which this Implementation Completion Report has been finalized.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
FARAKKA - II TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2442-IN)
PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. COMMENTS BY NTPC
Project Obiective
1.    The main objective of Second Farakka Thermal Power Project was to provide
additional least-cost thermal capacity in the Eastern Region to help in gradually
eliminating power shortages in India in general and in the Eastern Region in particular.
At the time of project preparation, the Eastern Region was experiencing a severe
shortage of capacity and energy which had led to widespread rationing and permanent
overloading of existing thermal units.
Both Unit-i and Unit-2 (500 MW) have been synchronized and have already
started supplying much needed power to Eastern region on sustained basis.
The declaration of commercial operation of the units has been delayed due to
design/operational problems experienced with few critical equipments during
stabilization period, after synchronization of the unit. Many of these problems have
already been set right and balance are likely to be sorted out with suppliers shortly.
The proposal to declare Unit-II commercial w.e.f. May 1, 1995 is under active
consideration of management while Unit-I is expected to achieve commercial operation
from March 1996 (after repair of D pass of electrostatic Precipitator).
The second Farakka Thermal Project is thus on its way to achieve the main
objectives of supplying additional least cost power to Eastern Region through
commercial operation of the two 500 MW units.
Project Design
2.    Right from inception, NTPC had adopted as an organizational objective of
achievement of self sufficiency in the design and engineering of large thermal power
stations. In this respect NTPC had already acquired adequate experience in the area of
I /    Comments by NTPC and POWERGRID were endorsed by GOI and sent to the Bank with GOI's
letter dated August 16, 1995, which was received at Bank Headquarters in mid-October 1995.



17
station design and engineering of 500 MW units at Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam.
This experience was gainfully utilized by NTPC by way of successful design and
engineering of the second Farakka project in-house, with very limited support from
Indian consultants in few areas.
The technical specification for various packages and detailed design review of
the project were similar to those followed in other NTPC stations and were also in line
with the general practices followed by other power utilities world over for construction
of such projects.
Project Implementation
3.    At appraisal, the commercial operation of Unit I (500 MW) was scheduled in
May, 1990 followed by Unit II (500 MW) after an interval of one year. However,
Unit I was synchronized in September, 1992, and the Unit II in February, 1994
respectively. It is evident from the list of main reasons given below which contributed
towards the delay in timely completion of the project, that many of them were beyond
NTPC control. These reasons were:
(a)   There was a shift of one year in award of turbine Generator  (TG)
package mainly because of the requirement of the World Bank for
prequalification of bidders, being the first TG package procurement
under ICB procedure.
(b)   NTPC was forced to procure three numbers Generator Transformers
against 7 nos. ordered on M/s Rade Koncar Zagrev from M/s TELK
India (with concurrence of the Bank) as Rade Koncar was not in a
position to supply these transformers due to political turmoil in
Yugoslavia. The Indian supplier also could not supply transformers in
time because of delay in the import of raw materials.
(c)   Soft soil conditions at the project site which caused frequent mud slides
during excavation and the need for continuous dewatering operations.
(d)   Accident during piling operations, when three piling rigs overturned and
two other rigs suffered damage during a severe cyclone, which delayed
completion of the Circulation Water System.
(e)   Steep rise in the international price of steel after the contract was
awarded to the winning bidder (Romanian), as a result of which the
contract had to be re-negotiated.

Operating Experience
4.    The Unit I was synchronized in September 1992. But stabilization of this unit
was delayed due to vibration problem in the turbine and problems encountered during
the commissioning of TDBFPs. After overcoming these problems, when the load on
this unit was being raised, difficulty was experienced in maintaining rated main steam
temperatures (540C) inspite of resorting to superheat sprays much higher than design
values. On one occasion the main steam temperature rose as high as 601C leading to
severe distortion of coils of all 54 No. Final superheater assemblies. In order to repair
these final superheater coils, the unit had to be takeh under shut down in August 1993.
After completing the repair work, the unit touched full load first time in November
1993 for a short duration. Data were collected during various operating modes by M/s
B&W, Canada for flexibility analysis of superheater coils. The trial operation of this
unit was planned to be completed by March 1994 after the test run in January 1994.
However, when the preparations for the test runs were under advanced stage, there was
an unfortunate incidence of collapse of pass D of electrostatic precipitator in January
1994 which upset the schedule. An arrangement has been made with Ansaldo for the
expeditious restoration of pass D of ESP in Unit I and strengthening of ESP structures
based on the study of ESP-I pass D collapse. Action plan to achieve Unit I commercial
operation in March 1996 is presented in Annex I2
5.    Unit II was synchronized in February 1994 and the unit was operated in March
1994 for a brief period. The unit was shut down as a measure of abundant precaution,
to carry out the modifications in ESP, based on the recommendations from the analysis
of ESP Unit I pass D collapse (which took place in January 1994) before proceeding
for trial operation. NTPC sent their design Engineers to Italy on two occasions to
expedite and finalize the drawings required for strengthening the ESP structures. The
drawings were released by Ansaldo progressively upto August 1994.  The critical
strengthening works were completed and the unit was brought back on bar in
September 1994. Similar to Unit I, Unit II steam generators also suffered from the
problem of very high superheat sprays (250 to 300 Tonne per hour at full load) in order
to maintain rated main steam temperatures.  Such high superheat sprays are not
desirable as (a) it affects the turbine heat rate and (b) it can lead to depositions on
turbine blades.
6.    Inspite of limitation of high superheat sprays, the Unit II could be operated
continuously at high loads for 14 days (including 72 hours operation at or near full
load), thus fulfilling the requirement of successful completion of trial operation. The
proposal to declare the Unit II commercial w.e.f. May 1, 1995 is under active
consideration of management.

7.    Performance data from the existing instrumentation has been collected by B&W,
Canada to ascertain the reasons for such high superheat sprays. In order to collect
more precise test grade data to comprehensively evaluate actual thermal performance of
boilers vis-a-vis designed/anticipated performance, it is planned to conduct thermal
performance testing on Unit II boilers alongwith contractual performance guarantee
tests.   The procedure for conducting thermal performance test and evaluation
methodology is being tied up with Ansaldo/B&W. Based on the data collected from
thermal performance testing, modifications if any, required to reduce superheat sprays
to design values will be worked out. As regards, performance guarantee testing a
series of meetings have been held with Ansaldo to finalize the test procedures. During
the last meeting in May 1995, Ansaldo agreed to submit the revised procedure after
incorporating NTPC comments by 30th June, 1995.
Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance
8.    Considering the industrial relation situation in the region, NTPC has set for
itself a tight time schedule of commissioning 500 MW units within 5 years from the
date of order of the main plant equipment. To achieve this objective, NTPC had
applied its Integrated Project Management and Control System (IPMCS) in this project.
While the use of the project management system and close monitoring had assisted
NTPC in commissioning its units in other projects either on time or in some cases,
even ahead of schedule, in the case of Farakka stage II power project, even though the
proven project management system was adopted and critical contracts were awarded to
experienced contractors, who had carried out similar jobs on other projects, there were
delays in commissioning of the units due to reasons beyond the control of NTPC as
discussed above under project implementation. Thus in spite of all the timely efforts
taken by NTPC, the progress of the project was adversely affected. Leaving aside the
delays in completion of the project, the perfornance of NTPC is considered to be
satisfactory to meet the expectations of the World Bank and was in line with project
guidelines outlined in the Bank's Appraisal report.
9.    Few of the lessons learned from operational experience of Farakka  stage II
units and other 500 MW units at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Rihand are
discussed below:
(a)   Boiler Furnace Sizing
All the 500 MW boilers installed at various NTPC stations suffered from the problem
of high superheat/reheat sprays, overheating of low temperature superheaters, lack of
operational flexibility etc.
In order to precisely pinpoint the reasons for such high superheat sprays, a test plan
was jointly worked out with suppliers to evaluate thermal Performance of boilers at
Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Rihand. The study revealed that root cause of the
problem in all these boilers could essentially be attributed to less than designed heat



20
absorption in furnace water wall. Based on the results of these tests modification plans
(within practical limitations of implementing modifications on already installed boilers)
were worked out for all these boilers and implemented.
It was quite evident from these studies that the over estimation of heat absorption by
designers was either due to (a) lack of sufficient data with suppliers about the heat
absorption pattern of Indian coal and/or (b) over exuberance on the part of supplier to
cut costs by reducing furnace size.
This operational experience made NTPC wiser and all out efforts were made to develop
in-house expertise to check furnace sizing with special reference to Indian coal. These
efforts proved successful and now NTPC has a proven computer model for review of
boiler heat transfer surface areas.
Using this model, even before the starting of Farakka Stage II boilers, it could be
ascertained that Farakka stage II boiler will also suffer from the problem of high
superheat sprays. NTPC findings in this respect were communicated to Ansaldo in
1992 itself and since then dialogue has been started with Ansaldo for carrying out
necessary modifications to eliminate the problem.
In view of In-house capability of NTPC to check boiler pressure parts sizing it will be
possible for NTPC to ensure that such problems are not repeated in future boilers.
(b)   ESP pass D collapse
The lessons learned from the detailed investigation of unfortunate incidence of collapse
of D pass of ESP of unit-I of Farakka are being used to improve upon operational
practices, review of Technical Specifications and detailed engineering practices.
(c)   Industrial Relations
Further lessons in the area of Industrial relations/climate learned during construction of
Farakka Stage II projects would be of immense use to NTPC to avoid adverse
industrial relation situation in the implementation of the ongoing as well as the
forthcoming projects.
(d)   Training
NTPC has recognized both managerial and technical training as one of the most
important aspects of organizational development. It is significant that Farakka Stage I
power project assisted by the Bank included procurement of a full scope 500 MW
thermal power plant training simulator to be installed at Korba. The Korba project also
has a 200 MW training sirnulator. This has been very useful in training of power plant
operators and technicians and has contributed significantly in efficient and reliable
operation of NTPC's power plants.



21
(e)   Procurement
Based on experience of Farakka Stage II, NTPC is further equipped to plan its
activities in the area of procurement, expediting and local clearances in line with
various World Bank's stipulations.
Evaluation of Performance of the Bank and Cofinanciers
10.   Second Farakka Thermal Power Project was taken up for implementation by
NTPC after a series of large thermal power projects (e.g. at Singrauli, Korba,
Ramagundam) and it is the second in the Eastern Power region of the country. The
assistance extended by the Bank contributed substantially in bringing the project to
fruition. The project was supervised closely and an adequate number of site visits
under supervision mission were made. Excellent cooperation existed between the Bank
staff and NTPC during the implementation of the project. In fact this relationship
continued to grow and to date Bank group has extended financial assistance to NTPC
for the implementation of 15 projects. This includes the assistance provided by the
Bank for NTPC Power Generation Project approved in June 1993.  With the
association of Bank for Farakka Stage II project, the Bank group has been involved in
the Farakka project for a total capacity of 1600 MW.
11.   Thus it may be seen that since the initial decade of development, Bank and
NTPC had developed an intimate relationship. The Bank has endeavored to support
NTPC in each step of its development in a manner that goes much beyond the
substantial financial assistance extended to support NTPC's expansion plan.
12.   Other than the Bank, financing was also provided by the Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufau (KfW, Germany), Italian assistance, Banker's Trust Co. and Exim Bank
of Japan.  The balance of the project cost was met from  GOI loans and equity
contributions as well as by NTPC from its internal resources.
Plan for the Operational Phase of the Plant
13.   Farakka Thermal Power Project has a built in advantage of assured coal supply
and relatively lower incremental cost of generation and thus this station will basically
operate to work as base load station.  High availability of the unit all associated
auxiliaries and sub-systems is one of the main Operation & Maintenance objective for
ensuring high PLF and low partial loading.
14.   Second Farakka Thermal Power Project is planned for power supply to states in
the Eastern Region. Power generated at the station will be transmitted over the 400 kV
AC/DC transmission lines of PowerGrid associated with the project and the
interconnected transmission networks of the State Electricity Boards in the region. It is
expected that the regional transmission systems will operate in an interconnected



22
manner with each state limiting its drawal to the extent of its allocations from the
various central generating stations.
15.   The operations of various generating stations has to be regulated in accordance
with the system requirements. NTPC sells power in bulk to SEBs and power supply
agencies with sizable generating capacity of their own, leading to conflicting priorities
for backing down generation during periods of low system demand. The super thermal
stations of NTPC located at pit-heads have relatively low fuel costs and it would be in
the national interest to operate these stations at base-load. It is NTPC's endeavor to
adopt suitable measures which allow base-load operation of its stations by encouraging
SEBs to reduce generation at their stations with higher marginal cost or by conserving
energy in hydroelectric reservoirs.
16.   It has been observed that in case of Stage I of the station, though the station is
operating at a high level of efficiency, the off take of power from the station has been
erratic. West Bengal's off take has been much lower than the allocation. As such,
most of the power is being absorbed by other states of the Region. It may be noted
here that it has been established that though the high voltage transmission facility is
capable of transmitting the power that would be generated from Farakka (1600 MW),
the capability of the sub-transmission and distribution has to be improved.
Alternatively, unused power would have to be transmitted to other regions. NTPC has
addressed this issue in association with Powergrid and Eastern Region Electricity
Board.
17.   NTPC gives utmost importance to operational performance of its power plants.
Several performance indicators covering efficiency aspects, leading to high level of
generation are used to monitor the operations of the power stations. The heat rate,
specific oil and specific coal consumption (i.e. fuel consumed per unit generation of
electricity), auxiliary power consumption etc. for efficiency monitoring, and
availability factor and plant load factor are used to monitoring the availability aspects.
Annual targets are set station wise and unit wise and performance is monitored with
respect the targets. NTPC has been performing at much higher levels as compared to
All India performance of thermal power sector.
Adequacv and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part-III
18.   Part III of the PCR prepared by the Bank includes statistical data covering
various aspects of construction and operation of the projects. The factual information
relating to NTPC, contained in this section is generally based on the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) prepared by the Bank for the project, discussions between Bank and
NTPC during various supervision missions and quarterly project(s) progress reports
submitted by NTPC. The project cost details are based on actual expenditures already
incurred and estimates of the expenditure on balance works to be completed. The

actual datas vis-a-vis schedules agreed with the GOI is given at Annexure 23.
B. COMMENTS BY POWERGRID
Preface
19.          The loan was made to India in June 1984 for on-lending to the National
Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The objectives of the project were (a) to meet
the electricity demand in the Eastern Region by providing the transmission linkage
between the second stage of the thermal power generation plant at Farakka and the
main load centers of the eastern region; (b) to ensure the evacuation of power from
these plants at least cost to the economy and (c) to enable the development of the
regional power systems, which will lead ultimately to a national grid, and to assist in
the development of the Indian power sector. On August 16, 1991 the management of
the [transmission] project was transferred from NTPC to National Power Transmission
Corporation Ltd. (NPTC), under a management contract signed by the two
corporations. On January 8, 1993 an ordinance providing for all the rights, titles and
other interests related to the transmission systems of NTPC to be transferred to
POWERGRID (NPTC was later renamed as Power Grid Corporation of India) was
promulgated by the President of India.
Environment. Resettlement and Rehabilitation
20.   In the context of transmission projects there is no significant impact on
environment except in case where the transmission lines involve any forest area, in
which case the impact is reversible by planting more trees. While identifying the
transmission system, detailed surveys were conducted by executing agency to identify
most suitable route having minimum infringement on forest land. Where trees had to
be felled in order to provide access to the lines, trees of a corresponding number were
planted in the vicinity as per guidelines from Ministry of Environment and Forests.
The question of relocation of people affected by the project did not arise because
transmission line routes and substation sites were selected in uninhabited areas.
Final Payments
21.   The loan was originally scheduled to be closed on December 31, 1991. Due to
reasons which were beyond the control of executing agency the implementation of the
project was delayed. After appraising the scheme, Bank had decided to extend the loan
closing date thrice and final closing date was fixed as April 1994.  The total
disbursements of loan till September 1994 were 75.18. Further, it is proposed to the
3/    Reproduced in the following as Annex II to Part II. The dates given in this Annex (with GOI
letter of August 16, 1995) are slightly different than those collected by the PCR mission in November
1994.

Bank to fund the balance requirements of US$ 3.50 million under Talcher-I
Transmission project (Loan 2845-IN).
Procurement
22.   The equipment and materials financed under the loan were procured under
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines.
The model bidding document used here will be used for bidding in other World Bank
financed projects which is expected to cut down substantially the time lag experienced
in previous projects.
Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance
23.   The project has overall achieved its objectives.  The project has been an
important component in the establishment of centrally owned regional grid. With the
satisfactory completion of the project the power transmission capacity, security and
reliability in the Eastern Region has increased. Since NTPC had already acquired
sufficient experience in the area of design and engineering of 400 kV transmission lines
and substations, entire basic and detailed engineering work for the 400 kV transmission
lines and substations were carried out by NTPC/POWERGRID in-house. The project
also provided an opportunity for NTPC/POWERGRID to gain valuable experience in
procurement under ICB procedures, which was later used for other Bank financed
projects.

Farakka II Project
Site Seiec:ion:
I.    Located in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal. the projec: site is about 300 km north
of Calcutta. It consists of 2 x 500 MNfW coal-fired generating units, and about 640 km of
associated. high voltage transmission lines. Power plant site selection is influenced by three
imDor-ant fac;ors;-avaiiabilitv of ELLel, abundance of cooling water, and proximiyr to the load
center  In this case, instead of being a mine-mouth plant in accordance with the GOI strategy
(parr 1. para.21), coal is transported to the plant fro-m the Hura block of the Rajmahal Coalfields
which is a long distance awav. Coolins water is drawn from the Farakka barrage; there is no
certainrt that the quantum of water offake could be sustained over the life of the power plant.
Farak-ka is far awa' from the load center. It appears, thererore. that technical and economic
ments wvere secondarv to other extraneous considerations in the selection of this oarticular site.
Cornrriimenr
2.     Law and Order has been a serious problem at the selected project site.  There were
demands by rhe local labor force and Project Affected Persons (P.AP) for the rizht to work on the
project and larger compensation packages respectivelv   Violent agitation became common.
Constant harassment of NTPC oficials. sometimes involving phvsical violence. could not be
contained bv the law enforcement authorities.
Imrnlefeentation
3      Problems which contrnbuted to delays in project implementation were as follows:
(a)    Prequalificauon requirements for the turbine generator contract needed to be
satisfied bv NTPC, as mandated by the Bank. The 500 NMW units were the first of
their kind being procured under ICB and it was necessary to ensure that invitations
to bid were extended to those bidders only who had adequate capabilities and
resources. This accounted for about one year's delav;
(b)    Hea-vy monsoon in the area, which caused numerous work interruptions;
(c)    The bearing capacitv of the soil was lower than expected. Pile lenzths had to be
changed from 20 m to 27 m;
(d)    Collapse of three piling rigs and damage to two other ries during a severe cyclone;
(e)    The level of the selected project site required 3 m of back.filling to bring it up to
the design plinth level;
(f)    Construc.ion power supply was unreliable, which sufered several interruptions
during working hours;
(g)    Poor infrastructure in the region did not support free access or movement of
materials to the site;

Annex A
(h)    Vendors, Cotrac-ors `-iling zo deliver rnateriais on time;
(i)    Generator Transf-ormn.ers ordered on a Yuzoslavian firrn were only partly delivered,
with consideraoie delay, due to political turmoil in that countrv. The balance of
the equiDme-t had to be reordered on an Indian firm, but even they failed to
deliver on time due to problems in importing raw materials;
(j)    Steep rise in the interrational price of steel after the contract for Structural Steel
u-as awarded to the winnrinz bidder (PZomanian), as a result of which the contract
had to be renezotiated. Also, there was significant delay in openinz the Letter of
Credit for the irr,orted steel from Romania;
(k)    Delav bv the contrac-or in delivering Boiler Feed Pumps, properly tested at the
factor-v befvore disoatch;
(I)    Slow proaress of installatiorn of the turbine-generators and power cvcle piping;
(m)   Delaved deliverv bv contractors of coal handling plant equipmernt, ash handlinsz
plant equipment, and instrumenzation and controls system;
(n)    Vibration of the rurbine-generator unit, which took a Iong time to rectify;
(o)    Damage to suneri-eater tubes of Urnit 4 during corminissioning (see para. 4 below);
(p)    Failure of the Electrostatic Precipitator in Unit 4 when the support structure
collacsec bv the weight of the ESP, with its hoppers full of ash (see para. 5
below).
4.     The boiler specification called for a very low eas velocirv in the convection passes and a
low furnace heat release rate. To comply with this requirement, the Contractor designed the
fumace with a shortened arch. Also, at NiTPC's insistence, the contractor compromised its
standard design of steam cooled wrao-around and spacer tubes in the superheater section by
eliminating them. As a result, the superheaters overheated and suffered metallurzical failure. The
Contractor has been blaming this on maloperation. Meanwhile, the start up procedure has been
revised and the final stearn temperature reduced from 540 C to 5200 C. The mechanics of failure
is still under investigation. The effiect of stearn temperature reduction by 20 is a penalty of more
than 1% in the operating efficiency of the units over the life of the plant. NTPC snould not accept
steam temperature reduction as a permanent solution to this problem.
5.     The D Pass of ESP 4 collapsed on Januarv 15, 1994 under unsustainable load conditions.
The C Pass colurrmns and structures of the ESP also sustained significant damage. Overloading
has been established as the primary cause of this failure. The technical explanation of the collapse
is still under preparation by the equipment manufacturers. Meanwhile, extensive structural
strengthening of the ESPs has been carried out in both urnits. Unit 4 was back on line on January
10, 1995 with two passes ofthe ESP in oceration initially; the third pass was commissioned on
Januarv 24, 1995  Unit 5 was back in service on September 26, 1994 after its ESP supporting
structures were strengrhened.

RFS_T'LEMEMT AND P>HARILITATrON PEMEi IAL ACTLOALPLLN:  NTPC carried out i n
1990 and 1991, a socio-economic study on the status of PAFs. The study was
not satisfactory to the Bank, and under Loan 3632-IN for the NTFC Power
Generation Project. agreement was reached with NTPC for a P.emedial Action
Plan i.e. "Retrofit' with the objective of restoring the economic base of the
PAFs.
Because the World Bank found the initial IIM study to be inadequate, NTPC re-
commissioned the socio-economic study to refine the land acquisition case
lists, to identity concentrations of PAFs in the affected villages. to determine
baseline socioeconomic conditions, and provide recommendations for the
ReAP. NTPC contracted the Indian School of Social Welfare and Business
Management (ISSW8M, Calcutta) and the Xavier Institute of Social Science
(XISS, Ranchi) for West Bengal and Bihar respectively because of the
differing project impacts and the widely variant cultural, social. political
and economic conditions in the two States.
RESSTTT1-ENANDT EH       LTATTON (R&R) CCMPCN: About 6 910 project affected
families (PAFs) in 215(151 + 64) villages have lost about 3,791 acres of
private land (for an average of 0.55 acres per PAF), in West Eengal and
Bihar as a result of land acquisition in Stages I and 11 of the Farakka
development. 8ecause no homes were taken by land acquisition, there are no
project-affected  villages or rehabilitation  colonies. In West Bengal PAFs
averaged 1,4 PAPs, suggesting an agregate affected active population of
(5005 x 1,4) 7007 PAPs, while in Bihar the surveys noted 6.6 persons per
family, for total population of (1905 x 6,6) 11 158 persons. In Bihar, on
average, 0.4 acre / family was acquired by NTPC, approximately an average
108s of 10%/10 of PAF land holding, with 60% having lost less than 1/2 acre. In
Bihar, 5a% of land oustees received less than 5 000 Rp compensation and in
total only 0,4% used money to buy Land. Impact of NTPC on the region has not



44
been sionificant and cn emoiovment c-pcrunities nas ceen nega:ive.
Rs. 84 million (USS2.71 miilion eauivalent) was paid as monetary compensation for
lanz. The mayor pcnion oi ccmpensation for Stage I was paid in 1980-81;
ano the balance was oaid in 1983-84. The compensation for Stage II was paid
in 1989-90 to about 5,500 PAFs. Part of earlier law and order problems
was due to the tension between NTPC and other state authorities and project
affected people (PAP), particularly coming from unreaiistic and unfulfilled
expectations for employment by NTPC, In total. 449 PAPs have been
employed by NTPC. Another 165 PAPs opted to become contractcrs for
NTPC for very small-scale jobs, and sixteen were given shops or kiosks. In
addition, about 2,075 PAPs obtained temporary jobs with the contractors.
The situation of the remainina PAPs wiil be addressed in the retrofit socio-
eccnomic studies recentiv completeo.
NTPC's Farakka Plant and site management has developed a communitv outreach program
ano has been upgrading infrastructure in the project affectea communities.
This includes (a) Roacs and Drains: New rcads, drains, culver.s constructed
in villages near the power station: (b) Education: Schools were repaired in
eight villaaes and three adult education centers were opened: (c) Drinking
Water: SO tubewells were opened in different villages: (d) Health and
Sanitation: Immunization camps were held and sick villagers wee X-rayed;
(e)Community Facilities: Many community latrines were provided: but stop
sheds were built and installed; and (f) Electrification:  Supply lines were
rehabilitated and Tildanga school and Palachi Village Club were electrified;
public lighting on the line to the ash pond was provided where the line crosses
five villages.
Up to October 1994, NTPC-Farakka has spent a total amount ct Rs 37 million on village
development activities, and continues these efforts with a 1994-1995 budget
of Rs 12.7 million. In addition, the project regularly organizes family
welfare camps, free medical service along the MGR, eye operation camps,
adult education activities, and sporting and cultural events.
NTPC has formed a Village Development Advisory Committee (VDAC) chaired by the MLA
of Mursnidabad District and including panchayat representatives at village,
block and district levels. Currently efforts are underway to broaden the
membership to include Government and local industry representatives, to
meet biannually (rather than annually as at present), and to prepare a
detailed agenda in advance of regular meetings. NTPC has asked IISWSM to
present its survey findings and ReAP recommendations to the VDAC in Bengali
to assure that the final product is a joint collaboration between NTPC and this
locally representative body.
