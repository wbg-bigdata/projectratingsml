Main Policy Areas   HigherEducation:
                         a) Quality and relevance o f teaching and research
                         b) Access and equity
                         c) Governance and management
                         d) Fiscal sustainability and effectiveness ofexpenditure
Key Outcome          1. At least one third of increase in enrollments inuniversitysector between
Indicators            2007/08 and 2008/09 i s attributable to students enrolled in science and
                      engineering
                    2. Number of PhD graduatesproduced by Pakistaniuniversities increases
                      to at least 550 by 2008/09
                    3. Number o f International Journal Publications from Pakistani scholars
                     increasesto at least 3,500 by 2008/09 from 2,500 in2007/08
Program Development PDO: Create the conditions to enhance the stock o f skilled Pakistanis able
Objective(s) and    to contribute to an economy increasingly based on knowledge and
Contribution to CAS technology, through an overhaul ofthe university sector.

                    The HESP supports the completion of initial reforms to increase equitable
                    participation, enhance quality and relevance and strengthen the efficiency
                    and sustainability o f the higher education sector with a view to sustaining
                    momentum o fthe core reform program through the current fiscal stress.

                    The CAS identifies sustainable growth as an essential pre-requisite for
                     long term poverty reduction. The HESP aims at an expansion of access to
                    quality higher education inorder to develop a skilled workforce which will
                    be necessary for sustainable growth. Bank engagement in the higher
                    education sector through the HESP DPC is guided by the strategic
                    principles of the CAS: client pull, scaling up / replicating approaches that
                    have already proved to be effective, and focusing on outcomes.
RisksandRisk        Political situation
Mitigation
                                                1

Risks: Pakistan has been through a period of high turbulences. There are
still concerns regarding the impact o f the economic policy response to the
macroeconomic imbalances and possible differences amongst main
political parties on a variety of issues, against the backdrop of local
fundamentalism, regional conflicts, and intense international pressure.

Mitigation: The medium-termpolicy framework to which the Government
i s committed minimizes the risks associated with the impact of the
measures to address the economic situation. While the political risks
remain substantial at a general level, they may not affect higher education
because o f unanimous support to the sector and as these reforms have been
supported through the political changes o fthe last 12- 18 months.

Uncertainmacroeconomicsituation

Risks: Despite several years of efforts to consolidate the macroeconomic
framework, risksremain o f increased external shocks, trade deficits, lower
capital and remittance inflows, and growing fiscal unbalances, all resulting
in a loss of confidence which could in turn trigger a vicious circle and
weaken growth prospects.

Mitigation: The IMF Stand-by arrangement and the authorities'
determination to ensure macroeconomic s tability and to encourage the
business environment minimize the risk o f a worsening o f the situation. At
the same time, both the PRES0 and the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
Limitation Act will mitigate risks that measures to reduce budget deficits
leadto a reduction of spendingon education.

Inter- and intra SectoralTrade-offs

Risks: While education and higher education in particular are currently
highon the priority ladder ofthe country's leaders, a shift in inter-sectoral
priorities remains possible. There i s a risk that the recent emphasis given
to higher education will be questioned on the grounds that basic education
should be given the absolute priority until Education for All i s achieved
and primary education becomesuniversal.

Mitigation: There is a wide consensus amongst mainstream political
parties regarding the need to offset Pakistan's lagging performance in the
higher education sector, and to raise universities to international standards,
so that they will become real engines of growth. The risk that higher
education would crowd out basic education i s mitigated through the
capping put on the share of the education budget allocated to higher
education.

Internal resistance

Risks: They could originate from various quarters: (i)faculty staff
uncomfortable with the emphasis on accountability and academic
performance; (ii)administrators who feel threatened by the introduction of
stringent accountability rules; and (iii)students ideologically opposed to
any reform that results in greater cost-sharing and/or partnership with
                         2

                private business. All three constituents may form a common front, and
                paralyze HEC's reformist efforts.

                Mitigation: A major effort to engage in earlier consultation and in
                continuous dialogue with stakeholders should allow to reduce - but not to
                eliminate-- these risks. Several reforms (e.g. tenure track system) are
                introduced on a voluntary basis. In the future, HEC will initiate a
                communication strategy to engage the academic community and to spell
                out the benefits expected from the reforms. However, universities can
                always become hostage of political rivalries regardless of the scope of
                reforms engaged (and o f the expected benefits), and there is no recipe to
                fully avoid this risk.

                Uneven institutionalcapacity

                Risks:Institutional vulnerability exists at two levels. At the HEC level, the
                scope of the reforms may overstretch the implementation capacity o f the
                Commission. Another risk is linkedto the fact that the chairman's position
                has been vacant since the resignation of the first incumbent. Additionally,
                if HEC were to lose its special autonomous status, it would lose its
                reformist capacity and its efficient modus operandi. At the universitylevel,
                capacity is quite uneven, and often very weak.

                Mitigation: The program is carefully sequenced, and reforms are
                introduced gradually. An institutional review o f HEC will be carried out,
                leadingto a redefinition of tasks and skill mix. HEC has been satisfactorily
                functioning during the absence o f a chairman, with both the Commission
                fulfilling its oversight role and the executive director being in charge of
                implementing reforms. A search process is underway, and an eminent
                chairperson is to be appointed shortly. The benefits o f keeping HEC an
                autonomous agency are understood by the Government. Improvements in
                the governance structure and massive training programs aim at reinforcing
                managerial capacity o f universities.

                FiduciaryIssues

                Risks: Budget support operations carry the generic risks associated with
                weak financial management and procurement capacity.

                Mitigation: Fiduciary risksare mitigatedby (i)   improved accounting and
                recording practices under the PIFRA regime; (ii)   introduction of new audit
                methodology; (iii)  capacity buildingof the financial management staff in
                universities; and (iv) progressive alignment o f procurement rules to
                internationalbest Dractices.

                PROPOSEDHIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT PROGRAM
                                               CREDIT

                        TO THE ISLAMICREPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.       This Program Document presents the proposed Higher Education Support Program (HESP).
The HESP i s a development policy credit designed to support the Government o f Pakistan's Higher
Education Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF-HE). The overarching, long-term
objective o f the Framework i s to enhance the stock o f skilled Pakistanis able to contribute to an
economy increasingly based on knowledge and technology. The HESP will support the Government
o f Pakistan (G0P)'s initiatives to increase participation, enhance quality and relevance and strengthen
the efficiency and sustainability o f higher education institutions (HEIs). HESP will contribute to the
rehabilitation o f the higher education sector o f Pakistan by helping sustain momentum o f the core
program and key accompanying reforms being undertaken by the Higher Education Commission
(HEC) through the current period o f fiscal stress.

2.       The country is going through a difficult period on several fronts. For the past year and a half,
the political situation has hindered the timely undertaking o f corrective actions requested by the
deteriorating economy.     Efforts were made early 2008 to promote private sector investment, better
governance, increased devolution, investment in human capital, and protection o f the poor and
vulnerable. However, it is only since the fall o f 2008 that the new government launched adjustment
measures targeted at fiscal and external deficits. The recently adopted Poverty Reduction Support
Paper I1(PRSP-11) o f the Government o f Pakistan provides a framework for the government's policy
agenda for the next three years.     The Bank's Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation
(PRESO) supports Government policies aimed at regaining and maintaining macroeconomic stability,
enhancing competitiveness, and protecting the poor and vulnerable through improved targeting o f
safety nets and cash transfer programs.

3.      In the long run, a shortage of qualified labor hinders prospects o f further progress and will
become more o f a bottleneck as the country transitions toward a knowledge-based economy and may
even prevent sustaining a healthy growth. This i s why constituting a strong pool o f skilled workers is
a long term strategic goal, and why the existence o f such a pool i s a prerequisite without which the
Pakistani economy will not be able to adapt itself and to compete inthe global market.

4.      Despite the fact that the higher education sector has received support recently, the sector lags
behind other countries in the region in terms o f various indicators. Its output o f graduates was not
aligned with the needs o f the economy --whether in quantitative or qualitative terms. It was also out
o f sync with the requirements o f a modern, tolerant and open society.         In order to address the
disconnect between what is expected from the sector and what the latter can offer, HEC launched a
series o f reforms to rehabilitate higher HEIs and make them more relevant to the needs o f the 21st
Century.

5.      These measures are encapsulated in the MTDF-HE. They encompass all critical areas in
urgent need o f improvement and have the potential to transform H E I s into one o f the engines o f
economic growth and progress.        They address quality and relevance issues, access and equity,
governance and management, and the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness o f expenditure in higher


                                                    4

education. The latest point is particularly important at a time when the country is under fiscal stress
and many sectors are competing for public funding.

6.      The reforms initiated by HEC and the investment made to implementthem are necessary, but
they are fragile. If disrupted, most of the investment may be lost, the sector may fall back in the
disarray it was before HEC's bold measures were launched and the economic recovery may be slowed
down because of an insufficient human capital basis. For this reason, it i s critical to protect the
MTDF-HEand the resources needed for its implementation. The proposed HESP will contribute to
sustaining the momentum of key reforms undertaken by the Commission.

7.       The MTDF-HE is part o f a comprehensive plan to overhaul the entire education system,
including both basic and secondary education and encompassing both general and vocational streams.
Reforms have been initiated at the federal, provincial and district levels (Punjab, Sindh, and NWFP)
and supported by IDA. The HESP is consistent with both the National Education Policy 1998-2010
and with the PRSP.

8.       The proposed HESP is also aligned with the country's macro-economic strategy as reflected in
the MTDF at the macro level. Both share the same diagnosis, the same objectives and the same
strategy. The Macro-MTDF places increasing access to higher education as a priority for "Pakistan
Incorporated". The alignment and complementarities between the MTDF-HEand the macro-economic
strategy i s clearly discernable in the Planning Commission's "Vision 2030" document, which posits
that "the economics of knowledge must underpinpolicies for growth".

9.      HEC's recent track record constitutes a good omen for the success of the implementation of
the MTDF-HE. The Bank's technical assessment o fthe MTDF-HE,published ina 2006 Policy Note',
is largely positive. The Policy Note found that the Framework was a sound and articulate response to
the sclerosisthat characterized the sector for many years. By attackingup-front the factors underlying
the poor quality of HEIs, the Commission has addressed the root of the problems facing the sector.
Hence, the efficient implementation of the reform package initiated by HEC warrants the combined
support ofthe Government and IDA.

    A. RecentEconomicDevelopments

10.     Pakistan's development record was strong for the earlier part of this decade. During
2003104-2006107, the Pakistani economy grew at 7.3 percent p.a. on average, driven by solid
performances in the services and
industrial sectors (see Figure 1). The
factors that contributed to growth
included      a     benign     external
environment, availability of external
financing,         political        and
macroeconomic       stability.     Key
measures included renegotiation of
external    debt   with Paris      Club    I

creditors, pre-payment of extensive
debt, greater reliance on concessional                                                                              B

'The  World Bank "Policy Note:Assessmentof the Medium-TermDevelopment Framework" (World Bank
2006) was completed at the request o f the Ministry of Finance
                                                        5

These measures, together with an expansion in the economy, led to a decline inpublic debt as well as
a reduction in debt servicing cost. Growth translated into rising household incomes, with per capita
income growing to US$878 in2006/07, an 18.3 percent increase from US$742 two years earlier.2

11.       Nonetheless, macroeconomic imbalances were building-up. The growth was in part
explained by heavy reliance on external financing and on expansionary fiscal stance, while revenues
and savings remained stagnant. A surge o f capital inflows from abroad allowed the government to
finance the rising fiscal deficits at a low cost. The consolidated fiscal deficit increased from 2.3
percent in 2003/04 to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2006/07, while domestic tax collection remained weak.
The effect of expansionary fiscal policy was compounded by a loose monetary policy, which caused
an upsurge in domestic demand and contributed to acceleration o f inflation from 3.5 percent in
2001/02 to 7.8 percent in 2006/07. Concurrently, the current account deficit reversed from a surplus
of 4.8 percent in2002/03 to a deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP in2006/07, financed through ample capital
inflows. The reliance on external financing left the economy vulnerable to external shocks and,
despite the clear signs of overheating, Pakistan concluded 2006/07 with no visible signs of adjustment.

12.      In 2007/08, the sharp rise in international oil and food (specifically wheat) prices, in
combination with policy inaction and internal political turmoil, led to rapidly expanding
macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan. Both fiscal and current account balances widened
significantly. In the absence of adequate remedial policy measures to address the imbalances-in
particular not passing on the internationalprice increasesto domestic consumers-the     economy begun
to adjust through a slowdown ingrowth and risinginflation. Spending overruns ledto a sharp increase
in the 2007/08 fiscal deficit to 7.4 percent of GDP, compared to the budget target of 4.0 percent of
GDP. Expendituresexceededthe budget target by about 2.9 percent o f GDP, while revenues fell short
o f the target by about 0.6 percent of GDP. The sharp increase inthe budget deficit was mostly caused
by the overrun of 2.7 percent o f GDP inbudgetary subsidies (from the budgettarget o f 1.1 percent of
GDP to 3.8 percent of GDP) owing to the rise in international commodity and oil prices. The problem
was compounded by an overrun o f 0.9 percent of GDP in interest payments which was mainly due to
an underestimation of interest liabilities inthe budget contributed to the increase inthe budget deficit.
The rise in the budget deficit would have been even higher without the 1.2 percent of GDP under-run
indevelopment spending.

13.      In parallel, increased import bills and strong aggregate demand contributed to a
widening of the current account deficit in 2007/08. Pakistan's current account deficit reached 8.4
percent o f GDP in 2007/08, compared to 4.8 percent in 2006/07. Over 50 percent o f this increase (1.9
percent o f GDP) was on account of a 38 percent increase in the import price o f petroleum per barrel.
The trade deficit increasedby about 58 percent year-on-year to 9.1 percent of GDP, mainly owing to
sharp increasesinthe import bill.

14.       Pakistan's foreign reserves declined rapidly due to the large current account deficit, a
reduction in net capital inflows, and inadequate adjustment of the exchange rate. While FDI
flows remained relatively robust at US$5.1 billion (albeit lower than in 2006/07) and remittances
increased to US$6.5 billion, portfolio investments declined as investor confidence plummeted. Also,
donor inflows significantly dropped as the macroeconomic framework went off track, and the
privatization process came to a halt in 2007/08. Furthermore, given the large spread on Pakistan
sovereign bonds, borrowing from international capital markets was not an option. As a result, foreign
reserves were drawn down to pay for imports. By end-June 2008, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
foreign exchange reserves dropped to US$8.6 billion, a fall of about US$5.7 billion since October
2007.

15.      Even though the deterioration in the terms-of-trade put increasing pressure on the
exchange rate, the Rupee-Dollar exchange rate remained broadly unchanged around US$1
/PKR 61 untilDecember2007. Duringthe second half of 2007/08 SBP allowed some exchange rate
flexibility and the exchange rate depreciated by 13 percent to reach US$l/PKR 68.4 by the end of the
fiscal year.

16.      Faced with lower external financing and privatization receipts, Government resorted to
direct borrowing from SBP for budget deficit financing. During2007/08, government borrowing
from SBP amounted to PKR 689 billion, increasingthe total stock of government debt owed to SBP to
Rs. 1.1 trillion at end June 2008. The rise in government borrowing kept the growth of reserve money
over 20 percent and fueled inflation (the average CPI increased by 12 percent in 2007/08 and by 21.5
percent on a year-on-year basis at end June 2008). SBP responded to the rise in inflation by increasing
the policy discount rate by a total o f 200 bp by endJune 2008, but real interest rates remained
negative by a large margin.

17.      I n response to the widening imbalances and supply side shocks, real GDP growth
declined from 6.8 percent in 2006/07 to 5.8 percent in 2007/08. In agriculture, floods and pest
attacks depressed rice and cotton production, while industrial production and services were
constrained by acute power and gas shortages.

18.      Pakistan's risk rating worsened as the economic situation deteriorated. Both Standard &
Poor's and Moody's downgraded Pakistan's sovereign debt ratings in May 2008 (from B+ to B and
from B1to B2, respectively) owing to the sharp erosion inthe fiscal position and the inadequate policy
responseto the worsening macroeconomic situation.

19.      Recognizing the need to correct the macroeconomic imbalances, the Government
embarked on a concerted effort to stabilize the economy starting with the 2008/09 budget. The
budget, among other things, envisaged sizeable fiscal consolidation through power and fuel subsidy
cuts and increased revenue effort. However, by November 2008 it was apparent that the budget
measureswere inadequate to contain the economic slide, aggravated by the global financial crisis, and
to restore the investor confidence eroded by a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves and further
increase inthe inflation rate.

20.      To avoid a balance of payments crisis and default on foreign debt payments, the
authorities developed a home-grown stabilization program, which was supported by the IMF
through a 23-month Stand-By Agreement (SBA) in November 2008. The program includes a
medium-termmacroeconomic framework, which envisages fiscal and monetary tightening to bring
down inflation and reduce the external current account deficit to sustainable levels. The 2008/09
program framework supported by SBA builds on the 2008/09 budget, modified to account for higher
inflation projections and greater exchange rate adjustment than envisaged at the time of the budget.
The framework was revised duringthe first program review inFebruary 2009 to take into account the
impact o f significantly deteriorated global economy, resulting lower exports, foreign inflows and
growth prospects in the short and medium term, as well as the change in the terms o f trade through
lower international oil and food prices. Table 1 summarizes the revised framework, and compares it
with the initialNovember 2008/09 program framework for 2008/09.

21.      The revised framework is built aroundthe followingeconomic parametersfor 2008/09:

       0     Real GDPgrowth of 2.5percent: the target was lowered from 3.4 percent owing to sharper
             than anticipated economic slowdown;

                  Fiscal deficit (excluding grants) of 4.3 percent of GDP: the initial fiscal deficit target
                  remained unchanged in nominal Rupee terms, but owing to the moderated GDP growth
                  projection, the target as a share o f GDP increasedfrom 4.2 to 4.3 percent;
                  Current account deficit of 5.9percent of GDP: the initialtarget o f 6.5 percent o f GDP was
                  reviseddownwards due to a larger than anticipated decline in imports; and
                  Annual average consumer price inflation at 20 percent: the annual inflation target was
                  adjusted downwards from 23 percent, as a result o f falling food and energy prices and
                  lower economic activity.

22.      The fiscal deficit reductionis to be achieved by a combinationof expenditurecuts and
revenue increases, with the burden of adjustment falling primarily on expenditures. The
2008/09 program assumes that Government's net borrowing from SBP will be zero on a quarterly
basis from November 1,2008 onwards, and Government will rely increasinglyon non-bank borrowing
and external financing. This, in addition to a sharp decline in aggregate demand during the second
halfof 2008/09 is expected to bringdown average annual inflation to the program target.

23.      At the first quarterly review of SBA inFebruary 2009, the stabilization program remained on
track. The rapid decline in international commodity and oil prices since August 2008 has reduced the
risks, facilitated improvement inthe external position and the achievement oftargets.

     B. Medium-Term Outlook

24.      Pakistan's real GDP growth is projected to remain low in 2008/09 and 2009/10, and
increase gradually from 2.5 percent in 2008/09 to 6.5 percent by 2012/13, although longer-term
projections are particularly uncertain in view of the volatile global economic environment.
Aided by increasing public investment-among       other things in infrastructure, power, and transport-
gross capital formation will rise and contribute to growth recovery and facilitate private sector activity.
Inparallel, gradually increasing private sector credit growth will help economic activity. Agriculture
i s showing good growth prospects, while manufacturing and services are expected to recover only
gradually as the domestic aggregate demand picks up and the availability o f power improves as a
result of investments in power generation.      With the global recovery, exports are also projected
gradually improve and reduce Pakistan's external vulnerability over time.

25.      Over the medium term, the Government's revised macroeconomic framework targets a
decline in the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) from 4.3 percentof GDP in 2008/09 to 2.3 percent
of GDP in 2012/13. To meet the ambitious revenue targets, the authorities plan to implement bold
and comprehensive tax policy and administration reforms. Owingto this sizeable revenue effort, total
expenditures are projected to slowly climb back to about 20 percent of GDP in 2012/13. Lowering
inflation remains a challenge. The external current account deficit i s projectedto decline to about 4.2
percent o f GDP by 2012/13.

26.      In the mediumterm, increased productivityand export competitivenessare necessaryto
generate growth and reduce external vulnerability. To this aim, structural reforms to strengthen
the investment climate and competitive environment are required. These will include measuresto ease
firm entry and exit, reduce barriers to competition and trade, and enhance labor market flexibility and
labor competiveness. Inaddition, efforts to improve the financial sustainability and efficiency o f the
power sector will be essential to attract investment innew power generation.

27.      Protecting the poor and vulnerable is essential during the stabilization process.
Recognizingthis, the federal Government and the Punjab Province increased spending on social safety
nets by total of 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2008/09. Further spending increases are projected in 200940.
The federal Government launched the Benazir Income Support Program in the fall 2008, with the
objective to provide cash grants to the poorest families inPakistan. Inparallel, the Province o f Punjab
established its own income support programto protect the poor and vulnerable of Punjab.

28.      In conclusion, despite a highly uncertain external environment, Pakistan is now in a
better position to attain the projected medium-term recovery path. Over the last few months, the
stabilization efforts together with a decline in international commodity prices have succeeded in
reducing external imbalances, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, narrowing fiscal overruns and
lowering inflation. However, the sharp deterioration in the global economic and financial outlook
poses significant risks to exports, remittances and external financing, notwithstanding the fiscal
stimuluspackages prepared in a number o f countries. Even though projections in these areas as well
                                                    9

as forecasts about the speed o f real economy recovery were significantly moderated during the first
program review inFebruary 2009, they may still turn out to be optimistic. This highlightsthe need for
a rigorous implementationo f reforms, while protecting core development spending, inparticular social
spending, to ease the adjustment for the poor and vulnerable people. There is a risk that the sharper
than anticipated economic downturn will lead to social tension as business activity slows down and
firms shed labor. Also, the risks to the domestic financial sector may increase. To mitigate this latter
risk, SBP has adopted a problem bank management and contingency plan for dealing with problem
banks, and measuresto improve banking resolution and banking supervision are being implemented.

29.     The medium-term revenue projections are ambitious and there is a risk that they will
not be met. However, the authorities want to retain the stretch targets in order to maintain the
pressure for reform. Recognizingthe need to substantially raise the tax to GDP ratio, they are keen to
seize the opportunity for bold tax reforms, and are committed to take compensatory action in case
revenues fall short of targets. This will include cutting o f expenditures.

30.      Stringentimplementationof the economic programwill be criticalto success, and timely
responses of fiscal and monetary authorities to emerging risks will be essential to ensure it
remains on track. Inthe current economic environment, any medium-termprojections are uncertain
and regular adjustments are necessary in response to changed circumstances.              The quarterly
monitoring of the IMFand the Bank's Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (PRESO)
will mitigate these risks through continued policy dialogue on a proper adjustment path.

  111.     THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORYPROCESSES

    A. MainIssuesand ChallenPes

3 1.    Access and quality remain significant challenges at all levels of the education sector in
Pakistan. Access is still far from beinguniversal at the primary level, and quality issues plague the
whole sector.    As one climbs the education ladder, these problems exacerbate-and               inequity
aggravates. Despite substantial efforts to ramp up basic education in order to catch up with enrollment
deficits and low learning outcomes, it will be difficult to reach education-related MDGs in the near
future. Yet, the country cannot wait for the problems to be fixed at the basic level to address those at
the upper levels. Doingthis wouldjeopardize the country's future.

32.      Pakistan stands behind most other countries in the region when looked at from the
knowledge economy point of view. The discrepancy is particularly clear when comparing Pakistan
with, for instance, Malaysia, a country which strives to bolster its education system (Figure 2). Out of
the several indicators used by the Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM), those relating to
education --and specially higher education-- fare amongst the worse. Pakistan's ambitions to become
a knowledge economy are conditioned -amongst several other factors-by         an up-scaling o f its entire
education system-including higher education.

     B. Pre-TertianEducation

33.      Pakistan's education indicators are low compared to countries with a similar level o f per
capita income and countries inthe South Asia Region. The challenges faced at the lower echelons of
the pyramid in Pakistan are enormous: (i)                      low levels of education expenditure; (ii)inefficient use of
funds and underinvestment in quality; (iii)weak governance and service delivery, as evidenced by
highteacher absenteeism, poor supervision, lack of accountability mechanisms; (iv) limitedaccess due
inpartto lack ofproper physical infrastructure; (v) shortageoftrained and qualified teachers: (vi) lack
of support for education, especially for girls, (vii) insufficient public/private partnerships (PPPs); and
(viii) absence of standardized data collection and dissemination.

34.      Pakistan ranked 165th out o f 177 members in the education index o f the UNDP Human
Development Report (2005). The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for primary school was 87 percent in
2005/06 - substantially lower than Bangladesh (106 percent), and India (107 percent4 Because of the
significant number of over-age children in primary schools in Pakistan, the Net Enrollment Rate
(NER) was much lower (53 percent). There are also substantial regional, urban-rural income, and
gender disparities in primary enrollments4. Drop-out rates are high. Learning achievements are low,
and vary considerably, with the largest gaps being between schools'. At the middle school level, the
GER drops to 49 percent, and at the Matric level, it was estimated at 44 percent in2005/06.

35.      There is a clear and positive relationship between family income and enrollment rates in
primary school. In addition to this early social selection, there is a negative (although not across all
provinces) relation between household income and enrollment in government schools. These features
are harbingers of what i s to happen at higher levels of education.

36.     InPakistan, higher education refers to education above grade 12, which generally corresponds
to the age bracket [I7 to 231. The higher education system is made up o f two main sub-sectors:
universities / Degree Awarding Institutes (DAIS),and Colleges. The responsibility for HEIs is shared
between the provincial and federal governments. The former have administrative control over HEIs,
while the latter, through HEC, provide funding to HEIs and control their ability to grant degrees.
Provinces are responsible for the establishment o f HEIs, while HEC has the oversight of public and
private degree granting institutions and coordinate evaluations o f academic programs. Colleges are
funded and regulated by provincial governments, and hence, not under HEC's purview. Universities
are responsible for their quality. In theory, colleges should play a critical role in building a middle
level skilled manpower. In practice, however, they do not have the financial, human and technical
means to do it, and serve as a last resort for those who did not make it to university. They are rightly
considered as the weakest link of the education chain.

37.     Colleges make up the single largest subsector. In 2005/2006, there were 1,135 public and
private colleges, enrolling some 326,000 students. This compares with 120 public and private
universities in2006/07, which enrolled 322,000 students (out of which 18,000 post graduate students).
The distance education sector contributed a further 210,000 students in2006/07, while the number of
private (external) studentswho appeared for exams stood at over 219,000.

38.     Higher education is chiefly public in nature, especially universities, DAISand Colleges. The
two providers of distance education - Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) and the Virtual
University are both public institutions. Public H E I s generally offer a wide range of courses and
programs, while private H E I s primarily offer a narrow range o f vocationally oriented courses such as
business and IT. The bulk of research in the HE sector is conducted in public universities, while the
private sector focuses on teaching. In2006/07, the private sector represented some 23 percent o f HE1
enrolments and 9 percent of Degree College enrolments (Table 2).

39.      After two decades of serious neglect, the highereducation sector in Pakistan has undergone a
rebirth in recent years. The situation began to reverse itself in the early 2000s, with the Government
showing a clear commitment to improving higher education, as evidenced by significant increases in
spending on higher education and the creation of HEC in 2002. As a result o f the reforms introduced
subsequently, the higher education sector has made significant progress, but much remains to be
accomplished.

                                                    12

40.      Mechanisms to migrate from upper secondary to higher education are intricate. Admission to
universities is very selective, with less than 10 percent of those taking the main entrance examination
making it into universities. Access to universities is mainly regulated by the Higher Secondary School
Certificate (HSSC). In2004, the pass rate was 50 percent, but universities admitted about one-fifth o f
the 389,000 students who passed. Students who pass the exam but are not admitted to university
usually enroll in affiliated colleges --or look for ajob.

(a)      Low Qualiv, ReducedRelevance

41.      The long period of neglect in which higher education has been left until recently has
resulted in poor quality teaching and learning, and a lack of focus on quality assurance and
quality improvement. Quality indicators (teacher qualifications, publications in refereed journals,
participation in international conferences) are on the low side. While the roots o f the problem are
multiple, the availability of qualified teaching staff i s probably first amongst them. There is both a
dearth of qualified staff and a lack of incentive/accountability mechanisms to optimize
competencesof existing staff. Only one out o f four faculty staff holds a PhD degree. Teaching has
not been an attractive option for bright graduate students, given low salaries and status and limited
support services. Hence, supply o f skilled faculty staff has been lagging behind.

42.      Rote learning is encouraged, leaving students with limited analytical and problem-solving
skills. Quality and depth o f knowledge o f the subject area are assumed to be indicated only by the
results of examinations, and the exams are reward mostly memorization. Highpass rates are regarded
as indicative of good pedagogy. Thus teaching to the examinations is the usual method.                                      Yet,
assessment methodologies are lax, and the examination system was rife with irregularities.

43.      Pakistaniuniversities have a long history o f inadequate library and computer facilities, limited
availability of teaching aids, lack o f access to the Internet, and outdated textbooks and other reading
material. Laboratories, for the most part, have been poorly equipped and much o f the equipment is
outdated, and lacks proper maintenance.

44.      Until recently, most general universities offered qualifications that were not aligned with
international norms. Curricula remained unchanged for decades, oblivious of the changes happening
outside o f the academic world. The dichotomy between the structure of degree programs in affiliated
colleges and universities hinderedthe smooth transition o f two-year degree college students into the
third year of university. External students (also known as "private" students) constitute a special
cohort of students who register in public universities but do not attend nor receive any pedagogic
support. The academic credentials of those external students enrolling in third year o f university are
particularly low, and they do not receive remedial courses to offset their disadvantage.

45.      The situation is no better at the post-graduate level, as reflected by weak research
outputs. The production of PhD is strikingly low, making very thin the basis for vibrant research.
There is very little applied and/or basic research undertaken in both the humanities and sciences. This
was highlighted in the 2002 report of the Task Force on Improvement of Higher Education, which
noted that: "Research is conspicuous by its absence in our seats of higher learningyy6.Key ingredients
are missingto establish a world standard research environment: (i)                   inter- and intra university linkages,
(ii)university-industry linkages, (iii)        opportunities for faculty staff to devote time to research; and (iv)
lack o f professional ethics.

46.      The private sector is very heterogeneous. While a number of private HEIs are below
standards, a few private universities, such as Lahore University o f Management Sciences (LUMS) and

the Agha Khan University, have strong national and regional reputations. Other private HEIs,
including Iqra University or the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science & Technology
performed well in comparison to many o f their public sector counterparts inthe 2006 HEC rankings.

47.     The distribution o f students by type of university suggests a lack o f relevance. While the
country i s in acute need o f high level technicians, over three-quarters of students in 2006/07 were
enrolled in general and pure science studies, while only 11%were enrolled in engineeringuniversities.
Inaddition, general non-science students are by far the largest contingent, making almost half of total
enrollments(Table 3).

48.     Despite their modest numbers, graduates do not find jobs easily, or those they find do not
match their expectations, as evidenced by the fact that unemployment i s more widespread for
university graduates than for those leaving with lower levels of education. In addition, there is little
cooperation between universities and the industry in terms of research. Yet, higher education yields
hefty (and rising) private rates of returns (Table 4).

(b)     A Narrow-based, Inequitable System,Isolatedfi.om its Environment

49.      Regardless of the indicator used, participationin higher education is low. In 2004l05,
enrollments represented 2.5 percent o f the corresponding age group. If enrollments in colleges are
included, the higher education sector was estimated to enroll about 807,000 students, which still
represents only 3.8 percent o f the corresponding age group. GER lags behind those in neighboring
countries such as India and Bangladesh, and significantly behindthose in countries such as Malaysia,
Thailand, China or Indonesia 7(Table 5). Indeed, both the primary completion rate and the secondary
net enrollment rate are lower than those observed in countries with a GNI per capita lower than, or
equivalent to, that of Pakistan. Participation rates are close to Sub-SaharanAfrica averages.

50.       Given these low levelsof participation,higher educationinPakistanlacksthe capacity to
leverage the knowledge economy that the country aspires to build. It remains an elitist system,
catering to a small proportion o f the eligible population. The combined effects o f earlier social
selection and the low transition rate to university entail a highly skewed and inequitable enrollment
distribution at that level (Table 6). Girlsmake up only one-third o f the total student population (vs. 38
percent inIndia, 44 percent in Indonesia and 55 percent inMalaysia)                 -- although   they outnumber boys
inmedicalschools.

5 1.      This low participation results from a combination of supply and demand factors. On the
supply side, the physical capacity o f public universities is not sufficient to accommodate the growing
number of candidates, while, at the same time, existing facilities are not used efficiently, and the
potential o f distance learning i s not fully exploited. The playing field o f higher education is far from
being even: despite the growing importance of private providers, public institutions are privileged.
There is both an excess o f control over some aspects o f the regulation (e.g. establishment o f private
HEIs) and insufficient control over other aspects. Private HEIsreceive little in the way of government
assistance.

52.       On the demand side, student aid mechanisms have not adapted to the rapid expansion of
enrollments. While scholarships offer a useful avenue for expanding participation among students
from low-income families, the number o f scholarships remained small and their use has been
hampered by the lack o f systematic and reliable data on family income. There is no strategy to
determine the respective roles and shares of scholarships and student loans. Likewise, there i s no
logical framework to determine eligibility criteria (whether for HEIs or for students).

                                                            15

 (c)    An Ineffective Management and Governance System
53.      Sector-wide governance issues are a pervasive impediment to the optimal functioning of
universities.   Until recently, responsibilities in public universities were not clearly defined.
Performance was not rewarded, let alone measured. Accountability was non-existent. Management
was performed on a day-to-day basis, without a long-term strategic perspective, and without agreed
targets against which to gauge progress. The internal management structure o f public HEIs was
dysfunctional, with a powerful vice-president selected on mainly political criteria on the one hand, and
a large, but weak senate on the other.

54.      Pakistan did not have a national accreditation, quality assessment, or quality improvement
process in place until 2003. Little had been done in terms o f internal evaluations at HEIs, although a
few o f them have conducted quality audits o f some o f their programs. There was no tradition o f
academic quality reviews inuniversities. Similarly, there was little effort to evaluate faculty members
internally. Until recently, there was no process to set standards for institutional accreditation and to
evaluate programs and faculty quality.

55.      HEC was created as a strong body with the power to foster badly needed changes in higher
education. It was given the authority to assess financial needs, establish accreditation and quality
improvement carry out curriculum review and enhancement, control and recognize degrees, accredit
new institutions, promote and fund research. However, the staffing of HEC was not fully at par with
the multiplicity and complexity of these tasks and the number of HEIs to serve. The Commission is
still not completely immune against changes in the political leadership, and its autonomy is still not
fully guaranteed. Moreover, given the breadth of the reforms it has launched, HEC lacks the
communication strategy that i s indispensable to reach out HE stakeholders and the public at large.

56.      HEC still does not have a reliable, timely Higher Education Management Information System
(HEMIS) which would allow it to develop solid forecasts and facilitate strategic decision-making.
There is no continuity inthe databases, including simple, basic data. For instance, it is not possible to
compare enrollment figures over time, even for the public sector.

57.      On the financial management side, HEC was until recently hampered by inefficient financial
management software and overstretched capacity. Financial management practices across HEIs remain
uneven. Since these are autonomous bodies, they enjoy flexibility in formulating their financial
management arrangements. Federally funded H E I s (public universities and DAIS)are subject to audit
by the Auditor General and are bound by certain Government rules. Private H E I s are not subject to
any such oversight. Newly established HEIs are required to get annual accounts audited by a chartered
accountant, but they do not have a duty to report these to HEC. Currently, varied models o f financial
governance are followed inthese institutions.

58.      HEC receives its spending authority from the Ministryo f Finance. Recurrent and development
fund grant requests are processed by the Commission and checks are sent to the HEIs. Until October
2008, these checks were drawnagainst a Personal Ledger Account (PLA), which needed to be
validated by the Federal Treasury Office before funds were released. Coupled with the delays in the
quarterly releases, the entire process usually took more than 6 weeks. The new Assignment Account
procedure has considerably reduced the time lag to an average of two weeks.

59.      In May 2003, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was set up through an
Ordinance to regulate and take such actions as may be required to provide efficiency and transparency
in public procurement. The PPRA prepared and notified the 2004 Public Procurement Rules. The
Rules in themselves represent international best practice albeit with a credible appeals process and
consultancy rules missing. In order to operationalize these new Rules effectively, it will be necessary
to issue implementingregulations and standard bidding documents. These two areas are yet to be

                                                   16

completed, which leads to a lack of clarity on the actualprocurementprocessthat needs to be followed
under the new procurement rules. The newly adopted rules are regarded as the rules to follow for
public procurement. While the posting of procurement notices on PPRA was mandatory for the
procuring agencies, there was no stipulation regarding the posting of notices of award. Recently, the
PPRA has directed all procuring agencies to post notices of award for contracts over PKR 50 million
on its website.

(4       An Under-resourcedSector

60.      Until the early 2000s, the university sector had been blatantly under-funded. The huge
and unprecedented increase in the HEC budget since 2002 has been accompanied by parallel
growth in student enrollments. Therefore,in real per-student terms, the surge hasbeenmodest,
and with less than one-half of one percent of GDP spent on its universities, Pakistan continuesto lag
behind other comparable countries. Indeed, this reflects a general underinvestment in education (out
of 106 countries, Pakistanranked99 for the share of GDP spent on educationin2005) - See Table 7)         -
particularly acute at the tertiary educationlevel.

61.      Since 2001/02, all federal government funding to universities and DAISi s provided through
HEC budget. That year, this budget was at an extremely low level, whether measured as a share of
GDP (0.1 percent), of the GOP budget (0.6 percent) or of total education spending (6 percent). It
doubled the following year, and kept growing in real terms since then --untilFY 2008 (currently at
about 0.3 percent of GDP). The bulk of the recurrent budget is dedicated to university grants which
are usedby HEIs to finance their operation costs. The developmentbudget is usedto boost quality and
innovation.

The Program

62.      The multiple predicaments suffered by the university system, and the associated risks for the
economy had been pointed out for many years. The first and decisive step to respond to pressing
alarms(including the Report of the Task Force on Improvement of Higher Education in 2002) was the
creation, in 2002, of the Higher Education Commission. HEC immediately embarked in a series of
initiatives to overhaul the sector. Then, in 2005, it issued its Medium-Term Development Framework,
which systemizes and articulatesthese initiatives ina coherent strategic document.

63.      The MTDF-HE focuses on universities, Degree Awarding Institutions and Centers of
Excellence (COEs). The exclusion of colleges from the MTDF-HE is consistent with the HEC's
mandate and budget. The HEC's only formal link with colleges is an indirectrelationship through the
affiliation of colleges to universities. Affiliation allows some inputs into the quality of teaching -for
which universities get fees. The abysmal situation of colleges and the importance of addressing it is
now widely recognized. A number of studies are being initiated to prepare the development of a
comprehensivereform strategyfor these institutions. Without waiting for such a strategy, however, the

Government has launched pilot programs to assist colleges (e.g. in Punjab). In addition, the HEC's
program supported by the HESP includes measures to improve the transition between college and
university programs, and to support pedagogical programs inthe colleges.

64.      HEC's ambition, as embedded inthe MTDF-HEis to "facilitate institutions of higher learning
to serve as engines for the socio-economic development o f Pakistan". To serve this ambition, HEC has
identifiedfour core strategic aims --faculty development, access and learning, research, and relevance-
- and three cross-cutting supporting aims --governance, quality assurance, infrastructure development-
- (Box 1). In operational terms, these aims translate into a reform program structured around four
pillars: (i)quality and relevance o f teaching and research, (ii)
                                                                access and equity, (iii)governance and
management, and (iv) financial sustainability. These pillars are highly complementary and closely
interrelated.  The way they are organized here reflects in-depth discussions with HEC and full
ownership by the Commission, and echoes the views o f the actors in charge o f implementing the
actions and measures of the MTDF-HE.

Pillar 1: Improving the Quality and Relevance of Teaching and Research

65.      The Government has recognized that the low and continuously withering standards o f higher
education institutions were a major impediment to the development o f a knowledge economy.
Immediately after its creation, HEC targeted quality of both teaching and research as its first priority.
A program was launched to equip faculty with the required qualifications and to make the teaching
and research trade more attractive. Academic programs were restructured, labs and scientific material
were procured, and research teams were linked up with international centers. As a result, most
performance indicators went on an upward trend. Despite these progresses, the Pakistani higher
education sector still does not fare well in international comparisons. Only two Pakistani universities
make it in the main international rankings (National University o f Science and Technology and
University of Lahore), and only a few are listed amongst the best schools in the Asia Region.
Consequently, the MTDF-HE takes a more aggressive stance and the first pillar i s built around the
quality o fthe inputs, the process, and the products of HEIs.

66.      However, neither the quantity nor the quality of students churned out every year can be
determined solely against academic criteria and by the academic community alone. The expansion o f
the system must be done within the framework o f the national priorities corresponding to the
economic and social objectives the country has set up for itself in the long-run. Thus, the first pillar
                                                    18

also includes a series of interrelated initiatives inorder to addressthe lack o f relevance o f teaching and
researchto the needs of 21st Century.

(a)      Buttress the supply, quality andperformance of faculty staff
Immediate Actions

67.      Inorder to address the acute shortage of qualified faculty which largely contributes to the low
quality of higher education in Pakistan, an ambitious long-term plan to increase and improve the
supply o f such faculty is beingdeveloped. Based on a forecast o f faculty shortages, the Commission
has reinforced its Foreignand IndigenousPhD Scholarship Programs for qualified students and faculty
o f public and private H E I s in key priority areas (e.g. engineering, biotechnology, information
technology, humanities/social sciences, and health science). All candidates are being selected on the
basis o f clearly defined criteria. Awardees o f overseas scholarship programs are expected to serve in
Pakistan for five years after completion of their studies, and incentive kits are designed to that
purpose. In addition to these long-term training opportunities, a new policy allows all interested
indigenous PhD candidatesto benefit from a six-month foreign training. A decision has beentaken to
scale upthe scholarship programs inorder to feed a steady flow o f qualified teaching staff.

68.      To create a more favorable environment with greater incentives to attract and retain qualified
and ambitious faculty who aim to build a career in higher education, the Government has launched a
performance-based tenure track system for faculty in public HEIs.            The Model Tenure Track
Process Statutes for faculty staff in public universitieswere approved by the Finance Division,
and notified by HEC, and they have been adopted already by about 40 percent o f all HEIS.Tenure
track appointments are conditioned on a PhD degree. An attractive salary package i s set up, in line
with that in the private sector. While this system is being applied to all new faculty appointments,
existing faculty are provided with an option to apply for a tenure track appointment.                 Initial
appointments are on a term contract, whereas permanent tenures are granted only upon completion o f
a full and transparent review processbasedon the recommendations of a Technical ReviewPanel.

69.      Steps have also been taken to boost the quality o f existing faculty. A professional development
program aimed at improving pedagogical skills and subject knowledge has been developed and
recently approved by the Commission.             The program includes in-service faculty development
programs and curriculum-based short-term courses for junior faculty. A number o f additional
scholarship schemes (many o f them supported by bilateral aid agencies) are also in place to encourage
young outstanding teachers inselected fields.

Medium-TermPriorities

70.      The scholarships scheme will be carried over in the outer years. The Government will
institutionalize the performance-based Tenure Track system and will increase the proportion of
Assistant Professors hired under the new system. The number of H E I s adopting the Tenure Track
statutes will gradually increase (adoption is voluntary). Finally, the Commission will pass a resolution
to approve a comprehensive Professional Development Scheme, strictly linkedto career development.

(b)      Enhance the quality of courses andprograms delivered by HEIs
Immediate Actions

71.      HEC has decided to raise the number of four-year Bachelor degree programs in general
universities with a substantially increased number of required credit hours and a structured broad-
based curriculum so that Pakistani undergraduate programs are aligned with international norms. The
four-year integrated curriculum for Bachelor degrees in basic, social, natural and applied sciences
follows standardized formathcheme of studies.
                                                     19

72.      HEC has initiated consultations in view of aligning undergraduate programs at affiliated
colleges with those of universities. The aim is to facilitate a smoother transitioning from affiliated
colleges to universities, and to reduce the unhealthy dichotomy o f the higher education sector split
between these institutions. Precisely because o f this schism and the traditional lack o f cooperation
between them, an outright and upfront change inthe structures and programs would likely meet fierce
resistance. Hence the choice to start with a wide consultation with stakeholders.

73.      In order to restore the usefulness, reliability and fairness o f assessments, the National
Committee on Examination System (NCES) has made several recommendations, including: (i)a shift
from an annual system to a semester system; (ii) more frequent usage of multiple choice questions
                                                    a
and short essay questions; and (iii)the training o f relevant professionals to improve assessment
strategies, quality of examination items and examination processes. The Commission has approved
these recommendations and the guidelines developed by a team o f experts to implementthem.

74.      A first round of review of the post-graduate programs has been completed in all public
universities, based on the MinimumCriteria for MPhil and PhD education defined by HEC. Based on
the reviews which were carried out by the Vice Chancellors' Post-graduate Program Review
Committees, the Commission has closed sub-standard programs at six universities and assisted the
concerned departmentsto fulfill the criteria so that they may be able to re-open the programs.

75.      A wide nationalconsultationhas been launched as a first step to address the situation faced by
external students, and to come to aconsensus on the main directions of a plan to increase the level o f
academic and curricular support for these students. The plan will spell out inter alia: (i)the
establishment of directorates of distance education in HEIs, (ii) development o f academic support
                                                                   the
activities andteaching materials; and (iii) the development of capacity building activities.

Medium-TermPriorities
76.      Duringthe following years, HEC will: (i)institutionalize the reorganization of the four-year
undergraduate programs, through an increase of the proportion o f HEIs offering structured broad-
based curriculum; (ii)finalize the policy documents to align Colleges undergraduate programs with
universities (iii) out training for faculty and universityexamination staff and start rolling out the
                  carry
implementation of an improved assessment methodology; (iv) complete the reviews o f post-graduate
studies; and (v) draft and finalize a plan improve the delivery o f education to private students and start
the settingup of directorates ofdistance education inHEIs.

(c)      Align teachingandresearchoutputs withnational development objectives

Immediate Actions

77.      First, the Commission has introduced measures to improve the employability o f
HEIs'graduates by: (i)involvingemployers inthe development of broad-based curricula responsive to
the labor marketrequirements; and (ii)   developing Terms of Reference for the establishment o f career
counseling centers in universities whose mandate will be to facilitate the employment o f graduates
through better information on labor market. Second, HEC has started the design o f a mechanism
allowing aligning research funding with national priorities as they are spelled out in the "Vision
2030". Finally, it has initiated programs to encourage university-industry collaboration through
funding projects undertakenjointly by university teams and professional from local industries.

MediumTerm Priorities

78.      Actions initiated in 2008/2009 will be continued and their implementation strengthened. HEC
will facilitate the implementationof measures aimedat improving graduate employability and will roll
out the development of flexible broad-based curricula. Career counselingcenters will be progressively
                                                   20

established in public HEIs, which will be encouraged to launch tracer studies. HEC will also pilot
new programs aimed at encouraging university-industry collaboration in R&D, including the
establishment o f Technology Incubating Facilities, and will develop a roadmap for the establishment
o f Offices o f Researchto support researchactivities (including commercialization) in selected HEIs.

(4       Improve the quality of research undertaken in HEIs
Immediate Actions

79.      A peer review process has been established for funding research in HEIs. Underthis process,
grants are awarded to researchers in a wide range of disciplines for a period of one to three years, only
after research proposals have undergone a rigorous peer review. By introducing this process, HEC is
aligning Pakistani research with mechanisms used in advanced countries, and is departing from earlier
practices funded on ad hoc decisions and/or alliances of interests.

80.      HEC has introduced a number o f other programs aimed at strengthening research quality. A
major initiative was to strengthen intra- and inter-universityIT structures through the establishment o f
the Pakistan Education and Research Network (PERN) - a nationwide educational intranet that links
all public and private sector chartered HEIs in the country. PERN focuses on collaborative research,
knowledge sharing, and resource sharing.

81.      Secondly, in order to ease affordable access to scientific and technological research, HEC has
introduced the Digital Library Program, which provides researchers at public and private HEIs with
access to over 40 publisher databases and more than 23,000 leading research journals, covering
approximately 75 percent of the world's peer-reviewed scientific journals. Thirdly, HEC i s promoting
enhanced international research collaboration by linking departments in Pakistani universities with
their counterparts in leading research universities abroad. Fourthly, HEC has developed and
implementedrigorous criteria for the recognition of quality researchjournals publishedinPakistan.

82.      HEC has taken several initiatives to promote research activities in private HEIs. First, a new
policy has been promulgated, by which private HEIs become eligible to the peer-reviewed research
grant program, and to receive 100 percent funding o f approved projects. This policy will allow
researchers from high-quality private H E I s (e.g. Aga Khan University, LUMS)to access fundinguntil
now restricted to the sole public HEIs. Second, private universities are now also eligible to receive
50% matching grant to access the digital library and to recruit foreign faculty. Third, grants will be
available to set up departments infields critical to the socio-economic development of the country.

MediumTerm Priorities

83.      In the following years, HEC will mostly focus on implementing the actions initiated to
strengthen the quality o f research conducted in Pakistan, by mobilizing both public and private
energies. Inparticular, it will adjust as neededthe funding formula for research. The initiatives will be
monitored so as to calibrate their respective importance, dependingon the observed impact.

Pillar 2: ExpandingAccess to, and EnhancingEquity of, Higher Education

84.      The very low enrollment rates prevailing in the early 2000's have prompted HEC to take
measures both to expand supply and to boost demand: existing infrastructure has been expanded,
initiatives have been taken to promote distance learning and private participation, and more
scholarships have been made available, while incentives were introduced to promote research. These
measureshave started to pay off. Between 2002/03 and 2004/05, total enrollments grew at an average
annual rate of 21 percent. However, given the rapid demographic growth, this expansion has not
translated into a substantial increase of the enrollment rate. If access to higher education i s not
significantly broadened, Pakistan will not be able to reap the benefit of the ongoing demographic
                                                    21

transition. Recognizing this fact, HEC is poised to take bolder measures in order to accelerate the
expansion of the sector. This is what the secondpillar o fthe MTDF-HEis about.

(a)      Increaseequitable access to higher education
Immediate Actions

85.      Inview of addressing the very low rate of participation inhigher education, HEC is resorting
to a two-pronged strategy. First, on the supply side, it has significantly increased the physical
capacities o f existing HEIs, in order to accommodate growing numbers of students. To enhance
access to students in disadvantaged regions of the country, HEC has set up campuses as well as
universities in these regions. Similarly, women universities are now operational in Quetta, Peshawar,
Rawalpindi and Lahore and are being supported by HEC to expand their activities. However, as
investments to build new facilities to put up incremental intakes would be daunting -especially under
the current fiscal crunch- more reliance is givento cost-effective distance learningapproaches (AIOU
and Open University). These approaches also allow more flexible study options, and are used as an
instrumentto broaden access to a whole range of users, including students who have interrupted their
studies for financial reasons, and adults.

86.      Second, it has also taken action on the demand side, even though it is to be noticed that the
room to address equity issues in higher education in Pakistan is relatively limited becausethe unequal
distribution o f entrants in higher education is the legacy o f the selection process which takes place at
lower levels o f education. Despitethese limitations, HEC has taken steps to lower the burdeno f costs
which keeps students from low income families at the gates o f universities. The first measure was to
launch a program to progressively equip all HEIs with a student financial aid office which operates as
the entry point for students to seek information on the costs of studies and the sources of financial
support. Then, inorder to ensurethat higher education participation is not the exclusive preserve of the
rich, the financial assistanceheed-based scholarship programs in both public and private H E I s have
been expanded: in addition to a steady annual flow o f 750 scholarships on HEC's own resources,
about 2,500 scholarships are granted by USAID and JICA. Finally, a proposal for a pilot loan scheme
for selected public and private HEIs (to be supported by IFC) has been developed. Currently, about 10
percent of undergraduate studentsare recipient of some sort of scholarship.

MediumTerm Priorities

87.      Over the medium-term, HEC will continue to address the needto increaseparticipation and to
promote equity, by augmenting resources, including physical infrastructure in existing HEIs and by
promoting distance learning. The number o f need-based scholarships for undergraduate students
studyingat public and private HEIs will be augmented. As an important step to ensure the long-term
sustainability of the need-based scholarship scheme, the cost of need-based scholarships will be
shifted from the development budget to the recurrent budget. The pilot student loan program will be
jump-started. Finally, in reviewing the funding formula used to fund HEIs, HEC will consider the
introduction of new criteria regardingthe social distribution o f new intakes.
(b)      Promoteparticipation of theprivate sector
88.      It is now widely recognized inPakistan that, regardless of how intensively engagedthe public
sector is in scaling up its effort to increase the supply o f places in HEIs, lifting access to higher
education at significantly higher will not be achieved without a substantial contribution of the private
sector. In order to foster further the expansion o f the private higher education sector, HEC has taken
decisive steps to reform the regulatory and funding framework that governs private HEIs.




                                                    22

ImmediateActions
89.     A first key measure is the approval by the Planning Commission of a policy allowing
eligibleprivateHEIsto qualify for up to 50 percent fundingfor developmentprojects,subject to
meeting"need-blind" admission requirements.The incentive package is available to private HEIs
that are not-for-profit, have at least 70 percent o f their courses taught by full-time faculty, have a
campus of their own and a proper governance structure, follow established accounting and audit
procedures, and meet the Cabinet criteria for the establishment ofHEIs.

90.     A second critical step taken to encourage private sector investment in higher education is the
notificationby HEC of revised criteria regardingthe creationof new privateuniversities,and the
relaxation of earlier regulations governing their establishment (reduction in the amount of land
required, and in the amount of trust funds to be retained, and relaxation of the limits on where trust
funds can be invested). Together, these changes will significantly lower the cost o f establishing
private H E I s and free up capital for them to invest in increased capacity and improved quality (further
to these measures, at least four new private universitieswill have opened in2008/09).

MediumTerm Priorities

91.     HEC will develop a framework for monitoringthe implementation o fthe new policy regarding
the establishment of private universities, and assess its impact. The Commission will also initiate and
complete a market feasibility study to determine the factors that influence foreign universities'
decisions to enter into collaboration with Pakistan universities and identify innovative ways in which
Pakistan could promote the establishment o f foreign universities. Finally, the Commission will launch
an awareness campaign so that private investors have a clearer understanding o f the conditions for
entry and the possibility of gettingfunded by HEC initiatives.

Pillar 3: Strengtheningthe Governance and ManagementofHigher Education

 92.     Recognizing that governance issues have plagued the sector for decades and still have the
potential to dwarf the effective implementation o f the reforms it i s heralding, HEC has started to take
measureson several fronts to tackle these issues (e.g. new rules regardingthe selection o f universities
vice-chancellors). These measures aim to instill a culture of accountability in HEIs, clarify
administrative procedures and establish the foundations for solid quality assurance mechanisms.
Innovations have been introduced to facilitate financial management procedures and to increase
transparency of procurement processes.

93.      The impact of these initial measures can be seen both in HEIs and HEC. However, the
internal governance of HEIs remains inefficient, administrative staff are under-qualified and excessive
power remains inthe hands of the vice-chancellor and the registrar. Similarly, within HEC, skill gaps
and a heavy workload threaten the effectiveness of the institution. Finally, basic data on the HE sector
remain elusive and unreliable. Hence, the MTDF-HE is taking these measures further in view of a
complete overhaul of the governance structure o f the sector.

(a)      Strengtheninternal governance, managementperformance and accountability of HEIs
94.      Reforming internal governance practices and introducing a culture of accountability is a
central objective of HEC's strategy. H E I s are accountable for their performance to students, parents
and other stakeholders in civil society and Government.           However, over time this tradition of
autonomy with accountability had eroded. Reversing this attitude i s a long term undertaking, which
needs to be spread over several years. HEC' strategy therefore is to help H E I s to develop their own
vision and programs, through consultation and consensus, rather than using a top-down approach
which would entail high risks of backlash.


                                                     23

Immediate Actions

95.      As a logical step further to the new way o f selecting vice- chancellors, HEC has started to
provide management training to senior university management (vice-chancellors themselves,
registrars, deans and heads of department), to share international best practices, and to improve their
management performance. These measures are also expected to prepare university leaders for further
initiatives and reforms.

Medium Term Priorities

96.      HEC will complete a diagnosis o f the current administrative management practices in public
HEIs. On the basis of this diagnosis, the Commission will prepare, in consultation with the HEIs, an
administrative policy reform aiming to increase the participation of faculty in decision-making process
and to increase accountability within institutions. The policy will introduce mechanisms for merit-
basedappointment of academic administrators and for empowering academic departments.

97.      A template for the preparation of 5-year strategic plans (including financial, academic and
asset plans, performance indicators) will be developed. The Learning Innovation Unit o f HEC will
develop custom-made training programs for HE1administrators while continue providingtraining to
senior universitymanagement,with an aim to strengthen HEIs' planning and management capacity.

(h)      Reinforce mechanismsfor quality assurance of academicprograms
Immediate Actions

98.      Under the Reform Program, a fully-functional Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) has been
established in 2005 at the national level as a monitoring and regulatory body. The Government is
committed to make QAA an autonomous body in the long term. During a transitional period, the
QAA's capacity will be strengthened. In addition, Accreditation Councils have been set up to assess
the quality o f academic programs in four areas (Computing, Agriculture Education, Teacher
Education, and Business Education).        Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) have been set up in
public HEIs as per agreed criteria. The 20 newly created QECs serve as a focal point for quality
assurancewithin HEIs for improvemento f their academic, teaching and learningstandards.

99.      Recognizing that the success of institutional performance reviews depends on clear and
carefully crafted national standards, HEC has worked closely with national and international
specialists to prepare draft Institutional Accreditation StandarddCriteria aligned to international
norms, and after gaining consensus on them within the academic community. A Quality Assurance
(QA) with clear guidelines to streamline the assessments by QECs has been issued. Finally, the work
to develop criteria for the institutional ranking o f domestic HEIs has begunwith extensive consultation
with stakeholders and usingpasthome grown experience and leading internationalranking practices.

MediumTerm Priorities

100.     To ensure the development o f successful program assessment mechanisms, QAA will: (i)
develop accreditation manuals which will spell out procedures for self-assessments; (ii) out pilot
                                                                                           carry
program accreditation to assessthe appropriateness and effectiveness of the process; and (iii)  establish
additional accreditation councils. The establishment of QECs will be completed in all public HEIS,
and initiated in private ones.       A third party evaluation of existing QECs will be carried out.
Accreditation manuals will be finalized. Program-based ranking o f H E I s will be rolled out.

(c)     Bolster theHigher Education Commission's capacity
Immediate Actions

101.    Implementing HEC's ambitious agenda of reforms requires an efficient, stable, and well
staffed organization. To that end, senior and middle level managers have received training and have
been exposed to best practices in renowned foreign centers. Terms o f Reference for a comprehensive
Human Resource (HR)review have been drafted. The review will examine the current structure o f the
Commission, including the roles and responsibilities o f the central leadership, the middle level
professional staff, and staff of regional directorates, and the division of labor between these various
levels. It will also scrutinize the institutional linkages between the Commissionand the HEIs.

102.    The vast array of reforms launched by HEC has started to pay off, and the academic
community i s generally satisfied with the Commission initiatives. Yet, critiques are also voiced -
sometimes loudly-- often by lack of an effort by HEC to explain the rationale for the reforms and to
highlight their positive outcomes. Recognizing that it is essential for the reforms to be complemented
by a proactive and well-designed communications program with sector stakeholders and the wider
public (including the press), HEC has started drafting a communication strategy.

MediumTerm Priorities

103.     The HR review will be completed, and its recommendations will be shared with stakeholders
from HEC and outside. An action plan will be developed based on the recommendations o f the review,
and measures will be launched according to the action plan. Training plans will be updated in
accordanceto the findings of the review and the action plan.

104.    The communication strategy will be finalized.          HEC will have a communication needs
assessment and a perception survey undertaken. Based on the findings, it will develop a more
aggressive communication approach geared towards both the academic community and the society at
large. A communication specialist will be recruitedto bolster HEC's communication team.

105.    The lack of a comprehensive and effective HEMIS is hampering long-term sectoral planning
(e.g. enrollment and budgetary projections), monitoring and evaluation. Hence, as a start to address
this major deficiency, the Commission has decided to conduct a pilot of the Campus Management
(CM) module application in two HEIs. An internationally used institutional management tool, C M
allows H E I s to manage both academic and financial activities, including enrollments, faculty,
curriculum, equipment and building facilities. Implementation includes training on system operation
and maintenance for HE1staff.

MediumTerm Priorities

106.     The C M pilot project will be expanded to additional HEIs, and the associated training will
continue. Progressive integration of the individual HE1 data bases will be sustained so that a
comprehensive, national HEMIS covering all public H E I s can be started and implemented. Later on,
HEC will seek meansto include private sector H E I s so as to lean towards comprehensive coverage.

(e)     Rationalizefinancialplanning and management in the higher educationsector

107.    While widespread reforms are being carried out in public financial management under the
Bank funded Project for Improvement to Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA), the higher
                                                      25

education sector remains outside the current ambit of these reforms since both HEC and the H E I s are
autonomous, self-accounting entities. However, HEC has embarked upon reforms aimed at increased
effectiveness of expenditures associated with enhanced transparency, quality and reliability o f
financial information. This i s being done through improvements in funds flow mechanisms,
comprehensiveness and timeliness in financial reporting and steps to augment good financial
management across the sector. In addition, HEC has, on its own, initiated measures to enhance
credibility and improve accountability.

ImmediateActions


Ledger Accounts (PLA) . These have now been replaced with Assignment Accounts and related
108.     To improve efficiency in the flow o f funds, the MOF has discontinued the use of Personal

procedures were notified in October 2008. Accordingly the Commission approached MOF for opening
the necessary accounts. The Commission's Assignment account i s now operational and is being used
for release of both development and recurrent budget. It now takes 3 weeks on the average for funds
to be transferred to HEIs for both development and recurrent expenditures.

109.     To ensure that the objective o f producing timely, comprehensive and reliable financial
statements i s achieved, HEC has commenced implementing the principles of the New Accounting
Model (NAM) introduced under the PIFRA. A strategy and plan o f action has been designed for
preparation of NAM based on the International Public Sector Accounting System (IPSAS) compliant
annual financial statements, to be made available for audit within 4 months after the end of each
financial year. Simultaneously, the Commission embarked upon the automation o f accounting
processesthrough SAP/R3 which has beenoperational with effect from July 1,2008.

110.     To provide an analytical underpinning for reforms in the area o f financial governance, HEC
has developed the Terms o f References for a pilot study to be conducted in selected public H E I s vis-a-
vis international best practices in financial management and internal controls such as the COS08
Internal Control Integrated Framework. The study will cover topics including funds flow,
organizational structures, budgeting,accounting policies and procedures, financial reporting and audit
effectiveness (both internal and external). The main output will be the identification o f areas requiring
interventions to facilitate the adoption of NAM principles and eventually lead to the preparation o f
NAM (IPSAS) compliant financial statements. In addition, recommendations for improvements in
internal control structures will be made.

Medium Term Priorities

111.     The recurrent budget allocation will be released within 10 days o f the start o f each quarter,
while the development budget will be released within 15 days o f the start of each half year. This will
allow predictability in the flow o f resources to HEC for preparation o f credible spending plans that
ensure expenditure effectiveness. Following the implementation o f SAP/R3 and adoption of NAM
principles, HEC will prepare and present NAM (IPSAS) compliant annual financial statements o f FY
2008-09 for audit by December 31,2009. Subsequently, the time lag between the close of a fiscal year
and the presentation o fthe financial statementsfor audit should be reduced to 4 months.

112.     The pilot study on financial management practices will be completed. This will help establish
a good practice model for public HEIs which can then feed into a reform strategy with an associated
action plan to enhance the credibility o f expenditures at HEIs. COSO principles would serve as a
guidelinefor this process.

113.     As of FY 2010, HEC will post quarterly budget executionstatements on its website within 6
weeks of the end of each quarter. The availability oftimely and reliablebudget executioninformation
will assist informed decision making. The implementation of SAPR3 will greatly facilitate the
preparation of such reports. Putting these in the public domain will contribute towards greater
transparencyand openness. Over the mediumterm, publicHEIswill beencouragedto follow suit.

@I       Upgradeprocurementperformance in the higher educationsector

114.     While the PPRA issued the Public Procurement Rules in 2004, operationalization of these
rules is still in the making, with implementingregulationsand standard biddingdocuments still under
preparation. This situation creates some degree of vacuum and ambiguity. In order to clarify the
procurement environment in the higher education sector, HEC has taken immediate steps to make
procurementtransparentand efficient, andhas several further measuresready for the yearsto come.

ImmediateActions

115.     Inorder to enhancetransparency inprocurement, HEC hasprepareda comprehensiveDraft
ProcurementHandbookfor goods, works and services and forwarded it to PPRA for comments.
This will be accompanied by the requisite Standard Bidding Documents. In addition, HEC has
commenced posting procurement notices and notices of award on its website in order to make the
procurement processtransparent.

MediumTerm Priorities

116.     Once the Procurement Handbook for goods, works and services (including StandardBidding
Documents) finalized and adopted by HEC, work will commence in two areas: disseminationof the
handbook within HEC and extension of the scope of reform to the HEIs. HEC will ensure that
procurement notices and notices of award for procurements by 25 percent HEIs are posted on its
website. Inorder to gaugethe effectivenessofthe newHandbook a third partyex-post sample reviews
ofprocurementsby 10percentHEIs will be carried out.

117.     A completeprocurementcapacity assessmentwill be carriedout for HEC and a trainingneeds
assessment will be prepared so as to ensure that all personnel engaged in procurement are trained in
the use of the Handbook and best practiceprocurement. Finally, to ensure complete transparency, a
complaints handlingmechanismfor aggrievedbidderswill be establishedand resultswill bepostedon
HEC website.

Pillar 4: EnsuringFiscalSustainabilityand Effectivenessof ExpenditureinHigher Education

118.     Bornafter years ofresourcedeprivationfor the highereducation sector, HEC started itstenure
without too muchattentionto funding, which was easily obtained, thanks to the new priority givento
the sector by the leadership of the country. The Commission is now fully aware of the costs
implications of its program, and is factoring them in its plans. Likewise, HEC is conscious that
resourcesare not unlimited, that trade-offsare to be made amongst sectors, andthat it has to compete
for resources.Therefore, it has to harness solidjustificationsto get the budgetary allocationnecessary
to implementits program. While, by any standards, the share of public resources allocatedto higher
education is still extremely low, the current economic and fiscal crisis has already led HEC to curtail
some of the initial measures contained in the MTDF-HE, and to drop overambitious plans to create
new engineering universities. The fourth pillar is built around these concerns. It reflects the
consensusreachedbetween HEC and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the twofold commitmentof
the former to rationalize spending while implementing its program of reforms and of the latter to
support financiallythis program.


                                                  27

(a)      Secureadequatefunding for higher education within asustainabIeoveraIIjscaIframework
Immediate Actions
119.     Implementingan ambitious platform of programs such as the MTDF-HErequires both a fairly
good picture o f the future costs o f the programs, and a predictable flow o f resources to cover these
costs. This can be achieved only if estimates and forecasts are reliable and if there is a shared
understanding o f the objectives, means and constraints by both the line institution (HEC) and the
financier (MOF and Planning Commission).             The Commission has taken steps to achieve full
consistency with boththe macro framework and the overall education sector.

120.     MOF has approved the Medium-term Financing Framework (MTFF) for higher
education for the FY09/10-to-FY11/12 period, consistent with the Federal government's overall
fiscal framework. A medium-term budgetary perspective is vital for HEC to implementits extensive
reform program in a sustainable manner. The MTFF provides HEC with greater certainty as to the
resources available to carry out its program. At the same time, it also provides the MOF with a better
basis for estimating annual funding allocations to HEC. The MTFF complements the MTDF-HEand
constitutes a platform spelling out the nature o f the parallel obligations o f the two parties (HEC's
commitment to deliver and MOF's commitment to fund). Itrationalizes budgetary negotiations, while
introducingan element of predictability inthe amount o f resources neededfor the sector.

121.     The costs o f the MTDF-HEwere projected using a detailed, comprehensive model based on
demographic trends, intakes from secondary schools, transition rates, etc. Both recurrent and
development costs were estimated on the basis o f the needs linkedto the objectives o f the MTDF-HE
(quality, access, relevance, and governance), differentiated by type of institution. Improvements in
internal efficiency (e.g. student-teacherratios) are factored in.The model yields an estimate o fthe "net
expenditures" which remainto befinanced bythe federal budget.

122.     Projections on the revenue side take are based on the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
Limitation Act of 2005, which commits the Government to at least a doubling o f the budgetary
allocation to the entire education sector as a share o f GDP between FY 2002 and FY 2012. This
translates into an increase of this share from 1.7 percent to 3.4 percentg. This is the absolute "floor"
set by the Act. However, the considerable needs o f the pre-university sector must be recognized. To
that end, a cap o f 21 pe rcent for the share o f higher education expenditures in total education
expenditures was built into the MTFF. Finally, non-governmental resources, whether through higher
student fees, through generation of HEIs' own resources or through further involvement o f the private
sector were projectedto increase, in order to minimizereliance on sole public monies.

123.     The MTFF parameters provide the basis for HEC to receive the funds necessaryto implement
the MTDF-HEand to ensure that the Government ison a pathto meetingits education sector spending
commitments. As a first concrete step, to implement the MTFF, the MOF has released quarterly
recurrent and development grants to HEC as per FY 2008/09 allocations for the third and
fourth quarters.

MediumTerm Priorities

124.     In order to the MTFF to remain a realistic instrument, it needs to be constantly adjusted.
Hence, HEC will update its resource requirements and forecasts. Similarly, the MOF allocations to
HEC recurrent and development budget will be revisited and readjusted in subsequent years on the
basis of the rolling MTFF so that it will allow HEC to achieve its medium term objectives.

(b)      Adjust the mechanism of resource allocation
Immediate Actions

125.      HEC has introduced a formula to allocate recurrent budgetary resources to H E I s in a
transparent manner. The formula i s an innovative feature, replacing the traditional historical approach
of a negotiated allocation based on previous year budget. The formula takes three parameters into
consideration: (i)student numbers weighted for area o f study, (ii)grading and performance - as
measured by the number of MPhil and PhD students and the number o f faculty with PhDs, and (iii)a
compensation factor to counterbalance previous resource allocation inequalitiesamong HEIs.

MediumTerm Priorities

126.      While this formula representeda significant advance and has worked well, HEC has identified
a need to increasethe link between funding and HE1allocations. Inorder to address this, the resource
allocation formula for public HEIs will be refined and a revisedformula will be tested.

(c)       Diversify sources offinds for HEIs

127.      In2006/07, about one-third oftotal revenuesofpublic HEIs were from non-government funds
generated from a range o f sources, including tuition fees, college affiliation fees, exam fees and other
sources such as hostel charges. Public H E I s currently generate very little money from contract
research, commercial ventures, fundraising, endowments or other philanthropic sources. A number o f
H E I s - and particularly older established universities - own assets such as land and buildings which
have the potential to generate substantial revenues. The Commission is beefing up its efforts to
encourageH E I s to garner extra-budgetary sources of revenues.

Immediate Actions

128.      Fully engaged in re-adjustingthe MTDF-HE and updating the MTEF, HEC has opened
discussions regarding the diversification of resources. It has also invited private sector organizations
to fund scholarships inpublic HEIs.

MediumTerm Priorities
129.      Consultants will be recruited to develop a strategy to encourage HEIs to increase non-
government sources of finding through better use o f assets at their disposal. The strategy will include
asset management/endowment techniques, larger use of asset holdings at H E I s and potential release of
regulatory or policy barriers to revenue generation. A roadmap to implement the strategy will be
designed and pilots will be launched inHEIs on a voluntary basis.

(4        Optimize resource management in HEIs
Immediate Actions

130.      HEC has begun collecting benchmark data on the cost of delivery o f non-core services in
public HEIs. This exercise will lay the ground for the development of a framework for public-private
partnerships (PPP) in the area o f non-core services. It is expected that it will provide valuable
information to both HEC and HEIs, allow comparisons within the public sector, between public and
private HEIs and with HEIs in other jurisdictions and give examples o f good practice both within and
outside Pakistan.




                                                   29

Medium Term Priorities

131.     HEC will completethe collection of data on the cost of non-core services, benchmarkthe cost
of delivery of these services across H E I s and disseminate information collected. This will provide a
basis for assessing the scope for increased efficiency in the delivery of non-core services, and will
allow HEC to develop and pilot a toolkit to supportHEIsundertakingPPP inthe provision of non-core
services such as hostels, transportation,food services, IT and security.

132.     HEC will also explore how to make greater use of the private sector in the financing, design,
construction and operation of public HE infrastructure. To kick-start this, the HEC will develop a
policy of encouraging the private provision of infrastructure at HEIs (private finance initiatives),
including benchmarkingpublic and private sector managed building and operational costs. A special
attention will be given to a particularly promising and common type of PPP arrangement, the
Build/Operate/Transfer (BOT) type of arrangement, by which the private sector finances, designs,
constructsand operates a public facility under a contract with the government for a given period.


            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

    A. LinktoCAS


133.      The HESP is fully consistent with the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was
approvedby the Board in June 2006. The CAS hadthree inter-relatedand mutually reinforcing pillars
linked to the strategic pillars of the PRSP: (i)sustaining growth and improving competitiveness; (ii)
improving government effectiveness and service delivery; and (iii)improving lives and protecting the
vulnerable. The CAS identified sustainable growth as an essential pre-requisite for long term poverty
reduction. By supporting Pakistan's drive to improve access to, quality and relevance of, higher
education, thus preparing a skilled workforce ready to spearhead the country's growth ambitions the
HESP is aligned with these priorities. Should the program progress satisfactorily, the Bank potential
programmaticengagement inthe higher educationsector will be clearly reflected inthe next CAS.

134.      Bank engagement in the higher education sector at the federal level through the HESP DPC
is guided by the strategic principles of the CAS: (a) client pull; (b) scaling up / replicating approaches
that have already provedto be effective; and (c) focusing on outcomes.

    B. Collaborationwith the IMFand Other Donors
135.      The IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded in
December 2004, and the Government did not request a successor program. Until October 2008
Pakistan was on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule. The consultations concluded in
December2007 highlighted the widening current account deficit as the economy's main vulnerability.
In May 2008, the IMF concludedthat a major fiscal adjustment effort accompaniedby a substantial
tightening of monetary policy and further exchange rate depreciation would be needed to contain
inflation while reducingthe current account deficit. At the request of the Pakistaniauthorities, an IMF
mission visited Islamabadin September 2008 to provide technical input to quantifying the economic
stabilization package being developed by the authorities and preparing an updated medium-term
macroeconomic framework. In light of the deteriorating balance of paymentsposition and substantial
financing needs, the authoritiesenteredinto an IMF-supported 23-month SBA in November 2008.

136.      The Bank is collaborating actively with development partners at the federal and provincial
levels, including through the PRES0 at the national level, and provision of technical assistance for
analytical and strategic work linked with the provincial reform program. Other developmentpartners
such as EC, NORAD, GTZ and DFID are complementing the Bank work in the NWFP, Punjab and
                                                    30

Sindh. However, until now, few development partners were significantly involved in supporting
higher education in Pakistan. USAID,JICA and the British Council provide a large number of
scholarships.

      C. Relationshipto OtherBankOperations
137.      The proposed E S P is closely linked to several ongoing/ planned operations in the country.
Itcomplements education projects in Punjab, NWFP and Sindh (which focus on increasing access and
quality at basic and secondary education levels) as well as the National Education Assessment System
(NEAS) project. Finally, the public financial management reforms supported by the HESP
complement those being implemented under the platform o f the PIFRA, to improve the overall
fiduciary environment and enhancethe accountabilityprocess inthe use o f public resources.

      D. LessonsLearned
138.      The HESP will be the first DPC inhighereducation inthe South Asia Region. Itbuilds upon
lessons learned from previous policy based lending operations in Pakistan and from Bank experience
of policy reform programs ineducation inother countries. The key lessons include:

         Strong political commitment and leadership are essential for a successful policy reform
         programto improve humandevelopment and reduce poverty;

         Technically rigorous monitoring, evaluation and research studies are required to assess
         progress, measureresults and outcomes, and guide the development o ffuture policy reforms;

         Analytical and advisory activities that increase the knowledge base and advance the policy
         agendaplay an important role inthe deepening and broadening o f the reform program;

         Strategic selection and sequencing of reforms i s critical, along with appropriate capacity
         buildingmeasures,to ensure deep and lasting impact on human development;

         Open consultation and communication with the community which the reforms will affect,
         serve, and benefit are essential for buildingconsensusamongst stakeholders and for successful
         implementationof sector-wide reforms.

      E. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

139.      The policy actions supported by the proposed operation are based on earlier analytical work
and the on extensive policy dialogue held during the preparation of the Pakistan Higher Education
Policy Note that was requested by MOF. They also draw heavily on international good practices in
higher education - carefully contextualizedto the Pakistani environment (Table 8 provides a summary
o f linkages ofthe proposed reform actions and the analytical reports).

140.      Some of the measures included in the program derive directly from the diagnosis and
recommendations of these previous works, for instance: (i)Study #I        (item 3) @ Capping higher
education expenditures as a share of total education; (ii)Study # 3 (item 1) and Study # 7 (item 4) C3
Tenure track concept; (iii)Study # 3 (item 3) C3 Generalization of HEMIS; (iv) Study # 3 (item 7) and
Study # 5 (item 4) C3 Development o f the MTFF; (v) Study # 6 @ Revisedcriteria for establishment
ofprivate universities; and (vi) Study # 7 ( item 1) C3 Creation o fthe Quality Assurance Agency.

         V.      THEPROPOSEDHIGHEREDUCATION SUPPORT PROGRAM

    A. OperationDescription
141.      The proposed HESP Credit (US$ 100 million) is a Policy Development Credit designed to
support the Government of Pakistan's MTDF-HE. The overarching, long-term, objective of the
Framework i s to create the conditions for enhancing the stock of skilled Pakistanis able to contribute
to an economy increasingly based on knowledge, innovation and technology. The Higher Education
Commission has started to implement the MTDF-HE, and i s planning to sustain and intensify its
efforts to rehabilitate the higher education sector o f Pakistan, with the support o fthe HESP.

    B. PolicyAreas
142.      The proposed operation is expectedto yield complementary andclosely intertwinedbenefits.

    0    Knowledge Society: Pakistan ranked 91st in the Global Competitiveness Report (2006/07).
         Even more telling, it ranked 104th for the education and training module inthe same report.
         By supportingreforms aimed at increasing access, boosting quality and improvingrelevance,
         the proposed operation will contribute to harness the potential of an enlarged pool o f young
         graduates, to improve labor productivity, and eventually, to sustain growth. Similarly,
         Pakistan i s lagging behind interms of investment in science and technology, and runs serious
         risksto be outpaced by its competitors and to missthe benefits of globalization. By supporting
         the MTDF-HEmeasures to encourage research, the HESP will contribute to the renewal o f
         research with higher quality standards, to build the chain linkingresearch and innovation and
         ultimately, to integrate the academic world and the economic sphere.

    0    Poverty reduction: Through its impact on growth, the proposed operation will have an
         indirect, long-term effect on the general level of poverty. The Government forecasts an
         increase of the GDP per capita from its current $900 level to $1150 by 2010. Improving the
         general level of education and especially o f those who will be working in the growth driving
         sectors is a prerequisite to achieve these results. The proposed operation will contribute to
         ensure that this prerequisite i s met and sustained.

         Lower Zevels of education: Despite recent progress, the GER in secondary education is still
         hovering at 44 percent and quality of education is poor at this level. The supply of quality
         teachers is a key ingredient to change this situation. By focusing on the quality of education at
         the tertiary level, the proposed operation will contribute inthe long runto enhance quality at
         lower levels o f education. Research conducted in universities on education will also help
         identify the main factors impedinga sustainable expansion of quality basic education.

    0    Contribution to fiscal stability: Growth cannot take place without macroeconomic stability.
         Reliable projections of expenditures are a critical factor to achieve predictability o f budget
         outlays and to reduce fiscal turbulences. The multi-year medium term financial framework
         supported by this operation, and the agreement reached between HEC and MOF on the basis
         of the MTDF-HEwill introduce more rationality and objectivity in the budgetary process, and
         will make this process less dependent on political vicissitudes.


    0    Signaling effects: Transparent management, accountability and performance are important
         factors. By supporting the Government's reforms to introduce such features and to promote
         good governance in universities, the HESP is expected to have spill-over effects outside o f the
         higher education sector, thanks to the emergence o f a new cohort o f leaders trained in an
         improved governance environment. Similarly, the efforts to bring closer together the public

                                                     33

           and private sectors in providing quality teaching and research are expected to have long term
           positive externalities. Finally, as highly educated citizens tend to be less prone to violence,
           increasing participation inhigher education may contribute to improve security.

143.        The HESP supports the completion of initial reforms in the areas where it is critical to signal
a strong political will and to establish credibility both vis 6 vis all stakeholders. The most strategic of
these reforms constitute the prior actions which have been completed. Box 2 lists these prior actions.
The Policy Framework (PF) summarizes goals, prior actions, and main indicators under each pillar
(Box 3). The PF was prepared on the basis of good practice principles for conditionality (Box 4).
However, HEC i s committed to pursue these reforms in the subsequent years, and to take further
measures to sustain and complement those already implemented. They are reported in the Policy
Matrix (PM) -Annex 2).

                                     Box 4. Good PracticePrinciplesfor Conditionality

Principle I:Reinforce Ownership

After decades of abandon, higher education has become a focus o f concern from the leadership o f the country
when HEC took over the destiny o f the sector in 2002. This operation is the logical follow-up o f an initial
request by the MOF to the Bank to assess the HEC's program. The strong initial political support to the reforms
undertaken by HEC has survivedthe change o f government. As preparation o f the operation proceeded, HEC
staff got deeply engaged in the DPC approach and in the translation o f the MTDF-HE into the PM, and
ownership became stronger and stronger. The P M is a genuinely joint product, mostly home-grown document
fed with consultations with the academic and scientific communities.

Principle 2:Agree upfront with the Governmentand otherfinancialpartners on a coordinatedaccountability
framework

The Bank support, as summarized in the P M has been discussed at length with the HEC leadership and staff,
shared with universityrepresentatives (from both the public and private sectors), and its parameters have been
carehlly adjusted and adapted to the local situation. The P M and the PF were also shared with other financial
partners. However, until very recently, few o f the latter were involved in the university sector, other than
through scholarship programs. The MTFF agreed upon between the MOF, HEC and the Bank provides a solid
platform for any partner deciding to support the sector inthe future.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank support to country
circumstances

As the HESP is the first DPC in higher education in South Asia, the accountability framework o f the operation
was designed based on specific national circumstances. As the measures and actions contained in the P M are
strictly echoing the Government's reform package, the outcomes and indicators to measure them are by
definition rooted in the country's own reality, rather than being dictated by abstract theory or dogma. The
procurement and financial management measures built in the operation reflect those taken by the Government in
the larger context, includingthe PRES0 andthe PRSC.

Principle 4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

A consensus has been reached with HEC to select seven prior actions conditioning disbursement, distributed
across all four pillars o f the Policy Framework. There are many more milestones, which will help monitoring
                                                                  36

 progress inthe implementationof the reform package,and are tools for HEC to follow upits own work, andtake
 remedialactions incase of departure from initial plans.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable and performance-basedfinancial
 support

 Regular reviews will be conducted both by the Government and by the Bank, based on the framework of
 outcome indicatorsspelled out inthe PM. A Steering Committee chaired by the ExecutiveDirector of HEC will
 convene on a regular basis to monitor progress. The Bank team will also follow up closely both from the
 Country Office and through regular and adequately staffed missions. These joint reviews will allow avoiding
,unexpecteddevelopments, andwillpermitthepredictabilityoftheflow offinancialsupport.



                                VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

     A. Povertyand Social Impacts
 144.    Currently, higher education in Pakistan i s still at the elitist stage, with a minute proportion o f
 the relevant cohort attending universities (or even colleges). Those who have made it to this level of
 education have gone through a succession of filters during their basic education period. Academic
 performance aside, most of these filters are of a social nature. Consequently, those attending higher
 education today are not only few, they are also socially marked, but the room to radically alter this
 pattern at this level is limited. Yet, by supporting actions to expand access, the proposed operation
 will contribute to reduce this social bias. However, HEC is going further than simply increasing the
 number enrolled, and is also implementing a program of scholarships which will proactively address
 equity concerns and open up university doors to children o f families for whom higher education was
 until now unaffordable because of its (direct and indirect) costs. The scholarship program will be
 paralleled by a loan scheme targeting students who do not fall in the poorest category, but still need
 support to continue studying. Inparallel, campuses are being open in disadvantaged regions and for
 women. Based on these various measures and the improvement o f the situation in lower levels of
 education, it i s expected that the GER for the lowest two quintiles combined will increase from 2.4
 percent to 3 percent within the next 4 years.

 145.      In addition to its direct equity impact, the HESP will also indirectly contribute to global
 poverty reduction in the long run. Such an indirect contribution has been documented in countries
 such as South Korea, which have invested heavily in education at all levels, and have harvested both
 substantial growth rates and drastic reduction of their poverty levels.

     B. EnvironmentalAspects
 146.      The reforms and policies supported by the proposed loan to strengthen Pakistan's higher
 education sector do not entail significant negative effects on Pakistan's environment, forests, or other
 natural resources. The Government's reform program includes the rehabilitation of university
 buildings and minor extension o f existing infrastructures. These civil works could be associated with
 minor negative environmentaleffects. The operation could entail positive environmental effects to the
 extent that policies are associatedwith increasednumbers of highly skilled Pakistanis that can develop
 environmental friendly technologies, conduct environmental research, and are prepared for strategic
 positions inthe environmental sector. Pakistan's environmental institutional framework, coupled with
 the adoption o f environmental safeguard standards for the expected civil works, constitutes an
 adequateframework to address the potential environmental effects of the operation.

 147.      The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA) o f 1997 is the cornerstone o f the
 country's environmental legislation. PEPA establishesthe general conditions, tools, and organizational
 responsibilities for pollution prevention and control. Agencies with responsibilities for implementing

                                                       37

and enforcing the Act's provisions include the Pakistan Environmental ProtectionCouncil (PEPC), the
Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pakistan EPA), the provincial Environmental Protection
Agencies, and Environmental Tribunals. Within this framework, federal authorities are mainly
responsible for policy formulation and provision of resources and oversight to the provinces, while
provincial authorities play the prominent role in implementing such policies and monitoring
compliancewith them.

148.      The National Environmental Policy (NEP) of 2005 constitutes an overarching framework for
achieving the goals o f sustainable development through protection, conservation, and restoration of
Pakistan's environment. Among the key instruments identified by NEP for its implementation is the
integration o f environment into development planning, including the diligent enforcement of PEPA's
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) provisions. NEP also recognizes the need to strengthen the
capacity o f federal, provincial, and district governments as a necessary condition for NEP
implementation.

149.      The Strategic Country Environmental Analysis (SCEA) prepared by the Bank identifies
Pakistan's main environmental challenges linked to economic growth and assesses the country's
institutional and organizational capacity to overcome such challenges. The SCEA found that the
legislative and environmental management framework i s largely in place in Pakistan. However, the
SCEA also provides recommendations to strengthen the capacity of environmental agencies to
anticipate and respondto environmentalchallenges.

    C. Implementation,Monitoring, and Evaluation
150.      The overall implementation and monitoringo f reforms is being coordinated and managed by
the Higher Education Commission. The Commission is led by the Chairman", who is granted the
status of a Federal Minister,and the Executive Director who is appointed as the head o f the Secretariat
(with the status o f a Federal Secretary) and is responsible for the implementation of the orders,
directives and policies o f the Commission. HEC consists o f various departments headed by Members
and Advisors who manage major activities ofthe Commission. Some o f the activities at the provincial
level will be facilitated by the HEC's Regional Centers (Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar). HEC has an
impressive track record, and has managed to launch and carry out a number of key reforms, including
some politically sensitive ones (e.g. the tenure track system). However, the Commission's capacity
both at the central and at the regional level needs to be strengthened. A Human Resources Review
will be undertaken and implementationof its recommendations will follow suit.

151.      The implementation of reform actions related to the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness o f
expenditure in higher education i s jointly managed by HEC and the Expenditure Unit of the MOF.
This dual responsibility is critical to ensure the continuity of the dialogue between the MOF and the
Commission andto avoid major turbulences in either the program or its funding.

152.      The development o f a comprehensive and effective Higher Education Management
Information System (HEMIS) and capacity strengthening at the central level (HEC) and at each HE1
are the key reform actions under the Program (Pillar 3).        The reforms aim to enhance timely and
reliable data collection and data analysis and to institutionalize strategic planning processes at the
HEC and the institutions. Inthe long run, only an efficient HEMISwill allow rigorous follow-up.

153.      The monitoring of various reform actions is being done by the respective departments which
are implementing the activities together with the M&E Department of HEC. Each responsible


lo Since December 2008, the position is held by an acting Chairperson, Ms. Shahnaz Wazir Ali, who is also an
Advisor to the Prime Minister for Human Development. An active search process to select a full-time
chairperson is underway.
                                                    38

department will be accountable for gathering data necessary to monitor the indicators attached to the
reforms. Because of the rigidity o f the system, the full outcomes of most reforms undertaken will
occur and be observable only after a few year lag. Rigorous evaluation of the reforms will be possible
only once their outcomes starts coming. However, both HEC and H E I s will start planning such
evaluation by setting up baseline data. The academic community will be called upon for a number of
tasks related to quality improvement. HEC will commission independent agencies to conduct third
party assessments ina number of sensitive areas such as the tenure track system.

    D. FiduciaryAspects
Country Context

154.      The Pakistan Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) of December 2003
highlighted improvements in expenditure reporting and monitoring, and stated that budget support
operations disbursed and managed through Government's financial management systems have
satisfactory outcomes. However, it also underscored the need for building institutional and human
resource capacity to support the transition to full reliance on Government systems, controls, and
financial reporting. It revealed weaknesses in data reliability, particularly at the sub-national level.
In accounting and financial reporting, challenges that remain to be addressed are: (i)creation of
internal audit units in departments to improve internal controls; and (ii)finalization o f the Controller
General o f Accounts' (CGA) control over organization, staffing, and training arrangements with
clearly definedroles and responsibilities for staff reporting.

155.      In addition, a PEPFM" review has recently been carried out. The review concluded, inter
alia, that expenditure effectiveness would be fostered by a concerted review and revision o f
Government business processes to eliminate redundant procedures in expenditure commitment and
payments, particularly for the development budget.

156.      Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessments (PFMAA) for the provinces
of Balochistan, Punjab, and NWFP were completed in May 2007, and identified deficiencies in
internal audit and controls, and budget credibility. These assessments were based on the PEFA"
PFMI3Performance Measurement Framework. Reform strategies are being formulated to bridge the
gaps. A federal-level PFMAA, using the same PEFA framework i s currently in progress and a draft
report is ready for discussion with the stakeholders.

157.      A series of actions and initiatives are already being implemented to achieve enhanced
accountability and effectiveness of public expenditures. These include both technical and institutional
reforms which are mainly driven by the Bank funded Project for Improvement to Financial Reporting
and Auditing (PIFRA). For better accounting and financial reporting, PIFRA has prepared a NAM
which has introduced an IMF GFS compliant Chart o f Accounts (CoA). As o f FY 2007, the federal,
provincial and district Governments are preparing their budgets on CoA. An automated budget
compilation accounting and reporting system using the sophisticated SAPO33 is being implemented
country wide. To enhance effectiveness of external audit, a risk-based audit methodology, compliant
with international standards, is being rolled out. It has already been applied to federal government
accounts for FY 2006. Introduction of an Audit Management Information Systemis also underway.

158.      HEC and the H E I s are autonomous, `self accounting entities'. PIFRA is being rolled out to
such entities in phases, starting from FY 2009. Eventually, HEC will be required to adopt NAM. The
Commission, being keen to accelerate this implementation, held detailed discussions with the PIFRA
directorate for a fast-track roll-out. Since funds were available, HEC decided to avoid administrative
and bureaucratic delays and independently acquired the SAP/R3 software and proceeded with the
adoption o f NAM. Accordingly, it is now excluded from the scope of PIFRA roll-out. Functional
specifications are being reviewed by PIFRA experts to ensure consistency with NAM. The private
H E I s have varied practices, but all recently established H E I s are required to put in place double-entry
accounting systems and get their annual accounts audited by Chartered Accountants.

Procurement

159.      The 2000 CPAR calls for a number of institutional and procedural reforms in public
procurement in Pakistan. Inconjunction with the Bank's assistance, it has served as an agenda for the
Bank's efforts for procurement reforms in Pakistan. These reforms are a necessary part o f good
governance and transparency in the use o f public funds. To achieve the procedural / institutional
reforms being sought, the key recommendationwas the adoption of a comprehensive law governing
public procurement. There has been progress at varying paces inthe area of procurement reform.

160.      At the Federal level, the PPRA has been created and the Public Procurement Rules of 2004
have been notified. HEC, being an organization under the purview o f the Federal Government, is
subject to the 2004 Public Procurement Rules, and i s in the process o f preparing a Procurement
Manual in order to streamline its procurement processes as well as take a number of steps that will
lendfurther transparency to the process.

161.      Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank: An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the State
Bank of Pakistan was conducted in 2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities, in particular
relating to SBP financial statementsand disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable central bank
standards. However, since 2001 the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have
been mitigated. SBP is currently producing financial statements consistent with international
accounting standards and formats. An independent review of SBP's internal audit function has been
completed and the recommendations implemented. SBP has also established a process o f reconciling
data reported to the IMF, and implementedguidelines to prohibit operations that pledge or encumber
reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability of, foreign exchange reserves
outside the authorized framework. Also, the SBP Act has been accordingly amended to strengthen its
independence and autonomy inthe management of reserves.

OverallFiduciaryEnvironment

162.      Having due regardto the measuresfor mitigation o f the risks associatedwith management o f
the country's foreign exchange reserves by SBP, the highest level of commitment demonstrated for
country-wide reforms in financial management being carried out under PIFRA and the initiatives
being taken by HEC for improvement inprocurement practices and financial governance inthe higher
education sector, the overall fiduciary risk associatedwith this operation is rated `modest'.

     E. DisbursementandAuditing
163.      Borrower and Credit Agreement:         This proposed Credit would be made to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The IDA Credit proceeds,
amounting to the equivalent of US$ 100 million, would be transferred to the Federal Government in
accordance with the terms of the FinancingAgreement (FA).

                                                     40

164.      Fundsflow arrangementsfor the Credit: The proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a
single tranche basis upon Credit Effectiveness to the foreign exchange account o f the Government of
Pakistan heldwith the State Bank o f Pakistan. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds inthe Account will,
within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund of the Government o f Pakistan
(Account No. 1-Non-Food) heldwith the SBP which is usedto finance budgetary expenditures.

165.      Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund for activities to be financed under the Program
by the Government o f Pakistan shall not be linked to any specific purchases, and no special
procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds of the Credit shall, however, not be applied to
finance expenditures in the negative list as defined in Appendix 1 o f the FA. If any portion of the
Credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the FA, IDA shall require the
Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refundthe amount equal to the amount o f the said
payment to IDA.Amounts refundedto IDA upon such request shall be cancelled from the Credit.

166.      Accounting and Assurance Requirements for the Credit: The SBP, on behalf o f the
Government, shall maintain an appropriate accounting system in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. For this Credit, since no special fiduciary arrangements are required, no
additional assurancerequirements inthe form o f a formal audit shall apply, in the light o f the fiduciary
environment as established with the management o f foreign exchange reserves by the SBP. However,
within 45 days of disbursement ofthe Credit by IDA, the Finance Secretary, Ministry of Finance shall
provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying the receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the Credit into
the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Pakistan, the date of the receipt, and the
exchange rate applied to translate the Credit currency into Rupees.

     F. RisksandMitigation
167.      The overall rating for the operation after mitigation is "substantial". There are several risks
associatedwith both the reform program and the proposed operation. However, the potential benefits,
together with the high level o f commitment and ownership in the country are deemed to offset these
risksandtojustify the Bank's support to the reforms withthe proposedHESP.

Political situation:

168.     Pakistan has beenthrough a period of highturbulences. There are still concerns regarding the
impact o f the economic policy response to the macroeconomic imbalances and possible differences
amongst main political parties on a variety of issues, against the backdrop of local fundamentalism,
regional conflicts, and intense internationalpressure.

Mitigation: The medium-termpolicy framework to which the Government is committed minimizes the
risks associatedwith the impact of the measures to address the economic situation. While the political
risksremain substantial at a general level, they may not affect highereducation becauseof unanimous
support to the sector and as these reforms have been supported through the political changes of the last
12- 18 months.

Uncertain macroeconomicsituation:

169.     The overall macroeconomic situation is fragile with attendant risks of a balance of payments
crisis, significant slowdown in growth, and fiscal pressures crowding out poverty-related spending.
Following a sharp deterioration in fiscal and current account deficits caused by oil and food price
shocks compounded by political uncertainty, the authorities developed a stabilization program and
entered into an IMF SBA in November 2008. At the first quarterly review o f the SBA in February
2009, the stabilization program remained on track. The rapid decline in international commodity and
oil prices since August 2008 has reduced the risks, facilitated improvement inthe external position and

                                                   41

the achievement o f targets. However, given the global economic crisis, the medium-term outlook
presents significant downside risks. The sharp deterioration in the global economic and financial
outlook poses significant risks to exports, remittances and external financing. Even though projections
in these areas as well as forecasts about the speed of real economy recovery were significantly
moderated during the first program review inFebruary2009, they may still turn out to be optimistic.

Mitigation; (a) The Bank plays a leading role in helpingPakistan and other stakeholders to mobilize
needed resources; (b) Active, high level dialogue on macro targets and coordinated response with
IMF and other donors to assist with formulation and implementation of stabilization measures and
provide financing as appropriate; (c) Work, together with government and donors, to sustain
momentum for ongoing reforms to strengthen the environment for investment and growth; (d) Strong
analytical work to support the Government economic team in developing and implementing policy
measuresfor stabilization; (e) Both the PRES0 and the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act
will mitigate risks that measures to reduce budget deficits lead to a reduction o f spending on
education.

Inter- and intra Sectoral Trade-offs:

170.    While education and higher education in particular are currently high in the priority ladder o f
the country's leaders, a shift in inter-sectoral priorities, and even their reversal remain possible. There
is a risk that the emphasis given to higher education will be questioned on the grounds that basic
education should be given the absolute priority until Education for All is achieved and primary
education becomes universal.

Mitigation: There is a wide consensus amongst mainstream political parties regarding the need to
offset Pakistan's lagging performance in the higher education sector, and to raise universities to
international standards, so that they will become real engines of growth. Both the "Vision 2030" and
the PRSP put higher education as one o fthe main ingredients to build "Pakistan Inc".
The risk that higher education would crowd out basic education i s mitigated by capping the share o f
the education budgetallocatedto higher education

Internal resistance:

171.    First, it could originate from faculty staff uncomfortable with accountability and academic
performance (e.g. tenure track system).         Second, it could come from administrators who feel
threatened by the introduction of stringent accountability rules. Thirdly, it could come from students
ideologically opposed to any reform that results ingreater cost-sharing and/or partnership with private
business. All three constituents may form a common front, and paralyze HEC's efforts to reform the
system.

Mitigation; A major effort to engage in earlier consultation and in continuous dialogue with
stakeholders should reduce - but not to eliminate-- these risks.       HEC will initiate a communication
strategy to engage the academic community and to spell out the benefits expected from the reforms.
However, universities can always become hostage o f political rivalries regardless of the scope o f
reforms engaged (and ofthe expected benefits) and there is no recipeto fully avoid this risk.

Uneven institutional capacity:

172.    Capacity constraints exist at two levels: (a) At the HEC level, the scope of reforms may
overstretch the implementation capacity o f the Commission. Another risk i s linked to the fact that the
chairman's position has been vacant since the resignation of the first incumbent. Additionally, if HEC
were to lose its autonomous status, it would also lose its reformist capacity and its efficient modus


                                                    42

operandi; (b) at the institution level, administrative and faculty staff may become overwhelmed by
increased daily management, planning activities and quality control requirements.


Mitigation: (a) HEC: The program is carefully sequenced, and reforms are introduced gradually. An
institutional review will be carried out, leading to a redefinition o f tasks and skill mix. HEC has been
satisfactorily functioning during the absence o f a chairman, with both the Commission fulfilling its
oversight role and the executive director in charge o f implementingreforms. A search process is
underway, and an eminent chairperson i s to be appointed shortly. Finally, the benefits o f keepingHEC
as an autonomous agency are recognized by the Government; (b) HEIs: Improvements in the
governance structure and massive training programs for faculty and administrative staff i s expected
build capacity andto mitigate these risks.

Fiduciary Issues:

173.     Budget support operations carry the generic risks associatedwith weak financial management
and procurement capacity.

Mitigution: Fiduciary risks are mitigated by (i) improved accounting and recording practices under the
PIFRA regime; (ii)the introduction of new audit methodology; (iii)the capacity building of the
financial management staff in HEiIs; and (iv) the progressive alignment o f procurement rules to
internationalbest practices.

                                     Higher Education Support Program:
                                            Letter of Development Policy
     Dear Mr.Zoellick,

     I. 1 am writing to request, on behalf of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
     (Government), for the PakistanHigher Education Support Program (HESP) of US% 100 million to create
    the conditions to enhance the stock o f skilled Pakistanis able to contribute to an economy increasingly
     based on knowledge innovation and technology, through an overhaul of the university sector. This Letter
    o f Development Policy sets out the Government's key policy actions under the reform program o f the
    Higher Education Commission (HEC) as articulated in the Medium Term Development Framework
    (MTDF) of the Commission. The Government is seekingsupport for the MTDFo f the HEC which aims to
    increase participation, enhance quality and relevance and strengthen the efficiency and sustainability of
    higher educationinstitutions(HEls).

    2.        Despite the fact that the higher education sector received substantial government support since
    2002, the sector lags behind other countries in the region in terms of various indicators. The enrolment
    percentageof the students in the age group of 17-23 year in HEIs is lower than other comparablecountries
    inthe region. Furthermore. the output ofthe higher educationsector was not aligned with the needs of the
    economy --whether in quantitative or qualitative terms. It was also out of sync with the requirementsof a
    modern, tolerant and open society. In order to address the disconnect between what is expected from the
    sector and what the latter can offer, HEC has launcheda series o f reforms to rehabilitate higher education
    institutions (HEls) and make them more relevantto the needs of the 21st Century.

    3.        In the year 2002 the Governmentof Pakistanset up HEC which developeda MTDF, covering the
    period from 2005-20IO. The MTDF identifies major issues faced by the higher education sector and offers
    a long term vision and strategy. This strategic framework is built around four core aims and three
    supporting or cross cutting aims. The core aims are: (i)Faculty Development; (ii)Improving Access and
    Learning; (iii)Excellence in Research; and (iv) Relevance to National Priorities. In order to achieve these
    four objectives three cross cutting and supportive aims were identified: (t) Leadership, Governance and
    Management; (ii)Quality Assessment, Standards and Accreditation; and (iii)Infrastructure Development:
    Physical and Technological.

    4.       Building on the MTDF, HEC's vision for higher education in responding to domestic and global
    challenges, with the practicalsteps neededto deliver the HEC's contribution to the reform agenda is based
    on the following main pillars:

        Pillar 1      Improvingthe quality andrelevanceofteaching and research
        Pillar 2  --
                  --  Expandingaccess and enhancingequity in Higher Education.
        Pillar 3      Strengtheningthe Governance and Managemento f Higher Education
        Pillar 4      Improvingfiscal sustainability and effectivenessof expenditure in Higher Education.


    5.       The HEC has developed itself as an Organization that intends to move forward aggressively to
    achieve the goals as elucidated in the above Pillars. HEC progressto date and remainingactions under the
    Program are documented in the following pages. HEC envisages continuation of implementation o f these
    programs till the time that these are incorporated into the routine activities o f the HEls when HEC will
    limit its role as a facilitator, promoter and an auditor.




                                                       45

Pillar 1: Improving the qualitvand relevance of teaching and research:

6.      This pillar focuses on the three core aims of the MTDF, namely faculty development, improving
access and learning, and excellence in research with the cross cutting theme o f quality assurance and
standards.  *


7.       Faculty Development: Only about 28% of the faculty o f public sector universities has PhD degrees
in the year 2002-03. The need for faculty development within the higher education sector lies at the heart
of the HEC's reform process, and an area in which vital and significant progress has been made. With a
dual objective o f increasing institutional capacity and enhancing local research activities, a three pronged
strategy was designed to achieve these objectives. Firstly, it developed a program o f indigenous and
foreign scholarships strongly focused towards PhD studies primarily aimed at improving the academic
qualifications o f university faculty. Secondly, as an immediate measure it started a foreign faculty hiring
program both on short and long term basis. Thirdly, it focused on capacity building of existing faculty
through the Learning Innovation Department and National Academy of Higher Education programs by
organizing courses, workshops and seminars to build pedagogicalskills aimed at improving the quality o f
faculty at universities.

8.      Several scholarship programs for enhancing qualifications of the existing and new faculty of the
HEls as well as to attract people in the open market who wish to join as university faculty were launched
from the very inception of the HEC. To date, under 21 different scholarship schemes for PhD studies in
international universities, 14,367 candidates were shortlisted for intensive out o f which 2,825 successful
candidates are already abroad. A total of 198 scholars have completed their education and have returned
and are serving in Pakistani institutions; mostly at public sector HEls but a few in public-sector R&D
organizations. Similarly, 4,173 PhD scholarships have been awarded under Indigenous PhD Program and
these studentsare currently pursuing PhD studiesall across Pakistanin public and private universities.

9.      To meet the immediate shortfall of well-trained faculty, 289 highly qualified foreign professors
including 92 foreign nationals have been hired under the Foreign Hiring Faculty Program and placed on
long term assigruiients across the county. Additionally, 175 foreign Professors are working on short term
assignments.

10.     For revitalizing the serving PhD, 489 Researchers and Faculty Members were awarded with 9-12
months Post-Doctoral Fellowships to work in international well eqvipped research laboratories and
Universities. Out ofthese, 308 went abroad while 208 havecompleted their Post Doc and 100are currently
abroad. These relatively small investmentshave substantially increased researchoutput for the Fellows and
also paved way for international linkagesand collaborative researches.

11.     HEC launcheda program for one-year initial placement of every HEC scholar (and other Pakistani
citizens) who did not have a confirmed employment in Pakistan prior to their return to Pakistan after
completion of PhD studies, in a public sector university willing to host them and ready to absorb them
following their fresh faculty induction system. 30 scholars who have completed PhD from abroadand did
not have a confirmed employment in Pakistan have been placed at various Universities under the
`Placement o f PhD Scholars Returning from Abroad' Program. Another batch o f 30 fresh PhDs or those
about to complete PhD would soon be inducted in the universities underthis Program.

12.     All these efforts coupled with faculty development program of several public sector universities
would hardly be increasing a few percent of the required PhD faculty needs of the 56+ public sector
universities. Realizing the enormity o f the task, HEC has prepared and submitted another PC-I for an
additional 2000 PhD scholarships for meeting the ever-growing needs o f the universities for qualified
faculty. Even after this addition, there would still be a shortage of foreign qualified PhDs. HEC is
anticipating that, by the year 2012, there should be a sizeable mass o f well qualified faculty in some o f the
public sector uiiiversitieswhich will further strengthen local doctoral programs.




                                               46

13.      Retention o f well qualified motivated faculty is another challenge which was addressed in a
comprehensive manner ensuring personaland professional satisfaction. HEC introduced the Tenure Track
System in 2004. As per this system, the initial appointment of faculty members is to be made on a
contractual. basis. Permanent tenure is granted subsequently on positive recommendations of renowned
international peers. Such faculty appointments carry an attractive salary package, comparable to that
offered by the private sector. All new faculty appointments are now being filled through this system.
Existing faculty members are also being allowed to opt for this system of appointment on choice. 40% o f
the public-sector HEls have adopted the model TTS statutesfor making all fresh appointments.

14.      HEC has implemented several in-service professional development programs ranging from
training Master Trainers to short-term executive management, on-site training and workshops for
university teachers and administrators. HEC regularly arranges and imparts a whole range o f one week to
several months' modular training programs. More than 1200 university teachers have been trained under
the three months' `Faculty Development Program' designedfor junior faculty.

IS.      National Academy o f Higher Education (NAHE) is the project initiated by HEC for the
professionaldevelopment of university faculty, as there is no provision o f proper in-service training to the
university faculty; even most of them don't have pre-service training experience at all. In order to
overcome this deficiency, NAHE is facilitating and conducting professional development coilrses through
an intensive in-service program titled as staff development courses (SDC) at the door steps of the public
sector universities and degreeawarding institutions across the country

16.      Soon after its establishment,the HEC established a small Quality Assurance Department(QAD), a
national Committee for Quality Assurance(QAC) and an independent Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).
The roadmap used by the QAD was to: 1) create awareness among the academia about quality issues; 2)
develop quality criteria; 3)     develop processes for implementation of criteria; and 4) monitor
implementation o f quality criteria by the HEls. Quality assurance mechanisms have been successfully
instituted across public sector Universities and standards established for award of PhD studies and for
publication in recognized research journals, adherence to a policy of zero tolerance for plagiarism,
establishment o f accreditation councils in the disciplines o f IT, Business Studies, Agriculture and
Education to ensure that all programs in these disciplines are assessed by their peers and meet stringent
quality standards. The QAD has published a number o f brochures dealing with the above topics which
serve as guidelines for implementation o fthese criteria by the HEls.      ,, .

17.     HEC, to bring uniformity in under-graduate programs, introduced a 4 year Bachelors degree
program with a structured broad-basedcurriculum in HEls. Although a number of universities have started
awarding degrees under 4 year prograin but in many cases this program has not yet been implemented.The
introduction o f this program in affiliated colleges is a major challenge. HEC has to work with provincial
governments to make ajointeffort inthis direction.

18.      Revision of Curricula has been focused to bringthem at par with the international study programs.
Intensive efforts were made to revise the outdated curricula through the respective National Curriculum
Review Committees and, to date, II 6 of thecurricula have been revised by the HEC.

19.     The accreditation of various programsthrough already existing Professional Councils and another
4 new Coiincils established by the HEC is underway. However, all programs need to be accreditedwhich
will be done in phased manner. The volume of work demands not only strengthening of QAA &
Accreditation Councils but financial support will also be required to meet the anticipated cost of
programme accreditation. The institutional accreditation will be carried out by QAA which also requires
more funding.




                                                47

   20.     Although the quality culture has started taking roots in the HEls through the efforts of the HEC,
   the present efforts have only just started addressing the QA program which includes establishment of
   Directoratesof Distance Education at larger Universities to improve the quality of private students and to
   recognize them as "Distant learners", development of Qualification Framework with Technical Assistance
   (TA) from International organizations such as APQN, developing & strengthening Internal Quality
   Assurance (IQA) system at all HEls as a pre-requisite for Programme & Institutional Accreditation,
   programme       Accreditation      by     the      respective     Accreditation    Councils,     Institutional
   AccreditatiodPerformance Evaluationon the pre-definedstandardsof HEC establishmento f QA Centre at
   an appropriateUniversity for the purposeo f research & development on QA processes & practices.

   21.     To ensure that all HEls should have access to research journals, the Digital Library (e-journal
   Program) is one of the greatest accomplishments of the HEC. The Digital Library is accessible to
   approximately 250 institutionsand provides open-access to e-books andjournals in various fields of study.
   A selection of over 20,000 e-books and more than 300 online journals are available for researchers. The
   HEC hasextended the Internet facility to all public sector universities by providinga fibre optic link with 2
   mbps.

   22.     HEC has launcheda number o f initiatives to develop a strong Research System at national level by
   allocation of more funds and efficient useo f existing resources.

  23.      Recognizing that the creation o f new knowledge through research is the key to driving innovation,
   and one of the primary responsibilities o f an institutiono f higher education, more than 20 Central Research
  Laboratories have been created at public universities across the country. These centres are meant to drive
  quality research and are being supported by major investments in information technology, such as the
  creationof a large Digital (e-journal) Library, video teleconferencing, etc.


  24.      HEC programsfor promotion of research includes the traditional researchproposal grants funding
  and support for presenting research papers at international and national professional conferences, to
  support for developing international research and institutional linkages, university-industry collaborative
  researches, purchase and upgrading o f laboratory instruments, and the Presidential Young Innovator
  awards.

` 25.      More than 600 research grant proposals have been funded andidlaborations with international
   universities have been strongly encouraged. Through collaborative arrangementswith the British Council
  and under the Pakistan-USA S&T Agreement, around 100 research partnerships have been initiated
  betweenPakistani universities with those inthe UK and the USA.

  26.      More than twenty five hundred faculty members o f public and private universities and degree
  awarding institutes were provided funds for presentingtheir researchpapers in international conferences. A
  total of 427 seminars, workshops andor conferences were also funded. This resulted in 240% increase in
   IS1 index scientific and research publications emanating from Pakistani universities and degree awarding
  institutesduring last three years.

  27.      Numerous other initiatives have been undertaken for supporting excellence in academics and
  research. These included, Foreign and local Trainings, Pacts and Protocols, Country License for Advanced
  designsoftware and Patent Filing.

  28.      Efforts are underway to develop a culture o f entrepreneurship, especially by establishing
  interdisciplinary, hybrid research incubators, technology parks, and centers o f excellence; in consultation
  with academiaand industry. This would not only guide our research, but also facilitate the production and
  absorptionofquality resource into the industry.




                                                  48

  29.      To promote open access to scientific literature and to promote the international visibility of
  research originating from Pakistan, the Pakistan Research Repository (PRR) was establishedin 2005. The
  aim of this service is to maintain a digital archive of the intellectual output of Pakistani institutions, to
  provide a single-entry access points to view this research, and to distribute this information as widely as
  possible. Currently, more than 1600 theses published in Pakistani universities have been uploaded to the
  repository.

  Pillar 2: TrnnrovingAccess & Enhancine Equity

  30.      Tertiary Education is a means to add value to the human capital of a country. Considering that
  only 2.6 percent o f students in the age gmiip of 17-23 years were enrolled in HEls during the year 2002,
  HEC earmarked improving access to quality higher education as one of the key areas in its strategic
  planning. It succeeded to increase enrolment in HEls by about 140 per cent Le. from 132,126 in 2002 to
  316,278 in 2008.       Consequently, the enrolment in higher education o f the age group o f 17-23 years
  increased from 2.6 per cent in 2002 to 4.6 per cent in 2008; however this ratio is still the lowest among the
  South Asian countries that include Nepal, Bangladeshand Sri Lanka.

  31.      To achieve rapid increase in enrolment, the HEC encouraged admissions in the existing
  universities by linking funding with the enrolment as one of the componentso f the fonnula for funding the
  universities. It also encouraged opening of new DAIdniversities in the public and private sectors and
  facilitated the female education which now maintains the ratio o f 46.3 per cent compared with 36.8 per
  cent in HEls in 2002. The growth in private sector Institutions was also remarkable i.e. from 44 to 56
  during this period which needs further encouragement. To cope with the need to increase enrolment many
  Institutions have started evening programs to match the requirementsof space, faculty and infrastructure.
  A significant increase in enrolment at the postgraduate level during this period is especially commendable
  which shows a highly positive response of the candidates to incentives offered by the HEC for such
  programmes.

  32.      The issues o f equity in the provisions o f higher education were addressed through provision of a
  large number o f scholarships to the talented students. The HEC has managed to provide financial
  assistance to the needy students with the help of the donor agencies (namely USAID and JICA; and also
  from its own resources) and is also endeavouring to launch a major educational loans scheme to provide
  further opponiinities for higher education to less privileged but talented students. To provide residential
' facilities to the students of rural areas, the HEC is providing adequqte.funds to the universities for
  construction of hostelsat their campuses, for the students coming from distant areas.

  33.      New areas of teaching and research have been introduced in the universities in responseto market
  demands and the diversity o f degree programs being offered by the HEls has expanded manifold. The
  HEC has embarked upon a program to document each degree in the form of Qualification Framework and
  aDegree Supplementwhicliis being finalized to provide basic information about each degree.

  34.      The unprecedented growth in university level education during the period 2002-2005 has already
  put a great stress on the available physical and human resources o f HEIs to match the increased demand,
  while the issue o f quality assurance in higher educationhas become even more conspicuous. Emphasison
  Quality Distance Education is seen as one o f the solutions to the gigantic problem and HEC plans to
  increase enrolment in the universities undertaking distance education, as well as to establish Directorates
  of DistanceEducation in the major public sector universities, while the quality parameters in this regard
  will be strictly enforced.

  35.      New institutions in the Public and Private sectors need to be establishedto maintain and enhance
  the existing level o f access to higher education by about 30% in the next 3 years. A concomitant increase
  in investmentin terms of infrastructure fac     es, faculty development and Quality Managementis required
  to maintain and enhance their rates ofgrowth in enrolment in the HEls.




                                                  49

   Strenethenine the Governance and Mannzement of Higher Education:

   36.      Weak Management and Governance is recognized as one o f the main obstacles for the
   improvemknt o f education system and to implement HEC reforms. Internal governance, management
   performance and accountability o f HEls need to be strengthened to create impact of different reforms
   initiated by government in HE sector. To strengthen internal governance, management performance, and
   accountability of HEls, we have plannedto initiate following activities. to finalize guidelines to improve
   administrative management structure; to develop Custom-made training program and to ensure effective
   implementation. Accordingly senior HE1management will be trained.

   37.     The Higher Education Commission consists o f the Commission, Le. the Board of Governors
   headedby a Chairman and the Secretariat headedby the ExecutiveDirector who is the Chief Executive o f
   the HEC. HEC has been satisfactorily functioning, with both the Commission fulfilling its oversight role
   and the executive director is in-charge of implementing reforms. While the affairs of the post of
  Chairpersonare being looked after by the special Assistant to the PrimeMinister on Social Sector, asearch
   process is underway, and a chairpersonwill hopefully appointed by August 2009.


   38.     HEC will develop a template for preparation o f a five-year strategic plan including financial,
   academic plans and asset plans as well as targets and performance indicators for HEls. These will provide
   bases for all HElsto preparetheir strategic plans.

  39.      HEC is giving due importance to QA and has initiated different reforms to create awareness about
  quality and also develop good practices for different programs. Establishing Quality Assurance Agency
  (QAA) was another initiative inthis direction. These quality assurance mechanismshave beensuccessfully
  instituted across public sector Universities. Accreditation councils in the disciplines o f IT, Business
  Studies, Agriculture and Education have been established to ensure that all programs in these disciplines
  are assessed by their peers and meet stringent quality standards. The Quality Assurance Department has
  published a number o f brochures dealing with various topics as guidelines for implementation of these
  criteria by the HEIs. We are planningto establishaccreditation councils in other selecteddisciplines. HEC
  also plans to get the QA Manual completed. Ranking list of academic programs of HEls will be published.


' 40.      The HEC does not differentiate between public sector and private, sector universities in terms of
  implementation o f Quality Standards. All the QA criteria and guidelines have been circulated among all
  the HEls for implementation and regular monitoring mechanismhas beendeveloped to ensure that each o f
  the criteria is implemented fully and properly. HEC has established 30 Quality Enhancement Cells in
  various universities under QAA for activating Internal Quality Assurance in the HEls. It is stipulated to
  have the QEC in all the remainingHEls to ensure adherenceto at least the minimum baselines defined by
  HEC.

  4 1.     To bolster capacity of HEC and strengthen it, we are planning to get a complete HR audit of HEC
  to review the gaps and asses the needs keeping in view the changed scope o f HEC. Training will be
  arranged for senior middle management of HEC and they will be exposed to best practise. Keeping in
  view importance o f IT and communication HEC staff will be provided with training opportunities in IT,
  communication and management. HEC did arrange a few training courses for its employees but has to be
  done under acomprehensivesystematicplan.

  42.      Improving communication o f HEC with stakeholders is another missing link and needs special
  attention. HEC will enhance its existing communications capacity by hiring a professional communication
  specialist from the private sector. The cominunications needs assessment has already been initiated to be
  followed by finalization/implementation of the Communications Strategy to better infordinvolve




                                                 50

 stakeholders and to give broader ownership o f HEC initiatives. Perception survey will be carried out and
 communication audit report will be periodically published.

 43.      The importance o f a robust, integrated and dynamic Information Management System (IMS) is
 crucial to improve management, in lowering expenses, and in better, more informed decision-making. The
 heart o f the IMS is a secure relational database containing all records o f students, personnel, finance etc.
 This database would be web-enabledand designed to provide different levels o f secured access to various
 authorized personnel for input and retrieval o f data. The IMS will be developed as part o f HEIMS which
 includes: (a) Administrative & Management Information; (b) Sttident Information; (c) Research
 Management & Faculty Information; and (d) Resource& Supply Chain Management.

 44.     Campus Management Solution (CMS) is an integrated solution which efficiently deals with the
 various activities o f an educational institution like faculty management, student management,
administrative functions etc. and aims at strengthening the governance and management o f higher
education. Campus Management will serve as the enabler for the institutions on how to deliver more
competitive services to the sophisticatedtraditional and non-traditional students. It provides and supports
the nationwide standard framework for the services delivery for the Administration, Students and Faculty
memben. As a pilot project six universities o f diversified discipline including medical, engineering and
Liberal Arts and science from all the regions o f country are selected for implementation. The CMS
modules include Recruiting & Admission, Sttident Records, Grade Book, Campus Self Service, Academic
Advisement, Contributor Relations, Student Financials and Student Administration. HEC will be
expandingthese facilities in selected Institutions.

45.      To improve the financial planning and management in the higher education sector HEC has
designed a strategy and plan of action for preparation o f N A M (IPSAS) compliant annual financial
statements, to be made available for audit within four months after the end of each financial year. This will
increase effectiveness o f public expenditures in HEls associated with enhanced transparency, quality and
reliability o f financial information for informed decision-making. This will also help for availability of
budgeted recurrent funds at the beginning of each Financial quarters and development funds at the
beginning of each half year and provide timely and reliable HEC financial information including budget
execution statementsreadily available on the web for decision making and public scrutiny. That will help
to strengrhened capacity o f public HEls to provide reliable and meaningful financial information and
integratedbudget and expenditurereporting system in place.

                                                                          ,I  .
46.      To improve procurement performance as well as for transparent and efficient procurement
procedures in higher education sector HEC had finalized a Procurement Handbook for goods, works and
services that will help HEls to reduce average procurementprocessingtime with increasedparticipation by
bidders. We also plan to train staff accordingly.

Pillar 4: lmprovine fiscal.sustainabilitv and effectiveness of expenditure in Hieher Education.

47.      HEC has mobilized the universities to improve their fund raising abilities and generate additional
funds through indigenous resources other than income from tuition fee etc by organizing the Alumni
Association and developing better linkages with industry and the community. On the other hand, HEC has
put in a considerable effort in managing risks and ensuring value for money and has taken various cost
cutting meastiresto economizethe expenditure without compromising on quality.

48.      While the increased governmerit funding is justified, it is important that HEls complement this
increase with increased revenues from tuition and other fees. IncreasedGovernment allocations for HEls
would be justified on both efficiency and equity grounds and would provide institutions with additional
resources to improve quality and research. Revenues generated from own resoiirces have increased
considerably between 200U02 and 2007!08        - rising from Rs. 3.140 billion to Rs. 11.048 billion. This
increasesuffices and ensures the fiscal sustainability with increasedgovernment funding.       .




                                               51

49.      HEC has replaced its manual financial accounting system with a computer-basedERP (Enterprises
 Resource Planning) Solution backed by SAP - the world renowned business software solutions
applications. HEC has successfully adopteddouble entry system of accounting in line with the N A M (new
counting m'odel) of PIFRA (Project for Improvement in Financial Reportingand Auditing) adopted by the
Governmento f Pakistan.The SAP has been implemented to go-live with effect from 1st July, 2008 forthe
four modules (i) FlICO - (Finance and controlling module), (ii) HR Module +Human                     Resource
Management), (iii)MMdMaterial Management) and (iv) Project System-(For HEC Projects). The ERP
solution provides 'real-time' access to financial data, project data and the organisation's assets register and
other information. HEC reliability of financial reporting has improved markedly. The reconciliation levels
of fiscal accounts for revenue and expenditure that has been achieved would continue to excel with the
adoption of internationallyacceptedprinciple o f accounts.

50.      HEC intendsto extend implementation of ERF' solution to all the public sector HEk and would go
for on-line access to the information related to revenue and expenditure as well as employeesrelated data.
HEC has implemented Campus Management Solution (CMS) - an integrated solution which efficiently
deals with the various activities of higher educational institutions and facilitates faculty management,
student management, and administrative functions. This solution supports the nationwide standard
framework for services delivery to students, faculty members and strengthened the administration. The
CMS providesa bettercontrol for revenue collection o f universities.

51.      Procurement rules based on PPRA rules and regulations have been prepared. These rules have
been sent to the PPRA authorities for vetting and simultaneously are being implemented as these are in
consonance with them. All the HEC procurement notices are being placed on HEC website for fair and
open competition.

52.      The Finance Division, Govt. o f Pakistan has finalized the Medium Term Financing Framework
comprising recurrent and developmentallocations for Higher Education sector for FY 2009-10 to FY201I-
12. These allocations are consistent with the core program of the HEC and the priority given by
government to the sector. These have also been conveyed to the HEC and the World Bank separately vide
letter D.0 Dy. 1704iSIFS2009,dated April 7"', 2009. Tlic allocations to be made are given below:

                           AssessmentLetter for the World Bank
March2,2009

This note provides the IMF staffs assessment o f Pakistan's macroeconomic developments
and prospects as background for the Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation
policy loan being considered by the Executive Board o f the World Bank on March 26. The
assessment is based on the findings o f the February 2009 IMF mission to Islamabad and
Dubai that conducted the discussions with the Pakistani authorities on the First Review under
the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and the 2009 Article IV Consultation.

RecentDevelopmentsandPerformanceunderthe SBA Program

Economic developments inPakistan since the SBA was approved on November 24,2008
have been favorable.
  The exchange rate has been broadly stable, with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP)
  intervening on the buying side o f the interbank foreign exchange market. As a result, the
  international reserves position has strengthened significantly (gross reserves amounted to
  $6.7 billion on February 23).
  There was a strong positive response from the T-bill market to the 200-basis points increase
  inthe centra1bank discount rate inmid-November, allowing the government to retire some
  o f its debt to the SBP. T-bill auctions through end-February have been consistently
  oversubscribed, with wide participation o f banks, and interest rates on T-bills came down
  from 14 percent (weighted average) in mid-January to 12.98 percent at the most recent
  session (February 25).
 There has also been a gradual reflow o f deposits into the bankingsystem.
  Headline inflation declined markedly to 20.5 percent in January, due to lower food and
  energy prices, but year-on-year core inflation remains high at 19 percent, despite a decline
  inthe month-on-month core inflationrate.
 Inmid-December, the authorities removed the stock market price floor which had been in
 place for 3% months. Subsequently, stock prices dropped sharply, but the decline moderated
  inearly January. Since then, the market has fluctuated inline with economic prospects and
  developments ininternational equity markets.
 All the quantitative performance criteriathrough end-December 2008 were observed.
  Through December, the budget registered a revenue shortfall that was compensated by
  expenditure restraint.
 Despite the improved confidence, credit and broad money growth have been slower than
 expected. Specifically, private sector credit growth, at 13 percent on an annual basis, has
 been lower owing to both lower demand from corporates and an increase in lenders' risk
 aversion.
   Structural conditionality has generally been observed, although there is scope for
 improvement insome areas.
 A contingency planfor handlingproblem private banks has been prepared.
 A committee to review the operational autonomy o fthe SBP has beenestablished.
 A tax administration reform plan has beenprepared which comprises key reforms, such as
 the integration o f the income tax and sales tax departments and the replacement o f the
 current general sales tax with a broad-based VAT.

                                              63

The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fundto help with the design o f
the VAT law, the revisions in the income tax legislation, and the possible introduction o f a
carbon tax.
 Electricity tariffs have been reviewed (with the World Bank) and it has been agreed that a 4
  percent increase, to be implemented between February and June, would suffice to reach the
  cost recovery level, given the recent substantial drop inthe price o f furnace oil.
 The SBP has stopped the direct provision of foreign exchange for furnace oil on February 1,
  2009, as agreed under the program.
 Progress has also been made toward the end-March 2009 benchmarks under the program.
 The fiscal program includes additional spending on the social safety net.
 Inlate January, the authorities andthe World Bank agreed onreforming the Benazir Income
  Support Program and introduce a scorecard for the identification o fpoor households.
 The authorities have accelerated the preparation o f a planto deal with the circular debt issue
  (inter-corporate debt inthe energy sector).

Outlook

Since the SBA program was agreed inOctober, the world economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly. This deterioration is likely to affect Pakistan's economy through several
channels:
  Domestic activity is likely to be weaker than originally envisaged in the program.     Large-
  scale manufacturing output has dropped, and there has been a significant decline inexports.
  Preliminary projections for agricultural output in 2008/09 show that increases in rice and
  cotton crops, and the prospects o f a large wheat crop, would offset a decline in sugar cane
  production.
 Lower activity is having an adverse impact on fiscal revenue.
  Falling food and energy prices and the lower economic activity should continue to exert
  downward pressure on headline inflation. Under conservative assumptions, year-on-year
  headline inflation would decline to 10 percent by end-2008/09 (compared with 20 percent in
  the program), and to 6% percent by end-2009/10.
  The external current account has also improved, but the outlook is fragile owing to the
  recent decline in exports. The projected outcome for the external current account through
  end-2008/09 is slightly better than envisaged in the program because a marked decline in
  imports is expected to outweigh the weaker export performance. The financial account
  surplus i s now expected to be somewhat lower than originally projected, due mainly to
  lower than envisaged inflows o f private capital. The overall external balance for 2008109 i s
  now projected to be better than programmed by about $500 million. This outlook, however,
  is subject to significant downside risks, especially if the drop in exports continues and
  remittances decline.

Key Challenges and Policy Issues

As noted above, the downturn in the world economy poses significant downside risks to
economic activity and the external position. The authorities recognize that, given financing
constraints, the scope for countercyclical policies i s limited and that consolidating economic
and financial stability remains the principal challenge faced by the authorities. The fiscal
program and the monetary policy stance remain the key policy tools to consolidate stability.

  The fiscal outlook for the remainder o f 2008/09 is likely to be affected by shortfalls in
   revenue and foreign budget financing. The authorities remain committed to the program
   target o f a deficit o f Rs. 562 billion, equivalent to 4.3 percent o f the revised GDP for
   2008/09. The tax revenue shortfall is expected to be partly offset by higher collections
   from the Petroleum Development Levy, as well as stepped-up auditing, and the authorities
   are committed to restraining expenditures, as needed, to achieve the budget deficit target.
   External budget financing in 2008/09 is now projected to be lower than expected, mainly
   reflecting a shortfall inexternal privatizationproceeds.
  Pakistan needs additional external resources in order to create fiscal space for higher
  development and social spending. A donor conference, tentatively scheduled for
  MarcWApril2009, will providean opportunity to seek additional external assistance.
 The cumulative 500-basis points discount rate hike in2008 has resulted intighter monetary
  conditions. As inflation remains elevated, it i s premature at this stage to reduce interest
  rates, but rates may be lowered later inthe year, provided that inflation continues to decline
  andthe government avoids SBP financing ofthe budget.
 The exchange rate should remain flexible, with marketintervention largely aimedat meeting
   the international reserves targets.
 Pakistan's banks have weathered the crisis well so far, but there are increasing risks from the
   deteriorating economic outlook. Non-performing loans have risen to 9.1 percent in
   December 2008, from 7.7 percent inJune. Stress tests by the FSAP update mission and by
   the authorities show that the deterioration in credit quality is the main risk. Accordingly,
   the authorities need to continue to monitor developments in the banking system very
    closely.

Medium-termoutlook

A significant increase inrevenues as a share o f GDP remains the cornerstone o f the medium-
term framework, but the economic downturn has led to a revision o f the medium-term path
for fiscal and external adjustment. Growth i s projected to recover gradually to 4.0 percent
next year and 7.0 percent by 2013/14. Headline inflation is expected to decline rapidly to 6%
percent by 2009/10. The external current account deficit is envisaged to narrow to 4% percent
o f GDP in2009/10 and to decline further to more sustainable levels by 2013/14. A significant
increase inthe revenue-to-GDP ratio will create fiscal space for higher public investment and
sustainable growth. However, the room for increasing the public investment-to-GDP ratio
may be more limited than previously assessed, as there is a need to ensure that the outlook
allows for an adequate increase inoutlays on poverty reduction.

StatusofIMFRelations

As noted, a SDR 5.169 billion ($7.6 billion) SBA was approved on November 24, 2008. The
staff has just completed the discussions on the First Review of the SBA and the 2009 Article
IV Consultation, which are scheduled to be considered by the IMF Executive Board in late-
March 2009.
