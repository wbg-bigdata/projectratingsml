Project at Risk at Any Time:
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1.         The project's objective was to correct critical deficiencies in Benin's power sector by (i)
streamlining the relationship between the utility (SBEE) and Government (GOB); (ii) reinforcing SBEE's
organization and operations, including the introduction of a performnance contract between SBEE and the GOB;
and (iii) financing part of the 1991-95 investment program in the power sector, including the rehabilitation,



reinforcement and extension of the distribution grid, as well as economically justified connection of new loads.
3.1.2.         In 1989, energy consumption in Benin, estimated at about I million tons of oil equivalent (toe),
or 200 kgoe per capita, was among the lowest in the world. Of this total, electricity represented about I percent
only. Until September 1987, when the Nangbeto hydro-power plant became operational, 90 percent of electricity
used in Benin originated from the Volta River Authority (VRA) in Ghana, via CEB, a power generation and
transmission company, jointly created by Benin and Togo in 1968. The Nangbeto hydroelectric power plant was
built on the Mono river, on the border between Benin and Togo, and was commissioned in 1987.
3.1.3          At the time of project appraisal, SBEE was a fully government-owned utility, responsible for
electricity and water supply. SBEE had a generating capacity of 56 MVA, of which a plant in Cotonou (the capital
city), which served as a standby facility. Its transmission facilities included a total of 460 km of 63 kv, 20 kv and
15 kv lines, Medium voltage sales accounted for 52 percent of the total. At end-1989, SBEE served about 56,000
residential customers, of which 30,000 in the Cotonou area. Steady economic growth and low tariffs led to an
average annual rate of 20 percent in the SBEE's sales in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, sales stagnated as a result
of a severe recession, a regional drought in 1984 and sharp increases in electricity prices.
3.1.4.         Consultant studies financed under the Nangbeto 11 Project (Cr. 1507-BEN/Cr. 1508-TO) pointed
to the need for rehabilitating distribution facilities and strengthening the management of the two utilities in Benin
and Togo. In July 1990 a new general manager was appointed for SBEE. He gave a new impetus to changes in
the SBEE's organization and in its relations with the Government. At the same time, GOB was engaged in a
reform of its public enterprise sector, aimed at giving managers increased autonomy within the framework of
performance contracts (contrat-plan).
3.1.5.         The objective of the project was consistent with the objectives of the first structural adjustment
credit, which was approved in May 1989, and was focused on reducing the fiscal deficit, initiating a reform of the
public enterprise sector and addressing the crisis engendered by the collapse of the state-owned banks.
3.1.6.         The project was also consistent with previous IDA's involvement in the power sector in Benin.
In the late 1970s a UNDP-financed study identified Nangbeto as the least-cost source of power to be implemented
as a regional project by both Benin and Togo. In 1981, IDA financed the detailed engineering for the Nangbeto
project, and in 1984 approved two credits to the Governments concerned for implementing the project. The project
was completed on schedule. A project completion report for Nangbeto was issued in 1993, and concluded that the
project had fully achieved its objectives.
3.1.7.         The objective of the Power Sector Rehabilitation project was realistic but would have benefited
from a clearer formulation. When the project was approved, improving the performance of the utility through
increased management autonomy and changes in all aspects of its operations was important for the overall
program of reform undertaken by Benin. Signature of a performance contract between SBEE and GOB was a
condition of credit effectiveness. A set of performance criteria was agreed upon, but no specific mention of these
criteria was made in the project documentation submitted to the Board.
3.1.8.         The objective of financing an investment program, as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
had more to do with outputs than outcomes. In the economic rate of return section in the SAR, it was mentioned
that investment financed under the project would increase low-voltage service by connecting about 2000 new
customers per year, while accommodating load growth of existing customers at a modest rate of I to 2 percent per
year. Technical losses would drop from about 15 percent in 1990 to about 13 percent in 1996.
3.2 Revised Objective.
3.2.1.         The objective of the project was not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
-2 -



3.3.1.         The project included two components, an institutional development program and an investment
program. The institutional development program focused on the strengthening of SBEE through (i) an
institutional study to review and make recommendations to streamline responsibilities between SBEE and the
Borrower and establish performance indicators in key areas of SBEE's operations; (ii) a training program,
including training overseas for selected SBEE staff in technical, financial and managerial areas; and (iii)
improvement of SBEE's billing and accounting system through establishment of a laboratory for meter calibration,
installation of computerized mapping facilities for customers and equipment management, provision and
installation of hardware and establishment of software for a computerized billing system; and carrying out of an
arrears audit.
3.3.2.         The investment component included (i) reinforcement of SBEE's subtransmission substation in
Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Abomey/Bohicon; (ii) rehabilitation, reinforcement and extension of the Cotonou,
Porto-Novo and Abomey/Bohicon distribution systems; and (iii) provision of telecommunications equipment, tools
and spare parts for distribution and diesel plants.
3.3.3.         The components were in line with the project objective and well within the capacity of SBEE to
implement.
3.4 Revised Comnponents:
3.4.1.         In late 1996, the Bank agreed to finance a further extension of the distribution network. At that
time, the original investment program was being implemented satisfactorily, but only 35 percent of the credit had
been disbursed. The new program was fully in line with the initial one and made sense, as demand for electricity
was fast increasing. On the institutional side, in July 1998, the Government eventually agreed to a repeated Bank
suggestion that options for the privatization of SBEE should be explored. IDA agreed to finance the study under
the credit. The selection of consultants was not done in keeping with Bank guidelines, however, and the study was
financed by SBEE.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1.         The quality at entry is rated as marginally satisfactory. The project was well designed. The
demand projections for electricity consumption were reasonable, and took account of past trends as well as of
expected developments. Expectations for improved performance of SBEE were well within reach. The weaknesses
in SBEE's management were adequately analyzed, and a set of appropriate measures was designed to address
them. Government commitment was rather weak.
3.5.2.         The institutional development component of the project was based on a performance-contract to
be signed between SBEE and GOB. The signing of the contract was a condition of credit effectiveness. The draft
contract had been prepared by consultants before project appraisal and reviewed during negotiations of the credit.
It took, however, one year for the contract to be finalized, thereby delaying credit effectiveness. Establishment of a
project implementation unit was also a condition of credit effectiveness. Eventually, the project unit was
established, but its role in project implementation remained marginal.
3.5.3.         Detailed engineering studies and draft bidding documents were not available when the project
was presented to the Board for approval. The recruitment of consultants for the preparation of these documents
took much longer than expected, resulting into a two-year delay in the physical implementation of the project.
Bidding documents could and should have been available before Board presentation for this project, as funds for
financing the consultants were available from other sources than the credit.
3.5.4.         The risk section in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was perfunctory. It indicated that delays in
project implementation and the achievement of SBEE's plans to improve its efficiency were possible. This was not
considered as a serious risk, however, as SBEE and GOB were said to be fully committed to strengthening the
power sector they were not considered serious risks. Experience showed, however, that the government
- 3 -



commitment for improving the sector and the efficiency of its utility was weak for most of the project
implementation period.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1.        The institutional development objective of the project ha$ not been achieved. SBEE' s
performance has not improved. While technical losses were reduced, the average collection period, which had
declined from about 11.8 months in 1987 to 6 months in 1990, increased to over 14 months in 1998. The
financial rate of return, which was over 5 percent in 1990 , has become negative in recent years. SBEE suffers
from serious weaknesses in its operations, including poor internal controlsIand deficient accounting
4.1.2.         The relationship between SBEE and the Government was expected to be streamlined, but the
Government kept interfering with the management of SBEE. Managers were changed too frequently. During
project implementationa total of five general managers have been appointed by the Government rather than the
Board of Directors. The Government has made some efforts to reduce delays in paying its bills, but local
governments and public enterprises have continued to be seriously deficient.
4.1.3         In 1998, it became apparent that Government interference in SBEE would not stop unless
Government was forced to disengage from the operations of the utility. At a donors' conference held in Lome on
April 1998, all participants agreed that no further assistance would be made to SBEE and the power sector unless
GOB disengaged from SBEE day-to-day operations. Subsequently, the Government agreed that privatization of
the utility was to be explored, and hired consultants to define options. The consultants completed their report in
March 2000. The Government has opted for a concession in both water and electricity and the bidding process is
expected to be launched by end 2000 and the concessionnaire to be in place by 2001.
4.1.4.        The investment program has been implemented, with some delay, but the results exceeded the
project's expectations. By end 1999, SBEE had about 160,000 residential customers, about double what was
existing in 1990. In order to meet this demand in customer growth, over 580 km of distribution lines were built
during the project period, which far exceeds what was envisaged at appraisa]. Over the 1990-99 period, sales of
electricity have increased from 176 to 319 GWh, representing an annual growth rate of 6.9 percent. Sales per
customer have declined, however, as new connections reached lower income groups. System losses have also
declined from 16 percent in 1990 to 13 percent in 1999.
4.1.5.        The project's outcome is rated marginally satisfactory. The number of consumers doubled during
the implementation period reaching out to low income groups. The investments financed by the project supported
the resurgence of the strong economic activity in recent years. The upward trend of the economic growth is
expected to continue in the future. On the other hand, the critical deficiencies in SBEE's operations and
management have not been corrected, although the privatization process is,underway.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1.        Institutional development. The study to define the relationship and to streamline the
responsibilities of SBEE and GOB has been completed. A performance contract between SBEE and GOB was
signed in .Jne 1992. It was expected to be updated for 1994, but was not replaced. In 1996, Donors financed
Technical Assistants (T.A.s)to take line responsibilities at SBEE, especially in the Finance Department. A year
later, the Managing Director was changed, and the T.A.s became advisors,j then were withdrawn. Soon after, at a
Donors Meeting in Lome, in 1998, all Donors agreed that the only way to resolve SBEE's problems was through
privatization, and that no further assistance to the sector would come fromn Donors unless SBEE was privatized.
In 1999, GOB agreed to the privatization of SBEE, and consultants have b¢en engaged to assist GOB in this
- 4 -



endeavour.
4.2.2.         An agreement between GOB and SBEE was signed in July 1995 to address the public sector' s
arrears issue and the payment of its bills on time. Cross debts between GOB and the SBEE were settled and a new
payment system was agreed upon. The Government made efforts to reduce delays in paying its bills, but local
governments and some public enterprises have continued to be deficient.
4.2.3.         The program of staff training was much delayed, and was only partially implemented. Adoption
of the new personnel statute, in line with the requirements of a commercially-oriented enterprise, was a condition
of disbursement for the training program. A new personnel statute was adopted in 1998 and was partially
implemented thereafter. A comprehensive training program was prepared and adopted in 1998.
4.2.4.         New hardware and software for better handling of customer accounts were supplied in 1996. The
system was deficient, however, and could not be corrected as the developpers of the billing system went bankrupt.
The study for a future system requirements has been completed, as well as the tariff study.
4.2.4.         The program for the rehabilitation and extension of the power distribution system, as defined
initially and revised in 1996, was completed. In the procurement phase for network expansion, the separation of
supplies of goods and equipment for the network from the installation, resulted in much lower cost than
anticipated. The thermal plants in Cotonou and Parakotu have been rehabilitated. The supervisorv control system
and the radio communications system have been installed.
4. 3 Net Present Value/Econonmic rate of ret urn:
4.3.1.         The Net present value has been estimated at about tJSS14 million. This confirms ex-post that the
project was worth doing.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
4.4.1.         The financial position of SBEE has been negatively affected by two factors, namely: (i) the
increased access to electricity by low income groups who benefit frorn the life line tariff; and (ii) the loss making
water activity which is subsidied by electricity. As a result, the convenented 4 percent rate of return on assets was
not achieved.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1.         The institutional development objective of the project has not been achieved. It was initially
focused on implementation of a performance contract. That approach did not work, however, as the performance
contract has not prevented GOB interference in SBEE daily activities. Subsequently, the dialogue among Benin
and its partners put emphasis on the need to privatize SBEE.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencY
5.1.1.         In 1984 and 1998, because of a regional drought, VRA was not able to supply CEB with the
required amount of power. The power cuts were 20 percent in 1984 and 50 percent in 1998. Because of their over
dependenee on electricity supply from Ghana, the latter cut created a major problem for both Togo and Benin, and
their utilities.
5.1.2.        In January 1994, Benin, together with the other members of the CFA franc zone, devalued its
currency by 50 percent. Economic growth accelerated to over 5 percent in subsequent years, and the demand for
electricity increased strongly as a result. On the other hand, the devaluation raised the cost of energy. CEB
-5 -



increased its tariffs by 65 percent in 1994 and SBEE was allowed to increase its tariffs by 15 percent effective
January 1, 1994. Another tariff increase would have been required in 1995, but was not granted by the
Government. The devaluation increased the value of the credit in local currency.
5.1.3.          Following the 1994 devaluation, SBEE benefited from debt cancellation, as France, Benin's
major creditor, agreed to cancel most of the debt.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1.          During the course of the project, there have been frequent changes of Directors General caused by
Government interference, this has affected the build-up of institutional capacity. Recently, the Government has
endeavored to pay its bills regularly, but some public agencies and local governments continue to be late in paying
theirs .
5.2.2.         Government procurement procedures are cumbersome, resulting in considerable delays in the
procurement process. The recruitment of the consultants for the preparation of the detailed engineering and the
bidding documents for the distribution facilities took much longer than initially anticipated. A supervision
mission, which visited Benin in January-February 1996 noted that it took an average of eight months for contracts
to be signed following the submission of the evaluation report on bids.
5.3 Factors generally suibject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1.         SBEE was fully committed to implement the physical aspects of the project, but less interested in
its institutional development aspects. Even under the unfavorable circumstances described above, it could have
tired to be more proactive in improving the management of customer accounts and the training of its staff. During
the 1998 energy crisis, SBEE was proactive in putting in place mitigating measures such as the leasing of
generating equipment to alleviate the power shortage, and seeking the necessary financing from public, private and
international sources. Concerning the privatization of SBEE, their Union, which is very strong, was most vocal
against the privatization.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1.         These were no significant costs changes in the project neither was there a reallocation of
financial assets. The overall budget remained the same.
6. Sustainability
6.1 RationaleJbr sustainability rating:
6.1.1.         The sustainability of the physical assets financed under the project hinges on SBEE's capacity to
operate and maintain its facilities adequately. The 1998 energy crisis, for which SBEE had no responsibility,
demonstrated the fragility of the present system and the ability of SBEE to respond in a crisis situation. SBEE
does not have a clear maintenance policy for its distribution network. Its poor financial condition is not conducive
to allocating sufficient resources to the maintenance of its facilities. The project set in motion the mechanisms for
the privatization of SBEE, which is expected to be completed in 2001. The sustainability of the project is likely if
the privatization is completed rapidly.
6.2 Trans7tion arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1.         The Govemrnent of Benin is considering a set of options for the privatization of its power and
water supply sector. Privatization of SBEE within an appropriate regulatory framework is essential for making it a
strong utility. Donors have agreed to support the sector provided that the privatization process of SBEE moves
forward. It is important that the Government of Benin swiftly implement its decision to privatize SBEE.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
7.1.1.         The performance of the Bank in the identification of quality at entry and preparation assistance
for the project was marginally satisfactory. The project was part of the government strategy to improve the
performance of the public enterprise sector through performance contracts. It was a logical follow-up to the
successful Nangbeto project. Funding was available under the credit for that project as well as from a PPF advance
to finance the feasibility study for the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution network, the institutional
assessment of SBEE as well as urgent works.
7.1.2.         Appraisal of the project was satisfactory. The project design was simple, and SBEE had the
capacity to implement the program of works as envisaged. The Government gave strong indications that it was
committed to initiating a reform of its public enterprise sector through the performance contract approach. Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), the French cooperation agency, which had supported the
development of the power sector in Benin for many years, was closely involved in project preparation and
appraisal, and agreed to finance the project for an amount close to IDA's contribution.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1.         Project supervision is rated marginally satisfactory. The project was supervised regularly, on
average twice a year. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) was conducted in July 1996 but its timing proved inadequate. A
new Government had been elected and needed time to grasp the issues in the power sector. Bank supervision
missions were thorough and issue-oriented. They did their best to help SBEE implement the project. There was a
remarkable continuity in supervision teams. Reporting was not adequate at times, however. The ratings and
sub-ratings were often too optimistic, reflecting expectations rather than reality.
7.2.2.         During the MTR, it was agreed that: (i) priorities for SBEE be redefined to include separation of
accounts of power and water activities, achievement of Audited Statement without reservations, further reduction
of losses and improvements of collection; (ii) as performance contracting has failed, AfD, in agreement with IDA,
has financed Technical Assistance personel to take up line management responsibilities at SBEE, especially in the
finance department. Soon after the General Manager was changed and the Technical Assistance personel became
advisors, their role diminished and finally were withdrawn.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
7.3.1.         Overall, Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1          The performance of both SBEE and the Government was satisfactory during project preparation.
The investment program was well prepared and the draft performance contract emphasized key issues for making
the utility a better one.
7.5 Goveriment implementation performance:
7.5.1.         The Government did not live up to its commitments. It interfered in the day-to-day management
of SBEE, contrary to the spirit of the performance contract. It kept changing the general managers of SBEE for
reasons that had nothing to do with corporate efficiency. It did not use its influence to make parastatal and local
governments to pay their bills on time. It did not adjust tariffs when needed. Its performance is rated
-7 -



unsatisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1.         The performance of the implementing agency is rated marginally satisfactory. It implemented
the investment program satisfactorily, albeit with delays. It proved capable of increasing connections at a fast rate.
However, it also reacted rapidly and appropriately to the energy crisis. It did not improve its billing and collections
and the management of its customers. The maintenance of its facilities is not adequate.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1.         The performance of the borrower is rated unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1.1.         A performance contract may be an adequate instrument for promoting management autonomy.
Experience has shown time and again, however, that governments have great difficulty refraining from interfering
in the management of their utilities. Political changes may bring about inqreased interference, as a new
government is often keen on replacing managers of public enterprises.
8.1.2.         A well functioning billing system is the backbone of an electricity distribution company.
Off-the-shelve systems are readily available and easily adaptable to utilities, that are still at an early stage of their
development. SBEE's insistence on having a system specifically designed for its requirements was a major
constraint to improving its billing and collection during project implementation
8. 1.3.        Coordination and consultation with donors is vital to the success of a jointly financed project and
for the achievement of project's objectives. A full coordination and a common approach agreed upon with the
project co-financiers, paved the way for the privatization of SBEE.
8.1.4.         Regional cooperation, including pooling arrangements, and common norms and standards, can
help reduce cost to utilities and improve system reliability. For years, SBEt has depended for its supply on the
Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB), a jointly owned company by Benin and Togo, which imports most of its
requirements from Ghana. This system, however, has its drawbacks in case of crisis because of over reliance on a
single source and/or single fuel (in the case of SBEE, on hydro-electricity from Ghana, so that when the drought
hit Ghana, the ill effects were also felt in Benin). Import sources and fuel should be economically diversified to the
extend possible and some indigenous generating capacity should be maintained as reserve, above and beyond that
necessary to supply the load.

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
9.1  Introduction
9.1.1   At the request of the Government of Benin, the International Development Association (IDA) has
approved Credit 2284-BEN in the amount of SDR 11,300,000 to be used towards the financing of the Benin Power
Rehabilitation and Extension Project. The credit amount is supplemented by a FF. 71,000,000 contribution from
the French Development Agency (AFD).
9.2    Project Objectives and Description
9.2.1   Initial objectives. The overall goal of the project was to correct major deficiencies affecting the power
sector. Its main specific objectives included: (i) Promoting productive investments through the extension of
- 8 -



interconnected power distribution systems in urban areas; (ii) Improving the power company's finances with a
broader self-financing capacity (which is expected to take over external financing from development partners on
the long terrn); (iii)  Strengthening management capacity; (iv) Laying the foundation of a new cooperation
with Government, allowing SBEE to exercise greater management autonomy.
9.2.2   Project Description. To achieve the above objectives, the following activities were agreed upon at the
signing of the credit agreement: (i) Institutional Strengthening: The objective of this component was to set in
place the institutional framework for SBEE's operations. The following activities were included in this component:
(a) Implementing a detailed study to clarify the relationships between Government and SBEE. as well as their
mutual responsibilities; (b) Drafting a performance contract between Government and SBEE aiming at improving
SBEE's efficiency and including  performance and increased productivity objectives for 1995; (c) designing a
technical assistance program and a staff training program, and implementing these programs; (d) Improving
customers billing through hardware and software development needed to enhance the accounts receivable system;
(e) Developing management and accounting computerized information systems; and (f) lJndertaking a tariff study
to rationalize the existing tariff structure and other studies needed for the development of the computerized
information system; (ii) Investment Program: This component was designed to finance part of SBEE's investment
program, including: (a) Rehabilitation, strengthening and extension of power production and distribution systems
in Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Abomey-Bohicon; (b) Establishment of power grid, supervision and monitoring
systems and of a radio-communication system; (c) Procurement of material and equipment.
9.3    Project Outcome and Impact
9.3A1  The project was designed to improve sector management by clarifying the roles of all actors in the sector,
strengthening the power and distribution infrastructure, and dramatically improving SBEE's internal management.
9.4    Investment component
9.4.1   Systems extensions. Under this component., first phase works were undertaken to modernize, develop
and strengthen 27 neighborhoods in the towns of Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Abomey-Bohicon.
9.4.2  In the following wards (quartiers): Fidjrosse, Setovi, Vedoko, Fifadji, Zogbo, Menontin, Gbenonkpo,
Fifatin, Irede, Midombo, Ayelawadje, Sende, Surulere, Yenawa, Kowegbo. Yagbe, Zindjanaho Sud, Ukes (in
Cotonou), Agbokou, Hounsouko, Les Palmiers, Tokpota (in Porto-Novo), and Goho, Kpocon, Bohicon-Centre,
Abomey centre (in Abomey-Bohicon), the following works were undertaken:
250 Km of low voltage lines
14 Km of low/medium voltage lines
27 pole mounted 160 KVA transformers
four 250 KVA substations
7 Km of medium voltage lines
9.4.3  In addition, the construction of 40 Km of rural medium voltage line under this component has made
possible to connect the communities of Cove and Zangnanado in the Zou province to CEB's hydroelectric power
system. This line has provided these communities with a sustainable supply of electric power while stopping the
use of a diesel power plant that had become too costly for SBEE to operate.
9.4.4   The achievement of this first phase has led to the building of new housing, the development of new
wards, and the creation of new economic activities. The need for a second phase became apparent. Under the
second phase, extensions in older wards were completed and new wards in Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Abomey
Bohicon were connected to the power distribution system. Specifically the following works were completed:
4,6 Km of medium voltage line
-9-



*      13,4 Km of low/medium voltage line
*      210 Km of low voltage line
*      18 pole mounted 160 KVA transformers
Ten 250 KVA substation
*      I switching station.
9.4.5  In addition, the AGLA ward, a former commuter suburb in Cotonou, is now connected to the power
distribution system, thanks to the following works:
*      80 Km of low voltage line
*      5 Km of medium voltage line
*      7 substations
9.4.6   The completion of this infrastructure has lead to an accelerated development of these wards and to
improvements in the living standards of their population. It has translated into 40,000 new customers for SBEE.
9.5    Rehabilitation
9.5.1   Under this component the Akpakpa power plan has been rehabilitated, allowing SBEE to better cope with
foreseeable deficiencies in CEB power supply.
9.6    Establishment of a supervisory control system and of a radio communication system
9.6.1   Under this component, a greater flexibility has been brought to the operation of the medium voltage
systems through remote control of parts of Cotonou and Porto-Novo medium voltage systems.
9.7    Procurement of material and equipment
9.7.1    Under this component, SBEE was able to: (i) Replenish its inventory of network material (electrical
cables, meters, connection equipment, etc.); (ii) Increase its rolling stock (bucket trucks and light pickup trucks);
(iii) Implement a prepaid metering system, which proved to be well adapted and created increased demand from
customers for such meters.
9.8    Institutional component
9.8.1   Project Implementation Unit. IDA's appraisal report had made the establishment of a Project
Implementation Unit an effectiveness condition. Unfortunately, the Unit, established in January 1995, was never
operational.
9.8.2   Relationship between SBEE and the Bank. Despite some occasional disagreement on awarding
contracts and on approving project requests, the World Bank has been timely in giving its non-objection, in order
not to slow down project operation. In general, the relationship between SBEE and the Bank with respect to project
management has been satisfactory.
9.8.3   Government performance. The Borrower (Government of Benin) has generally respected its
commitments under the project. No specific project difficulty can be ascribed to the Borrower's performance.
9.9   16titutional strengthening component
9.9.1   Computerization of management. The diagnostic study undertaken by SBEE in 1986 with the
assistance of several consultants including Coopers & Lybrand to identify a computer systems development master
plan that would allow decentralized data entry and ranking of different leveLs in computerization has led to the
signing of two contracts. The first contract was awarded to the Bull Company and concerns the supply of computer
- 10-



equipment. The second contract was awarded to Lyd-Informatique and concerns the design and implementation of
a computer-based accounts receivable system. The institutional counterpart of these changes was the establishment
of a new Computer System Directorate.
9.9.2   Unfortunately, the outcome of these projects have not met expectations and some initial achievements did
not last: (i) The account receivable system developed by Lyd-Informatique has stopped functioning, due to
relatively complex operational procedures and updating needs that had not been reflected in the contract. (ii) The
procurement of computer equipment that was to be financed originally out of the "contingency reserve" credit line
item (SDR 1,920,000) was delayed as questions were raised over the bidding procedures. Finally, SBEE decided to
use its own resources to finance the equipment (including four DPX and about one hundred desktops) and software
packages developed by a company, SBA-Fininfor. The use of software has brought improvements in several areas:
General accounting with the Geophit software, Human Resources Management (including payroll) with the Topaze
software , and Inventory Management with the Onyx software. (iii) To achieve its original objectives, SBEE has
used its own funds to finance the development of a new accounts receivable system by Group Cauris, a Beninese
company. Early results are encouraging.
9.10   Training
9.10.1 Under this component, the World Bank has financed 36 activities included in the SBEE training plan
from 1998 to March 2000. However, 42 training activities agreed upon in Credit 2284 have not yet been
implemented.
9.11    Problem Areas and Weaknesses
9.11.1 The World Bank's internal procurement procedures are time consuming and are sources of delays in the
use of Credit funds.
9.11.2 Contract signing by the Government of Benin was very time consuming during the project, although
noticeable efforts have been undertaken over the last two years by the Ministry of Finance to reduce time lags.
9.11.3 Although contracts are supposed to be free of customs and other taxes, Customs and Tax offices have
required payments of some taxes they were considering mandatory, creating friction between SBEE and its
suppliers.
9.11.4 The project has suffered from the lack of a Project Implementation Unit, particularly in the areas of
disbursement and assessment of available funds.
- 11 -



9.12.   Conclusion and Recommendation for Future Projects
9.12.1 Overall project achievement is considered satisfactory. Main objectives were achieved. Extensions in
distribution systems implemented under the project are remarkable, as entire wards have been developed very
quickly in Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Abomey-Bohicon. Demand for electric power has increased and the number of
SBEE customers is continually rising.
9.12.2  To ensure sustainability of the project achievements, SBEE will need to further invest in the training of its
human resources and in the maintenance of its installations and equipment.
9.12.3 With respect to future projects, the Bank will need to be much stricter regarding the effective
implementation of Project Implementation Units that must be adequately staffed and funded.
9.12.4 Finally, the Bank should trust more visibly the SBEE technical staff and its capacity to undertake power
systems extension studies and should avoid to systematically contract out such studies to outside consultants, which
are in general very expensive and use a large part of the Credit funds.
