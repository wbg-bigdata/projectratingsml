                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in

of the forestry population.  To this end, the Project aims to: (i)
reduce soil erosion and increase water retention to protect
agricultural lands; (ii) harmonize and improve social conditions of
the disadvantaged forestry sector population; (iii) improve quality
and increase quantity of sustained wood production; (iv) develop
forest rangelands; and (v) enhance, preserve and expand the
Borrower's nature and wildlife heritage.
