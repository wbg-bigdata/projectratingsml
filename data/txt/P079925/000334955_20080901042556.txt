I.Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an additional
Credit inan amount o f US$5 million equivalent to the Republic o f Uganda (Uganda) Sustainable
Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP),Credit number 3835-UG.

2.      The proposed additional Credit would support the completion o f planned activities under
the existing SMMRP to develop Uganda's mineral sector. A cost overrun under the project
occurred primarily due to higher than expected costs for technical assistance on geological
information and mapping as a consequence o f the recent mineral commodities boom. As such,
the additional financing will support existing and new contracts in order to complete hlly all
activities originally planned under the project. In addition, the project's development objective
has been refocused and a revised results framework prepared with improved performance
indicators. An extension o f the original project closing date by two years i s being requested to
match the additional financing implementation period and complete project activities and
achieve the project development objective (PDO).

3.      The original project is financed by an IDA Credit in the amount o f US$25 million
equivalent. The project was later also financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), inthe
amount o f US$5.35 million, and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), in the amount o f 6
million.

11.BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe Amount ofUS$5 Million

Country Context

4.      The SMMRP, approved in 2003, is an integral part o f the implementation o f the
Government's Mineral Policy, which was approved in2001. Insupport o f the policy, the project
targets: (i)stimulation o f investments in the mineral sector; (ii)
                                                                  increased revenues from mining,
resulting in rural development; (iii) regularization and improvements in small-scale mining; and
(iv) establishment o fmechanisms to minimize andmitigate the adverse social and environmental
impacts o f mineral exploitation. This would enable the development o f the mineral resources in
an efficient, socially sustainable, and environmentally sound manner, to contribute substantially
to the country's earnings, employment, reduction o f poverty, and improvement o f quality o f life
inrural areas.

5.      The SMMRP comes at a critical time for Uganda, when the world i s experiencing a
minerals boom. Metals prices have increased rapidly since the project was approved in2003. As
a consequence, exploration investments are increasing and, with the assistance o f SMMRP,
Uganda i s positioning itself to take advantage o f these investments.

6.      The number o f mineral licenses and amount o f non-tax mineral revenue collected by
Uganda has increased 200 percent since SMMRP's inception. Large-scale investors are being
attracted to the sector, with feasibility studies underway for two operations and major mining
companies purchasing the geological data developed under the project. Small-scale Ugandan

                                                         3


miners are equally enthusiastic about the support offered through the SMMRP to improve their
livelihoods and reduce poverty inthe miningareas.

The Original Credit and Project Objectives

7.      In 2003,      Uganda, with the support from the International Development Association
(IDA), designed the SMMRP with the following objectives: (i)accelerate sustainable
development and reduce poverty by strengthening governance, transparency, and capacity inthe
management o f mineral resources, with particular emphasis on community development in
mining areas and improvement o f small-scale and artisanal mining; and (ii)              promote a socially
andenvironmentally sound development o fthe minerals sector based onprivate investments.

8.      The IDA Credit in the amount o f SDR 17.7 million (US$25 million equivalent) was
approved by the Board on December 9, 2003 and became effective on August 17, 2004; it is
scheduled to close on June 30, 2009. In conjunction with the proposed additional financing, an
extension o fthe project closing date untilJune 30, 2011i s beingrequested.

9.      During the January 2008 project mid-tern review the Government and other project
stakeholders strongly endorsed the original project objective as fully valid and relevant. At the
same time, at the initiative o f the World Bank team, the stakeholders accepted the need to tighten
the focus o f the project objective, review and expand its indicators to better capture project
benefits, and increase the focus on project results. The rephrased PDO (based on the original
PDO) is as follows:

     "Strengthening Government's capacity to develop a sound minerals sector based on
    private investments and improvements in selected artisanal and small scale mining
    areas"

10.     Uganda has requested an extension o f the project closing date and additional financing to
cover a cost overrun. The extension and additional financing will allow continued World Bank
assistance to this priority sector. The four project components would remain the same: (i)
Strengthening Transparency and Governance in Mining; (ii)Community Development and
Mineral Resources; (iii)      Establishment o f EnvironmentaVSocial Management Capacity; and (iv)
Geological Information and Development.

Project Performance and Status of Implementation

11.     The project is moving towards reaching its developmental objectives and is widely
regarded as successful. Stakeholder meetings were held as part o f the mid-term review and
feedback on the project was overwhelmingly positive.

12.     The project had been consistently rated satisfactory. Due to the delay of the NDF-
financed mining cadastre activity', which caused a delay in implementation o f the mining

' The delay was a result o f NDF's requirement for 100 percent Nordic bidders. The assignment was advertised
  twice and since a sufficient response was not received from Nordic firms, NDF has now waived this requirement,
  and biddinghas beenopened to all international consultants.

                                                   4


cadastre sub-component, the project was conservatively ratedmoderately satisfactory inthe most
recent Implementation Status Report. Since that time, the procurement o f the cadastre activity
has advanced, and thus the project i s again considered satisfactory. Procurement and financial
management remain satisfactory; however a recent post-procurement review picked up on a few
weaknesses inregardto the execution o fprocurement. An action planto address these issues has
been discussed with the government and will be closely followed up in the next six months to
ensure smooth procurement processing going forward The project has no unresolved legal,
fiduciary, or safeguard issues, and the borrower and the implementing agency-the        Department
of Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM)-are              committed to the effective utilization o f the
additional financing. Approval o f the project extension and additional financing will reinforce
continued satisfactory project implementation and achievement o fthe PDO.

Proposed Extension of Closing Date of the Original Project

13.     An extension o f the original project closing date by two years is being requested. An
extension from the original closing date o f June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2011 i s necessitated due to
a delay inthe originally planned implementationperiod. While the IDA project was approved in
December 2003, it was not until January 2006, over two years later, that the parallel financing
from NDF and AfDB became available. The proposed additional financing will be implemented
along the same timeframe as the SMMRP and thus both the additional financing and the
SMMRP would be expected to close June 30,201 1.

14.     Three major factors caused the initial implementation delay. First, the parallel financier
agreements became effective with a two year delay, thereby delaying the implementation o f
associated IDAproject activities (NDF disbursementsare now ready to begin). Second, the three
different sets o f donor procurement rules, compounded by the time and Government capacity
needed to comply with the country's new procurement law, initially delayed procurement
(Government capacity and understanding o f the procurement processes i s now on track). Third,
the global miningboom caused by current highdemand for metals led to an unexpected shortage
inthe availability of qualified mining consultants andthus weak responses to some request for
proposals for project activities (current responses to request for proposals has been stronger).

15.     Over the past two years, project implementation has picked up and now all the major
procurement packages are well advanced. The proposed project extension will allow for the
completion o f these activities, which are critical to the success o fthe project.

ProposedAdditional Financing

16.     The project activities will remain withinthe original scope as designed at appraisal stage.
Additional financing in the amount o f US$5 million would cover the cost overrun o f US$5
million (SDR 3.1 million) to complete planned project activities under IDA financed activities.
Uganda will be contributing an additional US$0.6 million as counterpart fimding. The cost
overrun has occurred primarily due to higher than expected costs for technical assistance on
geological information and mapping, which has resulted from the mineral commodities boom
that followed project approval. The major project activities dependent on the provision o f the
additional financing are shown inTable 1below.

17.     Parallel financing arrangements as provided for under the original project will continue.
AfDB-financed components will be completed as scheduled (in line with the original closing
date), given that all major procurement has been completed. NDF, given the initial delay,
intends to extend its financing to coincide with the new proposed IDA project closing date
(NDF's extension is conditional on IDA'Sextension).

18.     Implementationarrangements under the proposed additional financing would be the same
as under the ongoing project. The current Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been exemplary
inits implementation o fthe existingproject.

19.     There i s a potential risk that prices for goods and services in the mining sector will
continue to increase. Thus, in addition to the contingency, the additional financing will include
anUnallocated Category for small price increases to provide for such potential further increases
andthus mitigatingthis risk.

111.ProposedChanges

20.     The project will not finance any additional activities, but rather ensure sufficient
financing i s available for the originally plannedproject activities.

21.     The original PDO was as follows:

    Assist the Government of Uganda in implementing its strategy to (i) accelerate
    sustainable economic and social development and reduce poverty by strengthening
    governance, transparency and capacity in management of mineral resources with
    particular emphasis on community development in mining areas and improvement of
    small-scale artisanal mining; and (ii) promote a socially and environmentally sound
    development of the minerals sector based on private investments.

                                                  6


22.     This PDO, while remaining true to the original intent o f SMMRP, has beenrefocused as
follows:

    Strengthening the government's capacity to develop a sound minerals sector based on
    private investments and improvements in selected artisanal and small scale mining areas.

23.     In line with the revised PDO and based on the original results framework, the results
framework has been revised to better measure and evaluate project results. The revised results
framework, including outcome indicators and intermediate outcome indicators, i s attached as
Annex 1.

24.     Implementation arrangements under the additional financing would be the same as for the
ongoing Project. The current PCU has been exemplary in its implementation o f the existing
project.

25.     There are no outstanding or unresolved fiduciary, environmental, or social issues under
the project.

IV. Consistencywith CAS

26.     The project remains consistent with the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which
was in force at the time o f project approval, including its objective o f promoting broad-based
private sector-led growth. The project i s also consistent with the 2005-2009 Uganda Joint
Assistance Strategy, which identifies mining as an activity for development in rural areas, and
likewise the Government's 2005 Poverty Eradication Action Plan, which calls for a mining
sector framework neededto encourages private exploration while ensuring that the country gets a
good return from the exploitation o f its mineral resources.

V. EconomicAnalysisof Cost Overrunor FinancingGap

27.     The proposed additional financing to cover the cost overrun does not negatively affect the
economic analysis o f the project. Just as the costs o f miningsector services have increased due to
the current commodities boom, so has the size o f potential investments in the sector. In the
current investment climate the project i s even more economicallyjustifiable.

28.     In the original economic analysis mineral production was expected to increase from
US$40.8 million in 2000 to US$127.8 million by the end of the project. Additional financing of
US$5 million will bring the total project cost to US$30 million. As such, investment in
exploration and mining operations will far exceed project cost. Modest estimates are for
increased exploration expenditure o f US$5 million per year; by contrast, investments currently
under feasibility study exceed US$250 million.

VI. ExpectedOutcomes

29.     While the project does not include any new activities, the results framework has been
revised to better capture project results in line with the refocused PDO. New indicators on

mining have been added to the existing indicators on mineral investment and revenue. The
project has gathered baseline data on selected artisanal mining communities so progress in
improving the livelihoods o fthese communities can be measured. The SMMRP PCUis engaging
the services o f a monitoring and evaluation specialist to assist ingathering data, tracking results,
andmonitoring achievements.

30.     Key outcomes expected under the project include increased revenues from the mining
sector, which can be used for poverty reduction programs; increased transparency o f the sector,
including publication o f sector revenues; and increased formalization o f artisanal and small scale
miners. Key outcome indicatorsto track progress towardproject outcomes include:

    Transparent and accurate licensing (mining cadastre), i.e., all licenses issued through the
    transparent and non-discretionary computerizedminingcadastre system.

    Uganda achieves transparency o f miningsector revenues as evidenced by regular publication
    o f such revenues.

    Increased mining investment measured by 50 percent increase in mineral exploration and
    investment.

    Increased fiscal revenues from miningby 50 percent.

    Increase in number o f licenses given to artisanal and small scale miners, to formalize the
    sector so that ASM can gain access to government support.

    Improved income levels inselected A S M communities

VII. Benefitsand Risks

31,     As there are no new project activities, the project benefits remain the same. That is, the
project offers benefits to the country by improving the mining policy, legal, and regulatory
framework and government capacity to administer the sector. It also targets actions to raise the
standard o f living andreduce environmental damage in small-scale and artisanal miningareas.

32.     Risks were evaluated at the project mid-term review, and the overall project risk
assessment o f modest remains the same (i-e., no change from the Project Appraisal Document).
During the assessment of risks at the mid-term review, the risk o f Government's continued
commitment to reform was reduced from substantial to modest. Inaddition, the risk o f quality o f
external audit was reduced from substantial to modest, since audits have been carried out on time
and quality is reported as adequate. Other risks remained unchanged. Two additional risks,
increases in world prices for services related to the mining sector and adequacy o f counterpart
fimding, have been identified since project approval and are both assessed as substantial. An
assessment o f political risk as substantial has also been included in conjunction with the
originally-identified risk o f political interference. The full updated risk matrix i s attached as
Annex 2.

33.    Environmental and Social Issues. The current Project Environmental Category (B)
would not change under the additional financing. The additional finance will cause no new
impacts and triggers no new policies. To date, safeguards compliance o f the project i s
satisfactory. Safeguards monitoring, especially inthe small-scale and artisanal mining areas, will
continue to reduce potential environmental damages and to address possible displacement o f
incomes and livelihood after mine closure. Three instruments to guide safeguard activities during
project implementation have been prepared and disclosed in the original project, including (i)   a
Sector Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), to guide sectoral environmental and social
assessments; (ii) a Resettlement Framework, to address resettlement and compensation; and (iii)
a Process Framework, for the mitigation o f social impacts due to restrictions in access to natural
resources due to the creation o fprotected areas.

VIII. FinancialTerms and Conditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

34.     As with the original project, the additional financing o f US$5 million would be provided
as a Credit. Standard IDA terms, with a maturity o f 40 years, including a grace period o f ten
years, apply. There are no additional conditions o f effectiveness.

The overall project risk continues to be assessed as modest (Le., no change from the
PAD). Below is a table with proposed changes to project risks ratings. The last two risks
inthetable havebeenaddedto those that were originally identifiedinthePAD.

Government           S           M           Upto date, the Government has
continued                                    demonstrated commitment to the project
commitment to                                reforms by supporting project activities and
reform                                       providing adequate counterpart funding. The
                                             promotion o f mineral sector development
                                             through private sector has been strongly
                                             supported and investors (both exploration
                                             and exploitation) started to come. It i s
                                             proposed to lower this risk to Modest.
Reasonably stable   M            M           Over the past years, prices for minerals were
world o f minerals                           booming which created a very opportune

and prices                                   New investments are coming inboth
                                             exploration and exploitation. A bulk o f
                                             projected miningactivities over the next few
                                             years will remain to be carried out by local
                                             miners (both artisanal and small scale).
Continued staff     M            M           Overall, the staffing andresources provided
stability and                                have been adequate. However, the issue o f
ownership regarding                          staff retention within the Ministryhas been
project activities                           flagged by all stakeholders. The project
                                             invests into developingskills among

                                             evaluate options to retain staff incurrent
                                             positions.
Political inference M            M           The project didnot experience political
