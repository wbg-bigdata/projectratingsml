                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Due to delays in completion of the renovations/construction at the Department of Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM) an extension of 6 months was requested by Government to
                         allow completion of the works and the installation, testing of and training on the geological equipment, systems and infrastructure to be housed the new buildings. In partnership with
                         our co financiers, the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), the project has invested over $30 million in geological information and systems
                         that cannot be made available to Government and investors if these components cannot be completed. In addition, completion of the building is required for the co financiers to
                         complete their remaining activities - the laboratory and mining cadastre system being funded by the AfDB and NDF, respectively. The Africa Vice President approved the extension
                         on June 24, 2011 with a new closing date of December 31, 2011. The co financiers have already extended their closing dates to July 31, 2011 for AfDB and September 30, 2012 for
                         NDF.
