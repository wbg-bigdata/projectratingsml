F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the proposed Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources
Project (SMMRP) is to assist the Government of Uganda (GOU) in implementing its
strategy to
  (i) accelerate sustainable development and reduce poverty by strengthening governance,
transparency and capacity in the management of mineral resources, with particular
emphasis on community development in mining areas and improvement of small-scale
and artisanal mining; and
  (ii) promote a socially and environmentally sound development of the minerals sector
based on private investments.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Strengthening Government's capacity to develop a sound minerals sector based on private
investments and improvements in selected artisanal and small scale mining areas.

1   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country context. Uganda is a land-locked country in the East African Region of sub-
Saharan Africa, bordering Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC). Uganda is considered one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, primarily
driven by agricultural exports including coffee, cotton, tobacco and fish (Revenue Watch
Institute, 2012). During the two decades from 1989 to 2009, Uganda’s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) grew, on average, at a rate of 7.4 percent per annum (Uganda at a Glance, 2012); per
capita income increased from US$309 to US$509.1 The poverty headcount fell from 56 percent in
1992/93 to 38 percent in 2002/2003, the time of Project preparation, and to 24 percent by 2009/10
(World Bank, 2012). At a fertility rate of 6.7 percent, Uganda’s rapid population growth poses an
employment challenge, which puts particularly new labor market entrants at risk of falling into
poverty. In addition, despite the gains attained, inequality persists both within and across different
parts of Uganda (World Bank, 2012).2 In 2011, Uganda ranked 161 out of 187 countries included
in the Human Development Index.

2.      Mineral occurrences. Uganda is endowed with a rich and diverse mineral occurrences,
which are most heavily concentrated in the southwestern districts close to the borders with
Rwanda and DRC, and in the southeastern districts close to the border with Kenya. In addition,
the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda, which hosts occurrences of over 50 different
economic minerals, has become one of the most prospected areas of the country since a
disarmament initiative has brought about increased stability and security after decades of conflicts
over cattle and pasture lands (Hinton et al, 2011). To date, Uganda's extractive industry has
focused on commercial mining of cobalt, gold, copper, iron ore, tungsten, steel, tin and other
industrial minerals such as cement, diamond, salt and vermiculite,3 primarily in the southwestern
and southeastern parts of the country (Revenue Watch Institute, 2012).

3.      Economic Relevance. Uganda’s mining industry reached a peak in the 1950's and 1960’s
when mining accounted for up to 30 percent of the country's exports (URA, 2011). Until the early
1970s, the mining sector contributed about six percent of Uganda’s GDP and accounted for
nearly one third of the country’s foreign exchange earnings. During the years of political turmoil
the mineral sector’s contribution shrunk to less than one percent of GDP (DGSM, 2003). At the
time of Project approval, in 2003/04 the sector’s contribution to Uganda’s economy accounted for
less than 0.9 percent of GDP (Uganda National Commissions for UNESCO, 2005), and by 2010
it had diminished to about 0.4 percent, in current prices (Yager, 2012). Cement, iron and steel,
gold, and cobalt combined accounted for 10.7 percent of Uganda’s total value of exports in 2010
(Yager, 2012).



1
  Since 2009, however, growth has slowed down due to exogenous shocks, such as prolonged drought and
increasing food and oil prices.
2
  The North and the East accounted for two thirds of the poor in 2009/10.
3
  The country has sufficient reserves to continue its 2007 production level of 3,500 metric tons for another
100 years (Revenue Watch Institute, 2012).




                                                      1
4.      Industry structure. While Uganda’s mining industry comprises several large-scale
investors, artisanal and small-scale miners (ASMs) produce more than 90 percent of metallic
minerals, industrial minerals (like gypsum, limestone) and building minerals (like clay, aggregate,
sand)? (TACC, 2009, p. 2). In Uganda, ASM4 provides a source of livelihood for nearly 200,000
women and men, of whom about 10 percent are engaged in artisanal and small scale mining of
gold, primarily in the eastern and northeastern regions of Busia and Karamoja and in the western
and southwestern goldfields in the Kigezi and Buhweju regions (Hinton, 2011). Women’s
participation in ASM varies between up to 90 percent (in highly impoverished regions) and about
10-25 percent in more agriculturally productive areas (Hinton, 2011).

5.      Environmental and Social Impact. Mineral production in Uganda remains far below the
comparative levels achieved by countries with similar geological potential.5 As a consequence,
mining has had a much less severe impact on the environment in Uganda compared to other
countries, such as DRC or Zambia, where large-scale base metal mining has led to significant
adverse environmental outcomes (Republic of Uganda, 2003). ASM operations are predominately
associated with environmental degradation, especially at small hard rock mines and alluvial
workings in the form of soil erosion, waste dumps and siltation (DGSM, 2003). Artisanal and
small-scale miners are often exposed to adverse health, safety and living conditions,6 especially
small-scale gold and salt miners who often practice extremely inefficient and unsafe methods of
prospecting and extraction? (URA, 2003), such as the use of mercury in small -scale gold
production.7

6.      Sector Reform. In the late 1990s, in order to take advantage of the opportunities offered
by renewed interest in mining in Africa, the Government of Uganda sought to transform its
mineral sector into a private sector-driven “modern and viable mining industry.? It strove to
redress its unfavorable investment climate, hampered primarily by bureaucratic delays,
intransparent allocation of mining licenses, and the lack of modern geological information (PAD,
2003). In 1999/2000, with World Bank collaboration, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Development (MEMD) led a Minerals Sector Review, which identified the key constraints to
sector development as well as a set of required reforms. A National Mineral Policy, approved in
2001, spelled out Uganda’s vision for a “new dawn in mining,? which constituted a formal
framework for the development of the mineral sector, within the National Strategy for Poverty
Eradication (MEMD, 2000).8


4
  Characteristics of artisanal and small scale mining (ASM) include: (i) manual and labor-intensive, using
only shovels and basins or somewhat mechanized; (ii) small in scale, employing only a few people working
at a small mine site; and (iii) somewhat disorganized and unlicensed or organized in the form of an
association that is legally allowed (licensed) to operate (TACC, 2009).
5
  Despite Uganda’s long history of mineral production, many areas of the country thought to be highly
prospective for gold, tantalite, copper and cobalt exploitation have received little or no exploration.
6
  These result from ASM operators’ widespread lack of: (i) mining and mineral processing skills; (ii)
business skills; (iii) knowledge of legal and regulatory issues; (iv) funds for appropriate equipment; (v)
awareness of environmental management and occupational safety; and (vi) the often informal and
clandestine nature of ASM activities.
7
  Other occupational health and safety hazards include: rock falls and pit wall collapses, accidents with
machinery and tools; exposure to dust, loud noise, and chemicals, such as mercury, cyanide and diesel;
poor hygiene and sanitation facilities; and mosquitoes breeding in ponded and stagnant water in pits
(TACC, 2009).
8
  Key policy objectives included: (i) stimulating investment in the mineral sector by promoting private
participation; (ii) ensuring that mineral wealth supports national economic and social development; (iii)

                                                    2
7.       Rationale for Bank assistance. The Project was consistent with the World Bank’s 2000
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which emphasized the promotion of broad-based private
sector-led growth as one its core elements (World Bank, 2008). The mineral sector’s envisaged
contribution to poverty reduction through private sector development was twofold. It aimed to: (i)
harness economic growth by attracting large-scale mining investments; and (ii) foster the
development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by formalizing and reorganizing artisanal
and small-scale mining to enhance its technical, environmental and social performance (Uganda
National Commissions for UNESCO, 2005). The World Bank was uniquely positioned to support
the Government’s integrated strategy for creating a legal, social and fiscal environment conducive
to attracting and assuring potential foreign investors, given that, at the time, it had been: (i) the
leading provider of technical assistance to African and Latin American mining countries and thus
a contributor to the significant expansion of mineral activities on both continents; and (ii) a core
participant in the mineral policy dialogue in Uganda (PAD, 2003). In addition, the World Bank’s
long-standing involvement and the positive outcomes9 of its prior support to related reforms,10
had given the Bank a comparative advantage in supporting the Government’s mineral sector
reform in a way that it would complement and reinforce activities and achievements of earlier and
concurrent operations (PAD, 2003).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.       Original Project Development Objective (PDO). The original objective of the
Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP), as stated in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) was “to assist the Government of Uganda (GOU) in implementing its
strategy to: (i) accelerate sustainable development and reduce poverty by strengthening
governance, transparency and capacity in the management of mineral resources, with particular
emphasis on community development in mining areas and improvement of small-scale and
artisanal mining; and (ii) promote a socially and environmentally sound development of the
minerals sector based on private investments.?11



regularizing and improving artisanal and small scale mining; (iv) minimizing and mitigating adverse social
and environmental impacts of mineral exploitation; (v) removing restrictive practices on women
participation in the mineral sector and protecting children against mining hazards; (vi) developing and
strengthening local capacity for mineral development; (vi) adding value to mineral ores and increase
mineral trade (MEMD, 2000).
9
  The overall outcome of the World Bank’s 2001-2007 Country Assistance Program for Uganda was rated
as Moderately Satisfactory, and as substantially effective for decentralization, public sector reform,
education, and water and sanitation (IEG, 2009).
10
   These included capacity building of public institutions, privatization of state-owned enterprises,
decentralization, and modernization of Uganda’s legal and regulatory framework (PAD, 2003). In addition,
establishing linkages with the Uganda Private Sector Competitiveness Development Project to expose
SMEs to best-practice business techniques, management systems, and technological innovations as well as
with “existing support facilities of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Africa Project
Development Facility and the Africa Management Services Company? was foreseen (PAD, 2003, p. 7). It
is unclear to what extent these linkages materialized.
11
   The wording of the PDOs in the PAD differed slightly from that in the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) between the International Development Association (IDA) and the Republic of Uganda, according
to which the Project aimed “to assist the Borrower’s efforts in implementing its mineral sector strategy for
accelerated sustainable development and reduction of poverty by specifically: (a) strengthening governance,
transparency and capacity in the management of mineral resources, encouraging community development
in the mining Districts and improving small scale and artisanal mining; and (b) promot ing socially and

    environmentally compliant development of its mineral sector with a sound private investment base.? Part
    (ii) of the PDO in the PAD referred to the promotion of a socially and environmentally “sound?
    development of the minerals sector while the PDO in the DCA sought to promote “compliant?
    development. Given the Project’s multi-pronged approach to supporting the environmentally, socially and
    economically balanced and transparent development of the minerals sector the term “sound? development,
    though not clearly defined, more appropriately captured the Project’s comprehensive approach compared to
    the more static and narrow notion of “compliant? development. Furthermore, it is unclear with which
    standards the development was supposed to be “compliant.? The PDO version in the Board -approved PAD
    will therefore be used to assess Project results in the context of this ICR.
    12
       Henceforth, the terms Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator and Outcome indicator will be
    used interchangeably. Likewise, the terms Intermediate Results indicators and Output indicators will be
    used interchangeably.
    13
       The wording of the PDO indicators in the main text of the PAD, albeit not significantly different in terms
    of substance was slightly different from that in the DCA; the Outcome Indicators in the PAD were slightly
    more specific. Indicator 2 (a) in Schedule 5 of the DCA (as well as in the Project Design Summary in
    Annex 1 of the PAD) reads “number of Community management plans which include mineral resources
    management? while the corresponding indicator in the main body of the PAD specifies “ regular use of
    community development plans, which include mineral resources management , by project end. The wording
    in the main body of the PAD was thus more outcome- than output-oriented. Furthermore, Indicator 2 (b) in
    the main body of the PAD included a specific numeric target, unlike the corresponding indicator in the
    DCA: “increased collection of mineral fees and fiscal revenues by 50 perc ent for regions as a result of
    decentralized fiscal collection procedures? (PAD, 2003, p. 2).
    14
       The wording and classification of the PDO indicators in the main text of the PAD differed from those in
    the PAD’s Project Design Summary (see PAD, 2003, p. 36ff). The latter contained the following four
    additional sub-objectives of the PDO compared to three sub-objectives included in the main body of the
    PAD: (i) legal and regulatory framework which is modern and transparent; (ii) mineral rights cadastral
    system and mineral information system available to investors; (iii) improved central/regional mineral
    institutions/agencies for timely/reliable transparent administrative and extension services; and (iv) fiscal
    reform for enabling decentralized collection of part of sectoral taxes (PAD, 2003).
    15
       The Intermediate Outcome/Output Indicators for the Project are listed in the Project Design Summary in
    Annex 1 of the PAD (see Annex 2 of this ICR).

    1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

    10.     Revised Project Development Objective. The PDO was revised, as part of an Additional
    Financing credit approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on September 23,
    2008 (ISR No. 11, December 2008) to read: “Strengthening Government's capacity to develop a
    sound minerals sector based on private investments and improvements in selected artisanal and
    small scale mining areas.? A review of projects in the Africa portfolio had identified the SMMRP
    PDO as being wordy and difficult to measure. The team took advantage of the MTR and the
    Additional Financing to refocus and revise the PDO. While “remaining true to the original intent?
    of the Project, the PDO was revised, to “improve [the] focus on results? (Aide Memoire, MTR,
    January 2008). The focus of the original PDO on helping the Government to “accelerate
    sustainable economic and social development and reduce poverty? was rather vague, not easily
    measurable, and not very realistic for a predominantly technical assistance type of Project.



                                                            5
11.     Revised Project Outcome Indicators. In accordance with the revised PDO, the original
Results Framework was modified “to better measure and evaluate project results? (Project Paper
for Additional Financing, 2008). The right column in Table 1 above depicts the revised Project
Outcome Indicators. The rationale for the choice of indicators was based on the objective of
developing a “sound? minerals sector, characterized by: (i) financial viability; (ii) good
governance; (iii) increasing transparency of mining revenues; (iv) environmental and social
responsibility; and (v) generation of lasting benefits to mining communities (Sheldon, 2009).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The “primary target group,? as identified in the PAD (2003, p. 17ff.) comprised the
following categories of direct beneficiaries:
     The “entire private mineral investing community, local and foreign? through the creation
        of a modern, consistent and homogeneous mining policy, legal and regulatory
        framework, and the development of adequate Government capacity for its
        implementation.
     Public mining agencies, particularly the Department of Geological Survey and Mines
        (DGSM) were expected to operate more efficiently as a result of capacity building
        activities at the central level as well as of the regional DGSM offices, thus facilitating the
        decentralized, timely and non-discretionary administration of mining rights, and
        improved enforcement capacity of environmental, health and safety regulations;
     Communities in small-scale and artisanal mining areas were expected to benefit from
        targeted actions aimed to raise the standard of living and reduce environmental damage.
     Small-scale enterprises were intended to benefit from technical assistance, legal rights,
        tenure security, improved access to markets, environmental and health awareness, and
        facilitated access to basic services and economic activities, which were to foster
        economic diversification. Particular attention was to be paid to addressing gender and
        non-adult labor issues in artisanal mining.

13.     Furthermore, according to the PAD, indirect benefits were expected to accrue to: (i) the
Government – and ultimately the people - of Uganda in the form of increased export and tax
revenue achieved through increased foreign and local direct investment; (ii) more sustainable
development and fair distribution of benefits to local communities adjacent to mining areas, and
thus a better regional distribution of productive activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.    In order to support the sustainable development of the mineral sector, the Project
comprised four key components16 and several sub-components (see Table 2 below) that were to
approach the industry’s key constraints concurrently from four different angles:


16
  For the purpose of this ICR, Component 5 and Component 6 are not considered key Project components
as they were to support the attainment of the PDO only indirectly by orchestrating (Component 5) or
providing contingency funding (Component 6) for the substantive Project activities to be undertaken under
Components 1 through 4. Component 5 represented the anticipated Project overhead costs, i.e. the
operating expenses of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within the DGSM, which was to coordinate and
manage Project activities and functions, including procurement, monitoring and evaluation, financial
management, record keeping, accounts and disbursement, as well as coordination with other stakeholders,
such as other parts of MEMD, NEMA, MGLSD, other ministries/agencies, as well as the Uganda Chamber
of Mines, the Uganda Quarry Operators Association, private mining companies, and NGOs (PAD, 2003).

                                                    6
   Component 1: Strengthening Governance and Transparency (US$5.5, about 20 percent of
    total Project cost at appraisal) aimed to strengthen governance and transparency in the
    mining sector to induce investment in the sector, and improve the allocation and management
    of mining revenues. It was assumed that reforming the mineral sector’s legal, regulatory and
    institutional framework, and building sufficient institutional capacity in the Department of
    Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM) to enable it to perform its licensing, cadastral, and
    geological survey duties, as well as monitor operations and enforce regulations would attract
    and reassure potential investors (McMahon, 2010).

   Component 2: Community Development and Small-Scale Mining (US$5.1, about 19
    percent of total Project cost at appraisal) aimed to pilot benefit sharing with mining
    communities. by: (i) testing the decentralized collection of some mining taxes and mineral
    resources management in select mining communities; and (ii) enabling artisanal ASM
    operators to develop, diversify, and/or increase their productive capabilities and thus enhance
    their income-generating opportunities. The former entailed assistance to select communities
    in the preparation of annual community development plans to budget for small scale
    infrastructure investments to be financed from royalties collected from nearby larger scale
    mining activities. The latter comprised a small grants program (SGP) to pilot safer,
    environmentally friendlier and more lucrative small scale income generation practices in
    mining communities; it was to be preceded by an outreach program that aimed to raise
    artisanal and small-scale miners’ awareness of regulatory provisions, mining rights,
    environmental and technical issues and to encourage the creation of mining
    associations/cooperatives to formalize mining activities (PAD, P. 49).

   Component 3: Environment and Social Management Framework (US$2.4 million, about 9
    percent of total Project cost a appraisal) aimed to promote environmentally and socially
    responsible mining development by creating: (i) a Social and Environmental Unit (SEU)
    within DGSM responsible for conducting baseline assessments and monitoring the mining
    sector’s compliance with mining, social and environmental norms and regulations; and (ii) a
    computerized Environmental Management and Information System that was to include
    baseline data, the safety and health inspection database, and environmental quality data.

   Component 4: Geo-Information and Development (US$12.1 million, about 45 percent of
    total Project cost at appraisal) intended to promote private investments in the mining sector
    by providing basic and reliable geological information and identifying high mineral potential
    areas. High quality geo-data were to be generated through airborne geophysical surveys and
    complete coverage of geological maps. The geo-information was intended to be readily
    available to potential investors through a computerized Geological and Minerals Information
    System (GMIS) (Project Implementation Manual, 2004).

  1.6 Revised Components

  15.      The Project Components were not revised. Additional Financing was sought due to cost
  overruns and approved in September 2008 to “ensure [that] sufficient financing [was] available
  for the originally planned project activities? (Project Paper for Additional Financing, 2008).

  1.7 Other significant changes

  16.     Changes in the scope of planned activities. The Project was designed during a “slump?
  in global mining. As the mining industry began to boom again around 2005, when Project
  implementation effectively commenced, the price of construction materials (see Annex 2 of this
  ICR) as well as the demand for (and thus fees of) qualified international consultants rose sharply,
  leaving the Project under-costed and under-funded. For example, the airborne surveys ended up
  costing US$ 12.51 million (USS7.51 million IDA-funding and US$5.0 million AfDB funding)
  compared to the budgeted amount of US$6 million, and the Internet/Intranet system installation

                                                      8
was also significantly under-budgeted at the time of appraisal (actual cost of US$1.47 million
versus a cost estimate of US$0.4 at appraisal). As a result of the cost increases, the Bank, co-
financiers and the client, focused on key priority areas and reallocated activities between them
and sought outside assistance (e.g. Commonwealth Secretariat on the legal framework) to
maximize the impact of available funds. As shown in Table 3 below, the following activities were
not undertaken or partially implemented while others were added as additional funding from
different sources became available during Project implementation (see paragraph 17):

17.      Changes in funding allocations. At the time of appraisal, as reflected in the PAD, the
total Project Cost was estimated to be US$28 million. Additional resources for the Project
became available in the form of a US$7 million (Euro 6 million) NDF Credit and a US$7.7
million AfDB Grant. The original scope of Project activities was essentially redistributed among
the three development partners and in some areas expanded (see Table 4 below),19 and concrete
sets of activities were earmarked for NDF and AfDB financing. In September 2008, the World

   However, only two of the envisaged seven seismology stations were purchased with AfDB funding (but
were not yet functional at the time of the ICR mission due the delay in the procurement of antennas).

   The new premises were to house equipment and staff for the mining cadastre, geological management
information system, documentation center (maps and books, environmental and social management system,
and laboratory.

   The IDA, NDF and AfDB funding arrangements were considered parallel financing; the three partners
funded specific activities included in the PAD and a common procurement plan, but each financier
assumed responsibility for procurement.

18.      Changes in implementation schedule. Project effectiveness was delayed from January
2004 when the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed until August 2004. Several
factors contributed to further delays in Project implementation, notably: (i) the fact that the
project financiers (IDA, AfDB and NDF) did not come on board at the same time, 20 (ii)
procurement delays caused by complex procurement procedures and the need to harmonize the
four financiers’ procurement guidelines with the National Public Procurement and Disposal of
Assets (PPDA) guidelines; (iii) the fact that the preparation of a simplified Community
Procurement Manual, which did not commence until 2009 reportedly due to ongoing discussions
as to whether communities should be carrying out procurement, and whose completion took
nearly nine months; (iv) under-budgeting of contract prices, due to inflation and underestimation
of bills of quantities, (v) a nearly one-year delay in the approval of the World Bank’s Additional
Financing Credit by the Ugandan Parliament following the approval by the World Bank’s Board
of Directors in September 2009; and (vi) the lack of continuity in PCU staff (see paragraph 66).
As a result of these delays, the Project’s Midterm Review was postponed from its original June
30, 2006 date until January 2008; and the Project closing date was extended twice by a total of 30
months, from its original June 30, 2009 closing date to December 31, 2011.

2    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Soundness of background analysis. While the PAD correctly identified the key
constraints to the development of the mining sector, overall, its diagnostic sections offer more of
a “preview? of Project activities than a thorough, well-structured analysis of the status quo.
However, the prevailing conditions were correctly analyzed and diagnosed in the Sectoral
Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), prepared during Project preparation (DGSM,
2003). It appropriately characterized Uganda’s mining sector and its mining potential, the
environmental and social impacts of mining, as well as policy, legal and regulatory issues
pertaining to mining. Given the original PDO’s focus on poverty reduction, community
development in mining areas, and improvement of small-scale and artisanal mining, as well as on
measuring the Project’s contribution towards decentralizing the management of mineral resources


20
  Even though, according to members of the Project preparation and appraisal team, additional financing
by the AfDB and the NDF was foreseen at the time of appraisal, these financing arrangements were not
reflected in the PAD, which lists International Development Association (IDA) and the Republic of Uganda
as the sole Project financiers. The AfDB and NDF funding only materialized with a more than five and
two-year delay, respectively, which delayed the start up of interlinked Project activities.

                                                  12
and decentralized tax collection, the PAD should have contained an analysis of the state of
decentralization at the time of appraisal, as well as some basic poverty indicators.

20.      Incorporation of lessons learned. According to the PAD, two sets of lessons were
incorporated into Project design: (i) lessons from (then) ongoing programs in Uganda; and (ii)
lessons learned from earlier World Bank-supported mining sector capacity building operations in
other countries in the Africa region, such as Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Tanzania, and
Madagascar, and in Peru and Argentina in the South America region (PAD, p. 20). Experience
had shown that successful 21 mining countries enacted legal, fiscal, environmental and social
policies in tandem (PAD, p. 20). It was assumed that foreign investment would materialize only if
MEMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently administer and manage the sector, which would
require an integrated approach to sector reform. Another important lesson learned from the
Ugandan experience with capacity building and public sector reform,22 which was appropriately
incorporated into Project design, was the critical importance of beneficiary participation in all
aspects of the project cycle, both in terms of broad stakeholder consultation as well as the
Project’s Community Development and Small Grants activities (Component 2),

21.     Assessment of Project objectives, design and components. The essence of the original
PDO was highly relevant at the time of appraisal, and its continued relevance, based on the
information available at the time, was confirmed during the Midterm Review (Thomas, 2004).
However, the original PDO was not very specific and difficult to measure, as was the case with
many projects of the SMMRP’s generation. For a predominately technical assistance type project,
the poverty reduction aim under Part (i) of the PDOs was overly ambitious and beyond the
Project’s realm of influence and attribution. Revenue transparency and revenue sharing with
mining districts were undoubtedly desirable aims but certainly not sufficient to ensure public
sector provision of basic social services required to enhance the quality of life in poverty-stricken
mining communities. Similarly, Project activities envisaged to be undertaken under the Project’s
four substantive components seemed rather complex and overly ambitious given the time and
funds budgeted for implementation.

22.     While the PAD did not specify a particular theory of change upon which Project design
was based, it is commendable that it implicitly embraced the World Bank’s – at the time of
appraisal – novel value chain approach23 for supporting extractive industries, which marked the
evolution from the historic emphasis on “merely? increasing investment to promoting sustainable
development (McMahon, 2010). Project design would have gained in clarity if the PAD had
presented a theory of change that would have explained more explicitly the link between ASM




21
   While the notion of success is not clearly defined, it appears to refer to “inclusive growth? of the sector
(see Thomas, 2004).
22
   However, the PAD did not reference any specific salient experience with operations financed by other
Development Partners or other World Bank-financed operations, such as the Local Government
Development Project, given the Project design’s prominent reference to decentralization
23
   The Project’s multipronged approach mirrored the value chain concept, a theory of change according to
which sustainable sector development required the following interlinked elements: (i) confidence-instilling
mineral legislation and award of licenses; (ii) clear regulatory framework and adequate capacity for
monitoring and enforcement; (iii) transparent and efficient collection of taxes and royalties; (iv) efficient
management and allocation of fiscal revenues; and (v) sector contributing to sustainable socio-economic
development (McMahon, 2010).

                                                      13
and poverty reduction,24 i.e. how to turn a circle of poverty into a cycle of prosperity25 as depicted
in Figure 1 below. 26 This conceptual approach is closely aligned with the Communities and
Small-Scale Mining (CASM) approach, a global networking, coordination, and knowledge
facility aiming to reduce poverty by improving the environmental, social and economic
performance of the ASM sub-sector in developing countries, which appropriately informed
Project design (CASM, 2012).27 It is laudable that the Project sought to actively promote local
community development several years prior to the mainstreaming of local community
development into the World Bank’s mining sector work (McMahon, 2010).

23.      Implementation arrangements. As noted by a cross-section of stakeholders consulted
during the ICR mission, the implementation arrangements for the Project were considered
satisfactory. An issue raised by PCU staff during the ICR mission pertained to the composition of
the PCU team, given that the Unit comprised both civil servants seconded from other parts of the
DGSM for the duration of the Project and contract staff. The significant difference in
remuneration between Government employees and contract staff, which was not commensurate
with experience or responsibilities, reportedly caused friction within the PCU.

24.      Adequacy of Government commitment. At the time of appraisal, the Government’s
commitment was inferred from its adoption of a 2001 Mineral Policy of Uganda and the 2003
Mining Act. Given that the above-mentioned constraints to attracting foreign investments were
feared to impede the development of the sector, the Government was motivated to embark on a
set of reforms that had proven to be effective in other countries in Africa and Latin America.

25.     Stakeholder involvement and participatory processes. As noted in the PAD and
confirmed by several stakeholders interviewed during the ICR mission, Project preparation was
preceded by several consultative workshops held in Kampala in 2000, 2001 and 2003 to reach
consensus on a policy and strategy for the development of the mining sector. These public
discussions culminated in the adoption of a Minerals Policy in 2001, and the approval of a new




24
   For example, the PAD did not explicitly establish the link between the formalization of artisanal and
small-scale mining activities and the associated increase in local tax revenue collected from licensed ASM
operators in order to benefit community development.
25
   The model is based on the key tenet that the cycle of poverty can be broken by: (i) miners organizing
themselves into cooperatives, associations or companies and work together to get a license; (ii) District
Environmental Officers (DEOs), Community Development Officers (CDOs), and Community Health
Officers (CHOs), along with DGSM staff and miners providing training and extension services to miners;
(iii) sub-county, parish and village leaders advocating for the inclusion of ASM into their development
plans; and (iv) government officials lobbying for support to ASM by the relevant line ministries (Hinton,
2005).
26
   ASM plays an important role as a source of employment and household incomes, in reducing urban-rural
migration, and stimulating the establishment and growth of local businesses. It also plays a pivotal role in
the construction industry, especially with respect to sand, stone, clay, and limestone (Nsita, 2012).
27
    As stated on the CASM website, the Communities and Small-scale Mining initiative was launched in
2001, funded through a multi-donor trust fund, in response to a critical need for integrated, multi-
disciplinary solutions to the complex social and environmental challenges facing ASM communities, and
improved coordination between those working in this sector.

                                                    14
Mining Act in 2003. In addition, stakeholders interviewed during the ICR mission commended
the Project on its extensive consultations held with ASM associations, private mining and service
companies, the Chamber of Mines, relevant NGOs, and representatives of central, and regional
administrations, as well as the Association of small scale miners during Project preparation,
including the preparation and disclosure of the Sector Environmental and Social Assessment in
Uganda in 2003. Furthermore, mining communities who were to benefit from mining royalties
collected from larger scale mining operations were to be actively involved in the management of
mineral resources, with support from NGOs and private firms (PAD, 2003).

26.      Assessment of Risks. In hindsight, several risks were underestimated or not
acknowledged at the time of appraisal. The risk of insufficient Government commitment to
institutional reforms, such as the envisaged restructuring of the DGSM was more pronounced
than its commitment to legal and regulatory reforms, and would have warranted a High risk rating.
The downgrading of this risk rating from Substantial to Modest following the Midterm Review
(World Bank, 2008) did not seem justified in light of persisting procurement related
implementation delays. The Modest rating of the risk of insufficient staff, resources and
conditions to effectively – and sustainably – implement the reform did not anticipate Sub-Saharan
Africa’s biggest onshore oil discovery in 20 years in western Uganda (Revenue Watch, 2012),
which reportedly contributed to the chronic underfunding of the DGSM relative to the MEMD’s
Petroleum Exploration and Production Department which was not flagged as a risk. Furthermore,
staff attrition due to the DGSM’s low pay scale, especially compared t o the reformed
remuneration structure in the PEPD                                       In addition, the Moderate
risk rating for fluctuations in global minerals market conditions did not anticipate the substantial
cost overruns incurred during Project implementation as a result of steep increases in the prices of
mining-related services. 28



28
  The steep and continuous increase in global mining industry capital expenditure from 2003 to 2008 is
depicted in a publication by the Economic Commission for Africa (2011), on p. 31.

2.2 Implementation

27.     Extension of Closing Date. The Project’s closing date was extended twice, by a total of
30 months: (i) from its original June 30, 2009 closing date to June 30, 2011 in conjunction with
the approval of an Additional Financing Credit on September 23, 2008 (Level One restructuring)
by the World Bank’s Board of Directors to complete Project activities and to align the closing
dates of the original and Additional Financing Credit; and (ii) through December 31, 2011 (Level
Two restructuring) per approval by the Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa Region on
June 22, 2011 to ensure “that the extensive investment of over US$30 million on geological
information and systems by the three financiers can be made available to investors and the Project
Development Objective (PDO) achieved? (World Bank, 2011).29 The two other financiers had
already extended their closing dates to July 31, 2011 for the AfDB Grant (which was further
extended to November 30, 2011 and again on December 20, 2011 to May 31, 2012 and
September 30, 2012 for the NDF Credit (which was further extended on September 5, 2012 until
December 31, 2012). 30 The main reasons for the delays included Government and NDF
procurement procedures,31 as well as effectiveness delays in regards to the original IDA Credit
(eight months), the AfDB Grant (11 months), the NDF Credit (37 months), and the IDA
Additional Financing Credit (more than 14 months).

28.      Additional Financing. The Project was originally to be financed by an IDA Credit in the
amount of US$25 million equivalent, and a Borrower counterpart contribution equivalent to
US$3 million. As mentioned in paragraph 20 above, the Project received additional resources in
the form of a Grant in the amount of UA$5.35 million or about US$7.7 million from the African
Development Bank (AfDB), signed in January 2005 and effective as of December 2005, and a
Credit agreement in the amount of EUR 6 million or about US$7 million from the Nordic
Development Fund (NDF), approved in May 2005 and effective as of June 2008. The AfDB and
NDF proceeds were envisaged to close the financing gap caused by cost increases in works,
goods and services, such as a US$2 million higher than expected (and budgeted) contract value of
the geological information and mapping activities (ISR No. 7, January 2007) associated with the
mineral commodities boom, as well as under-budgeting of Project activities at appraisal (World
Bank, 2008). However, at the time of Midterm Review it became evident that further resources
were need to cover the budget shortfall. The Additional Financing Credit approved in 2008 was to
ensure the completion of originally planned Project activities. However, it soon became apparent
that the Additional Financing would not be sufficient (ISR No. 13, December 2009), and that the
scope of activities had to be scaled back further in order to allow for the completion of priority
activities (see Table 3 above).

29.   Midterm Review. Due to a nearly two-year delay in the startup of Project activities,
World Bank Management agreed to postpone the Midterm Review until January 2008.




29
   The Restructuring Paper emphasized that the completion of the building was a prerequisite for the
completion of the remaining AfDB and NDF-funded activities, i.e. the laboratory and mining cadastre
system, respectively (World Bank, 2011).
30
   The due date of this ICR was extended until October 31, 2012 to incorporate the completion of activities
funded by the Nordic Development Fund, which were critical to the Project’s attainment of its objectives.
31
   As mentioned earlier the delay was caused by two unsuccessful rounds of bidding for the NDF-financed
cadastre and registry system, based on the NDF’s requirement that bidders be a citizen, permanent resident
or registered company of a Nordic country. The requirement was waved for the third round of bidding.

                                                    16
Stakeholder consultations held in Uganda32 during the Midterm Review revealed the following
key findings: (i) while the Project Development Objectives and Project activities remained valid,
the PDO and Key Performance Indicators were to be revised33 “to improve measurement and
focus on results? (Aide Memoire, MTR, January 2008); (ii) a 2-year extension of both IDA and
NDF Credits was to be requested, due to the delayed start up of Project implementation; (iii)
additional IDA funding of up to US$5 million as well as additional Government counterpart
funding of US$0.6 million were required to complete all remaining activities; and (iv) given the
persisting security issues in Karamoja, Block 4 of the Airborne Geophysical Survey was to be
exchanged, at no additional cost, for northern Uganda (Gulu, Pader and Kitgum). The latter
occurred in 2008 (Aide Memoire, MTR, January 2008).

30.      Implementation arrangements. Implementation arrangements did not change.

31.    Project Risk status. The Project carried a Country Record Flag in nine out of fourteen
ISRs with Portfolio system flag ratings, i.e. out of a total of seventeen Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs). The Project did not carry any Project Effectiveness Delay Flags, Disbursement
Delay Flags or Country Environment Flags.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     This section assesses the M&E arrangements for the original PDO and Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), as well as the revised PDO and KPIs.

33.      M&E framework for the original PDO. The Project’s M&E design was typical for this
generation of pre-Results Framework projects whose objectives and indicators tended not be
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound (SMART). The presentation of the
original Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) seemed disjointed, and lacked a logical flow. In
addition, since the KPI were not grounded in a well-defined theory of change, they were not held
together by an explicit and coherent set of assumptions. However, despite these shortcomings, the
individual KPIs demonstrated an implicit connection to the key elements of the original PDO,
except for poverty reduction,34 and an explicit connection with the “transparency and capacity in
the management of mineral resources? and possibly the “community development? aspects .
Nevertheless, overall, most of the indicators were superficially and partially tracking Outcomes,
and thus not very meaningful.35 The revision of the KPIs in 2006 (see ISR No. 6, June 2006) led
to a significant improvement, given that the Outcome and Output indicators were more closely
(re)aligned with the PDO indicators in the PAD. The KPIs’ reference to decentralization, such as


32
   The Midterm Review did reportedly not include a performance review, as customary, by the World
Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG).
33
   The MTR AM notes that the “PDO was not changed but was focused on the key elements.? However, the
new PDO represented a substantive change, given that one of the key elements of the original PDO, i.e. its
focus on community development in a decentralized institutional environment, was not explicit (but
covered through the focus on artisanal and small scale mining).
34
   It is noteworthy that the KPIs tracked during the earlier phases of Project implementation differed
substantially from those in the Project Design Summary in Annex 1 of the PAD. Except for the first PDO
indicator “Strengthening transparency and governance in mineral resources management: cadastral system
of mineral rights? none of the Outcome or Output indicators listed in the PAD were tracked until 2006 (ISR
No. 6, June 2006).
35
   For example, the first PDO indicator tracked one dimension of governance and transparency but did not
capture the reformed fiscal and legal framework dimension. The second PDO indicator did not measure
impact, i.e. whether or not the community plan were executed and to what effect.

                                                   17
the role of sub-national public institutions in the decentralized fiscal collection as well as the provision of
timely, reliable, and transparent administrative and extension services was rather prominently featured
in the PAD, was removed during the revision.

34.       M&E framework for revised PDO. The KPIs were formally revised in 200936 following
the formal revision of the PDO, as part of the Additional Financing and Level I Project
Restructuring in September 2008 (ISR No. 11, December 2008). Several new PDO indicators
were added to measure more accurately the Project’s impact on: (i) transparency through the
“zero unresolved complaints about the mining license allocation process? and “regular
publication of mining revenues to be transferred to mining districts? indicators;37 and (ii) small-
scale mining, through indicators such as the number of new ASM licenses, and incomes of
formalized ASM. The latter attempted to capture the Project’s impact on livelihoods of small-
scale miners, which was commendable, as it appropriately reconnected the PDO indicators with
the Project’s strategic context, i.e. the CAS and PEAP.38 While the KPIs became increasingly
realigned with the most salient elements of the Project over the course of implementation, except
for the community development aim, they also became increasingly numerous, culminating in a
total of 12 PDO indicators and 9 Intermediate Results/Output indicators39 being tracked at the
time of Project closing. While the Project was complex in design, a limited number of indicators
more clearly aligned with the theories of change underlying the Project (see paragraph 22), i.e.
the value chain concept and ASM prosperity cycle, would have been preferable. Furthermore,
changes in the living and working conditions in mining communities could have possibly been
monitored more consistently if the M&E consultancy had been conducted as planned.40




36
   The revised PDO was included in ISRs subsequent to the Board approval, i.e. starting from ISR No. 11
(December 2008). However, the revised KPIs appeared for the first time in ISR No. 13 (December 2009),
i.e. only after the Additional Financing became effective in December 2009. ISR No. 13 and all subsequent
ISRs covered the Project implementation and results status for both the Original Credit (Credit No.
P079925) and the Additional Financing (Credit No. P111097).
37
   The addition of several Intermediate Results indicators to measure the attainment of outputs intended to
support the Project’s governance and transparency outcomes constit uted a positive change. These include
indicators measuring transparency, such as time to process mining licenses and acquire geological data, and
governance, such as the creation of management systems, including a Social Environment Unit, a
computerized Environmental Management System, and a Geological and Mineral Information System.
Furthermore, the indicator pertaining to the review of mineral code and regulations was reinstated, and
several Intermediate Results indicators measuring the sector’s complianc e with environmental and social
responsibility aspects of “sound? mineral sector development were added (ISR No. 13, December 2009).
38
   However, it was also noted that the Outcome indicator “Regular Use of Community Development Plans?
contained in previous ISRs was last tracked in ISR No. 12 (May 2009). This was unfortunate, given the
Project design’s laudable focus on sub-national mineral resources governance and revenue sharing with
mining communities.
39
   Prior to the Project’s closing date, two IDA Core Sector PDO Indicators (number of direct project
beneficiaries and female beneficiaries) and four other non-Core PDO indicators (such as number of
community members benefitting from the Small Grants Program) were added – for the sake of providing
additional evidence of the Project’s performance - during the last supervision mission (ISR 17, December
2011). This ICR relies for the assessment of project outcomes on the six key performance indicators
adopted formally in 2008. The additional ones are listed in Section 3.2 but do not enter the outcome rating.
40
   Terms of Reference for an M&E consultancy were prepared (Hinton, 2010) but it did not materialize due
to shortage of funds.

                                                     18
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance41

35.      Safeguard Compliance. Throughout Project implementation, both environmental and
social safeguard compliance were consistently rated Satisfactory in supervision reports. 42
Environmental safeguards compliance was monitored by an environmental specialist on the
Bank’s supervision team, while social safeguards oversight was provided by a local Consultant.
The Social and Environmental Unit (SEU), housed within the DGSM and created with Project
support in 2005, played an important role in ensuring the mining sector’s compliance with
national environmental and social regulations. 43 During the Project’s lifetime, only one
environmental safeguard concern was noted during an inspection of the construction and
rehabilitation works on the DGSM’s premises in Entebbe, which was promptly remedied.44 In
order to ensure safeguard compliance under the Small Grants Program, as recommended by the
World Bank’s supervision team the small grant applications included a brief description of
potential environmental and social impacts and their management (Aide Memoire, May 2010).

36.      Financial Management. In supervision reports, the Project’s Financial Management
performance was rated Satisfactory throughout the Project’s lifetime, with the exception of two
Moderately Satisfactory ratings45 (see ISR No. 13, December 2009, and ISR 17, December 2011).
As noted and discussed during several supervision missions, the accounting software Solomon
ceased to function in 2008, and the PCU switched to manual financial management using Excel
spread sheets, which posed the risk of human error or tampering. The PCU expected to be
included in the IFMIS rollout by the Government, which was delayed, and did not consider the
installation of a new software package relatively close to the Project closing date a good
investment. Other financial management issues, which were largely resolved, included the
absence of consistent budget forecasting and ex-post budget analysis, resulting in budget line
overruns and over-commitment of the Project, insufficient internal controls and supervision.

37.      Procurement. The Project’s procurement performance was mixed as reflected in the ISR
ratings, which ranged from Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory.46 The need to comply with


41
   According to the TTL, the Project was in compliance with all legal covenants.
42
   Three safeguard instruments had been prepared and disclosed for safeguarding Project activities during
Project implementation: a Sector Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA); a Resettlement
Framework; and a Process Framework. As reported by the TTL, no resettlement occurred under the Project.
43
   Under the guidance of a local Consultant, the SEU enhanced environmental management capacity in the
mining sector through: (i) designing and conducting trainings in Environmental Management and EIA
procedures with 80 miners, DGSM staff, and local government officials; (ii) the preparation of a baseline
study of the working conditions at Katwe Salt Works and a toolkit for training ASM miners on safe mining
practices and environmental rehabilitation (Aide Memoire, MTR, January 2008); and (iii) liaising, through
an informal consultative forum, with stakeholder statutory institutions (Aide Memoire, January 2011).
44
   The health risk involved in the demolition of the asbestos roof was highlighted by the mission. By the
following mission, the contractor had reportedly prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and
NEMA had granted its approval for the transportation and disposal of hazardous asbestos waste, and
protective gear and adequate supervision had been provided (Aide Memoire, January/February 2011).
45
   The results of the 2011 first Quarter FMR raised a number of concerns, including internal controls, the
lack of a computerized system and record keeping (Aide Memoire, May/June 2011).
46
   Procurement performance was rated Satisfactory in about 60 percent of the ISRs, Moderately
Satisfactory slightly more than one third of the ISRs, and in one ISR the rating was Moderately
Unsatisfactory due to “an issue with poor quality of procurement documentation which has added to
procurement delays? (ISR No. 8, June 2007). These issues were addressed to the satisfaction of the
supervision team, and the rating in the subsequent ISR was Satisfactory (ISR No. 9, December 2007).

                                                   19
different sets of procurement guidelines, i.e. IDA, AfDB and NDF guidelines compounded by the
time required to comply with the requirements of the MEMD’s Contracts Committee and the
Solicitor General caused some initial procurement delays. The Government’s complex internal
clearance process (for contract values exceeding US$ 85,000), some reported delays in
procurement processing on the Bank’s side, mostly prior to 2007, and the NDF’s procurement
requirements resulted in significant procurement and thus implementation delays.47 Furthermore,
several supervision missions observed delays in payment and the risk for incurring interest on
delayed payments due to internal inefficiencies. The latter were partly attributable to delays in the
release of adequate counterpart funding required to meet the Government’s ten percent
contribution to the payment amount (Aide Memoire, January/February 2011). Internal delays and
quality issues were discussed during supervision missions and adequately addressed by the Client.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     Despite repeated urging by the World Bank’s supervision team48 the Government has not
put in place viable transition arrangements. Nevertheless, the Government emphasized its
commitment to the sustainable development of the sector, in particular in the Karamoja region in
northeastern Uganda. The DGSM has reportedly already begun to sensitize the population in
preparation of future activities, including an airborne geophysical survey. Stakeholders
interviewed during the mission concurred that carrying out an airborne geophysical survey (and
geological mapping) of Karamoja, which was not included under the Project due to Security
concerns at the time, is “truly important.? Reportedly, the resulting data would also be of
importance to oil companies. A request for US$20 million in IDA funding to support the airborne
geophysical surveys and geological mapping, as well as the construction of the regional DGSM
offices was submitted to the World Bank by Uganda’s Minster of Finance, Planning and
Development in December 2011. The request is presently under consideration by the World Bank.

3 Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

39.     Relevance of Objectives. The continued High relevance of the Project’s original and
revised Project Development Objectives is evidenced by the fact that:
     Mining was listed as one of Uganda’s eight primary growth sectors in the 201 0/11-
        2014/15 National Development Plan (National Planning Agency, 2010).



47
   In an effort to expedite the SGP program, during the January 2009 mission it was decided that the
procurement of materials and equipment was to be undertaken by communities. However, the preparation
of the Community Procurement Manual (the PAD and PIM did not contain any provisions for community
procurement) took nearly nine months. The procurement of the civil works contract for the construction of
DGSM offices at headquarter took eight months to be completed, including the nearly 9-month re-bidding
process, caused by the irregular procurement and subsequent rebidding of the civil works contract. The
long delays in the start up of civil works had a ripple effect on other Project activities, such as the
consultancy for the Modern Documentation Center whose 12-month contract (9 months of elapsed time)
ended up being spread out over a 3-year period.
48
   The MEMD was repeatedly advised by the World Bank’s supervision team to budget sufficient funding
“to absorb the essential operating costs after the project closure.? (AM, January/February 2011). In addition,
MEMD was advised to put in place arrangements to sustain the SGP beyond the life of the Project, and to
“keep the program going even after closure of the project? (AM, January/February 2011).

                                                     20
        The Project’s dual objectives of: (i) promoting environmentally and socially responsible
         large-scale investments in the mining sector; and (ii) fostering financially, socially and
         environmentally viable artisanal and small-scale mining operations to give ASM
         operators “a leg up? out of poverty are consistent with Outcome 1.4 of the Bank’s FY11 -
         15 Country Assistance Strategy for Uganda (CAS), notably increased efficiency and
         sustainability of natural resources management.

40.      Relevance of Design. The Project’s design was not changed at restructuring. The
continued High relevance of the Project’s design is evidenced by the fact that:
     The chapter dedicated to the mining sector in the 2010/11-2014/15 National
        Development Plan contains a set of strategies for unleashing the development of the
        industry (Uganda National Planning Agency, 2010) that either mirror or dovetail with
        activities carried out under the SMMRP. 49

41.    Relevance of Implementation. The Project’s implementation approach and arrangements
were not changed at restructuring. The Project’s continued High relevance of implementation is
evidenced by the fact that:
     Key expected results of the FY11-15 CAS under Outcome 1.4 include Project-funded
       achievements, such as strengthened Government capacity to manage the mining sector
       responsibly, support artisanal and small scale mining communities, and lay the
       foundation for future investment through high tech geological mapping and a modern
       transparent mining rights system (FY11-15 CAS, p. 31). Furthermore, mining was one of
       five sectors that together accounted for about 68 percent of IDA commitments during the
       2001-2007 CAS period (F11-15 CAS, p. 31).
     Moreover, the 2005 Joint Assistance Strategy for Uganda called for Developing Partners’
       support to: (i) advance rural development more broadly, including the development of
       mining enterprises (World Bank, 2005, p. 22); (ii) improve national and regional
       sustainable natural resource management, inter alia, in the mining sector; and (iii)
       increase the value of mining industry production (World Bank, 2005, p. 41);
     In addition, other organizations are at present actively supporting specific thematic and
       geographic mining sector initiatives in Uganda as well as the Great Lakes, and, more
       broadly, the Africa region.50

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

42.    In accordance with the ICR guidelines (World Bank, 2006) for World Bank-supported
investment lending projects whose Project Development Objectives (PDOs) have been formally


49
   These include: (i) promote and empower artisanal and small scale miners; (ii) provide basic geo-
scientific information for development of the mining and subsidiary sectors; (iii) enhance human resource
capacities within the mining industry; (iv) promote environmental and social responsibility in mining; (v)
strengthen and expand the National Seismological Network to achieve national coverage over areas prone
to earthquakes; (vi) promote and gazette the geo-sites and geo-parks; and (vii) develop geothermal energy
to complement hydro and other sources of power (Uganda National Planning Agency, 2010).
50
   For example, Irish Aid has funded a baseline assessment of ASM in Karamoja region in Northeastern
Uganda, which is likely to form the basis for the development of an intervention (Hinton et al, 2011a); and
the DGSM/MEMD is further engaged in regional initiatives, such as the International Conference on the
Great Lakes Region and Africa’s Mining Vision 2050, an initiative from African Union and the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (Hinton, 2011).

                                                    21
revised, the Project’s outcomes will be assessed against both the original and revised project
objectives. In order to arrive at an overall outcome rating, separate outcome ratings (against
original and revised project objectives) were weighted in proportion to the share of actual
loan/credit disbursements made in the periods before and after approval of the revision (per
World Bank, 2006, p. 42). As discussed below, the achievement of the original PDO was rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, while the attainment of the revised PDO was rated Satisfactory. At the
time of restructuring in September 2008, when the PDO was changed, US$ 12.81 million or
51.24 percent of the original IDA Project proceeds had been disbursed. In light of the above-
mentioned percentage rule, the overall PDO rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.2.1. Achievement of original Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43.      The original Development Objective (PDO), comprised of two Parts, reflected the
Project’s two-track approach toward promoting environmentally and socially sustainable
development. Part (i) focused on sustainable development at the local level through improved
artisanal and small-scale mining practices and community-based management of mineral
resources while Part (ii) aimed to further sustainable development at a national level by attracting
private sector investment in the mineral sector. Parts (i) and (ii) of the original PDO will be
assessed separately. A summary of the Project’s attainment of its original PDO indicators is
provided in Table 6 below.

3.2.1.1. Achievement of Part (i) of the original PDO: “to accelerate sustainable
         development and reduce poverty by strengthening governance, transparency and
         capacity in the management of mineral resources, with particular emphasis on
         community development in mining areas and improvement of small scale mining.?
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.      Recognizing the important role of artisanal and small-scale mining in reducing poverty
and accelerating sustainable rural development, which were at the core of Part (i) of the original
PDO, the Project made a groundbreaking contribution towards the advancement and
formalization of the ASM sector in Uganda that resulted in a National Strategy for the
Advancement of Artisanal and Small Scale Mining in Uganda. The Project-supported
interdisciplinary and gender-responsive model of ASM training and extension services built “on
international best practice by developing essential capacity and forging essential intersectoral
linkages between DGSM and other central government agencies, local government and
communities? (Hinton, 2010). As depicted in Figure 2 below, the formalization and development
of the ASM sector was supported by the following Outputs: (i) the formation of 50 associations51
of artisanal and small miners to enhance production and marketing efforts; (ii) the training of 180
local trainers who subsequently trained about 1,000 miners (40 percent of whom were women) in
practical mining-related topics, such as mining methods, legal and regulatory issues, business
skills, occupational safety and health, and community development; (iii) the award of 18 small
grants, on a pilot basis, which laid the foundation for mainstreaming ASM into national and local
economic development (Nsita, 2012); and (iv) a significant increase in the cumulative number of
ASM licenses issued from 100 in 2003 to 952 at the end of the Project, which presumably
resulted in an increase in local royalty collection (see Indicator 2.2. for the original PDO below).



51
  Some of these associations operated so successfully that they graduated from the ASM sub-sector to form
joint ventures with international mining companies.

                                                   were, on average, about US$2.59 million.

   It also provides potential investors with “one-stop shop? online access to geospatial data, and the Environmental and Social Management Information System,
and the online Modern Documentation Centre.
b)
   It is worth noting that the final ISR (No. 17, December 2011) indicates that only 60 percent of the Mining Cadastre & Registry system was established against
a target of 100 percent. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Mining Cadastre was completed by the NDF after the closing of the IDA credit.
c)
   The US$1 million baseline figure for this original PDO indicator was an estimate at the time of appraisal whereas the US$0.55 million baseline figure used in
the revised PDO represented the actual value at the time of appraisal. In addition, the US$30-50 million annual exploration/investment target was unrealistic and
most likely a mistake. The corresponding revised PDO indicator states a cumulative target of US$30 million.
d)
   Revenues from exploration licenses were, as corroborated by representatives from mining companies interviewed during the ICR mission, attributable to
Project activities. However, given the long start of up times of large scale mining operations it is not clear to what extent the substantial increases in mine exports
as well as fiscal revenues are attributable to Project-supported activities. The significant increase in fiscal revenues is at least partially attributable to intensified
collection efforts.
d)
   The corresponding PDO indicator tracked in the ISRs prior to the PDO change was: Increased mining investment measured by increase in mineral exploration,
mine exports and fiscal revenues from mining.

45.     In addition to the local collection of select sectoral taxes (Original PDO indicator 2.2),
community development was to be aided by a reform of the mineral fiscal regime (Original PDO
indicator 7) to increase the flow of fiscal revenues to communities by sharing larger-scale mining
companies’ royalty payments with adjacent mining communities (PAD, 2003). The Project
produced significant transparency gains given that, since 2009 the respective mining districts’
shares of mining royalties collected centrally by the Uganda Revenue Authority on behalf of the
MoFPED have been published in national newspapers. While, overall, the Project’s initially

envisaged impact on decentralized management of mineral resources (Original PDO Indicator 2)
was modest52 the Project’s achievements towards formalizing the ASM sector and thus increasing
the local revenue base represented an important step in the right direction. While the original
PDO Outcome indicators 53 did not specifically measure the extent to which sustainable
development and poverty reduction were accelerated by the Project, the actual values for relevant
Outcome indicators,54 in particular the increase in ASM incomes from US$3 per day in 2006 to
US$5-7 per day at the end of 2011 suggest that the Project substantially achieved its intended
improvements in ASM operations and miners’ livelihoods.


3.2.1.2. Achievement of Part (ii) of the original PDO: “to promote a socially and
       environmentally sound development of the minerals sector based on private investments?
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.      Current and potential private investors in the mining industry and other sector experts
commended the Government on the excellent geological data collected under the Project and
accessible through the new online geological database, which reportedly contributed to the
increase in exploration investments. It is worth noting that oil companies have also begun to
acquire airborne survey data due to the high accuracy of the information (see Output indicators
3.1 through 3.4 in Annex 2 of this ICR). On average, annual exploration and development
investments (see PDO indicator 3.1 in Table 6) amounted to about US$47 million in nominal
terms and nearly US$65 million in real terms (in constant 2011 US$) between 2005-2011, and
were thus well within and above the target range of US$30-50 million, respectively (see PDO
indicator 3.2 in Table 7). Annual fiscal revenues increased significantly between 2004 and 2011,
i.e. by 75 percent in nominal terms and 34 percent in real terms but fell short of the US$15-35
million target (see PDO indicator 3.3 in Table 6).

47.     The Project’s “socially and environmentally sound development? aim was substantially
accomplished.55 In terms of social soundness, the Project’s gender-sensitivity and emphasis on
equitable access, control and benefit from mineral resources represented unchartered territory at
the time. It culminated in 2009 in the formulation of a “Guidance Strategy for the Promotion of


52
   While a baseline profiling study and community planning workshop were conducted in Katwe in Kasese
District in 2006 (ISR No. 7, January 2007), the planned empowerment of mining communities to play a
leading role in managing their economic and social development through the preparation of community
development plans that were to include mineral resources management (PAD, 2003) did not materialize
(see PDO indicators 2.1 and 4.2 in Table 6).
53
   The key Outcome indicators in Table 6 pertaining to the Project’s performance against Part (i) of its
original PDO included: (i) PDO indicators 1.1, 1.2, and 5 measuring transparency and ease of mineral
rights award; PDO indicators 4.1 and 4.2 measuring improved governance based on a revised mineral legal
and regulatory framework; and PDO indicator 6 measuring strengthened capacity to effectively manage
mineral resources at central and regional levels. Recognizing the potentially important contribution of
revenues from non-agricultural activities, such as mining, towards reducing poverty in rural areas, Outcome
indicators 2.1, 2.2, and 7 in Table 6 were to measure the Project’s performance in regards to the community
development aspect of Part (i) of the original PDO.
54
   These include Output indicators 4.1 (improved ASM operations of small grant recipients), 4.2 (ASM
development without mining rushes), and 6.2 (increased incomes among ASM operators).
55
   The completion of the Commonwealth-funded review of the legal and regulatory framework (see PDO
indicators 4.1 and 4.2 in Table 6) is particularly important in regards to the legalization of - and hence
reduction of adverse environmental impacts and increase of tax revenue from - artisanal and small-scale
gold mining activities, which are not covered under the current Mining Act (Hinton, 2011).

                                                    25
Gender Equity in Mining in Uganda? which was intended to supplement the ASM strategy by
emphasizing gender-specific needs. In terms of environmental soundness, adverse environmental
conditions associated with new large-scale mining operations have been avoided as a result of
strategic Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) (Output Indicator 6.1.) that were routinely
carried out by the SEU/NEMA for eight new operations between 2005 and 2011. However, due
to the severe shortage of operational funding at DGSM, the technical and administrative arm of
the MEMD, the mandated “Lead Agency? for environmental management of the minerals sector
(Hinton, 2011), no mining inspections to monitor social and environmental impacts and
compliance of mining operations have occurred since the Project closed at the end of December
2011, which also marked the departure of SEU staff trained under the Project.

48.      In sum, the achievement of the original PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Despite
the Project’s modest support to the decentralized management of mineral resources and local
royalty collection, it did achieve two major aims. Firstly, the collection of state of the art
geological data obtained through high-resolution airborne geophysical surveys was praised by
every stakeholder interviewed during the ICR mission as an outstanding accomplishment that has
already resulted in increased exploration and development investments. Secondly, the Project
paved the road towards the formalization and legalization of the ASM sector, considered a
prerequisite to enhanced local royalty collection and improved environmental, social,
occupational safety conditions. The Project developed and began to implement a strategic
approach, building on international best practice that engaged policy makers, national and
subnational governments and mining communities in the improvement of ASM operations and
thus artisanal and small scale miners’ livelihoods. The broad-based ASM outreach campaign and
the formulation of a gender-sensitive ASM strategy “put ASM on the map? and led to the
recognition of its tremendous contribution to the national economy (Hinton, 2011).

3.2.2. Achievement of revised Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

49.     Stakeholders consulted during the ICR mission concurred that the Project generated
tangible benefits and accomplished a significant part of its intended objective, i.e. “strengthening
the Government’s capacity to develop a sound56 minerals sector based on private investments
and improvements in selected artisanal and small scale mining areas.? Table 7 below details the
Project’s achievements against its revised PDO indicators. The Project’s key results can be
summarized as follows.

    High quality geospatial data in high demand. Mining companies interviewed during the
     mission were particularly impressed by the high quality airborne geophysical data (see
     Intermediate Results Indicators 12 and 14), 57 which they regarded as the most successful
     Project-supported activity. Between 2007 and December 2011, 39 companies and individuals
     purchased geophysical, geological, geochemical data, and maps, generating nearly UGX135
     billion or US$58,000 in revenues. Mining companies, among them some of the largest global
     investors, valued the opportunity to purchase raw data in order to identify promising
     exploration areas.



56
   Soundness was characterized by: (i) financial viability; (ii) good governance; (iii) increasing
transparency of mining revenues; (iv) environmental and social responsibility; and (v) generation of lasting
benefits to mining communities (Sheldon, 2009).
57

    Geological and Information Minerals Information System. The integration of digital
     geological, geochemical, geophysical and environmental data into a shared Geological and
     Minerals Information System (GMIS) (Intermediate Results indicator 13),58 considered a key
     tool for the promotion of mineral exploration and investment in the mining sector was
     completed in June 2012. The Mining Cadastre and Registry was integrated into the GMIS in
     March 2012 (Intermediate Results indicator 2), and a web portal for public access was
     launched in September 2012. The Modern Documentation Centre has been linked to the
     GMIS on a web-map since January 2012; operational and metadata has been accessible
     online on the intranet since March 2012 and on the Internet since October 2012. The
     Environmental and Social Information Management System (ESIMS) (Intermediate Results
     indicator 10) was installed on the server in May 2012, and was linked to the GMIS portal in
     June 2012.59

    Rise in exploration and development investments. Access to preliminary geophysical and
     geological data, as well as promotional brochures and the DGSM’s representation at
     international trade shows, such as INDABA, ESRI, PDAC, Mines and Money and Africa
     Downunder 60 are considered major contributors to the substantial increase in mineral
     exploration and development licenses (revised PDO indicator 3). As depicted in Figures 2
     and 3 below, in the six-year period between 2005 and September 2011 the purchase of a total
     of 429 licenses generated about US$329 million in exploration and development investments
     in nominal terms, and US$451 in real terms (in constant 2011 US$), by far outperforming the
     US$30 million target for this Project-supported activity.

   The Geological and Mineral Information System (GMIS), a geological and mineral database aimed to
integrate semi-autonomous databases, was designed under separate consultancies for the Geodata, Mines,
Geology, and Laboratories Divisions.
59
   Prior to the closing of the Project, the World Bank had negotiated and agreed with the NDF that the latter
would cover the costs that were known to go beyond December 31, 2011 to ensure continuity of funding to
bring the GMIS to completion.
60
   Mining sector promotion by “front line? DGSM staff represented a more cost-effective alternative to the
Mining Promotion Unit, which was to be established under the Project but which did not materialize.

    Capacity building for good governance. Multiple stakeholders interviewed during the
     mission commended the Project on its extensive capacity building efforts for DGSM staff and
     other relevant civil servants in the form of graduate and post-graduate degrees, study tours,
     workshops, on-the-job training, as well as the provision of access to computers, and other
     modern office equipment and systems, as well as newly constructed office space.

    Increasing transparency of mining revenues. The 2001 Mining Act stipulated that 20
     percent of all royalties collected from mining companies are to be transferred from the
     MoFPED through the MEMD to mining districts (17 percent) and landowners (3 percent).61
     As a result of the Project, these royalty amounts are now published in local newspapers and
     thus fully transparent (revised PDO indicator 2). In order to sensitize local governments on
     this revenue sharing mechanism, as well as the Mining Act and its regulations, a Project-
     financed Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM) team conducted extensive consultations
     and trainings of trainers. Originally to be financed by the SMMRP and subsequently, as
     proposed by the Commonwealth Secretariat, funded and supervised by the latter, a new draft
     Mining Policy, Mineral Act and regulations (revised Intermediate Results indicator 1) were
     prepared and reviewed by the office of the Commissioner of the DGSM.

    Environmentally and socially responsible mining development. To redress adverse
     environmental, occupational safety, and social effects frequently associated with informal
     small-scale mining, a Project-supported ASM team, led by the Social and Environmental Unit
     (SEU) established with Project support in 2005 (revised Intermediate Results indicator 9)
     conducted comprehensive and intensive highly participatory consultations and training of
     trainers in 13 mining districts. This led to the creation of presently 32 active ASM
     associations and an increase in the number of ASM licenses from 100 in 2003 to 925 at the
     end of December 2011 (revised PDO indicator 5 and revised Intermediate Results indicator 6).
     The Project also funded the production of an excellent ASM Handbook as well as a toolkit
     for baseline studies of ASM in mining areas (revised Intermediate Results indicator 5).
     Beneficiaries consulted during field visits reported knowledge gain and positive behavior
     change as a result. In addition, the SEU carried out 25 gender consultations with 600 men and
     400 women, which, according to an official from the Ministry of Gender and Community
     Development, provided substantial support to the Government’s gender mainstreaming
     efforts (revised Intermediate Results indicator 8), and fed into the formulation of a strategy
     for gender in ASM, which will form the basis for future policy level discussions.

    Improving livelihoods in mining communities. The Project-supported Small Grants Program
     (SGP), which aimed to improve livelihoods and occupational safety, and reduce
     environmental damage caused by ASM activities, produced visible results. While the start up
     of the seed-funding pilot scheme was delayed by almost three years until 2010, partly due to
     the delayed preparation of the Community Procurement Manual, about 45 percent of the
     grant recipients reported that the “leg up? provided by the Project resulted in significant
     improvement in their livelihoods (PDO indicator 6).62 The entrepreneurial spirit of the six
     grant recipients visited during the mission in different parts of Uganda was impressive and
     their successful attempts to increase productivity, diversify and engagement in value chain
     activities remarkable



61
   As of December 2011, when a Statutory Instrument was issued, mining districts were to retain 10 percent
(of the 20 percent) and pass 7 percent on to mining sub-counties, and 3 percent to landowners.
62
   Incremental incomes associated with the receipt of a small grant varied greatly (see paragraphs 58f.)

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

50.     The Project was essentially a technical assistance/capacity building operation, which, as
such, did not lend itself to an economic and financial investment analysis. World Bank-supported
projects of this nature typically do not contain Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return or
cost effectiveness calculations. While, in principle, a cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) could
have been undertaken of the Small Grants Program, due to its limited sample size of 18 small
grants recipients a CEA would not have yielded meaningful results. The ex-ante economic and
financial assessment in Annex 4 of the PAD (p. 58) utilized “possible contributions of mining to
the economy? (PAD, p. 58) as a proxy approach for measuring efficiency. Projections for min ing
production values by the end of the Project in year 2008 were made for two scenarios: (i) a base
case scenario of one large-scale project which was to result in a US$128 million mineral
production value; and (ii) a best case scenario of two large-scale investments which was expected
to yield an a mineral production value of US$203 million. The analysis implicitly assumed that
the incremental production would be attributable to the Project. Since the analysis section in the
PAD did not relate the incremental production value to Project investments carrying out an ex-
post assessment based on this approach would not yield meaningful results regarding the
efficiency of Project-funded investments.

51.      However, the increased production of cement, limestone and pozzolanic materials, which
are, for the most part, produced by ASM operators, suggests that the Project’s extensive ASM
activities contributed to these positive changes in the production of construction materials. As
shown in Figure 4 below, the production of cement (hydraulic) rose from 507,068 to 1.4 million
metric tons, limestone production increased from about 226,408 to about 635,000 metric tons,
and the production of pozzolanic materials rose from 65,587 to about 446,000 metric tons during
the period from 2003-2010. Other economic indicators pertaining to efficiency considerations
include the mining exploration and development value and number of exploration licenses as
proxy indicators for potentially Project-encouraged future investment, fiscal revenues from
royalties, and revenues of ASM operations (see Table 8 below).

53.      The total (actual) Project cost amounted to US$50.2 compared to the original baseline
cost of US$27.0 million.63 In addition to the original IDA Credit and Government contribution,
financing was made provided by IDA in the form of an Additional Financing credit, an NDF loan
and an AfDB credit. While several activities were added to the original Project scope, such as
additional 50,000 line km of airborne survey, the construction of two seismological stations,
laboratory and lab equipment, equipment for geological mapping (see Table 3 above), the
primary purpose of the additional financing was to accommodate cost overruns stemming from
the substantially higher than expected worldwide cost increases associated with a booming
minerals industry as well as the under-costing of contracts such as the airborne survey (under
Component 4, which accounted for about 55 percent of total Project cost) and the
Intranet/Internet provision and civil works (under Component 1, which accounted for about 28
percent of total Project cost). These two Components, along with Component 5 (Project



63
   At the time of PDO change, 51 percent of the original IDA credit had been disbursed, or 41 percent of
the original and additional IDA-financing, and about one quarter of the actual Project cost. (The NDF and
AfDB were responsible for procuring activities financed under the NDF-loan and the AfDB grant.) Several
key Project activities were completed before restructuring, such as the IDA-funded airborne survey and
supervision, totaling about US$8.3 million). Major activities implemented after the PDO change include
the geological mapping, geological surveys and mineral resources assessment (US$7.9 million in IDA
credit proceeds and US$4 million in NDF funding), the AfDB-funded airborne survey (US$5 million), and
the IDA-funded construction and rehabilitation of the DGSM office and laboratory buildings (US$2.5
million including design and supervision cost). Given that the pre-PDO change implementation of Project-
activities was proportionate to the post-PDO change implementation in value, importance and number of
financiers, pre-PDO change efficiency is assumed to be the same as efficiency after the PDO change.

                                                   32
Management and Coordination) doubled in cost (although overall they remained at 8.6% of the
overall financing), compared to the appraisal estimate.

54.      Regarding cost overruns incurred under Component 1, official statistics show that input
prices in the construction sector increased by 10 to 11 percent per annum between 2007 and 2010,
with a pronounced spike in 2008, when input prices rose by more than 15 percent (UBOS, 2008,
2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012). The increase in the construction/rehabilitation cost of the DGSM
premises in Entebbe is thus a reflection of rising input price and not an indication of inefficiencies.
While inefficiencies were observed under the small grants program (Component 2), given that the
avoidable delayed release of grant funds constrained the ability of some grantees to complete
their sub-project activities, which led to less than effective use of funds, this only affected a small
portion, i.e. less than US$90,000 of Project resources.

55.     The under-costing of Project activities, notably the airborne survey, under Component 4,
represents a design flaw, given that the mining boom had already begun at the time of appraisal,
the cost increases thus should have been anticipated and costed accordingly. However, a
comparison of unit costs of airborne surveys (Component 4), as measured in US$ per line
kilometer flown, carried out in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda showed that the unit cost in
Uganda were similar to those in the other two countries, even though they were measured in
nominal terms (see Table 10 below).

56.     Regarding Component 5, the increase in administrative overhead costs reflects the
additional costs incurred by the 30-month extension of the Project closing date. Despite minor
shortcomings, given that the Project’s investments resulted in tangible and lasting changes in the
mining sector, in particular the establishment of an investor-friendly one-stop online shop for
geodata and mining licenses, and the increasing formalization of the ASM sector, efficiency is
rated Substantial both before and after the PDO change.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     The Overall Outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on the following
calculations (see Tables 11 and 12 below). The Overall Outcome against the original PDO is
Moderately Satisfactory, given that the Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation are
rated High, Efficacy is considered Moderately Satisfactory and Efficiency is rated Substantial.
The Overall Outcome against the revised PDO is Satisfactory, given that the Relevance of
Objectives, Design, and Implementation are rated High, Efficacy is considered Satisfactory, and
Efficiency is rated Substantial. The above-mentioned ratings were translated into numbers,
applying the ratings methodology in Appendix B of the ICR guidelines for restructured projects

                                                 33
with revised objectives. For the original PDO, this results in a weighted value of 2.05, and for the
revised PDO in a value of 2.44, hence leading to the overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.      Blueprint for ASM development. As mentioned earlier, the ASM sub-sector’s impact on
local and national development (see paragraph 4) is significant, yet not sufficiently recognized.64
Therefore, the Project-supported creation and partial implementation of a “blueprint? for the
advancement of the ASM sub-sector constituted crucial “pioneer work.? While assistance to
artisanal and small-scale miners was only provided on a pilot basis through the small grants
program, the broad-based ASM education campaign opened miners’ minds the environmental,
social, and occupational safety health and safety hazards as well as economic inefficiencies
associated with commonly used mining practices (Nsita, 2012). The Project thus laid an
important foundation to further work in this area.

59.     Gender impact. Nearly half of the 200,000 Ugandans who work in ASM are women who
generally face more difficulty than men in: (i) obtaining mining licenses, especially since it
involves travel to DGSM Headquarters in Entebbe: (ii) combining long ASM work days with
domestic responsibilities; and (iii) benefiting from sensitization campaigns due to gender
differences in regards to women’s ability to work as miners, participation in decision making
processes, ownership of radios, language proficiency, and literacy. The Project-supported
formulation of the Guidance Strategy for the Promotion of Gender Equity in Mining in Uganda,
combined with multiple gender consultations and sensitizations constituted a major milestone
towards women’s ability “to remove restrictive practices on women’s participation in the
minerals sector,? as stated in the Mineral Policy (2001).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.     The Project carried out extensive capacity building efforts for DGSM staff and other
relevant civil servants in the form of graduate and post-graduate degrees, study tours, workshops,
and on-the-job training. Furthermore, the Department’s physical infrastructure improved visibly.



64
  Artisanal and small scale mining plays an important role in furthering the Government’s poverty
reduction efforts, given its sizable contribution to GDP and the fact that ASM revenues are typically spent
within mining communities and districts, and invested in agricultural development (Hinton, 2009).

                                                    34
In addition to other equipment, new computers were provided to about 90 percent of DGSM’s
professional staff. With a view to sustaining the major scientific and technology gains achieved
under the SMMRP, and to aligning the Department’s organizational structure with its mandate in
a changed environment since its establishment in 1919, an institutional audit was conducted and a
new institutional framework developed and presented to the Ministry of Public Service in
February 2012.65 It is also worth noting that the Project’s Coordination Unit closely coordinated
activities with other agencies and established institutional linkages with the Department of
Occupational Health and Safety, and the Minister of Labor, Gender, and Social Development to
reestablish a partnership in monitoring, enforcing, and ensuring compliance of health and safety
procedures.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

61.     During the ICR mission it was noted that the small grants program and the ASM training
had motivated several associations to start safety-net like Village Savings and Loan Associations
(VSLAs) that generated significant benefits to its members One VSLA group in Busia District,
for example, saved about UGX 2.4 million in four months, from which they now extend small
loans to members. Most VSLA members regarded their groups as safety nets that could avail
small loans in times of need, i.e. to pay for housing construction, school fees, family emergencies,
burial expenses, and festive occasions. Furthermore, miners and community leaders reported
unexpected positive impacts including enhanced family and community savings and a decrease in
drinking as miners became aware of the limited nature of the resources and were equipped with
business and planning skills (Aide Memoire, MTR, January 2008).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.    Upon Project closing a formal beneficiary survey of 200 GP grant beneficiaries, local
government and DGSM staff was undertaken to assess the impact of investments made under the
Small Grants Program (SGP) as well as ASM training and awareness activities on the SGP
beneficiaries and their communities. The survey resulted in the following main findings regarding
its main aims:

         Aim 1: improve the Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM) sector. As a result of
          Project support: (i) individual small scale-miners organized themselves into fifty
          registered associations in order to raise their profitability as well as give them a voice; (ii)
          restrictive practices on women participation in the mineral sector were reduced, both in
          practice and in the new draft mineral policy; and (iii) local governments in mining areas
          began to collect revenue from ASM operations, 66 which is expected to provide an
          incentive for mining to be integrated into district and sub-county development plans.

         Aim 2: Develop small enterprise in ASM communities. The SGP disbursed a total of
          about UGS 200 million or about US$90,000 to 16 miners’ associations and two
          individual mining-related entrepreneurs aiming to establish or extend mining related
          businesses, from brick making to tree planting. Grantees contributed 30 percent of the


65
   The process is presently on hold, given that several other ministries have been identified by the Ministry
of Public Service as in need of a review of their institutional structure.
66
   The Katwe Kabatoro Town Council in Kasese District was levying a tax on all salt producers, regardless
of whether or not they had mining licenses, and Wakiso District was levying a tax on trucks carrying stones
from the quarry.

                                                     35
          sub-project cost in kind. Women constituted about 41 percent of the grant entities’
          membership. Nearly half of the 18 grantees reported having incurred average to
          significant benefits from the program, including increased productivity, incomes and
          creditworthiness. 67 Overall, though, only six out of the 17 sub-projects visited during the
          survey had been completed as planned. Several grantees mentioned that: (i) they were
          unable to complete their sub-project activities due to the delayed release of funds,68 given
          that double digit inflation had rendered the grant amounts insufficient to cover the actual
          sub-project cost; and (ii) funds were in two cases used ineffectively since investments
          were made at inappropriate times.69 Nevertheless, the respondents seemed confident that
          significant levels of benefits would be accrued in the future when their investments
          would have matured.

         Aim 3: cultivate a culture of savings and credit in ASM communities. Several grantee
          entities managed to strengthen their groups into formally registered mining associations
          with a Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) component. Significant benefits
          were reported by several associations, notably a salt mining women’s group in Katwe,
          whose savings enabled them to purchase a tent and 100 chairs, plus the associated
          utensils, which they rent out for UGX 150,000 per day for local functions.

         Aim 4: improve health and wellbeing in ASM communities. The respondents noted that
          the ASM trainings had raised their awareness of the need for proper disposal of human
          waste, restoration of the mining sites, tree growing for fire wood used to operate kilns,
          and rehabilitation of wetlands where sand and clay mining has taken place. The survey
          found little evidence that the knowledge had led to significant behavior changes or that
          the SGP had benefited the wider community. This was partly attributable to the low
          density of sub-projects per sub-county. The respondents reportedly expected the sub-
          projects to mature to yield future returns that would benefit the wider community through
          increased employment opportunities and the development of businesses to service the
          mining sub-projects.

4 Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

63.       The key risks to the sustainability of Project investments include:




67
   Examples include the owner of a welding workshop who, with the help of a grant purchased a welding
machine and a forging machine, which enabled him to increase his production of rock pounding tools; a
medical doctor who built an additional operating theatre in a mining community with grant funding, which
resulted in improved medical care to miners and their families as well as a substantial increase in his
income. In the case of a brickmaking group its incremental profits enabled the group to obtain a credit from
a local MFI to invest in an extruder, which increased the daily brick production from 250 to 1,000. Further
examples of benefits generated by improved yet basic and manageable technology were reported by
associations who built a limestone burning kiln, rehabilitated clay mining sites, installed a new water
supply system and, in one instance, an Ecosan toilet
68
   The first tranche was released in March 2010, two years after the submission of the sub-project
applications, and the second tranche was released one year later in March 2011.
69
   For example, trees were planted during a dry season, reportedly because the grantee entity had to account
for the funds, and an unfinished kiln was destroyed by rain because the second tranche was not disbursed
prior to the onset of the rainy season.

                                                    36
       Insufficient budget releases to DGSM compared to the Petroleum Exploration and
        Production Department and low salaries, make it difficult to retain trained staff. It also
        jeopardizes the availability of funding for recurrent costs related to Project investments,
        such as cost of maintaining the GMIS servers, computers and other equipment procured
        under the Project, the renewal of software licenses, maintenance of the new buildings,
        and availability of basic office supplies.

       Monitoring of compliance with mining and environmental regulations. The current
        lack of funding for fuel and per diems, as reported by several DGSM staff, does not
        permit regional or headquartered Department staff to carry out quarterly social and
        environmental inspections of mines, as mandated. In addition, the future of the SEU is
        still uncertain. The mainstreaming has reportedly been put on hold until a decision has
        been made about the Department’s new institutional structure..

64.     While Project achievements on the operating, institutional, and environmental side are at
risk, other results, such as the data produced by the geophysical airborne survey and the
formalization of the artisanal and small-scale mining operators, which brought about a culture
change in the sub-sector, are likely to have a lasting positive impact on the development of the
sector.


5 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      While the Project’s conceptual approach was, overall, appropriate and in line with
international good practice experience at the time, its presentation in the PAD could have been
better structured, more succinct, and would have benefited from a clearly articulated theory of
change as well as key performance indicators that were directly related to the development
objectives. However, the Project’s Quality at Entry exhibited two major shortcomings: (i) Project
activities were severely under-budgeted as a result of a failure to anticipate increases in the prices
of works, goods and services, given that the minerals boom had already started to occur at the
time of appraisal; and (ii) the two-year implementation delay caused by the delayed engagement
of the other financiers after Project approval by the World Bank’s Board of Directors could have
been prevented if financing agreements had been reached with the AfDB and the NDF during
Project preparation and their funding contributions been formally included in the PAD. This
would have also led to more realistic resourcing of envisaged Project activities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

66. Challenges encountered during the initial phase of Project implementation were caused
partly by the above-mentioned Quality at Entry issues, as well as shortcomings in pre-Midterm
Project supervision, as evidenced by the fact that the supervision team was repeatedly encouraged
by Management to address M&E concerns and formulate a monitorable procurement action plan
(ISR No. 4, June 2005 and ISR N. 5, December 2005). In 2006, implementation progress
improved and progress was made on the collection of some baseline data for key performance

                                                 37
indicators (ISR No. 6, June 2006). The supervision team adopted creative approaches aimed at
speeding up Project implementation progress, such as: (i) enlisting the Project Manager of a
similar (closed) Bank-supported mining sector project in Romania to provide “peer mentoring?
in contract management to PCU staff; (ii) enhancing accountability by instituting a rigorous
budget monitoring and financial forecasting mechanism; and (iii) establishing and maintaining
excellent coordination with the AfDB and NDF supervision teams (Aide Memoire, May 2010).
The latter was evidenced by joint supervision missions and “shuffling? of several Project
activities between the three Development Partners to ensure continuity of Project implementation
after the closing of the IDA Credit and AfDB grant.

67.      However, despite the supervision team’s commendably timely, diligent and thorough
efforts implementation challenges persisted. It is unclear whether less optimistic progress ratings
might have flagged the mixed Project performance more clearly, which might have led to the
adoption of alternative remedial approaches.70 While the tracking of implementation and PDO
progress became more meaningful after the revision of the PDO and results framework in
conjunction with the approval of the Additional Financing, cost overruns were accommodated by
an iterative process of repeated scaling back the scope of lower priority activities rather than a
more pro-active and far-reaching paring down of “non-essential? or Project activities. The
supervision team diligently and persistently flagged the risks to sustainability, notably in regards
to the mainstreaming of the SEU, in Aide Memoires and Implementation Status Reports (ISRs).
However, these important issues were not taken up in higher-level discussions between Bank
Management with the Government, other than as part of the overall public sector performance
dialogue.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     Overall, Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, despite the above-
mentioned shortcomings during design and supervision, given that the Project’s innovative design,
as a departure from common practice at the time, emphasized the need for environmentally,
socially responsible and gender-sensitive sector development. In addition, especially following
the Midterm Review, the supervision team: (i) instituted rigorous discipline, especially in regards
to expenditure tracking and forecasting among PCU staff; (ii) facilitated “hands on? peer support
in order to build especially the PCU’s contract management capacity; (iii) excellent co-ordination
with co-financiers; and (iv) conducted frequent supervision missions to closely monitor and guide
implementation. As a result, a significant portion of the envisaged scope of activities was
accomplished, utilizing international best practice approaches, particularly in the collection of
airborne survey data and the interventions in the artisanal and small-scale mining sub-sector.
Furthermore, the Project managed to generate a significant increase in mining-related fiscal
revenues, as well as remarkable transparency gains in the management of mining licenses, which
was largely attributable to diligent Project supervision, especially in light of the persisting
challenges encountered during implementation.




70
  It was noted that in particular in ISRs No. 9 (December 2007) through No. 12 (May 2009), the Country
Director’s PDO ratings were consistently – and justifiably – lower - and more realistic – than the
supervision team’s ratings.

                                                  38
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.      While the Government continues to consider the mining industry a high priority growth
sector, as evidenced, for example, by the 2010/11-2014/15 National Development Plan, its
expenditure profile, i.e. actual release of funds in support of sector activities, during and beyond
the Project’s lifetime do not mirror the industry’s purported strategic importance, given that, to
date it has:
     Not utilized its own resources to construct/rehabilitate the regional DGSM offices;
     Reportedly not involved stakeholders in the ongoing review of the mining law and
         regulations;
     Required nearly one year to get the Additional Financing ratified by Parliament;
     Not mainstreamed the SEU into the MEMD;71
     Not fully made its agreed-upon counterpart contribution, such as its 10 percent
         counterpart contribution to the payment of civil works and consultancy contracts72.
     Not released sufficient funds to DGSM that would allow it to fulfill its mandated roles,
         such as monitoring the mining industry’s performance and provision of extension
         services to artisanal and small-scale miners;
     Made very little funding available to finance honoraria for PCU staff and expenses
         required to operate, maintain and sustain Project-supported institutional structures, such
         as the SEU and an institutional Project memory, physical infrastructure, such as the
         DGSM headquarters in Entebbe, and electronic management systems, such as the GMIS.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.      Overall, despite its challenges, the Project Coordination Unit managed to produce
significant results, notably the provision of high quality geodata, which are sought after by
potential investors. However, the significant delays in Project implementation and shortcomings
in the achievement of Project objectives are at least partly a reflection of weaknesses in the
PCU’s effectiveness.73 Implementation progress was adversely affected by changes in the PCU’s
leadership, i.e. the retirement of the first Coordinator (as well as the Commissioner), the
unexpected death of the second Coordinator in September 2008, and an adjustment period for the
third Project Coordinator who had no prior experience with World Bank operations. Some of the

   The January/February 2011 supervision mission noted that “despite the earlier commitment? by the
MEMD to have a firm plan for integrating the SEU into the Ministry’s structure by March 2011, the
mission was concerned that the Ministry has not made tangible progress in ensuring sustainability of the
SEU (Aide Memoire, January/February 2011). A draft restructuring plan for DGSM was reportedly in
place in October 2010 (Aide Memoire, October 2010).
72
   Supervision missions repeatedly emphasized the need for timely provision of counterpart funds, give that
some payments to contractors had been delayed due to inadequate availability of the 10 percent counterpart
contribution.
73
   Initial implementation delays may also have been partly attributable to the fact that Project Management
and Coordination was handled by the Commissioner for Mines at DGSM, with support from a Deputy
Project Coordinator, a Procurement Specialist and an Accountant. It was not until June 2006 that the PCU
was led by a full time Project Coordinator who had been assigned from within the MEMD (Aide Memoire,
December 2006).

management challenges were mitigated by the excellent collaboration and great flexibility among
the three Development Partners (World Bank, AfDB and NDF). In addition, the PCU built and
maintained multi-stakeholder interactions, with the notable involvement of the Ministry of Health
and the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development. However, DGSM internal
administrative factors seem to have contributed to the PCU’s challenges, such as intermittent
financial management issues (see paragraph 36), procurement quality concerns (see paragraph 37)
and delays in payments of consultants and suppliers (Aide Memoire, December 2006).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.      Overall, Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Despite the numerous
challenges encountered during implementation, a significant portion of the intended Project
activities was completed and tangible results achieved, as described earlier. It seems that
especially the SEU, during the six years that it was fully staffed and Project-funded,
accomplished a great deal, both in terms of advancing the ASM sub-sector as well as
environmental and social monitoring of larger scale mining operations. During the ICR mission,
several mine operators recalled having received regular inspection visits from the SEU prior to
the Project closing date.

6 Lessons Learned

72.       Key lessons learned from Project implementation include the importance of:
         Realistic estimation of project costs and financing requirements to avoid implementation
          delays.
         Government commitment to budgeting sufficient funds to cover recurrent cost in order to
          sustain Project investments beyond the Project closing date;
         Flexible and close donor coordination and collaboration;
         The importance of supporting gender mainstreaming in the mining sector, especially in
          ASM, which requires gaining the trust of local governments as well as communities. The
          Project accomplished this through extensive, participatory consultations and trainings;
          and
         the merit of “peer support,? such as brining in a former Project Coordinator of a World
          Bank project from Romania; as well as
         the necessity to approach mining sector development from different interrelated angles,
          such as looking to reform, in parallel, the mining sector’s regulatory framework and
          institutional set up; capacity building of the lead agency to improve governance; increase
          transparency through computerization of the mining cadastre; promote the mineral sector
          through high quality data and integrated data management; and to redress adverse
          environmental, social and economic conditions typically associated with informal mining
          by incentivizing the legalization of and giving a “leg up out of poverty? to small scale
          miners.

          As mentioned in the main body of this ICR (Table 7, Indicator 2.2), as a result of the
 Project, the 20 percent share of centrally collected royalties flowing back to mining districts, sub-
 counties and landowners have been published in local newspapers since 2009 to enhance both
 demand and supply side accountability. Below is a an example of such a public notice, which
 appeared in the New Vision newspaper on May 31, 2010:

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

        According to the Beneficiary Survey, “in general terms the SGP was appreciated by all
the respondents because it had provided the entities with money to increase their capital which
they needed to change their operations for the better.? Based on interviews and observations, the
Consultant and his team rated the overall socio-economic change brought about by the Small
Grants Program as shown in Table 1 below:

 Significant           5          28 Dr. Mugisha and E. Obonyo are already realizing an increase in
                                         their business turnover.

                                     For Muhokya Catholic Church, Tekwo CBO and EWAD, there
                                     are real time assets on the ground
                                     These 5 projects account for approximately 28% of the disbursed
                                     SGP funds
Little               2          11   There is no evidence on the ground that the members have
                                     benefited. For example it seems that only the owner of the home
                                     where the water system for Mirembe United is located can be
                                     seen to have benefited. For Rweikiniro Nursery Bed,
                                     observations on the ground do not show much nursery activities
                                     had ever been carried out. Only a few poor quality seedlings were
                                     all that they could show.
Average              3          17   For Musasizi Mixed Farmers, Kyakitale Bakyara Kweyamba,
                                     and St. Peters CoU Katwe, there is evidence of assets created on
                                     the ground.
No change            5          28   For some like ECO and Jua Kali, some work has been done but
                                     there is no tangible benefit yet. For others like Akwat’empola,
                                     Karukwanzi & Ruhama Miners, there is even no evidence on the
                                     ground that the money was ever used for the purpose it was meant
                                     to be used
Worsened             2          11   Muhokya United Miners started to construct a lime kiln but the
                                     money advanced in the first tranche was not enough. The 2 nd
                                     tranche failed to come in time and the partially completed kiln
                                     started to collapse due to the rains. So they borrowed money to re-
                                     construct it and this hiked the cost of construction from the planned
                                     UGX 13.5 million to 21.33 million. This wiped out their operating
                                     capital, and now they cannot use the new kiln, and neither have
                                     they gone back to the old production methods.

                                     Eastern Artisanal Mining Co. planted the trees in a dry season
                                     because they had to account for the money. The trees died and all
                                     their energies plus their own contribution was lost

                                                 53
The following Summary of Findings of the assessment of the Small Grants Program contains
(unedited) excerpts from the Beneficiary Survey.

Overall Socio-economic Benefits. A total of UGX 193,331,400 was given out to the grantees as
SGP contribution (30% of the total cost of the project). The grantees were expected to contribute
UGX 82,856,314 (30% of the total cost of the project) All the 18 selected applicants received the
first tranche of the grant money, but two of them did not receive the second tranche. SGP
management respondents cited misuse of the money by the grantees, while the grantees
mentioned failure of the SGP management to appreciate the difficult operating requirements with
which they (grantee entities) were expected to implement the projects (e.g. travelling to Kampala
or the district capital to try and get quotations for such small purchases81, being required to plant
trees at the beginning of the dry season, being required to construct structures in a short time, etc.).

In general terms the SGP was appreciated by all the respondents because it had provided the
entities with money to increase their capital which they needed in order to change their operations
for the better. The consultant’s team weighed various responses and field observations and
arrived at the following levels of change in the benefits by the grantee entities:

Level of Change          in   No. of Grantees    % of total No. of Grantees
Benefits
Significant benefits          5                  28
Average benefits              3                  17
Little benefits               2                  11
No change                     5                  28
Situation worsened            2                  11
Not assessed                  1                  5
Total                         18                 100

In general terms the respondents spoke of benefits they have got but most these benefits are in
terms of assets developed. Only Dr. Mugisha’s clinic and Mr. Obonyo’s workshop have realised
an increase in income after increasing their capacities through additional equipment. The salt
mining projects are just starting to yield income, but all the other projects have not started to yield
any income yet. Nevertheless, the respondents see significant levels of benefits in future.

Training Offered under CDSSM Component. As part of the survey of the effects of ASM
training and awareness on the behaviour at various levels of the community, all respondents said
that it was some of their leaders who had attended some of the trainings. On their part, the leaders
said that although they had been trained with the intention of them going back to their
communities and passing on the knowledge, this was not possible because of lack of resources to
facilitate the trainings. Because the SGP has operated for a short time in real terms (first tranche
of grant money released in March 2010 and the second one starting in March 2011), no impacts
of training have yet been seen. Most of the awareness and training impacts will occur in the future,
provided the trainees are followed up proactively. For now, some changes are beginning to show.
The respondents expressed consciousness about the need for proper disposal of human waste,
restoration of the mining sites, tree growing, and rehabilitation of wetlands where sand and clay
mining has taken place, but they admitted they were not doing these things.


81
  In many local trading centres, shop keepers did not have pro forma invoices, but they sometimes had
only cash sale receipts.

                                                   54
Strengthening the culture of savings. For those grantees who reported that they had Village
Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) (i.e. Kyakitale Bakyara Kweyamba, Muhokya United
Miners Association, Musasizi Mixed Farmers, and Tekwo Community Based Organisation, the
VSLAs have resulted in real time benefits. Significant benefits were reported only by Kyakitale
Bakyara Tweyambe and Tekwo supported Jaribu VSLA. Kyakitale Bakyara Tweyambe has
strengthened their group into a formally registered association and increased their stock of
savings to the extent that they have now invested into a tent and 100 chairs, plus the associated
utensils for hire. Jaribu started with the SGP but it has pooled savings to the tune of more than
UGX 2.4 million, from which they can now extend small loans to members. Although the group
did not get any money from the SGP, some of their members took part in the trainings. Some of
the other grantees said that they also operate some forms of VSLAs but the consultant did not see
any evidence of how active the VSLAs were.

Most of the members who belonged to the grantee entities saw the VSLAs as safety nets where
they could go to for help in times of need (e.g. school fees, burial expenses, and even festive
seasons). However there is increasing awareness about the VSLAs being pools of investment
finance for members.

Improvement of Technologies. Better technology as a benefit was cited in Mr. Obonyo’s
workshop & Dr. Mugisha’s clinic (equipment), Musasizi Mixed Farmers (brick-making machine),
Muhokya Miners (limestone burning kiln), Ecological Christian Organisation (rehabilitation of
clay mining sites), Mirembe United Farmers (water supply system), and Alur Village (Ecosan
toilet) supported through Entebbe Women’s Association in Development (EWAD). The
technologies are appropriate, but they are basic and manageable by the beneficiaries.

The other grantees (about 50% of the total number of grantees) continue to struggle, business as
usual. The grant is reported to have been used to buy the usual hand tools (hammers, crowbars,
etc). Some of these groups do not even have anything to show for the money they received, let
alone their own contribution which was mandatory.

Benefits for women. The benefits described above have some advantages for the women
members:
(i) The Ecosan toilet in Alur Village provides for a separate stance for women, making it
      possible for them to maintain their privacy, something that was not possible earlier.
(ii) When their kiln starts to operate, women members of Muhokya Miners will be operating at
      the same level as men. Members said that in the past, mining was regarded as a man’s job and
      women could only provide associated services like food, drinks, etc, but now, mining had
      been de-mystified for women.
(iii) At Jaribu Group in Buteba Subcounty, Busia District, Tekwo CBO was using SGP money to
      train their members. 62% of its 34 members are women
(iv) Men are quite happy with their wives because they (wives) could finally contribute towards
      domestic expenses
(v) Dr. Mugisha’s clinic has reduced the burden (financial & physical pain) of travelling to far
      away Itojo hospital to deliver babies

Benefits to local governments. All indications were that local governments (LGs) benefited very
little, if any, from the SGP. The district and subcounty LGs do not seem to have even known
about the SGP officially, beyond what a few of their staff were told during training workshops
(Box 1).

Box 1: The Words of LC1 Chairman, Kyakitale, Katwe Kabatoro Town Council
SGP officials came and raised awareness. The women normally gather at their usual place below
that tree for meetings but I am not sure whether the meetings are about the SGP.

While they knew the potential of ASM for boosting LG revenues they also noted that the powers
to license miners lie with the DGSM in Kampala. DGSM respondents said that ordinarily they do
not license stone quarrying and clay mining for brick making. These are left to the LGs to deal
with. However, the respondents also pointed out that the law needed to be adjusted in order to
clarify this position.

Community livelihoods. The consultant did not see any evidence that the SGP had benefited the
wider community. In any case, it is too early for the projects to show returns at levels that would
make the wider community benefits possible. The respondents pointed to the future when the
projects would have matured to provide opportunities for increased employment and development
of businesses to service the mining projects.

Mr. Obonyo uses his workshop to train local youths in metal working under an apprentice
arrangement. To a small extent, Muhokya Catholic church employs casual labour to protect their
little woodlot. Occasionally Musasizi Mixed Farmers employs casual labour to dig up clay for
brick-making. Similarly, the salt mining groups employ some local men to work the salt pans. But
all these have been going on even before the SGP came in.

Health, safety at work, and environment management. Save for protective wear at Mr.
Obonyo’s workshop and Musasizi Mixed Farmers, the only evidence of addressing safety at work
was seen at Musasizi Mixed Farmers (plastic boots and overalls), and Mr. Obon yo’s Workshop
(overalls and boots). Neither was anything seen in terms of health and environment management.
It seems that after the training in these disciplines was done, there were no efforts made to follow
up the trainees to help them act on what they had learned. However, it was good to see that the
respondents know what they should do, even if they are not doing it yet. In fact, seven of the
grantees said that they had hoped to build toilets, put up systems for drinking water, and/or
restore mining pits, but they had had to put the little money they had received into the production
areas of their enterprises.

Intended and possibly unintended effects of the SGP. There are a number of unintended
effects of the SGP. On the positive side, ECO said that the SGP had opened their eyes to wider
ways (environment, health, safety at work, etc) of supporting small scale miners.

Delays in the disbursement of grant funds (two years after applications were submitted to receive
the first tranche & a year after accountabilities had been submitted to receive the second tranche),
at a time when inflation was galloping at double digit rates, resulted in uncompleted projects.
Since no one explained the long delays to them, the grantees have developed a quiet distrust
among the grantees about the intentions of the SGP management.

Muhokya Miners’ operating capital was wiped out as they fought to save their kiln from
destruction by rains. If the money had come on time, they would have completed it before the
rains came. ECO said that they are going to have to look for money from elsewhere to complete
the fish ponds.

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES PROJECT (SMMRP) / MINERAL
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT (MRMCBP).

1.1 Project Context at Appraisal

The project was put in place as part implementation of the Mineral Policy that was approved by Government
of the Republic of Uganda in 2001. The project was to conform to the Mineral Policy that constituted a
formal framework upon which the mineral sector would develop within the national strategy for poverty
eradication and development. The project was to address the constraints in the mineral sector and
subsequently promote private sector participation that would contribute to increase mineral production thus
leading to sustainable national social and economic transformation of the rural population through provision
of gainful employment and diversification of alternative source of income.

The constraints to be addressed included the following:
    1) Inadequate geological information;
    2) Non-competitive legal and regulatory framework; and
    3) Low human capacity and poor infrastructure.

In order to address these constraints, the Government of Republic of Uganda sought for financial assistance
from World Bank, African Development Bank and the Nordic Development Fund. Sustainable Management
of Mineral Resources Project was later put in place was implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Development (MEMD) through the Department of Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM). The target of
project after implementation was to:
     1) Enable good environment by enhancing transparency in management of the mineral resources that
          would stimulate investment in the mineral sector;
     2) Increase of revenues that would be better spent to improve service delivery that would lead to the
          rural development and national growth;
     3) Regularizing and improvement of small-scale mining that would enable increased income-
          generating opportunities in regions where mining was one of the few viable economic options
     4) Putting in place mechanisms for an equitable share of benefits from mining activities to
          communities near the mining areas or within such regions; and
     5) Putting in place mechanisms that would minimize and mitigate the adverse Social and
          Environmental impacts of mineral exploration.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO)

The overall objective of the proposed Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP) was
to assist the government of Uganda (GoU) in implementing its strategy to (i) accelerate sustainable
development and reduce poverty by strengthening governance, transparency and capacity in the
management of mineral resources, with particular emphasis on community development in mining areas
and improvement of small-scale and artisanal mining; and (ii) improve a socially and environmentally sound
development of the minerals sector based on private investments.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority)

During the January 2008 project mid-term review the Government and other project stakeholders strongly
endorsed the original project objective as fully valid and relevant. At the same time, at the initiative of the
World Bank team, the stakeholders accepted the need to tighten the focus of the project objective, review


                                                     58
and expand its indicators to better capture project benefits, and increase the focus on project results. The
rephrased PDO (based on the original PDO) became as follows:
“Strengthening Government’s capacity to develop a sound minerals sector based on private investments
and improvements in selected artisanal and small scale mining areas?.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

As already stated above, the project was to enable increased income generating opportunities in regions
where mining was one of the few viable economic options. The people would also benefit because the
project was to introduce approaches for an equitable share of benefits from mining activities near the mining
areas or within such regions.

1.5 Original Components (approved)

The approved Project components were not revised up to the project closure included the following:
    1) Strengthening of Governance in Mineral Sector Management;
    2) Community Development and Mineral Resources;
    3) Establishment of Social/Environmental Systems;
    4) Geo-information and Development; and
    5) Project Management and Coordination.

The project obtained additional financing to cover the cost overrun that resulted due to the commodity boom
that caused services in the mining sector to increase. The Bank analysed the then investment climate in the
sector and found it justifiable and hence had to provide additional funds to the project.

On additional funding, the project did not include any new activities but the results framework was revised to
better capture project results. New indicators on transparency, efficiency delivery, and livelihoods impacts
on artisanal and small scale mining were added to the existing indicators on mineral investment and
revenue.

Risks were evaluated at the project mid-term review, and the overall project risk assessment of modest
remained the same as in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). During the assessment of risks at the mid-
term review, the risk of Government’s continued commitment to reform was reduced from substantial to
modest, since audits were carried out on time and quality of reporting was adequate.

During the mid-term review, two additional risks, i.e., i) increases in world prices for services related to the
mining sector and ii) adequacy of counterpart funding were identified and were assessed as substantial.

2.2 Procurement Performance

In the initial years of the project, there were notable procurement delays, which in turn affected the pace of
implementation of project activities and works.

The main source of the delays in the project implementation for SMMRP/MRMCBP was the lengthy
bureaucratic steps that required procurement to be subjected to Government, and then, Bank procedures,
some of which were not under the direct control of the PCU. This resulted in extensive time taken to review
and approve procurement documents both at country and financing agency levels. However as a result of
frequent interactions with Contracts Committee, Solicitor General’s office and financing agencies to reduce
or eliminate delays, a lot of improvements were made to hasten the review the procurement processes.
Delayed reviews in NDF funded procurement packages also improved after waiving some conditions, where
initially most procurements were to be from the Nordic countries.
The Project had a Procurement Specialist by the names of Mr. John Kokas Omiat who later prematurely
terminated his contract voluntarily due to management refusal to arbitrary increase his consultancy fees. His
assistant in the names of Ms. Eva Nakiguli was discussed during the mid-term review (9-22 January, 2008)
and was found to have relevant training and experience in World Bank and other donor funded procurement
guidelines and was subsequently assigned to handle project procurement activities. A Procurement Clerk
who is a graduate in Procurement and Logistics was recruited to assist her. Ms. Eva Nakiguli also
subsequently left the project on 04th March, 2011.

2.3 Staffing Level in Account unit

The Project had a Project Accountant in the names of Mr. Henry Ndinaiwe. However, on assessing his
performance at the end of his contract, management decided not to renew his contract. The recruitment of a
new Project Accountant was discussed during the mid-term review in January 2008. The assignments of the
Project Accountant were later handled by the Assistant Project Accountant in the names of Mr. David
Ssonko after proving that he had extensive training and experience in World Bank and other donor’s
financial management and disbursement procedures.

       2.4 Project Coordination and Management

       Although initially, project implementation was relatively slow, essentially due to non-familiarity of dealing with
       a mixture of Bank’s procurement policies and procedures from different funding agencies, PCU later gained
       substantial experience through training in handling the different procedures of different funding agencies.
       This also later resulted in a lot of improvements in the quality of procurement documents (specifications,
       Terms of reference and evaluation criteria) prepared by PCU, which were initially poorly done.

       Initially, Mr. Joshua T. Tuhumwire was appointed as Project Coordinator and also doubled as a
       Commissioner, DGSM. He was assisted by Mr. Julius Nyakaana as Deputy Project Coordinator (DPC).
       However, on 07th June 2006, Mr. Julius Nyakaana was appointed a full time Project Coordinator and
       deputized by Mr. Edwards Katto as the Project Technical Officer. Since the recruitment of a full-time Project
       Coordinator deputized by the Project Technical Officer, a lot of progress was made but was later interrupted
       when Mr. Julius Nyakaana died on 03rd September, 2008. From September 2008, Mr. Edwards Katto was
       appointed as a full-time Project Coordinator and assisted by two Technical Officers, i.e., Ms. Grace L.
       Nassuna in charge of project administration and Mr. Gabriel Data in charge of technical issues. The trio
       have steered the project activities to-date.


       2.5 Supervision, Monitoring and review of missions undertaken on the project

       Overall, the quality of Banks’ supervision, monitoring and reviews on SMMRP were generally satisfactory in
       providing guidance to the project.

       3. Assessment of outcomes

       These are based on the Project’s Results Framework targeting – “Strengthening the government’s capacity
       to develop a sound minerals sector based on private investments and improvements in selected artisanal
       and small scale mining areas?

                                          Geophysical Data Management System (NGDMS) to
                                          process the Airborne Geophysical Data that is hosted by
                                          the Data Access Portal (DAP) server. The processed
                                          data has attracted more investors in mineral exploration.

                                          System (ESMIS) has been linked to GMIS and this will
                                          enhance collaboration with other stakeholders such as
                                          NEMA in handling social and environmental related
                                          issues through networking.
14. Reduced time to   14 days            A fully operational Modern Documentation Centre has 1 day
provide geological                        been put in place at DGSM. All the geological
data                                      information data has been digitally captured and installed
                                          on computers and is now available to investors at a
                                          reduced time of one (1) day compared to the previous 14
                                          days.




      4. CHALLENGES:

           1. Lack of Project Preparation Fund (PPF) to hire a consultant resulted into DGSM’s local personnel
              to delay the accomplishment of project planning and design phase that lasted from 1999 to 2002.
              Also due to lack of capacity, the local Project Management took long to prepare the Project
              Appraisal Document (PAD), Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and Project Procurement Plan all
              that were accomplished in 2003.

           2. The fact that the project financiers did not come on board at the same time, for example, IDA that
              signed the loan Agreement in January 2004 but started disbursing funds in September 2004; AfBD
              Protocol of Agreement that was signed in January 2005 but started disbursing funds in December
              2005; and NDF that signed the Loan Agreement in January 2006 but started disbursing funds in
              August 2009 because it had to take time to re-structure her organization resulted into a number of
              events beyond the control of the project management to occur such as inflation, a reason for
              increase in contract prices compared to the estimated price at the time of the project design
              resulting into the cost overruns (see table below) a situation that took too long before Parliament
              could approve additional funding. Similarly, during this period the mineral sector experienced a
              mineral boom that resulted into great demand for services hence hiking in fees by consultants. This
              resulted into one firm called African Development Management (ADM) that had already signed a
              contract for the Enhancement of the Legal and Regulatory Mineral Framework Study to pull out.

   3. Most project services were procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using
      financiers’ procurement guidelines and in some cases these needed time to be harmonized with
      National Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets (PPDA) guidelines leading to delay of
      implementation of some activities.

   4. Clearance and getting no-objections by different stakeholders, e.g., Ministry of Energy and Mineral
      Development (MEMD) Contracts Committee, the Solicitor General and the financiers could take
      quite long thus causing delay of implementation of activities contrary to the previous plans. A case
      in point is when there was a delay in clearing the designs for DGSM’s civil works. By the time the
      plans were cleared, the construction package had escalated due to increase in price of fuel,
      building materials such as cement and steel. Consequently, there was a shortfall for the civil works
      at the DGSM Headquarters leading to use part of contingency funds and dropping construction of
      seven regional geological offices, two regional geological training centres and a pilot training centre
      for ASMs.

   5. NDF had a requirement that all packages to be funded were to be of Nordic origin This rendered
      most packages under NDF funding without competition and as a result the responses were very
      poor necessitating repeat of some procurements. It was only In September 2007 that NDF finally
      agreed and revised the Nordic content for some packages and waived it completely. This move
      however delayed some activities such as Mining Cadastre and Registry System that were
      supposed to be accomplished in the initial period of the project.


   6. Under the project, a lot of training of DGSM staff was carried out especially in universities overseas.
      On return, the staff had acquired advanced knowledge in various disciplines, and bearing in mind
      that there are very few geoscientists world over; the institution faced a high turn-over due to
      employment market forces in the private sector that offers much higher remuneration.
      Paradoxically, the staff after gaining experience and high qualifications so as to fulfil the mandate
      of DGSM, the staff is attracted to greener pastures!! There is need to give thanks to the patriotic
      staff that acquired extra advanced knowledge but decided to remain behind to steer activities of the
      institution.



                                                       67
     7. The Procurement Specialist left the project for greener pastures in December 2007 and it took time
        to train his assistant to cope up with the procurement issues. Surprisingly, this officer after training
        also left for greener pastures and the project remained almost orphaned as far as procurement
        issues were concerned. To compound all these operational problems, the project lost the Project
        Coordinator, the late gallant and selfless Julius Nyakaana Amooti (RIP) in September, 2008 (May
        his soul rest in Eternal Peace). This later created a wide gap of project management as the
        caretakers from the civil service structure had to learn on the job. Worse still there was inadequate
        remuneration commensurate with the additional responsibilities of PCU staff who are also
        Government officials.

     8. Government counterpart funding that is normally required to pay for the 10% to the service
        providers, additional taxes and operating cost is insufficient and does not come in time and this has
        affected the financial operation of the project.

5.       WAY FORWARD

There is need to put in place a successor project that will handle the following:

     1) Airborne Geophysical surveys, Geological Mapping, Geochemical Surveys and Mineral Resources
        Assessment of the highly mineralized Karamoja region. Possible funding should be sought from
        World Bank, African Development Bank, Nordic Development Fund and the European Union.

     2) Review of the current Minerals Policy, Legislative and Regulatory Regime for the mining sector in
        line with the current International best practices that will be very attractive to potential investors.

     3) Marine investigations have not been carried out in Uganda. Bearing in mind that many rivers that
        flow into these water bodies traverse vast geological formations and dissolve minerals attached to
        them, therefore, there is need to investigate mineral resource potential under the Ugandan lakes.

     4) Construction and equipping of the seven (7) regional offices, seven (7) seismological stations that
        were dropped due to lack of funds. Also mechanisms should be put in place to get funding for the
        maintenance of the equipment(s) that have been procured and installed at DGSM including those
        in the laboratories.

     5) The is need to continue building capacity of the DGSM staff in order to improve their knowledge in
        Mineral Exploration, Exploration Geophysics, Seismology, Mineral Dressing (Processing), Mining
        Engineering, Environmental Management, Mineral Economics, Analytical Chemistry, Laboratory
        Management, Information Technology (IT) and Records Management and Financial Management.

     6) Only five (5) districts benefited from the Small Grants Programme (SGP) and there is need to roll
        out funds to the entire mining districts in the country since the earlier funds used in the pilot phase
        demonstrated a lot of improvement in the livelihood of the ASMs communities
