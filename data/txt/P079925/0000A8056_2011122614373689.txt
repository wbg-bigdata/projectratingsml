                         The Project has achieved solid results in its objectives. The major outcomes are:

                         • increase in licenses fees and royalties of 170% from UGX 1.16 billion (US$ 0.63m) in 2004 to UGX 3.14 billion (US$1.44m) in 2010, and almost 600% in FY11 with receipts of UGX
                         8.03 billion (US$3.8 million) from January to September 2011. This was boosted by a UGX 3.8 billion collection of arrears as a result of improved mineral audits. Even adjusting for

                         this amount revenues for 2011 to date are up over 260% from baseline. A 50% increment in non-tax rates per annum is expected by DGSM after its endorsement by Minister of
                         Mineral Sector and approval by the Solicitor General this fall.
                         • cumulative mineral exploration and development expenditure of US$346m since 2005 against a target of US$30m;
                         • 607 exploration licenses issued from 2005 to end September 2011, up from 190 at start of project;
                         • 726 licenses issued to artisanal and small scale miners (ASM), up from 100 at start of project and above the target of 300;
                         • successful completion of the Small Grants Program in 10 pilot sub-counties in 5 districts of Ntungamo, Kasese, Busia, Wakiso and Mukono, improving livelihoods and reducing
                         environmental impacts;
                         • geological mapping and geochemical survey results complete for southern Uganda identifying 12 prospective areas (7 metallic and 5 industrial) that are suitable for exploration by
                         investors;
                         • the geological survey data has attracted interest of investors. Over 35 investors, including some of the largest mining companies in the world, have purchased data from DGSM for
                         over UGX 132 million;
                         • New Investments. While it is not usually expected for new mines to start during the period of a first technical assistance project of this nature due to the long lead time for
                         exploration, Uganda is seeing encouraging signs of investment in small to medium mines and in exploration. This is a clear sign that the private sector is responding positively to the
                         improved soundness of mining sector management and information developed under the project. Two new mining projects have commenced since the start of the SMMRP. AUC
                         Mining in Kamalenge is processing alluvial gold and exploring the surrounding area for the hard rock source of the gold ore. Gulf Resources in Namekara invested in the vermiculite
                         mine and commenced pilot operations of 30,000 tons per year (tpy). Namekara is one of the top two quality vermiculite deposits in the world. The operation currently employs 150
                         employees, 85% of them local, and has plans to expand to 150,000 tpy.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In addition to the World Bank, the Project is financed by two other Development Partners, in particular, the AfDB and NDF. The AfDB financed project came to an end on November
                         30, 2011. The NDF financed activities, including implementation of the Cadastre and Registry System, promotion of mineral resources, the laboratory set-up in new DGSM
                         premises are still on-going until end of September 2012. The SMMRP funded by the World Bank is coming to its closure on December 31, 2011. All World Bank operations are
                         required to submit Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) to the Board of Directors. ICRs provide a complete and systematic account of the performance and results
                         of each operation. The Bank’s ICR will include a summary of the client's ICR, prepared separately by the Borrower. The Co-financiers will also be invited to comment. The SMMRP
                         ICR will be publicly disclosed after its approval by the Board, following its submission no later than six months after project closure, i.e. by June 29, 2011.
