                   PARAGUAY THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT

                                HIGHLIGHTS




          At the time of identification,October 1975, the Government of
Paraguay (GOP) was implementing its 1969-80 Education Development Plan with
basic objectives to increase primary and secondary educational opportunities
and to adapt them to the needs of an expanding economy (para. 2.02).  Project
preparation was satisfactorily carried out, with funds from a previous
project, by GOP with UNESCO assistance in November 1975 (para. 2.03).  The
project was appraised in March 1975, four months after preparation.

          Project scope included inter alia:

     (a) construction, furnishing and equipping 83 rural community learning
          centers, 83 teachers houses, 77 rural primary schools, 5 lower
          secondary schools and additions to 2 secondary schools;

     (b) in-service techer training;

     (c) production and distribution of textbooks and teaching aids; and

     (d) technical assistance and fellpwships.

          The project was satisfactorily implemented with an overrun of only
5.2 percent of the original USS17.4 million estimated cost. The project was
completed within the estimated time with savings of about US$1.0 million. To
utilize these savings the Bank and the Borrower agreed to construct 11
primary schools in the Asuncion area and to extend the original closing date
about one year (para. 3.03).

          Success of project implementation may be attributed primarily to
the fact that a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staffed with a stable cadre
of full-time qualified professionals, who had been given ample autonomy by
the Minister of Education, had been carrying out its duties since
implementation of the First Education Project in 1973 and was thoroughly
familiar with Bank guidelines and procedures (paras. 3.05, 3.06).

          Through standardization of school design, construction cost was
between 2-12 percent less than appraisal estimates. These designs continue
to be used as a model for schools being constructed (para. 4.09) for the
Fourth Education Project (Loan 1992-PA) with minor variations due to cost
and/or availability of local materials (para. 7.16). Due to the widely
dispersed construction sites and relatively small contract size international

companies (para. 4.14) did not bid.                        Generally, contractors performance was
s a t i s f a c t o r y , however, it was found t h a t excessive distances between echoole,
bad weather, and severe flooding caused j u s t i f i a b l e time overruns i n almost
a l l c o n t r a c t s (para. 4.17).           Supervision of construction by t h e PIU needed
strengthen:ng.                 The completion miesion f e l t t h a t both q u a l i t y and quantity of
supervision i n the f i e l d wae i n e u f f i c i e n t (para. 4.20).                For t h e Fourth
Education P r o j e c t , full-time Resident Inspectors a r e being assigned t o
construction s i t e s .

                   Furniture and equipment f o r echools was tendered i n t e r n a t i o n a l l y .
Delivery of f u r n i t u r e and equipment by successful companies was made t o a
c e n t r a l warehouse i n Asuncion and subsequently dietributed t o the echoola by
personnel of the PIU (paras. 4.27, 4.38).                            The mission f e l t t h a t although
such an operation was f i n a n c i a l l y b e n e f i c i a l t o the project it aleo placed
the PIU i n a compromising position (being involved with assembly of
f u r n i t u r e ) e s p e c i a l l y i n the case of t h e i r judging q u a l i t y of workmanship
(para. 4.27),              and that f o r f u t u r e p r o j e c t s t h i s practice should be
discontinued.

                   Although assurances were obtained during negotiations t h a t funds
would be allocated f o r adequate maintenance and r e p a i r of buildings,
equipment and f u r n i t u r e provided under the project, there was no i n d i c a t i o n
t h a t such funds had been made available (paras. 4.42, 4.43).

                  With the exception of enrollment levele established during
Appraisal most educational components of the project a t t a i n e d t h e i r a p p r a i s a l
t a r g e t s .    Enrollment t a r g e t s a r e expected t o be met within 2-3 years (para.
5.02).

                   It was found that project rural primary schools improved over other
schools i n the country a s a r e s u l t of:

          ( a )    parent and community i n t e r e s t and p a r t i c i p a t i o n ;

          ( b )    demarcation of the echoole nucleus; and

          ( c )    teacher upgrading and t h e i r attempt t o improve the schools'
                   e f f i c i e n c y (para. 5.07).

                   Non-formal          adult education and t r a i n i n g programs a r e not yet being
implemented s a t i s f a c t o r i l y (para. 5.09).                The mission f e l t , i f properly
monitored, improvement would be made through the non-formal education
component of Loan 1992-PA (para. 5.10).

                   Teacher t r a i n i n g under the project was e a t i e f a c t o r y .      Sixty-eight
percent of the project primary school techers a r e q u a l i f i e d by government
standards (para. 5.12).                    The remainder have attended upgrading courses.                Loan
1992-PA provides continuity by financing teacher t r a i n i n g and i t is f e l t t h a t
improvement can be brought about in. f u t u r e coureee by (para. 5.14):

          ( a )    reducing the number of participant8 i n each couree;

          ( b )    lengthening the course duration;

         ( c )   maintaining in-service t r a i n i n g on a continuing basis; and


         ( d )   surveying the i n t e r e s t s and needs of teachers p r i o r to designing
                 t h e course content.


                 Although educational software components were produced a s estimated
at appraisal, textbook distribution to schools o r students was unsatisfactory
(para. 5.17).            Ninety percent of textbooks remained unsold due primarily t o
t h e f a c t t h a t r u r a l parents lack money t o buy books.               This s i t u a t i o n was
resolved i n March 1982, when the Minister of Education decided t o d i s t r i b u t e
textbooks f r e e of charge t o a l l r u r a l students.

                 Total enrollment f o r t h e p r o j e c t secondary schools represents only
42 percent of t h e f u l l school c a p a c i t y (para. 5.19) perhaps due t o a delay of
about one year i n opening these schools (para. 5.20).                            The Ministry of
Education should make an e f f o r t t o determine (para. 5.22):


         ( a )   how many primary students i n t h e secondary catchment a r e a s
                 graduate;


         ( b )   where graduates go a f t e r completion of primary schools;


         ( c )   i f consolidation of c e r t a i n secondary schools would prove f e a s i b l e ;
                 and


         (d)     i f c l o s e r educational supervision i s needed t o monitor enrollment
                 and q u a l i t y of education i n secondary schools.

                 The Ministry of Education, based on experiences gained with the
F i r s t Education P r o j e c t , again reached an agreement with t h e Organization of
American S t a t e s (OAS) t o provide technical a s s i s t a n c e t o t h e P r o j e c t (para.
5.24).         The s p e c i a l i s t services provided under t h e proejct were adequate t o
meet the needs i d e n t i f i e d during a p p r a i s a l (para. 5.25).            The OAS a l s o
provided fellowships t o t h e project thereby reducing t h e number of t r a i n e e s
t o be financed from the project from 52 t o 28 (para. 5.29).

                 A s a r e s u l t of the lessons learned from t h i s p r o j e c t , f u t u r e
p r o j e c t s should pay p a r t i c u l a r a t t e n t i o n t o t h e following points:

         ( a )   Sucess of a project depends much upon t h e s t a b i l i t y of an e f f e c t i v e
                 P r o j e c t Implementation Unit t h a t i s throughly f a m i l i a r with Bank
                 guidelines and procedures.

         ( b )   Standardization of schools designs may e f f e c t i v e l y reduce bidding
                 and construction time a s well a s o v e r a l l c o s t .

         ( c )   Where schools a r e widely dispersed, the number of schools awarded
                 t o a s i n g l e contractor should be reduced t o a l e v e l which would
                 permit the contractor t o e f f e c t i v e l y c a r r y out t h e work.

         ( d )   The r o l e of the PIU i n construction, equipping, e t c . , of schools
                 should be limited t o inspection of q u a l i t y of m a t e r i a l s and
                 workmanship, not to assembly of goods.

( e ) Once assurances have been obtained t h a t adequate funds w i l l be made

1.01               A Bank Completion Mission composed of a general educator and a n
a r c h i t e c t , v i s i t e d Paraguay f o r about two weeks (March-April 1982) t o conduct
a f i n a l review of t h e Third Education Project financed by t h e Bank Group
(Loan 1346-PA and C r e d i t 667-PA).                      Before t h e mission's a r r i v a l , the Borrower
prepared a completion r e p o r t s i m i l a r t o those submitted f o r two previous
p r o j e c t s already completed (Credit 347-PA and Loan 1252-T-PA).                               The Borrower
Completion Report (BCR) 1/ was generally s a t i s f a c t o r y , describing t h e
physical and educational-implementation                           a s p e c t s of the project     . However, the
mission f e l t it was advisable t o expand the a n a l y s i s of t h e p r o j e c t ' s execu-
t i o n .    Therefore, the mission, a f t e r consulting with the Borrower, decided to
improve the BCR by f i l l i n g the gaps a s needed so t h a t the f i n a l Completion
Report would r e f l e c t both t h e Bank's and Borrower's viewpoints i n a s i n g l e

1.02               The mission working c l o s e l y with t h e Project Unit:

        ( a )      reviewed Bank f i l e s (correspondence, progress r e p o r t s , supervision
                   and a p p r a i s a l r e p o r t s , and other relevant l o a n / c r e d i t documents);

                   San Pedro and Central (about 60% of t h e geographic a r e a covered by
                   t h e p r o j e c t ) ;

        ( c )      interviewed Ministry of Education o f f i c e r s , school supervisors,
                   d i r e c t o r s , teachers and members of t h e communities v i s i t e d ; and

        (d)        analyzed the r e s u l t s of questionnaires completed by supervisors,
                   d i r e c t o r s and teachers of project schools.                     A list of places
                   v i s i t e d by the mission and key persons interviewed is included a s
                   Annex 1.

1.03               The main purpose of the Third Education P r o j e c t was t o a s s i s t the
government i n implementing its educational p o l i c i e s and programs s e t out i n
the 1969-80 Education Development Plan.                             In p a r t i c u l a r , it supported the
government's e f f o r t s t o improve and expand opportunities f o r primary and
lower secondary education i n r u r a l areas and semirural towns, thereby a s s i s t -
ing its investment e f f o r t s i n the r u r a l s e c t o r .                 It also intended          t o
improve the q u a l i t y and e f f i c i e n c y of t h e primary education system by
increasing the production of textbooks and teaching m a t e r i a l s , upgrading
teachers and supervisors, and strengthening educational administration.

                                                   11. PROJECT GENERATION



2.01               The p r o j e c t ' s formulation took only 14 months, which is a r e l a -
t i v e l y short time compared t o the norm of about 18 t o 24 months elapsed from
i d e n t i f i c a t i o n t o Board presentation, (see Basic Data sheets).                 The s h o r t
project cycle can be a t t r i b u t e d t o t h e following f a c t o r s :

       ( a )       t h e government gave high p r i o r i t y t o the expansion and improvement
                   of r u r a l basic education;

        (b)        a Bank education s e c t o r memorandum was a v a i l a b l e before project

secondary l e v e l s and to improve the q u a l i t y of educational programs and t o
adapt them t o t h e needs of t h e expanding economy.                            A reform program was t o be
implemented a t the basic education l e v e l , consisting of the development of a
new curriculum, production of new textbooks, upgrading teachers, and t h e
construction of schools primarily i n r u r a l areas.                            I n furtherance of t h i s
e f f o r t , the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n mission supported the government's education

c o n s i s t i n g of well-equipped              community learning c e n t e r s surrounded by
associated schools t h a t would apply reform c u r r i c u l a , have upgraded teachers,
and new and more relevant teaching m a t e r i a l s .                       I n a d d i t i o n , some secondary
schools i n semiurban towns were considered a s possible project items i n order

about t h r e e months a f t e r they were slgned (Annex 2).                               The 1977 n a t i o n a l
budget had been approved p r i o r t o l o a d c r e d i t e f f e c t i v e n e s s , t h e r e f o r e no
counterpart funds were made a v a i l a b l e i n t h e 1977 budget f o r t h i s p r o j e c t .
Since funding was not included i n t h e r e g u l a r annual budget, extraordinary
budgets should have been made a v a i l a b l e by t h e Ministry of Finance t o i n s u r e
timely implementation during t h e f i r s t year.                         This has been done f o r the
Fourth Education P r o j e c t .

3.02               I n s p i t e of a shortage of counterpart funds progress was made on
t h e project during 1977; about 85% of t h e r u r a l primary school s i t e s were
acquired and t h e PIU prepared tendering documents f o r these schools as w e l l
as prequalifying contractors.                        Also, lists of f u r n i t u r e and equipment were
f i n a l i z e d , manuscripts and teaching guides f o r grade 4 and 5 textbooks were
completed and t e n associated schools i n I t a p u a were finished.

3.03               I n 1978, when adequate counterpart funds became a v a i l a b l e , imple-
mentation of t h e p r o j e c t proceeded with only s l i g h t variances from t h e
proposed schedule.21                 Although f i n a l completion of c o n s t r u c t i o n was delayed
f o r about one year,             t h e o v e r a l l p r o j e c t was s u b s t a n t i a l l y completed by t h e
o r i g i n a l closing d a t e (June 30, 1981) (Annex 3 ) .

3.04               Early i n 1980, t o u t i l i z e about US$900,000 savings from various
p r o j e c t components, e s p e c i a l l y from t h e d e l e t i o n of 11 r u r a l primary schools
which no longer war-ranted t h e use of Bank/IDA funds, t h e Bank and the

       f i n a l l y being negotiated i n May 1978.

P r o j e c t Management


3.05               The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was established by
M i n i s t e r i a l Order No. 1097 dated October 24, 1973, t o carry out t h e implemen-
t a t i o n obligations of the F i r s t Education P r o j e c t f o r Paraguay (Credit
347-PA) and has continued t o f u l f i l l a s i m i l a r r o l e implementing t h e Third
Education Project (Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA).4/                          - The following staff were
attached t o t h e P r o j e c t Implementation Unit:

                                1 Director
                                1 Educator
                                1 Architect
                                1 Engineer 5/

                                -  Other Support Personnel


3.06               Overall, t h e PIU c a r r i e d out its d u t i e s i n a very professional
manner.           The success of t h i s u n i t can not only be a t t r i b u t e d t o t h e i r having
had experience with management of t h e F.irst Education P r o j e c t , but a l s o t o
maintaining a s t a b l e cadre of full-time q u a l i f i e d professionals who were
given ample degree of autonomy by t h e Minister of Education, allowing them t o
bypass many bureaucratic o b s t a c l e s commonly found i n s i m i l a r p r o j e c t s .


Bank S u ~ e r v i s i o n

3.07               Between 1976 and 1981 t h e r e were nine supervision v i s i t s a t i n t e r -
v a l s of between 4 and 12 months; 1 3 s t a f f r e e k s were committed t o t h e s e
v i s i t s (an average of 2.6 staff-weeks per year) which appears t o have been
adequate, taking i n t o consideration t h e experience gained by PIU s t a f f i n
implementing the F i r s t Education P r o j e c t and t h e c o n t i n u i t y of t h e Bank s t a f f
members involved i n these v i s i t s .               Bank a s s i s t a n c e t o t h e P r o j e c t Unit
involved a f a i r l y even p a r t i c i p a t i o n of t h r e e a r c h i t e c t s and one educator,
from a p p r a i s a l through completion, and seems t o have been adequate.                              The
c o n t i n u i t y of Bank s t a f f supervision is considered t o be an important f a c t o r
f o r successful p r o j e c t implementation.                It is worthwhile noting that an
educator p a r t i c i p a t e d i n seven out of t h e nine Bank supervision missions.
Most Bank supervision of t h i s project was c a r r i e d out simultaneously with t h e
F i r s t and Second Education P r o j e c t (Credit 347-PA and Loan 1252-T-PA)                             and

S i t e Selection

4.01                During a p p r a i s a l no major problems were envisaged i n obtaining
construction s i t e s since many s i t e s were already owned by t h e government.
Final s e l e c t i o n and t r a n s f e r of land t o the Ministry of Education of t h e
remaining s i t e s was begun i n 1976.                       Architects from the PIU a c t i v e l y
participated i n s i t e s e l e c t i o n .               For t h e most part s i t e s were well s e l e c t e d ,
of optimum s i z e and r e l a t i v e l y well located i n r e l a t i o n t o school catchment
areas.          Surveys of the e x i s t i n g u t i l i t i e s and topographic p r o f i l e s were made
t o f a c i l i t a t e design of physical f a c i l i t i e s .

4.02               The a r c h i t e c t u r a l s e c t i o n of the PIU i d e n t i f i e d about 90 s i t e s of
approximately 2 ha. each, and ownership arrangements f o r these were handled
by the l e g a l department of the MOE.                         F u l l time services of an attorney
assigned t o t h e PIU would have been d e s i r a b l e during the period of s i t e
a c q u i s i t i o n .    The f i r s t phase of s i t e a c q u i s i t i o n was delayed by nine months
due t o the l e g a l process i n t i t l e t r a n s f e r from the communities t o t h e
government.               There was v i r t u a l l y no delay i n acquiring s i t e s f o r the second
and t h i r d groups of schools to be constructed.

4.03                During the completion mission about 15 schools were v i s i t e d with
the following general observations with regard t o s i t e s :


        ( a )       grading and drainage of s i t e s , e s p e c i a l l y i n the general a r e a
                    of the buildings needs improvement i n many instances. 61 water
                    supply and d i s t r i b u t i o n is a major problem a t about haif the
        (b)         schools v i s i t e d and needs immediate a t t e n t i o n . -          '1

4.04               Methodology f o r s e l e c t i o n of s i t e s for t h e Fourth Education Project
has improved based on experience gained during t h i s project.                                   Preliminary
s i t e s e l e c t i o n and l e g a l a c t i o n a r e now i n i t i a l l y being made by t h e Depart-

supervisors.               The PIU follows up i n t h e f i n a l s e l e c t i o n .         This d i v i s i o n of
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y r e s u l t s i n a more e f f e c t i v e use of the time of the architec-

f o r t h i s study was made from funds of the F i r s t Education P r o j e c t (Credit

and extension of 2 m u l t i l a t e r a l secondary schools, 66 associated r u r a l
primary schools and 11 suburban primary schools were constructed, with no
discrepancies i n the a r e a of construction (para. 3.04)

t i o n regarding h i s t o r y of past construction p r o j e c t s , manpower c a p a b i l i t y ,
equipment, f i n a n c i a l a b i l i t y e t c .

4.12                Based on a mathematical formula f o r evaluation of t h e above i n f o r -
mation submitted by each i n t e r e s t e d company, a list of prequalified contrac-
t o r s was formulated.                   These contractors were subsequently i n v i t e d t o submit
tenders f o r project construction.

4.13               Although the Bank did not r e q u i r e i n t e r n a t i o n a l tendering of c i v i l
works, companies o u t s i d e Paraguay were not excluded from becoming prequali-
f i e d a s long a s they were l e g a l l y authorized t o c a r r y out business i n
Paraguay and met o t h e r requirements s p e c i f i e d i n t h e tendering documents such
a s being f r e e of debts t o the government, submission of a bid guarantee and a
work schedule and having never f a i l e d t o complete a c o n t r a c t with t h e Govern-

4.14               No i n t e r e s t was shown by i n t e r n a t i o n a l companies due t o t h e widely
dispersed construction s i t e s and r e l a t i v e l y small s i z e -          lo/ of the project
components.

4.15               Prequalified companies were contacted and asked to pick up bidding
documents.             Contracts were awarded t o t h e lowest bidder within workload
l i m i t s a s established during prequalif i c a t i o n .

4.16               Bids f o r school construction were called f o r i n t h r e e separate
phases.          Materials f o r completion of t h e 66 11/ associated schools were
purchased under t h i s p r o j e c t but i n s t a l l e d a s a community c o n t r i b u t i o n with
technical a s s i s t a n c e and supervision provided by t h e Ministry of                   ducati ion's
Department of School Construction.

4.17               Contractor performance was generally s a t i s f a c t o r y although t h e r e
were time overruns i n almost a l l contracts.                        Because of excessive distances
between schools, some of these time overruns can be a t t r i b u t e d t o the
c o n t r a c t o r s f d i f f i c u l t y i n providing adequate human and mechanical resources
t o commence and carrying out construction simultaneously.                            Other causes were
due t o bad weather and severe flooding.

11/ The Spanish Translation, which the Borrower commented upon, incorrectly
         indicated 16 associated schools.

4.18                It has been learned, however, that better contractor performance is
obtained when a company is given no more than s i x o r seven schools when
c o n s t r u c t i o n sites a r e remote and i n a c c e s s i b l e .             Companies whose c o n t r a c t s
were larger than t h i s were not able t o carry out the work i n a timely manner.

4.19                During a p p r a i s a l , supervision of c o n s t r u c t i o n was envisaged a s a
f u n c t i o n of t h e performance of PIU t e c h n i c a l s t a f f .                Actually, t h e PIU d i d
not have full-time supervisors on its s t a f f .                            During implementation, i n
January 1979, t h e PIU requested, and received permission from t h e Bank t o
employ two a r c h i t e c t s 121 from t h e Department of School Construction a s
supervisors of c o n s t r u z i o n whose c o n t r a c t s were to be paid out of t h e
"Professional Services" category, although t h i s category never contemplated
c o n t r a c t s o r s a l a r y "top-ups" f o r c o n s t r u c t i o n supervisors.

4.20                These supervisors l i v e d i n Asuncion and p e r i o d i c a l l y made v i s i t s t o
inspect c o n s t r u c t i o n of schools under t h i s p r o j e c t .                  On t h e b a s i s of t h e
information obtained from t h e schools v i s i t e d , t h e completion mission f e l t
t h a t t h e q u a l i t y and q u a n t i t y of supervision i n t h e f i e l d were

                        -

4.21                Future p r o j e c t s should be grouped i n such a manner a s t o permit
c o n t r o l and supervision by a r c h i t e c t s who would be s t a t i o n e d i n t h e a r e a of

4.24               Basic lists of f u r n i t u r e were prepared f o r each type of school and
a r e a during a p p r a i s a l , thereby expediting t h e process of project implementa-

a d d i t i o n a l items such a s storage c a b i n e t s .

4.25               Furniture was.procured under f i v e i n t e r n a t i o n a l tenderings, but
only nine l o c a l firms p a r t i c i p a t e d . 14/. Although a 15% preference was
provided f o r i n t h e tender documentsfor l o c a l l y manufactured goods over t h e
CIF p r i c e of imported f u r n i t u r e , t h i s preference margin has never been used

4.26               Bidders were not prequalified.                 However, during evaluation and
before award of a contract bidders were post q u a l i f i e d l 6 / i n accordance
with t h e terms of t h e bidding conditions, and samples o r f u r n i t u r e were
supplied t o PIU f o r q u a l i t y control.             However, award of the c o n t r a c t s was
always made t o the lowest bidder.

4.27               Furniture was delivered to a c e n t r a l warehouse where delivery t o
the schools was made by personnel and v e h i c l e s of the PIU.17/                           Some
f u r n i t u r e was delivered "knocked down" and was assembled ~ ~ P personnel.               I U
This p r a c t i c e puts the PIU i n a compromising p o s i t i o n regarding judgment a s
t o the q u a l i t y of workmanship o r compliance regarding completion and d e l i v e r y
of goods within t h e specified time l i m i t .                   These p r a c t i c e s could adversely

of e f f e c t i v e project q u a l i t y c o n t r o l .

4.28               Designs and technical information f o r some f u r n i t u r e procured under
the f i r s t lending lacked adequate d e t a i l s regarding acceptable q u a l i t y
standards.             For example, i n c e r t a i n cases, thickness of wood and dimensions
of t a b l e l e g s were not shown, nor were adequate technical d e s c r i p t i o n s of
m a t e r i a l s to be employed included.              This has since been improved.

15/      To c l a r i f y the Borrower's observations i t should be pointed out t h a t i n
         11 cases the lowest bid was from locally manufactured furniture and the
         15% preference margin did not need to be employed a s evaluation

4.33                By making t h i s examination, perhaps f u t u r e mistakes can be avoided

Equipment

4.36                Equipment f o r the project was purchased by three d i f f e r e n t methods
a s follows:

        (a)         i n t e r n a t i o n a l competitive tendering (70% of t o t a l equipment
                    value) ;

        ( b )       l o c a l competitive tendering (15% of t o t a l equipment value);

        ( c )       d i r e c t price quotations (15% of t o t a l equipment value).

4.37                An international c a l l f o r bids was announced i n the l o c a l news-
papers with l e t t e r s being sent t o embassies i n Asuncion.                       There were t e n
i n t e r n a t i o n a l tenderings f o r equipment t o be supplied under t h i s project               .
Contracts were awarded t o 34 l o c a l firms, many of whom represented foreign
manufacturers.                 Equipment was purchased from the following countries: ( a ) USA
(44%), ( b ) Germany ( l o % ) , ( c ) England (9%), (d) Japan (ZX), ( e ) Spain (3%),
( f ) Brazil (17%), (g) Argentina ( I % ) , and (h) Paraguay (14%).                           Although the
15%margin of preference was provided for i n the tendering, t h i s preference
did not a f f e c t the evaluation of bids.

4.38                To simplify p a r t i a l delivery of equipment by suppliers t o about
160 21/ project i n s t i t u t i o n s , the project u n i t rented a c e n t r a l i z e d
wareEuse i n Asuncion, and each supplier quoted delivery t o the warehouse
instead of to the individual schools.                           Delivery to the schools was made by
PIU employees using a vehicle purchased under the project.                                 This system
resulted i n more e f f i c i e n t d i s t r i b u t i o n ~ o fequipment and b e t t e r inventory
control.            Receipt of equipment is acknowledged by each school d i r e c t o r and
r e c e i p t s turned over to t h e Patrimonio Section for inventory records.

4.39                In general, equipment being purchased for primary schools appears
be s a t i s f a c t o r y and is being used e f f e c t i v e l y .     Some of the handtools being
d i s t r i b u t e d t o the primary schools appear a b i t oversized for the age of
primary pupils but a r e s a t i s f a c t o r y f o r use i n adult non-f ormal t r a i n i n g t o
be offered a t the same school.

4.40                Examination of some of t h e t o o l s indicated improper care and i n t h e
case of planes, c h i s e l s , and saws, many were found with r u s t which w i l l
render them useless within another year unless some care i s taken.

4.41                During t h i s mission i n d u s t r i a l a r t s workshops i n secondary schools
were v i s i t e d and t h e equipment appears s a t i s f a c t o r y not only f o r secondary
school use but a l s o for adult education courses.                        One f a c t o r , however, which
w i l l be a constraint t o putting t h i s equipment i n t o use is the lack of
e l e c t r i c i t y i n some locations.                The mission recommended the purchase of
generators for these schools, which was undertaken immediately by the PIU.

          emphasizes t h a t purchase of t h i s vehicle was with Bank approval.                        They

would a l l o c a t e funds f o r adequate maintenance and r e p a i r of b u i l d i n g s ,

conventional supervisors1 role.                   Children within the nucleus area have t h e
opportunity t o complete primary education within reasonable proximity to
t h e i r homes.           The new nuclei system is being implemented not only within
project schools but schools throughout the country.                            The Fourth Education
Project (Loan 1992-PA) is supporting expansion of the system.                             The Bank
completion mission conf irmed i n the f i e l d t h a t nuclei d i r e c t o r s a r e trained
adequately to supervise associated schools, and t h a t t h e i r mobility is
f a c i l i t a t e d by the use of motorcycles provided by the project.                   The nucleari-
zation system has d e f i n i t e l y contributed t o t h e improvement of school super-
v i s i o n and administration i n the r u r a l areas and is expected t o improve
ultimately the q u a l i t y of i n s t r u c t i o n i n school.          In preparing its completion
r e p o r t , the Ministry of Education made a survey of supervisors, d i r e c t o r s and
teachers of t h e new school nuclei.                  In general, they had f a i t h i n t h e
philosophy and value of the system f o r improving the supervisory and adminis-
t r a t i v e efficiency and f o r meeting the need of t h e communities involved.                   A t
the same time, they point t o the need to ( a ) disseminate more information on
the philosophy and operations of t h e school nuclei system; (b) arrange f o r
t h e c e n t r a l school d i r e c t o r t o work exclusively on supervision and adminis-
t r a t i o n of the c e n t r a l and associated school, relieving him of teaching
requirements; ( c ) update on a continuous b a s i s the school map and related
s t a t i s t i c s ; (d) launch a campaign t o boost enrollments i n t h e r u r a l learning
centers; ( e ) encourage a more extensive use of the multi-grade                          technique; ( f )
make use of textbooks; (g) implement non-formal education and t r a i n i n g
programs t h a t b e n e f i t the community; and (h) t r a i n teachers i n the use and
maintenance of workshop materials and equipment provided for non-formal

5.09               The Minister of Education, in' coordination with specialized
agencies (Ministries of Agriculture, Labor, Health, e t c . ) , was expected t o

14,000 a d u l t s a t the RCLC a s part of t h i s project.                 This project financed the
services of an i n t e r n a t i o n a l s p e c i a l i s t i n adult education, trained about 40
teachers, provided adequate equipment f o r 10 schools, and printed 900 reading

primary education was under experimentation and its evaluation and r e v i s i o n

mathematics.                It has taken into account the social, economic and geographic

d i r e c t o r s and supervisors f o r t h e new schools.                The Fourth Education Project
which a l s o finances trainng of teachers, d i r e c t o r s and supervisors would take
up t h e backlogs i n t r a i n i n g . The l a s t in-service              teacher course was completed
i n June 1981, about two years l a t e r than s t a t e d i n the Credit Agreement
(Section 4.05).                However, t h i s displacement i n time did not adversely a f f e c t
t h e appointment of trained teachers i n p r o j e c t schools due to delays i n
school construction. The Ministry of Education made a survey of the t r a i n e e s
who p a r t i c i p a t e d i n t h r e e regional courses.            In general, they indicated
s a t i s f a c t i o n with t h e usefulness of t h e in-service courses, except f o r a few
remarks which may help improve f u t u r e courses:

        ( a )       reduce the number of p a r t t c i p a n t s f o r each course;


        (b)         lengthen the course duration so t h a t an in-depth t r a i n i n g can be
                    made i n a s p e c i f i c a r e a ;


        ( c )       maintain such an in-service t r a i n i n g program on a continuing basis;
                    and

        ( d )       make a survey of the i n t e r e s t and needs of teachers p r i o r t o

In addition t o t h e t r a i n i n g of general s u b j e c t s teachers, a s p e c i a l i s t . was

Textbook Production

5.15               The project included the financing of printing materials (papers,
cardboard, ink) f o r the production of about 300,000 textbooks and 20,000
teacher's guides f o r grades 5 and 6 of primary education ( i n communications,
mathematics, s o c i a l and n a t u r a l sciences, and h e a l t h ) ; and 5,000 textbooks
including teachers' guides f o r adult education.                      A t appraisal, textbooks f o r
grades 1-4 were ready f o r d i s t r i b u t i o n i n the Ministry of Education storage.
During project execution, the Bank approved financing 85% of the printing
cost based on a c t u a l prices of materials which were lower than had been
o r i g i n a l l y estimated.

5.16               The textbooks and teaching materials were produced as estimated a t
appraisal i n number and q u a l i t y , except f o r 7,000 adult basic education
textbooks which exceeded the appraisal t a r g e t s (5,000) by 2,000 books.
Paper, cardboard, ink and other materials were purchased through interna-
t i o n a l competitive bidding.                Contracts were awarded t o a Brazilian firm
(paper and cardboard) and a German firm (ink and f i l m ) f o r a t o t a l amount of
about US$120,000, o r one third of the estimated cost.                       Prequalified printing
firms were invited t o bid, f i r s t f o r printing textbooks f o r grade 5 (June
1979) and second f o r grade 6 (April 1980).                     The textbooks a s produced a r e
expected t o have a useful l i f e of three t o four years due t o the q u a l i t y of
paper used, and to the f a c t t h a t t h e i r content is i n accordance with t h e new,
revised curriculum f o r primary education.

5.17               Textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n t o schools o r students continues t o be
unsatisfactory.           The s p e c i a l i s t i n textbook costing, accounting and distribu-
t i o n included i n the technical a s s i s t a n c e component was not contracted i n
s p i t e of frequent Bank urging.                 The Ministry procedure of s e l l i n g textbooks

(more than 160 i n the country) a s agents f o r textbook s a l e s was not effec-
t i v e ; 90% of textbooks remained unsold.                  From a preliminary survey c a r r i e d
out by school supervisors, it appears t h a t t h e major reason f o r students
being without textbooks is t h a t r u r a l parents lack money t o buy books.                   Based
on t h i s finding, the Minister of Education took a decision (March 1982) t o
d i s t r i b u t e textbooks, f r e e of charge, to a l l r u r a l schools.       Each school w i l l
receive books i n the proportion of one f o r every two students attending a
s h i f t ; therefore, i n some cases a book w i l l be used by four students i f t h e
school operates i n two s h i f t s f o r the same grades.                Books w i l l remain school
property, and students w i l l be able t o use them, without charge.                      Cost of
replacing textbooks would be financed from the Ministry of Education budget
o r through loans and grants from b i l a t e r a l o r i n t e r n a t i o n a l agencies.     The
Bank Completion Mission v e r i f i e d t h a t the Ministry resolution of f r e e
textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n was being implemented i n r u r a l project schools.           The
Bank should therefore c l o s e l y monitor the additional c o s t s to be generated by
t h i s policy change and the e f f e c t i v e use of books by teachers and students a t
school.           The textbook component of the Fourth Education Project should be
reviewed i n the l i g h t of t h i s policy change-

Secondary Education

5.18              A s a follow up of the F i r s t Education Project, the l o a d c r e d i t
financed construction and equipping of f i v e lower secondary schools.                 The
main thrust was t o provide secondary education opportunities to semi-rural
towns a s a basis for improving the productivity of lower income groups.                      I n
addition, f i v e workshops and laboratories of the two m u l t i l a t e r a l (diversi-
f i e d ) secondary schools were constructed and equipped.             Four schools have
been operating since 1980 and the remaining three since 1981.                 Also provided
was equipment for the workshops and laboratories of three diversified schools
t h a t were constructed under the F i r s t Education Project (Credit 347-PA).

5.19              Total enrollment i n the f i v e project lower secondary schools of
1,016 students represents only 42% of f u l l school capacity working i n two

secondary cycle (grades 10-12) where enrollment per grade is too low to be
economical, between 10 and 20, except i n one school which has an average of
34 students i n grades 10, 11 and 12.              One possible reason for the low enroll-
ment is the delay of about one year i n opening the schools; enrollment may
increase s t e a d i l y over the next year, but a continuous monitoring of the
enrollment trends is recommended.

5.21                Teachers f o r i n d u s t r i a l a r t s and sciences have received adequate
training.             However, a majority of them a r e not yet able t o teach properly t h e
prevocational subjects a s provided f o r a t appraisal since three out of the
f i v e schools do not have e l e c t r i c i t y or water supply even though equipment
items have been i n s t a l l e d .            This s i t u a t i o n has been corrected since the
r e t u r n of the completion mission, which recommended purchase of mobile
generators, using the balance of the loan funds.

5.22                To remedy the low enrollment a t the lower secondary education
i n s t i t u t i o n s , the Ministry of Education, p a r t i c u l a r l y t h e Department of
Secondary Education, should make an e f f o r t to determine:

        ( a )       how many students graduate from primary schools i n t h e catchment
                    area of the secondary schools;

        (b)        where graduates from primary schools i n the project a r e a s go a f t e r
                    completing primary education;
        ( c )       i f i t would be f e a s i b l e t o consolidate small and i n e f f i c i e n t

5.23                The two m u l t i l a t e r a l project schools were expanded f o r workshops
and laboratories.                   The mission v i s i t e d one of these schools and found i t was
operating with 800 students, exceeding t h e a p p r a i s a l t a r g e t of 600 students.
Qualified teachers and i n s t r u c t o r s , with a r a t i o of 35 s t u d e n t s per teacher,
were s a t i s f a c t o r i l y using t h e equipment f o r the prevocational programs

t i o n of t h e Paraguayan r u r a l population was c a r r i e d out under t h e leadership
of a highly q u a l i f i e d l o c a l s p e c i a l i s t . A s r e s u l t of the study, a b i l i n g u a l
teaching method was developed and adapted t o l o c a l s i t u a t i o n s .              Experiments
i n audio-visual techniques using Guarani f o r teaching Spanish, were made i n
71 r u r a l schools (with an enrollment of about 3,200 students) located i n f i v e
departments.              A preliminary evaluation c a r r i e d out i n 1980 showed that
student achievement increases when f i r s t grade children were extensively
taught i n Guarani and t h a t they became r a p i d l y integrated i n t o school and
student groups i n subsequent grades.                      USAID, with a USS1.0 million project,

Only about 20% of loan funds available for this program were b usedecause the
OAS granted government fellowships for 16 technical teachers and about eight
educational administrators, thereby reducing the number of trainees from 52
to 28 to be financed by loan proceeds.  About 10 fellowships were not used
due to difficulties in locating suitable courses in foreign institutions for
training ministry staff who could be absent from their office only a few
months. Teachers trained under this program were assigned to technical,
vocational and multilateral schools offering technical courses and are
receiving a competitive salary.

6.02                Although t h e r e was a nominal increase of 4.4% i n project c o s t s , it
should be noted t h a t o v e r a l l p r o j e c t scope was increased e s p e c i a l l y by
s u b s t i t u t i n g t h e construction of suburban primary schools f o r purchasing of
construction materials f o r the same number of associated r u r a l primary
schools and adding t h e project preparation for t h e Fourth Education P r o j e c t
Actual c o s t s of construction of the o r i g i n a l project scope was about
US$350,000 l e s s than what had been estimated a t appraisal.                         The major c o s t
increase i n terms of percentage was f o r Project Administration (+134%), which
was e n t i r e l y financed by government, followed by Furniture (+14X) and C i v i l

was e n t i r e l y financed by government, followed by Furniture (+14%) and C i v i l
Works (+8%).               Increased c o s t of t h e s e c a t e g o r i e s was compensated to some
e x t e n t by under-spending              i n Construction Materials (-17%), Professional
Services (-15%) and Technical Assistance and Fellowships (-78%).                                      The
government was successful i n c o n t r o l l i n g the project c o s t ; however, t h e r e is
scope f o r f u r t h e r improvement.

6.03                Cost adjustments i n c i v i l work c o n t r a c t s during the course of
c o n s t r u c t i o n amounted t o about USS1.82 m i l l i o n , o r 17.1% more than the value
of the o r i g i n a l c o n t r a c t s .    Of t h i s , USS0.22 m i l l i o n (12.1%) was due to
physical changes and modifications t o c o n t r a c t s .                    The remainder, USS1.60

6.05               Discussions were held with t h e Project Unit, and a methodology
proposed which could s i g n i f i c a n t l y reduce c o s t overruns on f u t u r e projects.
Four basic points were considered i n these discussions:


       ( a )       Since p r i c e increases a r e normally authorized around the f i r s t p a r t
                   of January and July, t h e Project Implementation Unit should not
                   propose t o sign c o n t r a c t s between December 15 and February 1 nor
                   between June 15 and August 1.

       (b)         An advance should be given to each contractor, against a bank
                   guarantee, i n the amount of 15-20% of t h e value of the contract.
                   Proportional r e t e n t i o n s would be made from p a r t i a l payment s to t h e
                   contractor.

       (c)         The PIU should specify construction materials t h a t must be
                   adequately stored a t the job s i t e within 90 days of signing a
                   contract.          Payment should be made i n the amount of 80% t o 90% of
                   t h e value of such materials.

       (d)         I n the event materials mentioned above a r e not t o be stored, t h e
                   contractor would be penalized by not being allowed t o take i n t o
                   consideration the value of those materials i n subsequent p r i c e
                   increases authorized by t h e government.

The e f f e c t of the above suggestions should reduce project cost overruns due
t o authorized increases i n labor and materials c o s t s by a s much as 50%.

6.06               During a p p r a i s a l , project administration was estimated t o c o s t
US$378,100 f o r t h e l i f e of the project and be 100% financed by government.
Actually, US$883,930 was spent f o r administration of the project by t h e
PIU, which is an increase of 134% over what had been anticipated. 28/
6.07               It appears that the annual overall cost of operation of t h e PIU
under present conditions should be i n the range of US$300,000-350,000.                                This
does not include supplemental f i n a n c i a l a s s i s t a n c e through l i n e items such a s
"Professional Services" o r "Technical Assistance," which amounted t o about
US$23,200.

Financing and Disbursements

6.08               A t a p p r a i s a l , the ~ a n k / 1 ~funds (US$12 m i l l i o n ) were supposed t o
                                                            A
finance 69%of t h e t o t a l project c o s t (USS17.4 m i l l i o n ) .                Due t o the cost
increase, however, t h e Bank/IDA funds financed only 66% of t h e a c t u a l t o t a l
c o s t (USS18.1) as follows:


-
28/ As pointed out by t h e Borrower, only 4.8% of the t o t a l project c o s t was
       spent on project administration.                      This amount i s within acceptable
       l i m i t s .    The o r i g i n a l US$378,100 considered t h a t personnel within t h e MOE

         Treasury Department within t h e Finance Ministry and t h a t a l l
         accounting has been c a r r i e d out out i n accordance with Paraguayan
         laws.

        (a)         The project formulation took only 14 months from i d e n t i f i c a t i o n to
                    Board presentation.                This short project generation cycle can be
                    a t t r i b u t e d to the f a c t t h a t ( i ) t h e project supported the govern-
                    ment's high p r i o r i t y program; ( i i ) the Ministry of Education s t a f f ,
                    e s p e c i a l l y PIU s t a f f , was s t a b l e and experienced with preparation
                    and implementation of a previous B ~ ~ ~financed              / I D Aproject; and
                    ( i i i ) t h e project s t a f f maintained close and e f f e c t i v e cooperation
                    with Programs' s t a f f within t h e Bank (para. 3.01).

        (b)         The project became e f f e c t i v e on time, but t h e project implementa-
                    t i o n suffered from t h e lack of budgetary arrangements during the
                    f i r s t year, and consequently a c t u a l implementation and disbursement
                    lagged behind the appraisal schedule by about one year throughout
                    the implementation period (para. 4.01).

        (c)         During the implementation both t h e Bank and the Borrower
                    e f f e c t i v e l y amended the scope of the project i n accordance with the
                    changing circumstances i n t h e country (para. 4.04).

        (d)         The e f f i c i e n t implementation of the the physical aspects of t h e
                    project was aided, t o a g r e a t extent, by the s t a b l e and experienced
                    PIU s t a f f with adequate delegation of authority from the Minister
                    of Education and the adequate Bank supervision v i s i t s with well-
                    balanced composition of missions and continuity of s t a f f , a s well
                    a s the uninterrupted support from the Minister of Finance i n
                    providing adequate counterpart funds (paras. 3.06 and 3.07).

Implementation of Physical Aspects

7.02                Implementation of t h e physical aspects including s i t e s e l e c t i o n s ,
design, construction and equipping of educational f a c i l i t i e s were carried out
e f f i c i e n t l y ; however, some minor probiems were encountered which could have
been avoided i n retrospect:


        ( a )       t h e s i t e s f o r the f i r s t phase construction should have been
                    selected and acquired before t h e presentation of t h e project to t h e
                    Board (para. 4.02);

        (b)         retaining a lawyer i n the Project Unit on a full-time basis during
                    the f i r s t year of implementation would have expedited the s i t e
                    a c q u i s i t i o n , and t h i s cost should be included i n the project cost
                    estimates (para. 4.02);

        ( c )       a study could have been designed to compare t h e r e l a t i v e e f f i c i e n c y
                    of the new designs compared to the conventional designs, especially
                    with respect t o t h e trade-offs between higher i n i t i a l investment
                    and lower maintenance costs, since the minimum maintenance was an
                    important design consideration (para. 4.07);

        (d)         t h e construction supervisors of PIU s t a f f should have been
                    stationed i n t h e a r e a of construction and should have v i s i t e d the
                    s i t e s a t l e a s t weekly (para. 4.21);

some f u r n i t u r e was delivered "knocked down" and was assembled by
PIU personnel.            This practice might adversely a f f e c t the
c r e d i b i l i t y of PIU s t a f f i n carrying ~ u tth e i r quality control
function (para. 4.27);

i n evaluating bids, t h e PIU seems to have over-emphasized the
lowest price when interpreting the "lowest evaluated bid" of the
Bank procurement guidelines, and consequently accepted bids
offering an "alternate" proposal f o r some f u r n i t u r e which is
unsuitable f o r use i n r u r a l primary schools.              The Bank should
r e i t e r a t e to its borrowers the importance of compliance with speci-
f i c a t i o n s and evaluation of bids i n selecting the lowest bid
(para. 4.31);

no i n t e r e s t was shown by international firms i n the construction of
schools due to the dispersed s i t e s and small s i z e of the contracts
involved; however, some foreign firms offered bids f o r furniture
and equipment procurement through the l o c a l firms.                 The preferen-
t i a l margin f o r the f u r n i t u r e and equipment procurement did not
play any s i g n i f i c a n t r o l e (paras. 4.14 and 4.37);

experience has shown t h a t b e t t e r contractor performance was
obtained when a company was given no more than 6-7 schools when
s i t e s were remote and inaccessible (para. 4.18);

a v a i l a b i l i t y of basic lists of furniture and equipment prepared f o r
each school and area expedited the process of project implementa-
t i o n although they were refined and modified during implementation
(para. 4.24);

f u r n i t u r e and equipment were delivered to a c e n t r a l warehouse where
delivery to schools was made by PIU personnel and a vehicle
purchased by PIU under the project.                     This method resulted i n more
e f f i c i e n t control and timely d i s t r i b u t i o n of equipment and
f u r n i t u r e than a method by which suppliers s t o r e and deliver them
to schools i n accordance with the construction completion
dates;

about 70% of t o t a l equipment was purchased through international
competitive bidding, and the majority was purchased from the
developed countries (64% from USA, U.K. and Germany) (para. 4.37);

the area constructed was the same a s estimated a t appraisal, and
designs made with assistance provided by CONESCAL, a r e economical
and s u i t a b l e f o r r e p l i c a t i o n throughout Paraguay (para. 4.10); and

equipment purchased under the project appears to be of good quality
and is being used e f f e c t i v e l y (para. 4.39).           Despite the government
assurances given a t negotiations, no adequate funds have yet been
allocated f o r maintenance of buildings, equipment and furniture.
The Bank should take a more rigorous and positive stance on t h i s
matter, by proposing, f o r example establishment of a school mainte-
nance scheme (para. 4.43).

Implementation of Educational Aspects

7.03              The p r o j e c t ' s educational components aimed a t improving the q u a l i t y
and e f f i c i e n c y of t h e educational system have been completed successfully
while the q u a n t i t a t i v e (enrollment) t a r g e t s of the project need more time t o
be met.          Total enrollment i n project r u r a l primary schools so f a r has reached
only 76% of t h e appraisal t a r g e t due mainly t o the delays i n opening of t h e
schools i n r e l a t i o n t o the a p p r a i s a l schedule.       The completion mission e s t i -
mates t h a t the appraisal t a r g e t s would be a t t a i n e d within a two-to-three           year
period (para. 5.06).                  Attainment of the enrollment t a r g e t a t project lower
secondary schools has been much l e s s than a t the r u r a l primary schools.
Including t h e students a t upper secondary school l e v e l , which was not t h e
purpose of the p r o j e c t , enrollment i n project secondary schools has reached
only 42% of the a p p r a i s a l enrollment t a r g e t on t h e two-shift           basis.
Therefore the f a c i l i t i e s a r e u t i l i z e d a t a l e s s than optimum l e v e l (para.
5.19).

7.04             The s i n g l e most important aspect of the project is t h a t the project
has f a c i l i t a t e d government's program f o r e s t a b l i s h i n g and operating a school
n u c l e i system t o improve the supervision and administration of r u r a l
schools.         Although the q u a n t i t a t i v e objective of the system, i . e . ,     increase
the access of r u r a l children to a successively higher grade of primary educa-
t i o n , has not yet been showing f u l l concrete r e s u l t s , t h e decentralized
supervision and administration system of r u r a l primary schools has
established a s o l i d footing f o r f u r t h e r improvement and strengthening.                The
c e n t r a l schools have become the focal point f o r t h e supervision and adminis-
t r a t i o n of r u r a l primary schools.          Multi-grade     teaching techniques and
two-shift         operations a r e widely applied a s p a r t of the school nuclei system.
This school nuclei system is being applied not only i n the e i g h t project
departments, but a l s o i n a l l 20 departments of t h e country (para. 5.08).

7.05             One important function of the school nuclei system has not yet been
successfully implemented.                  The c e n t r a l schools a r e supposed t o carry out an
accelerated ~ r i m a r veducation Droeram. an adult hasjc education program and a
non-formal s k i l l t r a i n i n g program f o r r u r a l youth and a d u l t s .    Due t o the
l a t e completion of some r u r a l schools equipped with a d u l t education and
t r a i n i n g f a c i l i t i e s and t o the lack of a proper mechanism f o r coordination
between public agencies involved i n adult education and t r a i n i n g program,
t h i s component of the project has shown so f a r only a meager s t a r t (para.
5-09).

7.06              I n addition t o t h e establishment of the school nuclei system, t h e
project has made a s i g n i f i c a n t contribution t o t h e i n s t i t u t i o n a l development
of t h e Paraguayan educational system through the implementation of t h e
in-service teacher t r a i n i n g program, including technical s u b j e c t s teacher
t r a i n i n g , t h e textbook production and d i s t r i b u t i o n program, t h e school
mapping program, a b i l i n g u a l study, t h e information and documentation
program, t h e personnel management program and the study on t h e student
achievement evaluation procedures.

7.07             Although not a l l teachers assigned t o the project schools a r e
q u a l i f i e d by the government standards, they have taken in-service                   teacher

t r a i n i n g courses provided under the p r o j e c t .              Through t h e p r o j e c t , t h e
in-service           teacher t r a i n i n g has become a permanent program of t h e Higher
I n s t i t u t e of Education and t h e Regional Education Centers, and more t r a i n i n g
courses have been made a v a i l a b l e a t t h e regional l e v e l (para. 5-14).

7.08               Textbooks and teaching m a t e r i a l s were produced s a t i s f a c t o r i l y i n
number and q u a l i t y a s envisaged a t a p p r a i s a l and a t l e s s c o s t than estimated
a t a p p r a i s a l through an, i n t e r n t i o n a l competitive bidding for procurement of
m a t e r i a l s f o r p r i n t i n g books (para. 6.16).           Textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n , however,
continues t o unsatisfactory.                         When the completion mission v i s i t e d t h e
country, about 90% of t h e produced textbooks remained unsold due mainly to
the parents' lack of economic resources to purchase them.                                  It was only i n
March 1982 t h a t the Minister of Education made a decision t o d i s t r i b u t e t h e
books, f r e e of charge, to a l l r u r a l schools, instead of individual s t u d e n t s ,
and the Bank completion mission was a b l e t o v e r i f y t h a t the f r e e d i s t r i b u t i o n
of t h e textbooks was being s a t i s f a c t o r i l y implemented i n project r u r a l
schools.           Delays i n the textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n has a l s o had an adverse impact
on t h e timely a p p l i c a t i o n of t h e revised c u r r i c u l a to r u r a l primary schools.
The Bank/IDA should have paid more a t t e n t i o n t o the textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n
system a t a p p r a i s a l , s i n c e the shortcomings of t h e t r a d i t i o n a l d i s t r i b u t i o n
system were p a r t l y known a t t h a t time.                    Moreover, t h e Bank/IDA should have
been more i n s i s t e n t on t h e borrower's engagement of a s p e c i a l i s t f o r
textbooks who could have i d e n t i f i e d the seriousness of t h e problem e a r l i e r
and recommended c o r r e c t i v e measures accordingly (para. 5.17).

7.09               The school map was completed s a t i s f a c t o r i l y with t h e a s s i s t a n c e of
an i n t e r n a t i o n a l s p e c i a l i s t and became t h e b a s i s f o r preparing t h e Fourth
Education P r o j e c t and t h e Education Development Plan (1981-91).                                The mapping

s p e c i a l i s t s , and as a r e s u l t , an audio-visual teaching method was developed
and put i n t o an experiment, which w i l l be followed uyp by USS1.0 m i l l i o n
p r o j e c t being financed by USAID (para. 5.29).

7.11                The t e c h n i c a l a s s i s t a n c e program of t h e project helped update t h e
educational administration a t t h e c e n t r a l l e v e l through t h e improvement of
t h e information and documentation system, t h e job a n a l y s i s and d e s c r i p t i o n
system, and a comprehensive diagnosis of c u r r e n t procedures f o r evaluating
s t u d e n t ' s evaluation system under t h e Fourth Education Project (paras. 5.25
and 5.28).

7.12                Except f o r about t e n fellowships t h a t could not be used e f f e c t i v e l y
due t o d i f f i c u l t i e s i n l o c a t i n g s u i t a b l e courses i n foreign i n s t i t u t e s , a l l
fellowships included i n t h e project were c a r r i e d out p a r t l y with t h e proceeds
of t h e l o a n / c r e d i t and p a r t l y with g r a n t s provided by OAS; and all l o c a l
s t a f f trained under the p r o j e c t were returned t o the intended positions,
receiving competitive s a l a r i e s ( p a r a . 5.29).

7.13          The technical assistance program was successfully executed under a
contract made with OAS which employed only local and regional s p e c i a l i s t s w
A s a r e s u l t , the actual cost incurred for technical assistance was 49% lower
than the appraisal estimates excluding contingencies, leaving about
US$250,000 unutilized under t h i s category (para. 5.25).

7.14          Equipment provided under the project for the five lower secondary
schools has not been put i n proper use yet, due to the lack of e l e c t r i c i t y o r
water i n the schools.            A t the advise of the completion mission, the PIU has
quickly procured mobile generators and pumps which would enable the schools
t o use equipment as intended (para. 5.21).

7.15          The project was implemented with little cost overruns.            Although
the    totalof                       USofl8.15 million exceeds the appraisal estimate of
USof17.38 million by 4.42, t h i s excess is due to the increased scope of the
project, especially the construction of 11 suburban primary schools substi-
tuting for the procurement of construction materials for the same number of
rural primary schools and preparation of the Fourth Education Project.
Actual construction costs of the original project scope were about US$350,000
l e s s than the appraisal estimates (para. 6.01).

7.16          Although costs have been effectively controlled, there is a scope
f o r further improvement by: 311      -
       (a)    avoiding signing of contracts just before and a f t e r the price
              adjustments normally made i n January and July;


       (b)    providing advance to each contractor i n the amount of 15-20% of the
              value of the contract, against a bank guarantee;

       (c)    specifying construction materials that must be stored a t the job
              s i t e within 90 days of signing of a contract and paying 80% t o 90%
              of the value of such materials; and

       ( d )  ~ 3 l e t i n g;.he amount of tne constructior. ma:erials stcrez at job
              s i t e s from the contract amount to be considered for the subsequent
              price adjustments (paras. 6.05).

7.17          The professional service category took into account only the costs
involved i n the development of designs and did not include the salary top-ups
f o r the Ministry of ~d"cation staff-assigned to the PIU t o carry out super-
vision of construction.             These costs should be estimated a s an i n t e g r d part
of normal operational costs of the PIU (paras. 4.19 and 6.07).

7.18          The Bank loan of USof8.0 million and IDA credit of USof4.0 million
accounted for about 66% of the actual t o t a l cost, compared with the appraisal
estimate of 69%. The government increased its cbunterpart funds by about
USS0.8 million to meet the cost increases entailed mainly from the modifica-
tion of the project scope (para. 6.08).

        incorporated in implementation of the Fourth Education Project.

7.19             Loan and c r e d i t funds of USS12.0 m i l l i o n were f u l l y disbursed, and
t h e a c t u a l disbursement p r o f i l e c l o s e l y followed t h e a p p r a i s a l p r o f i l e ,
except t h a t t h e a c t u a l p r o f i l e was lagging behind t h e a p p r a i s a l p r o f i l e by
about one year throughout t h e implementation period due to the lack of
counterpart funds during the f i r s t year of implementation (para. 6.11).

7.20             Retroactive Financing of US$100,000 was made a v a i l a b l e t o cover the
project preparation expenditures, but i t was not used s i n c e a previous Bank-
financed project was s t i l l underway t o take up t h e expenditures.                             Also, t h e
Ministry of Education requested a loan of US$80,000 from t h e Central Bank
Preinvestment Funds p a r t l y financed by an IDA c r e d i t (587-PA) f o r t h e project
preparation; t h e loan was not made a v a i l a b l e on time due t o t h e bureaucratic
procedures.            The t h i r d project loan a l s o financed about US$90,000 of the
expenditures r e l a t e d t o the preparation of t h e f o u r t h Project.                      This piggy-
back financing arrangement was more useful than the r e t r o a c t i v e financing t o
cover the expenditures r e l a t e d t o the preparation of a f u t u r e project (para.
6.14).

7.21             Periodic r e p o r t i n g of t h e f i n a n c i a l s t a t u s of t h e project was made
by t h e PIU t o t h e Ministry of Finance.                     However, t h e r e has been no a u d i t of
t h e f i n a n c i a l records of t h i s project.             It would be useful to make an
in-depth review of the accounting p r a c t i c e s of t h e government e n t i t i e s and
r e q u i r e the f i n a n c i a l records of the Bank/IDA financed p r o j e c t s be audited
annually by an independent public o r p r i v a t e agency (para. 6.10).

7.22             The Borrower's Completion Report became t h e b a s i s of t h e Bank/IDA
completion r e p o r t .             In order t o s u s t a i n borrower's i n i t i a t i v e and encourage
t h e borrower t o make an in-depth review of t h e project implementation, t h e
Bank/IDA have commented on t h e borrower's d r a f t completion r e p o r t , and t h e
Bank/1~Acompletion mission should have helped t h e borrower t o r e v i s e and
f i n a l i z e the completion r e p o r t i n the f i e l d , instead of writing its own
completion r e p o r t a t headquarters.                 I n t h e f u t u r e , t h e borrower should be
asked t o prepare an in-depth interim p r o j e c t implementation review report f o r
a n a l y s i s and comment by t h e Bank a t about mid-point                      i n t h e project implemen-
t a t i o n period.          Such a r e p o r t would help the borrower t o prepare a f i n a l
completion r e p o r t .

7.23             A s p a r t of t h e project implementation review t h e borrower made a
s e r i e s of s t u d i e s and surveys including:


        ( a )    progress i n t h e school n u c l e i system;

        ( c )    evaluation of teacher t r a i n i n g programs;

        (d)      use of teacher houses;

        ( e )    problems and t h e extent of textbook d i s t r i b u t i o n ; and

        ( f )    e f f e c t i v e n e s s of the audio-visual teaching method f o r b i l i n g u a l
                 education.

Findings of such studies could have been e f f e c t i v e l y incorporated i n t o the
Borrower's Completion Report had adequate time and a s s i s t a n c e been made
available to the borrower.

Action Recommended

7.24              Many project schools still s u f f e r from water supply and d i s t r i b u -
tion problems a s well a s the deficiency i n grading and drainage.                           The
Ministry of Education should contact the relevant public agencies o r organize
community a c t i v i t i e s to solve these problems promptly (para. 4.03)

7.25              The Project Implementation Unit and t h e Department of School
Construction should be integrated and be developed a s a school construction
and maintenance department of the Ministry of Education, since major invest-
ment projects of the education s e c t o r have been carried out by the PIU and
its project implementation capability has been greatly enhanced (para. 4.23).


7.26              The PIU should make a quick and thorough examination of a l l r u r a l
primary school f u r n i t u r e to analyze the d u r a b i l i t y and compliance with tech-
n i c a l s p e c i f i c a t i o n s and ask the suppliers t o take c o r r e c t i v e measures on a
voluntary b a s i s (para. 4.32).

7.27              32/       The Ministry of Education should promptly a l l o c a t e an
adequate budget f o r maintenance and care of the equipment, f u r n i t u r e and
buildings purchased under the project.                              In the long run, the government
should study the p o s s i b i l i t y of e s t a b l i s h i n g a national network of mobile
maintenance shops t o v i s i t schools periodically and handle minor maintenance
tasks o r organizing l o c a l communities f o r the school maintenance purpose
(para. 4.43).


7.28              The Ministry of Education (MOE), e s p e c i a l l y the Primary Education
Department, should continuously monitor the enrollment trends i n both t h e
formal and non-formal programs of the Rural Community Learning Centers and
study the causes of the possible lags i n the enrollment increase (para.
5.06).

7.29              The MOE, e s p e c i a l l y the Primary Education and the Adult Education
Departments, should make a study of the i s s u e s and problems of implementing
the non-formal adult education and t r a i n i n g programs of the school nuclei
system and make recommendations to relevant departments of the Ministry of
Education and other government agencies f o r a successful implementation of
the programs (para. 5.09).

7.30              The MOE,          331 e s p e c i a l l y t h e Secondary Education Department, should
make an in-depth study of the reasons f o r the lower than expected enrollments

10-12) (para. 5.20).

7.31                The PIU should monitor provision of mobile generators and wells t o
t h e lower secondary schools which have d i f f i c u l t y i n using equipment due t o
the lack of power and water supply and contact relevant public agencies t o
a c c e l e r a t e t h e provision of public u t i l i t y s e r v i c e s on a permanent b a s i s

                Para. 3.05, PIU s t a f f :      An engineer should have been included.

               Para. 4.02, S i t e Selection:         " ~ i n i s t r yof Public Works" [ i n the

Spanish version.             - Translator] should read " ~ i n i s t rof~ Education and


Worship."          We point out a l s o t h a t the Architectural Section of t h e PIU located

90 s i t e s and t h a t t h e related legal proceedings were carried out by the Legal

Department of the Ministry of Education and Worship.

               Para. 4.03 ( a ) :      In f a c t there were problems with some schools

because t h e project designs took i n t o account storm drains only for t h e

building.           Good drainage would a l s o c a l l for storm drainage works for the

e n t i r e t e r r a i n , including neighboring s t r e e t s .

               Para. 4.03 (b):         The main problem with t h e common wells is t h a t t h e r e


is no certainty that water w i l l be obtained a t depths that are reasonable for


r u r a l premises budgets.          Also, those budgets make no provision f o r r e p e t i t i o n

of work o r t h e use of some other a l t e r n a t i v e (already provided f o r , i n a

c e r t a i n percentage, for t h e Fourth Project).

               Para. 4.09:        In t h i s project we have t e s t e d t h e soundness of t h e

design i n operation, and f o r t h e Fourth Project we have accordingly adopted

changes i n the materials f o r reasons of cost o r of a v a i l a b i l i t y i n the works

            Para. 4.16:        "1b schools" should read "66 schools                ."

            Para. 4.20:        In r e a l i t y , the system of periodical supervision (the


frequency of which can vary g r e a t l y , depending on the condition of the main


access roads t o t h e works) does not permit s t r i c t monitoring of t h e progress


of the work.     This was commented on by the PIU i n the completion report, page

35, and resident supervision has been adopted for t h e Fourth Project.

            Para. 7.16 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) :        A l l these points have arisen

through experience with t h e Project.                 A l l a r e taken i n t o account i n the

programs and projects of t h e Fourth Project.

            Para. 7.27:        In view of t h e s t a t e of abandonment of some of t h e


schools i n operation, and a l s o t h e f a i l u r e t o carry out minor repairs i n

others, t h e ~ a n k ' sappraisal mission, during its v i s i t , stressed the need for

some system of maintenance of premises.                     Experience t o date suggests t h a t it

would be advisable t o take these recommendations i n t o account.

            Para. 7.31:        Recommendation adopted as a solution for future projects.

            Para. 4.25, Furniture:                The statement t h a t   "...   t h i s preference

margin has never been used            . . . . ' I is incorrect: the 15%preference margin,

which has been applied t o a l l goods manufactured i n Paraguay, appears i n each

and every one of t h e comparative tables of appraisal of international bids.

            Para. 4.26:        According t o t h e procedures approved by t h e Bank for t h e

purchase of f u r n i t u r e , prequalification was not necessary.

            Nor was post-qualification used i n any case.                      Instead, before award

t o t h e successful bidder, h i s present legal and economic/financial s i t u a t i o n

is confirmed, since it can have changed since the t i m e when the bids w e r e


submitted.

                  Para. 4.27:      I t is t r u e t h a t some furniture (student desks,


cupboards) contracted c . i . f . t o PIC warehouse was delivered i n Asuncibn


unassembled.              This was done t o f a c i l i t a t e transportation and d i s t r i b u t i o n of

t h e f u r n i t u r e by PIU s t a f f ; it had been agreed t h a t t h e supplier would defray


t h e expense of transportation of the f u r n i t u r e t o t h e r u r a l primary schools


but not t h e personnel payments.                This procedure of accepting t h e f u r n i t u r e


unassembled was a g r e a t advantage as regards transportation and d i s t r i b u t i o n

of t h e f u r n i t u r e , since t h e cargo volume was reduced t o one-fourth.                This

resulted i n a s u b s t a n t i a l reduction i n transportation costs and a l s o allowed

b e t t e r coordination of t h e work and f i n a l delivery of t h e f u r n i t u r e and other

items, such as equipment intended f o r the same project schools, and more

e f f i c i e n t supervision by PIL q u a l i f i e d personnel, since under t h e contract PIU

a l s o had t o bear t h e cost of transportation of the equipment.

                  Para. 4.29:      With regard t o t h e reference t o a bidder who submitted

an a l t e r n a t i v e bid, we wish t o explain t h a t t h e schedule of bases and

conditions of tender f o r public i n v i t a t i o n t o tender no. 7 (supply of school

f u r n i t u r e ) , dated August 20, 1979, approved by the Bank, provides t h a t i n

presenting h i s bid t h e bidder s h a l l conform t o the technical specifications

required by t h e Office.             However, he may present a l t e r n a t i v e bids t h a t include

variations from t h e design c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and materials which he believes

c o n s t i t u t e improvements i n q u a l i t y compared with t h e tender s p e c i f i c a t i o n s ,

provided t h a t they do not depart s u b s t a n t i a l l y from t h e measurements and

design required by t h e Office.

                  I n t h i s context, t h e PIE considered t h e a l t e r n a t i v e bid t o be

acceptable because of its more favorable cost and because it met conditions

appropriate t o t h e function f o r which the items were intended (student desks),

                                                                            ATTACHRENT I

                                                                            (Pg. 5 o f 13)


with a basic structure of metal tubing with a l i d of double formica veneer,

assembled using bolts.        I t consequently appears t h a t the mission considered

the conditions s e t forth i n the tender documents t o be incorrect.            These

considerations would tend t o modify the comments i n paras. 4.30 and 4.31 of

the report.

               Para. 4.31:  We refer t o the statement t h a t the manufacturer's own

technical specifications, in bid number 12, were not complied with.               We point

out t h a t t h i s constitutes a subjective opinion of the mission and that we

consider it t o be mistaken since, as s e t forth i n the Annex, Details and

Specifications, t o the contract under reference, dated January 24, 1980, the

measurements, materials and manufacturing d e t a i l s are given i n Article 4.55

(double student desk) where it i s indicated that the         lid  s h a l l be completely

laminated with Malamine, cedar model, light color Eucaplac.              We understand

t h a t the indication "totally laminated" does not include the other parts of

the furniture, since the base structure is clearly specified t o be "assembled

from industrial s t e e l tubing, welded and painted black."         a he desk i s

accompanied by a bookshelf and two chairs."

               In addition, during appraisal of the bids, the PIU required t h a t

samples be presented of completed models of each item of furniture, as s e t

forth i n the schedule of bases and conditions of tender, para. 3.3.5, with the

object of arriving a t a better definition of the final appraisal c r i t e r i a ,

particularly i n the case of t h i s bid of a desk which can be easily assembled

and disassembled, with a great saving of space i n storage and transportation.
