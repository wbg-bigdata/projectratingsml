PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA: FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1532-CR)
PREPACE
This report covers the Fifth Telecommunications Project In Costa
Rica supported by Loan 1532-CR. The loan for $10.6 million to Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) was approved in March 1978, became
effective in March 1979, and was closed in June 1984, two years after the
original closing date.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Industry
Department of the World Bank on the basis of information and data supplied
by ICE, information gathered b'- the Bank project completion mission which
visited Costa Rica in August 1984, and discussions with ICE and the
Government.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED has sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower for comments. However, no
comments have been received from them.

PROJECT COMPLSION REPORT
COSTA RICA: FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1532-CR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Fifth Telecommunications Project in Costa Rica comprised the
revised Stage V telecommunications development plan (1978-85) of Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), an autonomous Government-owned
corporation providing electric power and telecommunication services in
Costa Rica.
2.        It followed the Fourth Telecommunications Project (Loan 1006-CR)
and was a continuation of the expansion of the Costa Rican telecommunica-
tions system aimed at meeting part of the urgent demand for new telephone
and telegraph services in existing areas and extending services to new
areas. The objectives also included insitutional improvements within ICE
to improve productivity, maintain financial soundness and expand and
develop its training program. Both the physical and institutional
objectives were achieved (PCR nara 7.01).
3.        The project was completed in December 1984 1/ three years behind
the original schedule. During implementation, in 1987, the project scope
was enlarged with Bank agreement to increase the yearly rate of connecting
subscribers by about 35%. The expanded project scope and the delay in
project completion resulted in an increase of project eost by about 531
over the appraisal estimate. ICE implemented the project well, particular-
ly in light of the adverse changes in the economic environment in the
country during this period. ICE's technical capability has been further
strengthened as a result of the experience gained during implementation.
4.        During the project period, tariffs were increased four times (PCR
para 5.10). These were intended to offset the effects of devaluation and
inflation and permitted ICE to easily meet the covenanted 121 rate of
return on its revalued telecommunications assets. Despite the extremely
adverse economic conditions, the internal financial rate of return for the
1978-85 investment program was about 112 which compares reasonably well
with the appraisal estimate of 12%.
5.        Notable features of Costa I ca's telecoimunications system are
its high quality technical performance and. the reasonable number of stafi
required to operate and maintain the system (14 per 1,000 DELs).
6.        In conclusion, (para 9.01) the PCR notes that "ICE has attained a
certain degree of maturity as a well organized entity capable of planning,
implementing, and operating the national telecommunications system of Costa
Rica." This achievement is all the more commendable considering the
adverse economic conditions prevailing during the project period.
1/ Except for the rural component financed by IDB which is expected to be
completed by the end of 1985.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA: FIPTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1532-CR)
INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), an autonomous
Government-owned publlc corporation, provides all domestic and
international telephone services, In addition to electric power. Its fully
owned subsidiary, Radlografica Costarricense S.A. (RACSA) operates the
telex service and offers circuits for private rental. By a law of July 27,
1977 RACSA maintains its separate identity for ten more years.
Independently, the Junta Nacional de Communicaciones (JNC), a Government
agency operates the existing domestic public telegraph network. JNC uses
ICE's and RACSA's infrastructure for national and international public
telegraph services but pays for the usage adequately to cover the costs.
1.02      The Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) is Costa Rica's
principal regulatory authority. It has jurisdiction over the tariffs,
technical standards and finances of ICE's electric and telecommunications
operations as well as over all other entities providing public electric and
water/sewerage services. However, SNE does not have jurisdiction over
RACSA. The Government reviews SNE's decisions concerning tariff matters.
1.03      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications eector
in Costa Rica since 1963 through five loans: a first loan (346-CR effective
October 10, 1963) of $22 million was made for electric power and
telecommunications development; a second loan (632-CR, effective October
20, 1966) included $6.5 million for telecommunications development; a
third loan (801-CR, effective June 2, 1972) included $17.5 million for
telecommunications development; a fourth loan (1006-CR effective November
19, 1974) of $23.5 million was exclusively for telecommunications
development. All these projects have since b.en completed. A fifth loan
(1532-CR effective March 9, 1979) of $10.6 million to help finance ICE's
fifth development program has also been completed and is the subject of
this report.
II. PROJECT APPRAISAL AND CONTENTS
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      ICE had in 1973 prepared a telecommunication expansion program
for the 1974-80 period called Stage IV, the first part of which, Stage IVa
covering the period 1974-77, was financed by the loan for the fourth
telecommunications project and completed in December 1979. In 1977, ICE
revised and expanded the second part of the original program (Stage IVb) to
1981, renamed it Stage V expansion program and presented it to the Bank for
financing.1/ Bank appraisal took place in July/August 1977 with
negotlations for the loan in Washington in February 1978. The Bank's Board
1/  The project was further revised in 1982.  See para 3.02.



-2
of Directors approved the loan on March 14, 1978. The loan agreement was
signed on March 23, 1978.
Project Objectives
2.02      The project formed part of a long term plan and was a
continuation of the earlier Bank financed projects. The specific
objectives of the fifth telecommunication project were to:
(a) meet part of the anticipated demands for local, long
distance and international telephone services in San Jose
and some 80 other localities;
(b) increase penetration of telephone service in rural areas
by installing public call offices;
(c) replace the existing obsolete telegraph system and expand
the telex facilities;
(d) introduce, operate and maintain equipment with modern
technology such as electronic switching and data systems;
and
(e) further improve ICE's organization, improve productivity,
maintain its financial soundness, and expand and develop
its training program.
Project Description
2.03      At loan effectiveness the fifth project comprised the following
main items to be implemented from 1978-1982:
(a) expansion of the local telephone network capacity by
approximately 65,000 exchange lines from 135,800 lines to
199,340 lines, permitting connection of about 54,600
DELs;
(b) expansion of long distance facilities by provision of
microwave, PCM and carrier and cable systems and
additional multiplex equipment to provide about 1,600
additional long distance circuits in the national
telecommunications network, of which about 200 circuits
would be on new routes;
(c) installation of three new long distance exchanges and
expansion of the existing exchange to increase
terminations by about 2,100 from 4,400 to 6,500 to
accommodate the additional toll circuits;
(d) expansion of the rural telephone system including
corresponding cable and radio links for connection with
the national network to:



-3-
(1) about 500 rural communities through public call
office service;
(it) about 1,200 rural productive centers through radio
systems served by an operator;
(e) provision of public mobile telephone services to cover
the entire country and to connect 300 additional mobile
stations;
(f)   (i)  expansion of the telex exchange to Rrovide services
to about 450 new telex subscribera;1
(ii) replacement of the old telegraph network with a
combined telephone - gentex message service;
(g)  provision of additional circuits for international
telecommunication traffic through installation of either
an earth satellite station or submarine cable; and
(h) improvement and expansion of ICE's training programs.
Covenants
2.04      The Loan Agreement 1532-CR provided that the Borrower (ICE)
shall:3/
(a)   operate each of its Telecommunications and Power
Directorates separately, maintain separate records and
prepare separate financial statements (Section 5.01);
(b) have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal
year audited and furnish the auditor's report within four
months after the end of each fiscal year to the Bank
(Section 5.02);
(c) not incur for the Telecommunications Directorate any
long-term debt unless current net revenues cover maximum
future debt service requirements at least 1.5 times
(Section 5.04 (a));
(d) not sell any bonds subject to repurchase agreements if
the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 302 of the
aggregate principal amount of all bonds outstanding
(Section 5.04 (b));
2/ The total number of telex subscribers was estimated to increase from
517 at the end of 1976 to 1,300 by the end of 1981.
3/ Section numbers refer to the relevant sections of the Loan Agreement.



- 4 -
(e)  produce an annual rate of return of not less than 12% for
the Telecommunications Directorate (Section 5.05 (a));
(f)  not transfer funds to anything not directly related
power or telecommunications services (Section 5.06);
(g) revalue its fixed telecommunications assets annually
(Section 5.07);
(h) set adequate rates for telephone and telex service
provided to the Junta Nacional de Communicaciones
(Section 5.08 (a));
(i) properly allocate, starting in 1978, administrative costs
between the Power and Telecommunications Directorates and
between construction and operations (Section 5.08 (b)).
The Borrower complied with all of the above covenants.
2.05      The Guarantee Agreement for Loan 1532-CR provided that the
Guarantor shall:
(a) pay all outstanding telecommunications debts to the
Borrower within 90 days of billing (Section 3.03 (a));
(b) pay 65% of debts outstanding prior to the date of this
agreement (March 23, 1978) by December 31, 1978 and the
remainder by June 30, 1979 (Section 3.03 (b)); and
(c) make allocations in the FY 1979 budget sufficient to
ensure fulfillment of (b) (Section 3.03 (c)).
Although the Government did not meet the schedules as stipulated in the
Guarantee Agreement, the provisions of (b) and (c) above were subsequently
met during 1979 (para 3.01). With regard to (a), the Government is making
regular payments to cover the service received from the National
Telecommunications System (NTS) in addition to making occasional lump sum
payments to catch up with its arrears. Under the present difficult country
economic conditions, a better performance by Government is unlikely. The
Government represents only about 3% of NTS's total annual billings, so
elimination of Government arrears would have a negligible impact on the
financial position on NTS.
2.06      In a supplemental lettex, Government confirmed that in order to
provide prompt payment of Government telecommunications bills to ICE, the
annual national budgets will contain specific aypropriations sufficient for
this purpose. In order to ensure that these appropriations fully cover
amounts owed to ICE they would be reviewed from time to time during the
year and extraordinary budgets would be introduced to provide additional
funds if necessary.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      The initial effective date agreed during loan negotiations was
September 19, 1978. A condition of effectiveness was that Government
budgetary allocations for 1978 would be made to cover 65% of their
outstanding telecommunications debts to ICE as stated in the guarantee
agreement (Section 3.03). Ultimately the loan was declared effective from
March 9, 1979 after all conditions had been met. Despite this delay, ICE
made good progress with the engineering design and preparation of bid
documents and by April 1979, $5.4 million of the loan (of $10.6 million)
had been committed for telephone cables which was a main item for Bank
financing.
Project Revision
3.02      Due to fast increasing demand and a Government policy to meet
as much demand as possible, the Government's Stage V telecommunications
program was revised in 1979 to increase the yearly rate of connecting
subscribers by about 35% and extend the program to 1983. In May 1982,
agreement was reached finally between ICE and the Bank to amend the project
description accordingly. The main changes were:
(1) the expansion of the local telephone network capacity
from 65,000 to 98,700 lines;
(2) the increase of additional long distance circuits from
1,600 to 2,400 and;
(3)  the transfer of the proposed expansi %n of telex and
telegraph network from ICE to RACSA._/
In 1980, it was also decided to postpone the mobile telephone service
component, reduce the number of rural productive centers served by radio
systems from 1,200 to 800, and install an earth station for international
services (para 2.03 (g)). ICE at the same time undertook substantial
expansion of its vertical services covering PBXs, push button telephone
sets, etc., to meet the demand for these services at the subscriber's
premises.
Implementation Schedule
3.03      The project completion date was estimated at appraisal as
December 31, 1981. A revised schedule was drawn up in mid 1982 extending
4/ RACSA had in the meantime obtained a loan from EXIM Bank to carry out
the telex expansion and it was agreed to exclude it from the revised
Bank project.



-6-
the project completion date to June 30, 1983. The revised project (para
3.02) was completed by December 31, 1984, except for the rural component
financed by IDB which will be completed by the end of 1985. The original
closing date of June 30, 1982 was extended twice, to June 30, 1984 to meet
some outstanding disbursement requirements of the program.5/ The final
application for withdrawal was made in December, 1984 and the remaining
balance of the loan ($0.24 million) was canceled in February, 1985.
3.04      The main rePsons for the delay from the appraisal schedule and in
a few cases behind the revised schedule were:
(a) the initial eight months delay in the Bank Loan
effectiveness because the Government was slow in meeting
its obligations to settle its arrears (para 3.01);
(b)  the expanded investment program and project (para 3.u2);
(c) Government's annulment of bid award for the stored
program control (SPC) exchanges (para 3.06); and
(d) the difflcult economic conditions resulting in the sharp
devaluation of the currency and high domestic inflation
(para 5.01).
Procurement
3.05      The management of ICE had taken special efforts to keep updated
on Bank procedures relating to procurement, and sent a delegation to the
Bank in Washington in April 1979 for this purpose. Procurement of the
items to be financed from the loan was done in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines and presented no difficulties. It was anticipated at appraisal
that about $3.4 million of goods covering cables and accessories, poles and
PVC ducts were likely to be offered under ICB to manufacturers in the
Central American common market, including Costa Rica for whom a 15%
preference was provided. The total amount of goods purchased from Costa
Rica and El Salvador was about $3.0 million and $3.8 million respectively.
The increase is mainly due to rhe expanded local network provided in the
revision of the original project.
3.06      The procurement of SPC telephone switching equipment which was
cofinanced by suppliers' credits presented some proDlems. ICE's initial
award resulted in cancellation of the original bid by the National
Comptroller's office due to legal action introduced by one bidder. Fresh
offers were called for and negotiated, resulting in delay and higher
prices. ICE also had to develop an emergency plan and make arrangements
for some extensions to existing electromechanical equipment to meet the
pressing demand.
5/ The project implementation period covers 1978-84 and the program
implementation period covers the additional year to the end of 1985.

Cofinancing Arrangements
3.07      The financing plan for the foreign costs at appraisal and the
actual flnancing provided to the revised program is indicated below:
Source                       Foreign cost support

TOTAL          54.3          85.3
Bank & IDB support remained at about the anticipated levels, while
suppliers' credit increased substantially (over 1OOZ). Kuch of this was
required for the increased telephone switching equipment and the earth
station for international services. In addition, CABEI supported the
revised program and ICE itself did not find it necessary to contribute any
foreign costs.
Project Cost
3.08      The cost of the revised project, which coincides with ICE's
program for the period 1978-856/ is given in Annex 1 and sumarized
below.  In view of the substantial devaluation that took place from 1981
onwards, a comparison with the appraisal cost estimates in colones will be
particularly distorted. Hence the comparison has been made in equivalent
dollars.
6/ The Bank-financed components of the project were couplete as of
December 31, 1984. The remaining costs for the rural component
financed by IDB were incurred in 1985 (para 3.04).

rate during execution. The main reasons for this cost increase were: (a)
that devaluation lagged behind domestic inflation (which totaled 500% from
1977 to 1984);7/ and (b) the expanded project scope and extended project
period. In addition, engineering and administration overhead and interest
during construction increased substantially. This reflected: (a) the
extended program period; and (b) the introduction of a new procedure for
allocation of engineering and administrative overhead which increased the
distribution of costs to this category.
3.10      Foreign Cost Increase.  The foreign cost increase of about $31.0
million (57%) was mainly due to the increase in the project scope.
Increases occurred in local telephone network due to the increased exchange
capacity and the higher cost of procurement of SPC switching equipment and
extensions on electromechanical equipment resulting from the delay in the
SPC tenders (para 3.07). The cost of both domestic and foreign
transmission systems increased due to the increase in capacity of circuit
provision by about 34% and the establishment of a satellite earth station
(para 3.02). Additional expenditure was incurred of about $3.1 million for
the provision of "vertical' services, i.e., additional subscriber services
such as PBX or touch tone telephones, which were not included or identified
separately during appraisal but were assumed to form a small part of the
local network. Some cost savings however were achieved since the original
allocation included costs for telegraph, telex, mobile telephones,
training, and consultants.
3.11      Ongoing works, financed by IBRD loans 801-CR and 1006-CR, only
required 3% of available funds of the program, compared to 19% at
appraisal. However, capitalized interest charges increased from 4% at
appraisal to 10%.
Disbursements
3.12      Estimated and actual disbursements of the Bank's loan are shown
below:
7/ Domestic inflation rates increased from about 4% in 1977 to 90% in
1982. For the first half of 1984 the annual rate "s estimated to be
38%.

Loan Allocation
3.13      As a result of the substantial change in the project it was
necessary to undertake reallocation of loan proceeds. The Bank accepted
(by its letter of April 19, 1982) ICE's request for reallocation along with
amendments to the project description in Schedule 2 (para 3.02). Major
changes were the increases 1a allocation for the expanded local telephone
systems (mainly for the external plant network), and transmission equipment
(mainly for multiplex and PCM equipment for interurban routes), and the
deletion of the allocation for telex which was undertaken by RACSA (para
3.02). The final allocation corresponds closely to the revised
allocation. The original, revised, and ftaal allocations of the loan
proceeds are as follows:

outstanding balance, ($0.24 million) was canceled, in February 1985.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.14      ICE is fully satisfied with the quality and performance of the
equipment supplied under the project. The equipment and materials were
supplied in accordance with the specifications reviewed by the Bank and the
performance met with specified requirements. There were nc Bank-financed
consultants employed during this project. ICE has been periodically
utilizing the services of some individual experts to assist in such areas
as rural telephony and digital switching. Prior to the commencement of
this project, ICE had, with consultants' assistance, developed its
engineering and traffic forecasting to improve its planning organization.
Consequently the fifth program, which the project covers, is more
balanced. The performance of contractors and suppliers was generally
satisfactory. ICE has good technical personnel who carried out the
detailed engineering and prepared the technical specifications, bid
documents, and evaluation. ICE also carried out most of the external plant
installations including those for the cable network along with some outside
help in rural areas. Installation for the electronic exchanges was carried
out by the contractors since it was a new technology. ICE submitted
regular and comprehensive six-monthly progress reports on the project to
the Bank.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      At the time of appraisal, ICE was expected to increase the
capacity of main exchanges from 111,140 lines at the end of 1976 to about
219,000 lines by the end of 1982, and the number of subscribers connected
were expected to increase from about 87,000 to about 170,000 with average
growth rates of about 12% per annum. The annual growth in demand was
expected to be 11% for DELs, 14% for long distance traffic, 13.5% for



- 12 -
international traffic, and 17% for telex-gentex subscribers. By
December 31, 1983, ICE had increased the capacity for automatic exchanges
to about 213,000 lines and the number of subscribers had increased to
179,000 averaging growth rates of 10% and 11% per annum respectively. The
increase in domestic long distance telephone traffic was 12%, slightly
lower than the projected 14% per annum. International tele,?hone traffic
increased at an average rate of about 10% per annum. ICE maintained a
reasonably good quality in both domestic and international services.
V. FINAN7CIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01      The project implementation period coincided with a very dixiicult
adjustment period for the Costa Rican economy as a whole. By 1981, Costa
Rica had the highest per capita indebtedness in the world. The
deteriorating economic climate led to successive sharp devaluations of the
national currency, from C 8.60 per dollar in 1980 to C 45.00 in 1984.
Domestic inflation was severe; the consumer price index rose from 100 in
1980 to 378 in 1984. Viewed against this background, the financial
performance of ICE's NTS was excellent.
Accounts
5.02      ICE is an autonomous corporation.  Throughout the project period,
ICE has maintained separate accounts and prepared separate financial
statements for its National Telecommunications System (NTS) and its
National Electric System (NES). The accounts are reasonably well kept, in
accordance with accepted commercial accounting practice. However, further
improvements need to be made, particularly in the allocation of overhead
charges between NTS and NES and in determining transfers from NTS to NES
(para 5.12).
External Audits
5.03      ICE's financial statements were audited annually, The auditors'
reports were usually submitted about five months after the end of each
fiscal year, which is broadly in compliance with the Loan Agreement. The
external auditors were Victor Munoz Associados. The quality of the external
audits was generally satisfactory. The unustlal treatment of part of the
revaluation increase of long-term debt 1982§.' was pointed out in September,
and was corrected.
8, Under Costa Rican law, deferred charges due to foreign exchange losses
need not be shown in the balance sheet and the corresponding increase
in long term debt may be left out of the balance sheet.

5.05      The financial performance of NTS has been satisfactory.  The rate
of return on the current value of average net flxed assets in operation was
in each year comfortably in excess of 12% as covenanted, except in 1983,
when the rate of return dipped slightly below this level to 11.6%. In
general, NTS was successful in obtaining timely tariff increases to offset
rapid inflation and currency devaluation (para 5.01). The Increases in
traffic and tariffs (para 5.10) resulted in operating revenues per DJL
increasing by about 30% per annum over the period 1978-83; this offsets
almost precisely the increase in operating expenses during the same period
(31% per annum).
5.06      The forecast versus actual financing plan for the project -
implementation period9/ is summarized below:

generation financed 56% of total applications as compared to 58% forecast,
and borrowings 44% versus 42% forecast. This is quite close to the
original estimates, despite the enormous changes brought about by the
economic situation of the country.
5.07      Bond issues financed only a negligible portion of the investment
program (0.2% of total sources). The percentage of bonds subject to
repurchase agreements stayed well within the covenanted 30% of the
aggregate principal amount of all bonds outstanding and was 9% as of
December 31, 1983. The remaining funds were provided by the Bank (5%
instead of 10% expected at appraisal), IDB (5%), and CABEI (3%). In
addition, commercial banks provided 17% of funds (0% expected at
appraisal) and suppliers' credits 14% (19% expected at appraisal).
5.08      In retrospect it is not possible to clearly separate ICE's fifth
program from the future program. Consequently, the funds required for
fifth program construction (112% of total applications) may be compared to
the 68% originally estimated for the fifth program and the future program
combined. The large increase reflects higher local and foreign C;osts due
to the expansion in project scope, domestic inflation and devaluation
(paras 3.09 and 3.10).  Ongoing works, financed by TERD loans 801 and 1006,
only required 3% of funds, and capitalized interest charges required 10% of
total funds available (para 3.11).
Assets Revaluation
5.09      ICE has revalued its telecommunications fixed assets annually
based on currency devaluation and inflation rates. The methods used were
satisfactory. The gross value of fixed assets per DEL installed capacity
was $1,370 equivalent as of the end of 1983 which is in line with current
prices for switching and associated equipment in Costa Rica.
Tariffs
5.10      NTS obtained permission for frequent tariff increases during the
project period. These increases were intended to offset the effects of
devaluation and inflation and enable NTS to transfer funds to NES without
adversely affecting its own financial performance and position. Costa
Rican authorities found it far easier to increase telecommunications
tariffs than to increase electricity tariffs. During the project period,
tariffs were increased four times as follows:



-17 -
Initial
Increase     Elasticity
January 1981            30.8%         -5.5%
July 1981               20.7%          0.0%
November 1982           61.8%         -3.2%
January 1984            98.4%        -17.9%
In all cases, the initial elasticity of demand (as measured in the San Jose
area) disappeared after a few months and telephone usage resumed at
previous or higher levels.
5.11      International tariffs are fixed in dollars and thus increase
automatically with the devaluation of the colon. In 1982, the Regulatory
Commission gave NTS permission to increase domestic tariffs automatically
in direct proportion to the charge in the interbank exchange rate of the
colon against the dollar and to submit further tariff increase proposals in
the first quarter of 1983. The resulting tariff increase occurred in
January 1984.
Debt Limitation
5.12      Annual debt service coverage ratios averaged about 2.2 during the
period 1978-80. Due to the rapid devaluation of the Colon, debt service
coverage was sharply lower in the years thereafter (para 5.04). For 1981
and 1982 the debt limitation covenant (para 2.08 (c)) was not met. Strict
adherence to this requirement was in fact waived by the Bank in order to
enable NTS to incur the limited additional borrowings necessary for
completion of the project. This waiver acknowledged the special
circumstances faced by the Borrower, which were beyond its control, and the
limits to tariff action. In the context of Costa Rica's general debt
rescheduling in 1982, ICE's debts to commercial banks were also
rescheduled. For this portion of its debt, an additional grace period of
three years was obtained, followed by a repayment period of 3-1/2 - 4-1/2
years. Interest rates were raised substantially, to LIBOR + 3-1/4%.
Transfers to NES
5.13      Transfers have been made from NTS to NES starting in 1981.  The
accounting system does not enable the precise determination of the
magnitude of the annual transfers. ICE management believes it to be
currently in the order of $5 million to $6 million per year, but this
figure cannot be verified because 'cash and banks" are pooled and are
treated as the residual item when preparing the financial statements of NTS
and NES. To some extent this undermines the purpose of having separate
accounts and financial statements. Therefore, corrections should be made.



-18-
Even if these amounts could be traced through the accounts, the formula
presently used for overhead allocation ensures that the profits of NTS (and
thus the transfers to NES) are understated (para 5.14). In addition, this
cross-subsidization policy sends the wrong signal to power consumers,
although it does not appear to supress demand for telecommunications (pars
5.10). However, Government presently allows NTS to expand by only 4% per
year (in terms of DELs), whereas NES is allowed to expand by 7% per year
(MWh). Unless power tariffs are adjusted, these transfers will place
increasing financial strain on NTS and cause economic distortions.
Overhead Allocation
5.14      The Loan Agreement required that ICE allocate administrative
costs between the electricity and telecommunications departments and
between construction and operations, using methods of allocation acceptable
to the Bank. The distribution key used for allocating overhead charges
between NTS and NES is presently 47/53. This ratio has been used for
several years and should be revised because it does not reflect the
dominance of NES within ICE. Allocation of overhead charges should not be
based on a rough rule of thumb but on a weighted formula reflecting such
components as gross fixed assets, the number of staff, the number of
subscribers, operating revenues, etc.
Accounts Receivable
5.15      As of the end of 1983, net accounts receivable were equivalent to
1.6 months of billing, which is satisfactory. However, accounts receivable
from Government were equivalent to 10 months' of billing in 1983 and
increased to about 12 months equivalent by the end of 1984. Since billing
to Government represents only 3% of gross revenues, these arrears do not
represent a cash flow problem for NTS and their elimination would have only
a modest impact on the financial position of NTS. In strictly legal terms,
however, Government failed to meet the covenants of the Guarantee Agreement
(para 2.05), despite considerable efforts to catch up with arrears and stay
current on present bills. This situation should improve when the general
economy improves.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01      ICE is administered by a seven member Board of Directors which
appoints ICE's General Manager, three Deputy Managers (for power,
telecommunications and administrative services), the treasurer and the
internal Audftor. Since reorganization in 1977, the telecommunications
directorate, which has four divisions covering construction, operations,
engineering, and international telephone services has been functioning
effectively. The reorganization of the old administrative and finance
directorate into three separate department areas (administration, finance



- 19 -
and personnel) has also brought about improvements.  The deputy manager of
telecommunications oversees RACSA, resulting in better coordination between
the services. There has been continuity in the top management of
telecommunications headed by the Deputy Manager, and this has been a
siginificant factor in effective implementation.
6.02      There has been improvement in the engineering organization with
better traffic forecasting and detailed engineering which has supported the
fifth project in its concept and execution. The conscious effort
to improve and expand the telecommunications facilities for rural areas
has contributed towards better control and implementation of the rural
links and improved operation and performance.
Staffing, Recruitment, and Training
6.03      The telecommunications staff, which was about 1,900 at the end of
1976, or about 16 persons per 1,000 DELs, reached a total of about 2,755 by
1983 with a ratio of 14 persons per 1,000 DELs. This improvement has been
brought about by a conscious effort to improve productivity and control
personnel costs.
6.04      ICE's senior engineering and financial staff is generally
competent and has satisfactory experience in good management of the
enterprise. A comprehensive training program is in place for technical and
administrative personnel. The Bank has supported this program by financing
part of the training facilities. A specialized department located in San
Jose meets ICE's in-house training needs covering all aspects of ICE's
activity. The program is complemented by other technical schools in Costa
Rica, and the universities. ICE has used training provided by suppliers,
particularly on new equipment and has organized seminars on
telecommunications and associated topics, often jointly with other Central
American countries. ICE has also been able to second some of its technical
staff to assist other Central American countries and to work in the
regional telecommunications commission, CONTELCA.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievement
7.01      The project generally achieved the physical growth targets for
DELs and telephones envisaged at appraisal. Annex 5 presents a comparison
of the performance indicators projected at appraisal and the actual
achievements to the end of 1983. This achievement, in spite of the
difficult financial situation experienced by the country during this
period, is commendable. ICE's technical capability has been further
strengthened as a result of the experience gained during project planning,
execution and subsequent operations.



- 20 -
Project Spin-off
7.02      The uain spin-off from the project for the manufacturing sector
was the support it gave to the cable industry in Costa Rica and El
Salvador. As noted in paragraph 3.05, S6.8 million of cables/accessories
and overhead line material were procured from the local Industry in these
two countries.
Least Cost Solution
7.03      The studies relating to the fifth project were based on planning
and engineering for the least cost solution, while at the same time
following a long term plan for expansion of the national network. I its
execution, ICE made adjustments in the service area of exchanges and
corresponding networks to respond to actual demand. Some adjustments were
also made in the dimensioning of the long distance network to accommodate
unexpected demand.
Rate of Return
7.04      The internal financial rate of return for the 1978-85 investment
program is estimated at 11% as outlined in Annex 6. This rate is close to
the appraisal estimate of 12%. The economic rate of return should be much
higher, because it would also include:
(a) increcental revenues beyond 1983 due to utilization of spare
capacity made possible under the project;
(b) indirect external benefits to other sectors such as
transport, agriculture public servlces, etc., from improved
and expanded telecommunications; and
(c) consumer surplus, especially given the long waiting list.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall and Specific Performance
8.01      The overall Bank performance on this project has been good.  In
particular, the Bank dealt firmly with the settlement of arrears prior to
declaring the loan effective (para 3.01). The Bank also processed bid
documents promptly. When project revision was necessary and justified, the
Bank reacted positively and agreed to reallocation of loan proceeds (para
3.13).
Supervision
8.02      The Bank's supervisory effort was adequate.  There was a certain
lack of continuity due to staff changes, but this did not affect overall



- 21 -
project supervision. ICE submitted regularly comprehensive quarterly and
special six monthly reports covering its activities and project progress,
which aided the Bank in project monitoring.
Working Relationship
8.03      The working relationship between Government and the Bank has been
very good.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      With the completion of the fifth project, ICE has attained a
certain degree of maturity as a well-organized entity capable of planning,
implementing, and operating the national telecommunications system of Costa
Rica. ICE has also maintained a healthy financial position while achieving
regional balance in the provision of telecommunications facilities and an
increase in overall telephone density from 7.9 per 100 inhabitants in 1978
to 11.1 by 1983. ICE's achievement in all the more commendable considering
the constraints placed on it by adverse extraneous circumstances. With
respect to future planning and investment, ICE will have to explore and
keep up with the increasing demands for "vertical" services at the
subscribers' premises, data systems and the integration of networks brought
about by the merging of the telecommunications and computers systems with
the advent of digital technology.

Return on Investment
Benefit period
The benefit period of the program extends from 1979 to 2001 when on
average the equipment provided under the projects is expected to have
completed its useful life.
Net Benefits
Construction costsl/ were obtained from ICE's records excluding
capitalized interest. Incremental revenues and operating costs net of
depreciation and interest attributed to the program were based on actual
financial results. All values were expressed in 1978 prices to reflect the
one year delay in implementation of the project (para 3.01). A summary of
the costs and benefits stream is given below:

The internal financial rate of return is estimated at 11%.
1/ The rate of return calculations are based on the construction costs for
the 1979-85 time slice of the Fifth Program. The figure for 1985 shows
only capital costs less interest for the Bank project cost streams
(Annex 1). In the absence of data, it is also assumed that revenues and
costs for 1984 are duplicated in 1985.
