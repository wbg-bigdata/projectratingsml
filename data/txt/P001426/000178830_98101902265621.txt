FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OF THE BANK AND TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
CORPORATION ON A PROPOSED LOAN BY THE BANK TO
THE LIBERIAN BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT (LBDI)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
AND AN INVESTMENT BY THE CORPORATION IN LBDI
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
third loan to the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI), with
the guarantee of the Republic of Liberia, for the equivalent of US$7 million
to help finance productive sub-projects and to support a technical assistance
program for LBDI and the proposed exercise of subscription rights by IFC to
a number of shares of $10 par value each up to a total cost of US$306,300.
Amortization of the loan would conform substantially to the aggregate of:
(a) the amortization schedules i.pplicable to the specific investment projects
financed out of the proceeds of the loan, with a maximum period of 15 years
from the approval or authorization of the last investment project, and
(b) the amortization over 15 years including 2-1/2 years of grace of the
technical assistance part of the loan (US$150,000). The interest rate would
be 8.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.   Its report
"Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 462a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors. An updating
report entitled "Liberia: Economic Memorandum" (No. 873-LBR dated September 15,
1975) has also been distributed subsequently. Country data sheets are contained
in Annex I.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings, and contribute a sizeable share of govern-
ment revenues and wage employment. Iron ore mining is by far the largest
single activity in the enclave sector, accounting for about 34 percent of
gross domestic product at factor cost. There are only limited linkages
between the enclaves and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits
of economic growth have been unevenly distributed. Annual repatriation by
foreigners of profits and savings is equivalent to about 20 percent of gross
domestic product.
4.        At the other extreme, traditional agriculture has minimal inter-
action with the monetized economy; however, it supports the majority of
the population -- perhaps as much as 70 percent. About 4 percent of Liberians
have per capitaincome levels above US$3,000,while the majority live at near
subsistence level with income of about US$100 per annum. To help redress this
imbalance the Government is trying to increase its earnings from the conces-
sions and use the resources to diversify the economy with increased partici-
pation by Liberians.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



-2-
Development Plan
5.        In order to achieve these objectives the Government has prepared
a four-year Development Plan covering the period July 1, 1976 to June 30,
1980. The Plan was prepared by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID>.and the Government (Reference President's
Memorandum to the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The
Plan identifies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic
development as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sus-
tainable socio-economic activities throughout the country; (c) greater
involvement of Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distri-
bution of the benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable
standard of living for the people throughout the country. The average
annual growth of real GDP during the plan period is envisaged at around 6.8
percent. The total development expenditure is projected at US$415 million
of which US$251 million is foreign financing and US$164 million domestic
financing. Disbursements and firm comaitments account for almost 60 percent
of the expected foreign financing.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to agriculture as the
cornerstone of the Government's diversification strategy. The objective
is to diversify and modernize agricultural production, increase productivity,
improve associated rural economic activities such as marketing and processing,
and provide social and physical infrastructure to improve the quality of life
in the rural areas where most Liberians live.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries, was
hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong world
demand for Liberia's major export, iron, brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export commodities
-- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP -- which averaged
about 5.5 percent a year in the 1965-1970 period dropped to less than 3
percent in 1975.
8.        However, because of good fiscal management, government finances
did not come under pressure. In 1974, revenues grew by 20 percent and,
despite increased government spending, an overall budgetary surplus of US$15
million was realized. In 1975, revenues increased by 10 percent over 1974
and recurring expenditures by 12.5 percent, the latter largely reflecting
the effects of imported inflation on public expenditure. The following
factors enabled the Government to manage its finances despite a deceleration
of the economy: (a) the renegotiation of concession agreements that improved
Liberia's share of the profits; (b) a further increase in the new contract
prices for iron ore (in 1975 prices were on the average 55 percent higher
than 1974); and (c) higher maritime revenues from vessel registration under
the Liberian flag of convenience.



-3-
Balance of Payments
9.        Since Liberia uses US dollars as the medium of exchange, balance
of payments analyses are at best tenuous. In the 1964-1972 period in terms
of value, exports grew 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent annually.
Thereafter, from 1972-1974, following accelerated international inflation,
imports rose by 29 percent annually, exceeding the 22 percent annual export
growth. Oil imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million
in 1974, and US$47 million in 1975. Nevertheless, Liberia achieved a trade
surplus of US$96 million in 1974 and ahout US$75 million in 1975. During
1975, Liberia received aid commitments of US$80 million; US$62 million in
loans and about US$18 million in grants. The World Bank was the largest
donor and the United States the second largest. The other donors were the
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and the African Development Bank (ADB).
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was
estimated at about US$168 million as of December 31, 1975. The debt service
ratio is estimated at 4.8 percent in 1975, as compared to 5.3 percent in
1974 and 7.2 percent in 1972. The ratio is projected to fall further in the
next few years as the final portions of the heavy debt incurred in the early
1960s are paid off. The Bank Group share of public debt outstanding and
disbursed is presently about 15 percent and is projected to increase to about
30 percent by 1980; as a proportion of public debt servicing liability, the
Bank Group share is projected to increase from its present level of about
12 percent to about 35 percent in 1980. Even with an expanded public borrowing
program, Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is expected to remain
relatively modest unless there is an unexpected deterioration in external
conditions. We do not at the present time foresee debt servicing problems,
but it should be remembered that Liberia's exports are highly concentrated
in a few commodities (mainly iron ore and rubber) with notoriously unstable
world market prices. However, given the country's satisfactory performance
in economic management and its modest debt service ratio, Liberia should be
regarded as creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 12 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$64.2 million; there have been 4 IDA credits
totalling US$17 million, and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000 for
development planning. IFC has made one equity investment of US$248,490 in
the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI).
The Bank loans have been for roads, port expansion, power and LBDI; IDA
credits have been for education and agriculture. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of July 31, 1976,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:   (a) to help increase
the absorptive capacity of the economy and enable Liberians to take greater
initiative in developing their own resources for the benefit of their own



- 4 -
people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader sharing
of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in broad-
ening the economic base; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing
development resources from other external agencies.
13.       The proposed project would assist in the diversification of the
economy by helping LBDI meet the foreign costs of its investments during
the three-year period of FY77-79. It would also provide assistance for
training LBDI's Liberian staff and for further strengthening LBDI's project
appraisal and supervision capacity. In line with the priorities establi-
shed in the Government's recently published four-year development plan,
the Bank Group plans to give increasing emphasis in its lending program
over the next few years to the agricultural sector. An agricultural
development project, which will be co-financed with USAID, is being
appraised and is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors in the
next few months. The project is designed to rehabilitate and develop about
30,000 acres of farm land to improve production of swamp and upland rice,
cocoa and coffee in Bong County; it would substantially raise the income
of about 10,000 small farm families. A project is being prepared for plant-
ing of 42,000 acres and rehabilitation of 18,000 acres of rubber trees, which
will benefit about 2,900 families: a]so under preparation is a forestry
development project which would initiate a pulpwood plantation program,
and help establish a Forest Development Authority.
14.       In the social sectors, a third education project is being appraised
which may include vocational training, science and technology, education, and
education management. Also being considered is a project for the exten-
sion of the Monrovia water supply system.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL, AGRICULTURAL AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
The Industrial Sector
15.       Manufacturing is a small part of the Liberian economy,accounting
for about 5 percent of GDP. The domestic market is small and industries
so far have been limited largely to import substitution such as petroleum
refining, cement, food and beverages, construction materials, clothing,and
and furniture. Real growth in the sector averaged 10 percent per annum
from 1964 to 1972. The bulk of the output of the sector is sold domestically;
exports of manufactured goods account for a small proportion of output,
although processed fish and wood products are increasingly important exports.
Ownership is largely foreign, although there is a small but active group of
Liberian entrepreneurs engaged in a number of agri-business, manufacturing
and service industries.
16.       In the recently approved National Development Plan covering the
period 1976 to 1980, the Government indicates that priority within the
industrial sector will be given to an increase in the processing of local raw
materials such as timber, rubber and agricultural products. The Government
also plans to encourage production and assembly industries especially for export.



- 5 -
As part of the Government's strategy to promote export oriented processing
and assembly in Liberia, it plans to establish an industrial free zone which
would offer exporters exemption from import duties and taxes. The Government
supports private investment through a liberal incentives policy and its
traditional "open door policy" which allows unrestricted capital flows. Incent-
ives are granted either under the Incentive Code or -- in the case of iron ore,
rubber and forestry concessions -- through concession agreements. The incentives
to encourage private investment include the following features: (1) up to
90 percent exemption from import duty and equipment and inputs; (2) full income
tax exemption on reinvested profits and 50 percent exemption on other taxes;
(3) special tariff protection (ranging from 5 to 25 percent in addition to normal
tariffs described in paragraph 17 below); (4) loss carry forward; and (5) accele-
rated depreciation. The Government's primary instrument for promoting industrial
projects is the Liberian Development Corporation (LDC). Set up in 1961 as an
autonomous public corporation, LDC has responsibility for identifying,promoting
and establishing viable business enterprises in Liberia. However, due to
financial and staff constraints LDC's effectiveness has been rather limited.
17.       A 1973 Bank study concluded that the effective tariff protection
of industries in Liberia was high with large variations among individual
industries. Tariffs have since been revised and fall into the following
categories: 75 percent on luxury goods, 40 percent on other consumer goods,
11 percent on raw materials and 5 percent on capital goods. All new indus-
tries must obtain a license from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and
Transportation. The licensing decision takes into account existing capacity
in the particular industry. To avoid inefficient and high cost production
as a result of the combination of licensing and tariff protection, the
Government controls prices of products receiving beneffts from investment
incentives.
Small-Scale Industries
18.       Predominant activities among small scale entrepreneurs are
carpentry, jewelrv, tailoring and cement block making. Small-scale indus-
tries have, however, received little government support and there is a
lack of effective government sponsored programs offering managerial and
technical assistance. LBDI has recently created a special unit to provide
training assistance in accounting and business management for its small
borrowers but more general programs are needed. The Government is aware
of this need and during negotiations indicated that it would welcome dis-
cussions with the Bank with respect to the possibility of initiating a study
for establishing a credit guarantee and/or technical assistance scheme for
small-scale enterprises.
The Agricultural Sector
19.       Agriculture, including rubber, forestry and fishing, contributed
16 percent of GDP and 23 percent of exports in 1974; it sustains the live-
lihood of about three-quarters of the population. The sector consists of:
(1) foreign-owned rubber and timber concessions which are highly productive;



(2) Liberian-owned commercial firms which have entered into rubber and oil
palm production as a result of the demonstration effect; and (3) traditional
farmers who account for 90 percent of agricultural holdings in Liberia. The
traditional sector remains largely outside the monetized economy and produces
mostly subsistence crops such as rice and cassava and some cash crops such
as coffeee, cocoa and sugar cane. The Government has recently initiated
programs to improve the productivity of the sector as well as to increase
incomes in the rural areas. The Upper Lofa County Agricultural Development
Project, co-sponsored by IDA and USAID, is one of the first of such projects,
uneer the above program.
20.       Liberia does not have an institutional source of credit designed to
assist small farmers. The Government-owned Agricultural Credit Corporation,
established in 1957, ceased operations in 1963 due to heavy financial losses.
Since then, limited credit facilities have been offered through the Credit
Division in the Agricultural Ministry, the cooperatives and credit unions.
LBDI's financial support has largely been directed towards commercial farmers
although small farmers have received financing provided they were able to
meet LBDI's security requirements. The Lofa County project includes a
revolving credit fund to be administered by LBDI in conjunction with local
cooperatives. LBDI will also offer general banking services in the area.
However, recognizing the need for continued agricultural credit facilities,
the Government is considering the possibility of establishing an agricultural
credit institution which will primarily lend through cooperatives to small
farmers who are without adequate security and need supervised credit. On the
other hand, LBDI will continue to finance commercial farms and forestry
projects.
The Financial Sector
21.       Given Liberia's use of the US dollars as currency and its relatively
open economy, many financial transactions fall outside the domestic financial
system. The major rubber, mining and timber concessions as well as the large
domestic enterprises can deal directly with banking institutions in Europe
and the United States. As a result, the development of a domestic financial
system has been limited to essentially LBDI and the commercial banks. Out-
standing commercial bank credit totalled US$79 million as of November 1975.
Of this amount, 59 percent was for the trade sector and 19 percent for
agriculture, while manufacturing accounted for only 1.2 percent. Commercial
bank lending rates depend largely on perceived risk and range from 12 percent
to 16 percent for corporate clients and up to 24 percent on personal loans.
Past investment needs have largely been met from foreign sources but, as
Liberia attempts to reduce its dependency on the enclave sectors, domestic
resource mobilization will have increased importance.
22.       In 1972, a Banking Commission, with IMF assistance, studied the
financial system; the Government has begun to take action on its recom-
mendations. As a result the National Bank of Liberia was created as a
central bank with responsibility for overall banking supervision, clearing



- 7 -
house operations, credit to the Government and banks, and the supply of
currency. A review of the interest rate structure in Liberia is also
underway. At present, minimum interest rates have been fixed at 5 percent
on savings deposits and 6-1/2 percent on time deposits. The ceiling on
lending rates is set at 25 percent by the Usury Law.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment" No. 1155-LBR, dated August 6, 1976) is being distributed
separately. The project was appraised in February 1976. A loan and project
summary is attached as Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C.
from July 1 to July 7, 1976. Mr, George Cooper, the financial counselor,
Embassy of Liberia, and Mr. Elias Saleeby, President of LBDI, represented the
Guarantor and the Borrower, respectively, in the negotiations.
24.       LBDI has received two Bank loans totalling US$5 million.    The
progress in making subloans for productive investments has been satisfactory
with both loans. The first loan has been fully committed; the second loan
is expected to be fully committed before the end. of 1976. The proposed
third loan will-help LBDI finance the foreign costs of its investments during
the period 1977 to mid-1979 in productive enterprises in manufacturing,
agriculture, transportations, tourism and services. Continued Bank support
is particularly important since LBDI remains the primary source of develop-
ment financing in Liberia, especially for Liberian entrepreneurs. The project
also provides for technical assistance to strengthen the institution's
operational capability.
LBDI - The Borrower
25.       Established in 1965 with the help of IFC, LBDI has an authorized
and fully paid-in share capital of US$1 million. Class 'A' shares (51
percent) are restricted to the Government, Liberian citizens and corporations,
and international institutions and must always outnumber Class"'B' shares.
The Government and IFC hold 25 percent each, and private Liberian investors
hold 1 percent of the share capital. Class 'B' shares are held by various
financial institutions, the Firestone Plantation Company and two mining
companies; they account for the balance of 49 percent.
26.       LBDI is the main institution providing medium and long-term
finance for productive enterprises in Liberia. In addition to granting
medium and long-term loans, making equity investments, and providing guarantees,
LBDI encourages and facilitates the participation of other sources of capital
in the enterprises it finances.
27.       IFC has invested considerable effort in recent years in assisting
LBDI through a representative on LBDI's Board. IFC's representative has
played an active role in providing technical assistance and advising manage-
ment in the development of LBDI's policies and operations.



-8-
Management and Organization
28.       LBDI has a Board of eight members:   three representing Liberian
interests, one representing IFC and four representing Class 'B' shareholders.
The Chairman of the Board is the Minister of Finance. Loans and investments
exceeding US$150,000 must be approved by the Board. Loans and investments
of less than US$150,000 are approved by an Executive Committee consisting
of the Minister of Finance, as ex-officio member, and two members representing
each class of shareholders. LBDI's President, who chairs the Committee, is
a non-voting member. The Committee meets more frequently than the full Board
and discusses all matters prior to Board presentation. The President of
LBDI is authorized to approve investments of up to US$25,000 with a global
limit of 10 percent of LBDI's aggregate approvals each year.
29.       In September 1973, Mr. Elias Saleeby, a Liberian previously employed
in the Bank's DFC Department, took over as President of LBDI. He has proven
to be effective in improving internal procedures as well as in taking new
initiatives for the company. He is assisted by a well-qualified expatriate
General Manager who has been with the institution since 1970. The General
Manager's contract expired in May 1976, but he has agreed to stay on until
a suitable Liberian replacement is appointed.
30.       LBDI has a total professional staff of 16, 12 of whom are Liberian
while the remaining 4 are Peace Corps volunteers. A program of staff
development and training for the next three to four-year period is under
preparation by LBDI. A technical assistance component of US$150,000 is
included in the proposed loan to help finance the foreign cost of the
training program which will help upgrade the quality of its existing Liberian
staff. The company's basic organization comprises two departments --
Projects and Comptrollers. Projects Department has improved considerably
in recent years while efforts are presently being made to strengthen its
supervision capacity.
Policies
31.       LBDI follows sound investment policies.   Its current operating
policies, contained in its Policy Statement as of March 31, 1976, set
financing limits which restrict its exposure in any single enterprise to
30 percent of LBDI's net worth plus 5 percent of its subordinated debt. Its
total equity investments are limited to its net worth and individual equity
investments are not to exceed 10 percent of LBDI's net worth. Combined
loan and equity investments in a single enterprise would normally not exceed
50 percent of the enterprise's total assets and LBDI's equity investment
would normally not exceed 25 percent of the enterprise's paid-in capital.
Public sector projects may be financed up to 30 percent of LBDI's total
commitments at any time.



- 9 -
32.       The interest rate charged by LBDI is 11-1/2 percent, including
a 1-1/2 percent service charge. It also charges a commitment fee of 1
percent on the undrawn balance, a one-time commission fee of 1 percent
of the approved amount and an additional penalty charge of 5 percent of
outstanding balances in arrears for more than three months. As a matter
of policy, LBDI passes on to its clients the foreign exchange risk on all
its external borrowings, including the proposed Bank loan. LBDI presently
enjoys a sound financial position (paragraph 36). However, LBDI's cost
of borrowing has recently increased and this trend is likely to continue
over the next few years. Also, the rate of inflation in Liberia is expected
to remain in excess of 8 percent in the near future. In view of these con-
ditions LBDI proposes to review its lending rate each year on the basis of
criteria to be established in consultation with the Bank; it is understood
that its lending rate will not be reduced below 11-1/2 percent without the
prior approval of the Bank. (This restriction would not apply to sub-loans
which might in future be financed from soft funds which stipulate lower re-
lending rates).
33.       LBDI has been doing well in terms of providing small loans
(US$10,000 or less each) to Liberian enterprises since more than 50 percent
of LBDI's approvals by number are for loans of less than US$10,000. However,
several promising projects were not financed due to the inability of the small
entrepreneurs to provide collateral sufficient to meet LBDI's requirement.
LBDI requires collateral of at least 150 percent of the loan amount in order
to ensure the sponsor's commitment to the project as well as provide security.
A relaxation of collateral requirements for small-scale industries has been
considered but a preferential system of collateral would be difficult for
LBDI to administer. A useful alternative would be for the Government to
guarantee loans made by LBDI to viable small-scale enterprises. This matter
is to be further discussed between the Government and the Bank with a view
to exploring the possibility of establishing a scheme to guarantee loans to
small-scale entrepreneurs (paragraph 18).
Record of Operation
34.       LBDI's operations have increased rapidly in recent years.    During
1974 and 1975, 95 loans were approved totaling US$7.5 million. In general,
LBDI's financing activities have supported relatively small Liberian
enterprises. As previously noted, more than 50 percent of LBDI's approvals
by number have been for loans of less than US$10,000. The weighted average
maturity of the loans has been six years. About 80 percent of the projects
are Liberian controlled, in contrast to the general pattern of lending and
industrial ownership in Liberia.   Over half of the projects and 42 percent
of the amount-involved rubber production, timber and wood processing and
other agri-business.
Portfolio
35.       As of December 31, 1975, LBDI's loan and equity portfolio
comprised 130 loans totaling US$7.1 million and 9 equity investments for
US$150,000. The loan portfolio of US$7.1 million represents an increase
of US$3.3 million, or 87 percent, over the previous year. Despite this



- 10 -
rapid expansion, the quality of the portfolio remains sound. Only 5.5
percent of the total loan portfolio amount was affected by arrears of more
than three months as compared to 5 percent at the end of 1974 and 10
percent in 1973. LBDI is taking appropriate action to recover the arrears;
meanwhile, it has made adequate provisions for probable losses. Provisions
as of December 31, 1975 were US$172,000, or about 2 percent of the out-
standing portfolio.
Financial Results
36.       In 1974, net profits amounted to US$84,000 and enabled LBDI to
declare its first dividend. Net profits in 1975 increased considerably to
US$302,000, or about 23 percent of average net worth, and a 6.5 percent
dividend was declared. The increase in net profits has been the result of
the company's expanded level of operations and its increased commitment
charge, guarantee fee, and penalty fee (0.25 percent, 1.0 percent and 4.0
percent respectively) which compensated for its higher cost of borrowing.
LBDI's gross income in 1975 amounted to 10.3 percent of average total
assets while financial expenses were 4.1 percent. Administrative expenses
fell from 3 percent of average total assets in 1974 to 2.5 percent in 1975.
37.       LBDI's financial position is sound.   Total  assets rose to US$12
million by the end of 1975, an increase of US$4.1 million over the previous
year. The growth was due largely to increases of US$3.3 million in loan
and equity investments. LBDI's long-term debt showed a corresponding
increase of US$2.9 million to US$8.3 million. According to the second loan
agreement between the Bank and LBDI, the company's debt/equity ratio is
limited to 7:1 with debt defined to include the redeemed (Government
promissory notes converted to cash loan by the Government) or discounted
(by LBDI) portion of promissory notes from the Government. At the end of
1975, this ratio stood at 6.3:1. LBDI has taken steps to increase its
paid-in capital by US$2 million, in order to raise the borrowing capacity.
38.       LBDI has undertaken a borrowing of US$500,000 from the Government
to cover part of LBDI's commitment in a Government-sponsored hotel project.
The terms and conditions of this borrowing have not been formalized. LBDI
indicated that it will reach agreement with the Government on the terms and
conditions of the borrowing by April 30, 1977.
Projected Operations and Resources
39.       LBDI has a sizeable pipeline of investment projects at various
stages of preparation. At least US$4 million in loans and US$200,000 in
equity investments are expected to be approved in 1976. Loan approvals
are projected to increase by at least US$1 million each year thereafter
while approvals of new equity investments are expected to remain constant
at about US$200,000 each year.
40.       During the period of three and one-half years, beginning 1976 to
mid 1979, LBDI's expected commitments in terms of loans and equity invest-
ments amount to US$17.2 million. Loan commitments alone are estimated at
US$16.5 million, of which US$11.6 million or 70 percent would be for
financing imports. As of December 31, 1975, LBDI had an uncommitted
balance of US$3.6 million remaining from the last IBRD and ADB loans.
The resulting foreign resource gap is estimated at US$8 million.



41.       Although LBDI is seeking assistance from other external sources
such as the African Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Development in
Africa, there are no immediate prospects of raising substantial funds from
these sources. A Bank loan of US$7 million (which includes US$0.15 million
for technical assistance) is proposed which would cover 85 percent of LBDI's
foreign resource gap during the period under consideration. It should not
prove difficult for LBDI to raise the relatively small balance required to
close the gap from other sources.
42.       LBDI's local resource requirements during the forecast period
are estimated at US$0.7 million for equity and US$4.9 million for loan
commitments. At present, LBDI has US$160,000 in local resources. Additional
funds are expected to be raised from increase in equity, redemption of
Government notes, and internal cash generation including loan collections;
these sources are expected to fully cover LBDI's local expenditures during
the period.
43.       To sum up, LBDI's total commitments during the period from
January 1, 1976 to mid-1979 are estimated at US$17.2 million, and are
expected to be met from the following sources:

1/ Plus US$150,000 for technical assistance program.
Terms and Conditions of Proposed Bank Loan
44.       Interest on the Bank loan would be 8.9 percent per annum;    the
standard commitment fee would apply. The Bank loan would be committed
over three years and disbursed over four years. Disbursement would be at
the rate of: (i) 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of directly
imported goods and services, (ii) 75 percent of the invoiced price of
goods produced outside Liberia but purchased locally, (iii) 60 percent of
expenditures for civil works, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component and (iv) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants
and fellowships for training LBDI's staff. The amortization of the Bank loan
will conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules of
LBDI's sub-loans and the amortization over 15 years, including 2-1/2 years of
grace, of the technical assistance part of the loan. LBDI's sub-loans would
have a maximum maturity of 15 years. In view of LBDI's improved appraisal capa-
bility, the "free limit" under which LBDI has authority to approve individual



- 12 -
sub-loans would be raised from the present level of US$100,000 to
US$150,000; the aggregate "free limit" would be increased from US$1 million
to US$2 million. Sub-borrowers would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Procurement would be through normal commercial channels.
Project Benefits and Risks
45.       LBDI calculates the economic rate of return on investments
estimated to cost more than US$50,000; for such past investments the
economic rate of return has averaged 35 percent and a similar rate of
return can be expected on future investments envisioned in the period 1977-79.
Project risks are no greater than can normally be expected with operations
of this type.
PART V - IFC INVESTMENT
46.       An TFC investment of US$306,300 in the share capital of LBDI is
proposed as IFC's participation in LBDI's share capital increase from US$1
million to US$3 million, bringing IFC's share holding in LBDI, after a stock
dividend to be issued in conjunction with the capital increase, up from
US$248,490 (representing 24.8 percent of existing share capital) to US$616,910
(representing 20.6 percent of share capital after the capital increase).
The Government and IFC would continue to hold an equal number of shares and
would remain the two largest shareholders. IFC now holds 24,849 shares
which were subscribed pursuant to Board Resolution No. 65/13 adopted on
August 10, 1965.
47.       The US$2 million proposed capital increase, which is necessary
to support LBDI's continued growth, will consist of a US$250,000 stock
dividend to existing shareholders (about 60 percent of 1975 year-end retained
earnings) and a US$1,750,000 rights issue at par. LBDI expects the whole
issue to be subscribed. IFC's subscription would be contingent on firm
commitments for at least US$1,300,000 of the proposed rights issue.
48.       IFC's participation is considered necessary to complete the
capital increase successfully. Moreover, IFC's participation would permit
IFC to keep parity with the Government in the shareholdings of LBDI and
thereby help to maintain LBDI's commercial character and IFC's role in
assisting the Company. Since LBDI has good prospects and an important role
to play in financing Liberian development, continued active support by
IFC is desirable. On the basis of LBDI's projections, net profit is
expected to range from 14-19 percent on average equity in 1976-80. Although
LBDI currently expects to raise its 6-1/2 percent dividend to 8-1/2 per-
cent by 1980, expected profitability would permit a still higher dividend
rate, which LBDI will consider.
49.       Annexed to the appraisal report is an outline of relevant laws
of the Republic of Liberia affecting the investment by IFC.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Liberian Bank
for Development and Investment (LBDI), the draft Guarantee Agreement
between Liberia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, the text of
a resolution approving the proposed loan and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed IFC investment are being distributed separately.
51.       In accordance with Article III, Section 3 (ii), of the Articles
of Agreement of the Corporation, notice of the proposed investment has been
given to the Government of Liberia.
52.       Liberia has signed and ratified the ICSID Convention;   however,
there are no contracts between Liberia and any foreign private investor in
the context of this investment which might give rise to an investment dispute.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and that the proposed investment would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that:
(a) the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan, and that
(b) the Board of Directors of the Corporation approve the pro-
posed investment.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 617-LBR      Port Development Project: US$3.6 million
Loan of June 20, 1969; Effective date:
July 10, 1969; Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area within
the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers; provision of
two tugs and a pilot, launch, as well as additional buoying and lighting of
the navigable channels; consultants' services for individual advisers and
feasibility studies for the development of road approaches to the port.
Project execution has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to the
Government's request that funds still undisbursed be used to help finance an
overall study of port development needs in Liberia, which was stipulated in
the project. Government signed a contract in May 1974 for the first phase
of port development study, and is now assessing the results of this phase
before undertaking the second phase of the study.
Loan No. 684-LBR      Power Projects: US$7.7 million Loan of June 4, 1970;
Effective date: June 5, 1970; (fully disbursed);
Loan No. 778-LBR      US$7.6 million Loan of October 26, 1973; Effective
date: September 30, 1971 (fully disbursed); and
Loan No. 1150-LBR     US$1.8 million Loan of August 1, 1975; Effective date:
October 20, 1975; Closing date: June 30, 1979.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped finance
the expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, the installation of
two gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection
of 42 miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas;
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

establishment of a new substation and related facilities. There have been
cost overruns mainly due to international currency fluctuations and the
purchase of larger generators than originally anticipated. A supplemental
loan of US$2.9 million was provided in October, 1973 to cover the cost
overruns caused by foreign exchange fluctuations and by use of larger gas
turbines. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. On July 8,
1975, the Board approved a technical assistance loan of US$1.8 million for
PUA. Project implementation is underway.
Credit No. 306-LBR   Agricultural Projects: US$1.2 million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Effective date: December 8, 1972;
Credit No. 577-LBR   Closing date: December 31, 1976 and US$6 million
Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective date: May 26,
1976; Closing date: December 31, 1981.
The first agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and
preparation of detailed investment proposals for integrated rural development
projects; a physical survey and detailed study of the Liberian-owned rubber
industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian rubber farmers with credits
to rehabilitate untapped or poorly tapped rubber; improving rice reasearch;
reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and training for Liberians to
prepare investment projects. Feasibility reports and consultants' study on
Ministry of Agriculture reorganization has been completed, but construction
of training center is behind schedule. Project completion date has been
revised from June 30, 1976 to August 31, 1977. It is estimated that the
extention will not entail significant cost overrun. A second agriculture
pro_ect, approved in 1975, is now in execution. It includes the following
elements: provision of seasonal and development credit to assist project
farmers develop and improve production of 5,600 hectares of upland rice,
1,900 hectares of swamp rice, 2,800 hectares of coffee and 2,300 hectares of
cocoa; construction of 100 villages wells; provision of schistosomiasis
surveillance unit; construction and operation of staff and farmer training
centers; recruitment and training of Liberians for extension, cooperative
credit and project management; introduction of an agricultural credit system
through new institutional arrangements such as creation of a special revolving
fund and the establishment of a branch of the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment at the project center in Voinjama.
Loan No. 838-LBR      Development Finance Company; US$1 million
Loan of June 26, 1972; Effective date: November 10,
Loan No. 1055-LBR     1972; Closing date: December 31, 1976 and US$4 million;
Loan of December 3, 1974; Effective date:
January 3, 1975; Closing date: June 30, 1979.
The first loan contributed to foreign exchange costs of industrial
projects financed by LBDI in 1972 and 1973. This loan is fully committed.
The second loan would help LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals for the first quarter of 1976
amounts to about 40% of the projected total for 1976. Loan commitments and
disbursement amount to 26% and 29% respectively of the targets set for 1976.
Profits for this quarter amount to $108,000 compared to the projected profits
of $89,000.

Loan No. 907-LBR      Highway Projects: US$3.0 million Loan of June 13,
1973; Effective date: December 28, 1973; Closing date:
Credit No. 395-LBR    December 31, 1977; US$2.6 million Credit of June 13,
1973; Effective date: December 28, 1973; Closing date:
Loan No. 1156-LBR     December 31, 1977; and US$27.5 million Loan of August 28,
1975; Effective date: October 14, 1975; Closing date:
December 31, 1979.
Implementation of the maintenance program, which started about six
months behind scheduled, is progressing slowly. Further delays were caused,by
a US$4.0 million cost overrun on the US-financed maintenance equipment, and a
delay in its delivery.   USAID has agreed to provide supplementary financing.
Contracts for all engineering studies have been signed, and work progress is
satisfactory. The construction contract for the Monrovia Bypass has been
awarded and work has begun. Implementation of the project being financed
under the last loan is well underway. Contracts have been awarded for Mesurado
Bridge, Totota-Ganda Road, UN Drive and for supervision consultancy.
Credit No. 305-LBR    Education Project: US$7.2 million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Effective date: December 18, 1972;
Loan No. 1266T-LBR    Closing date: March 1, 1978 and US$4.0 million
Third Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effective date:
July 8, 1976; Closing date: October 31, 1980.
The implementation of the first project has been slow due to difficul-
ties in selecting suitable architectural consultants, reaching agreement on
designs and following satisfactory bidding procedures for civil works. The
problems have been resolved and implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.
The first of the construction contracts has beep awarded; and the project is
expected to be completed by around March 1978, about six months behind the
original scheduled.
A second loan (on Third Window terms) of US$4.0 million was approved
by the Executive Directors on May 25, 1976. The Loan Agreement was signed on
June 7, 1976 and was made effective on July 8, 1976.
