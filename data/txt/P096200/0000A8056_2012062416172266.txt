                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Land Registration Project (LRP) has helped to improve the security of land rights and make transactions more efficient and transparent through its support to registration of real
                         estate rights in the local court based land registration offices in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) and in the Real Estate Cadastre (REC) in the Republic of Srpska
                         (RS). Nearly all the land registration offices (24 offices in FBH representing 104% of the target and 16 in RS representing 100% of the target) have been renovated and new business
                         plans developed. Land register and cadastre service standards have been adopted in both Entities. The backlog of registration requests has been eliminated in all but a few offices.
                         The majority of maps (covering 1,4 million ha in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH)) and land register records (a total 1,609,202 land registry folios) have been digitized. IT systems have

                         been introduced and solutions for the WEB access to records have been established. Methodology for incorporating apartments in the court registers and in the REC have been
                         developed. The timeliness and quality of services provided by the land registration offices in both Entities have greatly improved. In the RS 53% of the registration offices register
                         mortgages within a day and in the FBH 39% of the offices register mortgages within a day. The average time for the mortgage registration is 4 days in the FBH, which represents a
                         significant decrease from the average of 65 days in 2007. The client surveys commissioned in 2010 confirmed significant increase in user satisfaction with services provided.
