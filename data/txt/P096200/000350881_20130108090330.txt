1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The 1995 Dayton Accords, which brought about an end to three years of conflict in the former
Republic of Yugoslavia, established a complex government structure: a State of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH) with two Entities; the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH); and the
Republic Srpska (RS), and their government structures. The Br?ko District 1, established as a
self-governing administrative unit, was added to the structure in 1999. Between 1995 and project
preparation in 2005, the country had made good progress in recovering from the conflict, but
many problems still remained, with half the population living at, or near, the poverty level, high
unemployment and low levels of investment.

As the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted, all levels of government were eager to
encourage economic growth through investment, improving government services and reducing
corruption. As access to land and property is a key factor in many areas of economic growth, and
as real property can also serve as security for loans for investment, there was great interest in
improving the land administration system. Similarly, the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
2005-2007 noted that all levels of government sought to create an environment for sustainable
and balanced economic development. Improved land administration would be an integral
element of such an environment. Land administration is an entity level responsibility, so the
Entity governments were to be responsible for most aspects of the project.

In addition, the German Organization for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) had been working in
both entities on creating a viable land registry since the passage of the Law on Land Registry in
2002. The work done by GTZ provided the underpinning for a successful project focused on the
land registry system and improving service.

The rationale for the Bank to become involved centered on two factors: the readiness of the
country’s legal and institutional framework for implementing the necessary reforms, plus strong
support at State and Entity level; and the Bank’s considerable expertise in projects of this kind
regionally, with similar projects underway in six neighboring countries at the time of preparation
and numerous projects in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region over the preceding 15 years.
The Project was to contribute to the higher level objectives described in the CPS through greater
security, certainty and accuracy of land records, reducing impediments to access to land,
improving the land administration services, and enhancing transparency, thereby simultaneously
reducing corruption opportunities.

 The Br?ko District constituting of the entire territory of the former Br?ko municipality was established after an arbitration
process in 1999. The Br?ko District is a neutral, self-governing administrative unit, under the sovereignty of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It is formally part of both BiH Entities.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO was to facilitate the orderly development of transparent land markets through the
registration of real estate rights and complementary policies that would enable transactions to be
made with security and efficiency. The PDO level indicators were:

1. Improved land registration system as evidenced by: improved transparency, speed and
accuracy of making land transactions for clients wishing to buy, sell, inherit, mortgage or lease;
data from all registry folders in accessible database and at least 50 percent of the registry folders
updated and reconciled with existing cadastral databases, based on office review; incorporation
of apartments into the main land registry;

2. Improved cadastre system as evidenced by: improved efficiency and speed of providing
relevant existing cadastre data and initiation of data quality improvement for clients wishing to
register their property rights, to access property maps, to appraise property values, or to
undertake efficient, responsibly managed development investments requiring land; completion in
eight sites of systematic registration of property rights and situation analysis to understand the
magnitude of property related impediments to development; development of cadastre
information management system;

3. Development of policy and legal framework as evidenced by: strategies on dealing with
illegal development, encroachments, privatization, restitution and planning; legislative changes
addressing use of electronic systems, modifications of law or legal procedures taking into
account implementation experience of existing legal framework (e.g., mortgage, appraisal,
transaction and property tax, restitution, planning, third party mediation), and use and/or disposal
of state and municipal land; strategies for land-related revenue, including legislative changes,
addressing issues such as the cumulative impact of all land related service fees and taxes,
policies on intergovernmental exchange and sharing of revenue and information, and
methodology for property tax system using mass appraisals; initiation of a second phase of long-
term program.

The PAD also included a vision for 2016 2 with the following outcomes at the end of the second
phase: (1) clear, easily accessible and comprehensive land registry records that were compatible
with the cadastre records; (2) increased investment through better land use planning and quicker
construction permitting; and (3) secure, legitimate property rights that could be traded efficiently.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons / Justification

In July 2010, key indicators were revised to reflect overriding realities and the project was
restructured, including a closing date extension of one year from March 31, 2011 to March 31,
2012. The extension was needed to compensate for the delay of almost one year in making the
project effective. The delay was due to difficulties in establishing a government at State and

  The vision 2016 was to establish (by 2016) a well-functioning land administration system which facilitates
investment and good governance.

                                                         2
Entity levels. The PDO itself was unaffected. These PDO and intermediate result indicators were
adjusted:
    • The unanticipated complexity of reconciling cadastral information and registry folders
        led to a decision to reduce the targets of PDO indicator to 20 percent of registry folders
        reconciled with cadastral information. The related intermediate result indicator was
        reduced to 60,000 cadastral objects surveyed;
    • Due to the re-assessment of the existing law, it was concluded that apartments could not
        be legally registered in the database, except in certain limited circumstances. The PDO
        indicator to incorporate apartments within the new registry database was amended to
        development of a methodology for incorporating apartments into the main land registry.
        The related intermediate result indicator on the data entry and reconciliation was
        redefined as 1.6 million register folders entered to the land book (apartment records
        excluded). The record reconciliation intermediate result indicator was reduced from the
        original 1 million to 370,000 records reconciled with the cadastre;
    • It was planned that 47 offices would be renovated and 52 would be equipped. During
        implementation, some of these offices were assessed as not requiring renovations or to
        have been dealt with separately. 3 Thus, the intermediate result indicator was revised to 37
        offices to be renovated and equipped by the end of the project, with an additional 3
        receiving equipment only;
    • The intermediate result indicator on the number of cadastral objects in the eight sites
        selected for systematic registration was reduced to 60,000 from the original 100,000.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were to be those people and businesses that wanted security in their real
property holdings in order to invest (either labor or money, including through mortgages).
Additionally, although not directly identified, all persons holding property were to benefit
through greater security and certainty of their legal documents. Similarly, all potential and future
owners of real property would benefit. More broadly, society would benefit through improved
economic use of real property plus the greater social stability and increased standards of living
through investment in housing (such as extensions and renovations) that flow from clear and
certain legal ownership of real property.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project had three components:

      •    Component A: Registration: the purpose was to improve the transparency, speed and
           accuracy of registering transactions. Activities included development of service standards
           and sustainable service; improvements to working conditions for staff and public
           reception areas; registration of apartments in the land registry system; data harmonization



3
    The EU funded a number of court renovations and some registration offices were included in this program.


                                                          3
       between the land registry and cadastre records; and technical assistance (TA) and
       training;
   •   Component B: Cadastre: the purpose was to improve the efficiency and speed of
       providing data on immovable property. Activities included development of service
       standards, business plans, and procedural manuals for cadastre agencies; pilot work in
       eight sites to develop a methodology for systematic mapping and registration of property
       data; digitization of cadastral maps; development of Information and Communication
       Technology (ICT); and TA and training;
   •   Component C: Policy development and project management: the purpose was to develop
       strategies and draft legislation to remove the existing impediments to economic growth in
       the land sector. Areas that were identified for possible investigation included land use
       planning and construction permitting, land privatization, and property taxation.
       Development of a long-term program (including a second project), TA and training were
       also included in this component, as well as project management and monitoring.

1.6 Revised Components

N/A

1.7 Other significant changes

Given that the project became effective twelve months after the Board approval, it needed a one
year extension to meet all of the project targets. This was granted as part of the project
restructuring of July 2010. The extension was to ensure continuity and to allow preparation of
the planned second project. In March 2012, a further three month extension of the closing date to
June 30, 2012 was agreed to allow completion of final contracts for cadastre services and for IT
systems upgrading.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Bank has had extensive experience with registration projects in the region, and it drew on
that experience during preparation. In the BiH, the government was committed to develop land
administration and management systems to promote growth. A thorough review of the
institutional, legal and administrative frameworks was undertaken, and experience in
neighboring and regional countries contributed to the analysis, particularly in regard to lessons
learned and the rationale for the Bank’s intervention. In light of this analysis, the scope of the
Project was focused somewhat narrowly, and its objectives were modest due to the capacity
constraints that the Bank team found in the BiH. By the time of the project design, the BiH was
still a post-conflict country with gaps in institutional memory and weak capacity in both central
and local levels of the government. Thus, many of the Project activities were limited to simple,
straightforward tasks such as building renovations and acquisition of equipment, digitizing of
existing data and maps, and provision of training. For property registration it was necessary to
develop the regulatory framework, procedures and introduce service standards. During project

                                                 4
preparation, there was discussion to include full work on the cadastre, but it was clear that the
survey methods being used could not work at the national scale and that more work on the
regulatory framework and methodology was needed. Because of the technical assistance
provided by the GTZ over several years, the conditions were already in place for a successful
program in land registration.

Policy development and legislative reform activities were set to start, and planning was to focus
on the short and medium term. In addition, systematic cadastral surveying methodologies were to
be tested and learning to take place, allowing for more ambitious goals during the second project.
The Project was, therefore, designed as the first of two steps, with the second step dependent on
demonstrated performance and capacity in the first. The design realistically reflected the capacity
constraints in land administration in the BiH and was designed specifically to address these
constraints while still improving the system for land administration by focusing on service.

Institutionally, the Project was complex, not only due to the dual agency land administration
system (separate registry and cadastre) but also due to the two Entities functioning as separate
projects. There were two Ministries of Justice (MOJs) and two Geodetic Authorities (GAs)
involved, plus 10 cantonal governments in the FBiH that funded and had some control over the
land registries and the municipal cadastre offices. To address the cross-institutional issues, the
financing agreement included a covenant ensuring the creation of the LACAB, which was to
coordinate across the country and deal with higher level policy issues, and a land registration unit
(LRU) in each Entity MOJ to coordinate and manage the land registry activities within each
Entity.

The national and entity level governments showed strong commitment, as demonstrated by their
rapid appointment of a chief of each LRU and active participation from the beginning of the
Project. A substantial social survey conducted in 2005 greatly informed the preparation process.

Risks were realistically assessed at the time of preparation and appropriate mitigation measures
put in place. Delay in the project effectiveness could have been identified as a risk given the
governance structure. Two risks were perhaps underestimated: the risk that Entity governments
would be slow to fundamentally reform laws (particularly in regard to reforming the cadastre
system in the FBiH) and the risk that apartment registration would be held up by a strict
interpretation of the requirements for building registration. However, in both cases the risks did
not significantly affect the development objective, and the activities continued with some
modifications.

2.2 Implementation

The Project experienced an effectiveness delay of twelve months, due to difficulties in the BiH in
forming a government, which had to ratify the financing.

The Project was implemented during a period when the two Entities—the FBiH and the RS—
increasingly developed independently of one another. Although there was good cooperation
during preparation and in the first year of the Project, by 2008, the two entities were evolving
different land administration systems and needs. Several activities—including development of

                                                 5
land administration business plans and IT solutions—were therefore undertaken separately. Still,
there was always broad agreement on the high level goals at the State level. As late as 2011, the
State level Land Administration Coordination Board (LACAB) produced a Land Administration
Sector Policy and Strategy for BiH. The Policy and Strategy integrated Entity level plans into a
joint policy.

At a practical level, the two entities developed different models of land administration. In the RS,
a new law in June 2011 unified the land register and cadastre into one centralized institution, the
Real Estate Cadastre (REC) at the GA. In the PAD, the transition from a dual agency land
registration system to a single agency had been presented as a best practice option to be
considered at mid-term. The Bank team was supportive of the transition on the basis that unified
systems are generally more efficient than dual systems. In the FBiH the dual agency land
registration system has been retained. Land rights are registered in the local courts while the
cadastre is kept by municipalities under the guidance of the GA.

Several other factors had a major impact on implementation. The factors with a positive impact
were:
   • MOJ engagement. In both Entities, the MOJs were engaged throughout most of the
       project, providing leadership and oversight. The LRU staff were motivated and
       contributed greatly to realizing the Project goals;
   • Good court presidents, managers and staff. In all courts, in both Entities, dedicated and
       hard-working staff responded positively to the renovations, new equipment, improved
       software, temporary additional staff and training provided under the Project and the GTZ
       administered technical assistance project co-funded by Germany, Sweden and Austria.
       Much of the success in successful modernizing of land registries can be attributed to the
       attitude of managers and staff, who were often undertaking their own activities to
       improve operations and service as well as embracing the Project’s reforms;
   • ICT development. Though ICT development proceeded separately in each Entity and
       experienced delays, the final outcome is that both Entities have basic ICT systems and
       good ICT strategies in place. They have begun implementation of their second stage ICT
       investments. The successes were largely due to the pragmatic, incremental, approach
       applied to software development and the use of small contracts to deliver specific outputs.
       The aim, which proved successful, was to enhance existing solutions and develop basic
       functions rather than to introduce a full scale sophisticated system through a large scale
       development contract;
   • Donor assistance. Technical and material assistance administered by the GTZ was
       satisfactory and well received by the BiH authorities. The assistance covered almost the
       whole of the Project period. The TA team was responsive to requests by the
       implementing agencies and co-funded Project activities, and assisted in the Project
       implementation. In particular, the team was instrumental in office renovations and
       equipping; establishment of education centers; education and training in land
       administration; IT support; setting up the monitoring and evaluation systems, and
       supporting the integration of BiH land administration institutions to land administration
       communities of Europe and Western Balkans. Other donors also participated, including
       the EC (provision of geodetic reference stations, orthophotomapping and spatial data
       infrastructure support) and USAID (work on property taxes, planning and development).


                                                 6
       Regular donor coordination meetings were held whenever the supervision team visited
       the country.

Other factors had a less positive impact:

   •   LACAB. While the LACAB functioned well in the first year of the Project, in the
       following years it had difficult functioning, largely due to disagreements between its
       members as to their role and organization as the political economy in BiH changed to
       emphasize more the Entity level authority. In spite of these difficulties, the progress on
       the legal framework and preparation of plans for future land administration activities was
       satisfactory and the main output, the national level strategic plan for land administration
       was completed and approved by LACAB in 2011;
   •   Donor support. The GTZ TA provided support to the government through technical
       assistance and training both before and during the project period, utilizing funding from
       Sweden, Austria and Germany. This had been progressing extremely well until midway
       through the Project when some difficulties arose. As the governments’ capacity
       developed and they were ready to take over more responsibility and have a greater say in
       the allocation of donor funds, some friction between the entity governments and GTZ
       arose, which caused some delays in implementation of the Project. The critical issue was
       related to the (financial) sustainability of the project, in particular to the funding of
       professional staff within the Bosnian institutions, particularly with regard to local experts
       and their being taken over incrementally by the Bosnian institutional structures. The issue
       was sorted out after several months, but—as a conclusion for other projects—the division
       and the transfer of responsibilities between TA consultants and government personnel
       should be clear from the beginning of TA projects in order to avoid unnecessary delays.
   •   Sustainability of land registration domain in the FBiH. The LRU was successful in the
       coordination role between the FMOJ and LROs during the project. This coordination
       extended to the ICT development and maintenance, and resulted in the successful
       upgrading of land registration software used by the LROs. However, at the project
       closure the FMOJ’s LRO coordination was found to be too dependent on consultants, and
       the function discontinued. As an interim solution, the LRO’s technical (ICT in particular)
       coordination will move to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the new project, and
       the sustainability of the land registration domain will be a key focus of the new project.
       Four months after the project closure, and stemming from these well recognized
       sustainability issues, the Minister of MOJ appointed a legislative commission to reform
       the real estate registration legislation in the FBiH. There is an initial political agreement
       between the institutions overseeing registration (the FGA and the FMOJ) of unifying the
       real estate registration service under a single agency in the FBiH.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The PAD’s Results Framework included ten PDO outcome indicators and sixteen
intermediate outcome indicators (perhaps too many). However they were clearly expressed, the
LRUs were successful in data collection and the indicators provided a quantifiable broad basis
for assessing progress towards meeting the PDO. The project ISRs recorded progress with only
selected key indicators from the PAD following the Bank’s policy for entering data into an ISR

                                                 7
at the project start. The Results Framework in Annex 3 included specific indicators covering
almost every Project activity, and the PAD clearly envisaged how the data would be collected
(by the MOJs and the GAs) and synthesized (by the LRUs) into useable reports for decision
making. In retrospect, the target of 1 day registration of a property transaction was overly
ambitious when judged against regional standards (according to Doing Business the regional
average is 30 days and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
country average is 26 days). At the time of the first restructuring the indicator was retained as a
target to try and achieve on the understanding that it is better to have a high target to aim for than
one that can easily be achieved.

Implementation: There was already an initial reporting system in place within the MOJs,
supported by the GTZ, covering the activities of the land registries. Data was easily gathered and
could be relied on. The GAs, with a more limited range of activities, also collected data and
submitted it to the LRUs. Social surveys were conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2010, and this also
provided valuable data. Real estate market studies for each Entity were carried out in 2012.
Quarterly reports were prepared throughout the project period to a high standard by the LRUs,
using the indicators as a basis.

Utilization: Certain elements of the monitoring reports were critically important to decision
making and allocating Project resources to reach targets. In particular, the data on backlogs in
registration at the land registries and digitizing of land registry data were used to employ
temporary staff to address problems and finalize the work. The quarterly report, plus discussions
and inspections undertaken on supervision missions, reassured all parties that Project activities
were progressing and, where they were not progressing, provided a valuable input in making
timely modifications.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project was classified as Category B for the environmental assessment, as the environmental
effects of the project were expected to be minor and indirect. The planned office improvements
were to be restricted to renovation of existing premises and not to involve major civil works,
excavation or demolition, which could potentially harm the environment. Prior to the Appraisal
of the Project, an Environmental Assessment (EA) had been prepared as a Framework document,
complete with disclosure and public consultations. The EA (as reflected also in the PAD)
provided that all renovation and rehabilitation contracts were to include Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs), that is, measures to minimize or mitigate environmental damage.
The EMPs for each site included provisions on minimizing disturbances through dust and noise,
adequate management of construction wastes, and provisions for chance findings of cultural or
historical heritage that have been fully implemented and no complaints have been received.
Safeguards and in particular EMP compliance was monitored through regular supervision
missions and was found to be satisfactory.

In regard to financial management, procurement and disbursement the audits were performed on
time with clean opinions and quarterly financial management reports were submitted on time and
found acceptable to the Bank. Procurement was implemented in accordance with Bank rules and
post reviews found no outstanding issues.

                                                  8
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A second phase was, as noted, envisaged in the PAD and included in the CPS for 2012 to 2015.
A new project has been designed and was approved by the Board on October 25, 2012. While the
LRP focused on land rights registration in local courts, the new project will focus on improving
the cadastre system and the sustainability of the land registration and cadastre institutions. The
new project, the Real Estate Registration Project (RERP), has the following development
objective: a sustainable real estate registration system with harmonized land register and
cadastre records in urban areas of both Entities. The Project has three components:

   1. Real estate registration data development. This component will support land register and
      cadastre data harmonization on land, buildings and rights based on the actual situation in
      the field, with a goal of establishing up-to-date and interlinked, or integrated, land
      register and cadastre databases;
   2. Real estate registration infrastructure development. This component will continue work
      in improving working conditions and infrastructure in the land registry and cadastre
      offices across the country. Information technology investments will lead to further
      interlinking between real estate registers and other public datasets making the data
      accessible online to a wide audience;
   3. Policy and institutional development, and project management. The last component will
      support the development of laws and policies to achieve the PDO, supply TA and training,
      address long-term issues of institutional funding and sustainability, and provide project
      management.

During the interval between the first Project closing in June 2012 and effectiveness of the second
Project, expected in early 2013, the two Entities have continued their activities to reform the land
administration system. In the RS, the GA has transferred all land registry functions from the
courts to its local offices and the new project will further support the integration of the land
registry and cadastre functions into the new REC system.

In the FBiH, the LRU did not continue to exist after Project closing. The Bank considers this to
be a key long term sustainability issue and has maintained a focus on this issue throughout the
new project preparation. The government has recently appointed a new Director of the LRU
within the Ministry of Justice, which is a very positive development. However, the MOJ does not
have adequate capacity and financing for continuing ICT development or maintenance of the
land registration software, which is used by the Court land registries. The technology
coordination function between the LROs will have to be taken over by the new Project’s PIU.
The new Project will work with the government of the FBiH to address this sustainability issue
and propose long-term solutions. The recently appointed legislative commission to reform the
real estate registration legislation in the FBiH is a key and important development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the objectives and design of the Project were consistent with the country’s
needs and aspirations. The CPS for 2005 to 2007 placed land administration as an integral
element of an environment of sustainable and balanced economic development. There was, and
still is, a strong need for secure, transparent and efficient land administration in the BiH to
facilitate investment, economic growth and social stability. The design targeted key areas in
which land administration could be improved—services provided by the courts and cadastre
offices, the policy and legal framework—with many practical, achievable, measurable activities
that could have an immediate and positive impact on land administration.

At the project close the BiH is in the midst of a long period of slow growth amidst escalating
financial volatility in Europe, and there is a widespread recognition that the country has to
strengthen its competitiveness. The physical infrastructure, the business environment, and human
capital development will not only require significant investments in key administrative bodies
such as the property registration system, but improved governance and labor policies. Also
natural resources have to be utilized more sustainably. The project has contributed to improving
regional competitiveness by increasing the security of real estate transactions and providing
better access to credit. It has also improved the accuracy of spatial data, making it easier to
monitor and plan the use of natural resources. Building on these achievements, the new project
will be contributing to the economic growth, social inclusion and natural resources pillars of the
CPS for 2012 to 2015.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

As noted above, the PDO was to facilitate the orderly development of transparent land markets
through the registration of real estate rights and complementary policies that enable transactions
to be made with security and efficiency. This was to be achieved through an improved land
registration system, improved cadastre and improved policy and legal framework.

At the Project’s close, it appears that land markets are more transparent and efficient, and have
become so through an orderly, systematic process that has brought land administration in the
BiH into the modern era. This was confirmed in numerous stakeholder interviews. Efficiency is
evidenced by the PDO indicator 1 that shows the faster registration and improved turnaround
times for registration of documents—in the FBiH the majority of courts complete requests within
five days and 39 percent within one day; in the RS, 53 percent of transactions are completed
within one day. In Sarajevo, the improvement has been dramatic with registration of a property
transaction decreasing from years to a matter of days. These improvements in service times have
been achieved while at the same time the number of requests has been increasing in the land
registry offices.

Increased transparency in the land markets can be demonstrated in several ways:
    • access to reliable data, particularly through internet access for the Sarajevo and Banja
       Luka courts, praised by notaries and real property brokers (PDO indicator 1);

                                                10
   •   wider publicity of services, fees and requirements (PDO indicator 9).

There is also greater security:
   • adopted performance standards limit opportunities for red tape (PDO indicator 1);
   • systems allow timely completion of transactions reducing risk of fraud (PDO indicators 1
       and 4);
   • all ownership information is in digital form (PDO indicators 2 and 6);
   • apartment registration has been enabled (PDO indicator 3);
   • all land registries have new modern software that incorporates security features and a
       back-up system to protect information (PDO indicator 6);
   • archives have been improved securing the historical evidence of property rights (PDO
       indicator 2).

There is also increased transparency and predictability in land policies and laws:
   • land policy and the legal framework have been improved (PDO indicators 7, 8 and 9);
   • the new systematic registration method, which was developed based on the projects’
       piloting, will be implemented under the new project (PDO indicator 5);
   • the new land administration strategy is supported by the new project (PDO indicator 10).

In terms of customer satisfaction with cadastre and land registry services, the customer surveys
from 2005, 2007, and 2010 have shown a steady decrease in the amount of time that citizens
spend in the registry and cadastre offices and also in the number of visits needed to complete a
transaction. The rate of respondents satisfied with cadastre services has increased from 2005 to
2010 (from 30 percent to 53 percent respectively). For the land registry offices, the satisfaction
has not increased significantly, however respondents do tend to be more satisfied with the
“professional conduct of employees,? “accuracy of the LR data,? and “freedom of access to
information,? all aspects of the services impacted by the project. Private sector representatives
confirm the greatly improved access to data and improved processing times.

The Project also made significant improvements in ‘complementary policies’ as evidenced by the
PDO indicator 9. USAID provided a great deal of support to the government and helped Br?ko
District to implement a property tax system using mass appraisal techniques. The RS has adopted
a similar property tax law and has begun implementation. In the FBiH, property tax is a Canton
and municipal responsibility, and they have generally decided not to impose a property tax at this
stage. Both Entities have also made progress on their planning and permitting policies and in
dealing with illegal developments, and new legislation has been developed.

The Project took a practical approach to improving the land administration system in the BiH by
focusing on improving services (PDO indicators 1 and 4) and the legal framework (PDO
indicators 7–10), and testing methods for the harder systematic registration and cadastre
activities (PDO indicator 5). In this way the project quickly responded to the needs of citizens
while building the necessary capacity and framework (legal, regulatory and technical) for the
more complex work ahead.

3.3 Efficiency

At the project start, lack of policy in land administration and inefficiencies within the land
registry services hindered business development and real-estate investment. Professionals,
businesses and citizens were frustrated with long waiting times and the several trips required to
the local offices to finalize a transaction, and the high costs, all of which made it difficult to
complete basic real estate transactions or borrow money based on property as collateral. The
PAD identified as the main economic benefits an increased security of tenure, a decrease in
transaction costs, improved access to land administration services, and improved public sector
management associated with improved governance. The economic and financial analysis in the
PAD does not include calculations of the Net Present Value (NPV) and Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) for these benefits.

Efficiency Improvements:
Following efficiency improvements, transactions are now completed within one working day for
more than half of the clients (53 percent) in the RS. In the FBiH, 39 percent of courts register
mortgages within one day and 21 percent of courts register mortgages within 2–5 days. There
have been considerable reductions in the average time spent at the office per transaction from
197 minutes down to 99 minutes, which is a 50 percent improvement. At 114,000 transactions in
2011 and an hourly wage rate of BAM 5.25 (US$3.24), this equates to an annual economic
benefit of just over US$602,057. These efficiency gains would be even larger if one included the
monetary benefit of the increased productivity of government workers in the registration offices
implied by the faster transaction times. Furthermore, the number of registration requests and
registered mortgages significantly increased. In the FBiH, the number of registration requests
was 70,561 in 2011, an increase of 37 percent since 2007 when 51,352 transactions were
registered. Note that the number of transaction requests in 2011 is an increase of 96 percent since
2006 when only 35,819 requests were registered. Registered mortgages in the FBiH increased
over 44 percent from 4,405 4 in 2007 to 6,357 in 2011. In the RS, the number of registered
transactions actually decreased 26 percent from 14,445 in 2007 to 10,657 in 2011. However, the
number of registered mortgages in the RS in 2011 was 3,244 which is a significant increase of
138 percent since 2007.

Fiscal Impact:
The Government has significantly benefitted from the increase in transactions through an
increase in transfer tax revenue. At the Project start the annual property transfer tax revenue was
US$123 million. Without the Project, the estimated number would have increased to 159 million
by 2012. The market stimulating effect of the Project has, however, increased this number to an
estimated US$176 million per year. Given very conservative assumptions on the percentage
attributable to project activities, these benefits amount to a Present Value (PV) of US$13 million
at a 12 percent discount rate.

                                                12
Property Market Impact:
Investments in cadastre and registration systems improve access to finance and other investments
in the housing market. Improvements are reflected in the number of transactions as well as in the
average property prices, the product of which determine the total market value. During the
course of the Project, market transactions increased from 65,797 in 2007 to 83,880 in 2012,
while average property value increased from US$46,715 to US$54,400 (or 52,472 in 2007
dollars). Assumptions are applied to estimate the scenario without the Project. Under a very
conservative scenario, it is assumed that the Project had a 1 percent market stimulating effect,
such that in its absence market transactions would have increased to 83,041 in 2012. For the
estimation of average property values without the Project, it is assumed that the price in real
terms would have increased at an annual rate of 3 percent reaching the value of US$47,895 in
2012. Given other conservative assumptions on project coverage and project costs of US$15
million, the conversion of these incremental benefits into monetary value translates into an NPV
equal to US$18 million at a 12 percent interest rate with an ERR of 47 percent. A sensitivity
analysis is conducted to calculate benefits assuming a larger market stimulating effect: at 5
percent effect NPV increases to US$38 million with an ERR of 85 percent and at 10 percent
effect NPV increases to US$63 million with an ERR of 133 percent.

Mortgage Market Impact:
Mortgage loans as a financial product were introduced only shortly before the financial crisis of
2008, and hence were not hit severely by high rates of defaults or foreclosures. However, with
consumer lending rates over 2 percent higher than the mortgage rate (10.0 percent and 7.7
percent effective interest rate respectively) consumer lending is much more profitable for the
banks; furthermore, interviews with bank associations confirmed that the banks often use
consumer lending with guarantors in place of mortgage financing due to issues relating to the
registration of property. However, the Project has considerably improved this situation. We
estimated that after the 6 years of implementation, 30 percent of consumers taking out a loan of
some kind to finance their home now have access to mortgages. Given conservative assumptions
on project coverage, the avoided interest payments due to the increased access to mortgages
amount to a benefit with a PV of US$16 million at a 12 percent discount rate. If these economic
benefits are added to the benefits of the property market impact (assuming a 1 percent market
stimulating effect), the NPV increases to US$32 million and the ERR to 61 percent. Considering
a sensitivity analysis, at a 5 percent market stimulating effect NVP increases to US$52 million
and ERR to 95 percent and at a 10 percent market stimulating effect NPV increases to US$77
million and ERR to 141 percent.

The estimates of the economic and financial analysis suggest that the Project was a sensible
investment for BiH. With a relatively modest cost of US$15 million, the Project has been able to
improve efficiency in land transactions and generate the conditions for incremental economic
and fiscal benefits. These benefits are expected to accrue in the future.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The Project’s overall outcome is rated Satisfactory. The Project targets were met and the real
estate registries and cadastre facilitate the land markets with security and efficiency. Efficiency
has improved as evidenced by the faster registration and improved turnaround times for
registration of documents. Increased transparency in the land markets is demonstrated through
increased access to reliable data, particularly through internet access for the Sarajevo and Banja
Luka courts (praised by notaries and real property brokers); and there is wider publicity of
services, fees and requirements. There has also been a steady decrease in the amount of time that
citizens spend in the registry and cadastre offices and also in the number of visits needed to
complete a transaction.

Finally, the improved legal and policy framework for land administration (registration and
cadastre) and land management (planning, taxation) was developed during the course of the
Project, paving the way for the next phase related to the continuing challenges of institutional
sustainability of the land administration system, which will be the focus of the second project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The 2010 social survey collected data on users of the land registries and cadastre offices, and
found that:
   • land registry office visitors were most frequently the 36-50 years age category, and two-
       thirds were men - this had changed little from 2005;
   • unemployed citizens (51.4 percent), domestic population (70.0 percent), as well as those
       who evaluated their socioeconomic status as “average? (52.3 percent) were most
       frequently the visitors for the land registry offices in 2010;
   • two-thirds of participants stated that inheritance of real estate was the reason for their
       using the land registry, and the majority did not use the services of an attorney/notary;
   • when asked “have you experienced discrimination in the land registry office on any
       basis? the overwhelming response was ‘no’ (92 percent of all respondents); and 93
       percent of women responded that they had not experienced any discrimination based on
       gender.

A major study on gender and land issues in BiH, Kosovo and Montenegro was completed in
2011 by the World Bank and the report was published the same year. Although there were no
legal restraints and women had equal rights to men, in customary practice there appeared to be
some differences and men were far more likely to be registered as owners than women, either
individually or jointly. The key lesson was that the gender question does need to be addressed
and monitored in land projects in the region. The lessons learned have been integrated into the
design of the new project, which will raise public awareness of the legal rights of women and
produce disaggregated data on real estate ownership by gender (as a PDO indicator).

Consistent with expectations, the social surveys show that the users of the land administration
services are the broad population and they are therefore the immediate beneficiaries. Use of the

                                                14
services is broad-based, with those with an average standard of living being in the majority.
Looking more broadly, the improved services also benefit those who are seeking to acquire
property—often the younger members of society and those engaged in business. In addition to
the immediate benefits of faster and more reliable service, the less time involved in waiting or
having to make informal payments, the more time and resources citizens have for more
important economic and social activity. The impact of gaining quicker and more secure access to
property data (including for borrowing purposes) or property to be acquired for housing or
economic purposes will generally have a positive impact in terms of raising living standards and
conditions.

Continuing the reform process and improving services, particularly through online access to
information, is likely to further secure the advances made under the Project and thereby the
benefits flowing to all segments of society and the economy. The new Project has more of a
focus on improving social impacts and social monitoring, including for women and the poor, and
a full impact evaluation is being planned.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

In regard to the land registry system managed by the Entity level MOJs, and the local courts, the
Project resulted in a significant positive impact and series of positive effects, as intended in the
PAD, on institutional development, in the short-term in both Entities and in the long-term in the
RS due to forming of the REC, and to a lesser degree in the long-term in the FBiH.

There were no units or offices directly responsible for the land registries or their operations when
the Project began. In each Entity, one Deputy Minister for Justice had this role together with his
other duties, but no support staff for the activity. Through the creation of LRUs, the Project had
an immediate impact by creating coordinating units that could set standards, monitor results,
provide training and guidance, report on outcomes and also direct the use of Project funds. The
LRUs operated successfully throughout the Project. In the FBiH, attempts to establish a land
registration department based on the LRU failed because of constraints in civil service size and
recruitments. At the close of the Project the LRU ceased to exist, but was later reinstituted to
facilitate the project closing. The land registry coordinating function will be supported by the
new project PIU, and the new project includes a focus on developing permanent institutional
solutions.

At the courts, which are headed by a largely autonomous president, the land registry offices were
transformed from paper-based, slow operations, where the potential for additional payments
existed, into more modern, digital, customer-focused operations. Staff conditions were greatly
improved through office renovations and purchase of new furniture and equipment, thereby
supporting the land registry staff to deliver higher quality services more quickly. Capacities in
local courts and other local land administration institutions were significantly strengthened
through systematic training and education of employees that tangibly improved efficiency and
quality of the services provided to clients.

In the RS, a similar picture emerged of more efficient, better equipped land registries that were
more aligned to the needs of their customers. However, with the change to the law in 2011,


                                                 15
responsibility for registering transactions shifted to the RS GA. While this is a positive
development in the long-term, in the short-term it produced transitional delays in the Project
activities. However, the GA has the necessary capacity to deal with the challenges of transition
and the Project provided support. The new Project will continue support to the RS GA in
completing the transition.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The new law, which unified land registries to the cadastre in the RS, was an unexpected
breakthrough. Though it was supported by the Bank and mentioned in the PAD as an alternative
to be considered, it was not part of the original project plan. It will have a major positive impact
on the new Project by creating more streamlined institutional arrangements.

An unanticipated outcome is that the land administration professionals (particularly surveyors in
the public sector) have been strengthened by their integration into the broader land
administration community in Europe and the western Balkans, partly as a result of the Project’s
activities and training program. BiH had been somewhat isolated from modern developments and
trends due to the conflict and post-conflict situations, but with the Project’s reforms and the
availability of funds to travel to conferences (as part of the training budget), public sector land
administration professionals were able to increase their engagement with their professional
community and also report on the Project’s results in international conferences, such as in the
annual land conference held by the Bank in Washington, DC. Both Entities are regularly
represented in the annual Regional Conference on Cadastral and Spatial Data Infrastructure
(covering all countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania) and are included in EU-supported
project “Inspiration? for joint support in developing a spatial data infrastructure compatible with
EU requirements. This has had a valuable impact on institutional development and reinforced
support for the Project sponsored reforms, and thus the political support for, and sustainability of,
those reforms.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Three surveys of customers—both private persons and professionals—on the land registries and
cadastre offices were undertaken in 2005, 2007 and 2010. Survey questions and methodology
remained the same for all three years, so the results are comparable. The main conclusions from
the surveys are:
    • clients were generally satisfied with services at the project close, with some 60.4 percent
        of respondents saying that the land registry had satisfied their request, and 52.8 percent of
        cadastre customers stating that they were very satisfied;
    • their knowledge about services had increased during the project and the most common
        sources of information were television and radio;
    • the time taken to resolve cases had decreased during the project, with growth in the
        category of “30 minutes or less? to process an application (from 49.4 percent in 2005 to
        56.9 percent in 2010);
    • professionals were pleased with the training and seminars on land administration that had
        been provided;


                                                 16
   •   problems still remain, including lack of harmonized data between the land registries and
       cadastre offices and the cost of services.

With regard to corruption, the customer survey specifically asked respondents if they had to pay
a bribe in the land registry office in both the 2007 and 2010 surveys. While the number for
individuals paying a bribe was quite low (3.2 percent in 2007; 4.3 percent in 2010), the number
of those paying bribes when visiting the courts as representatives of legal entities was higher
(11.2 percent in 2010). However, these numbers should be regarded with some skepticism as
this type of corruption is often under-reported. The new Project will continue to address
corruption issues in the land sector. A longer summary of the final report of 2010 appears in
Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. The risks are twofold: financial and
institutional. These risks are particularly relevant to the registration function in the FBiH.
Registration in the FBiH is managed by the local courts with oversight from the MOJ. However,
when the LRU was initially discontinued there was no specific office within the MOJ responsible
for this supervision. There is also no guarantee of sufficient financing to continue to support the
reforms—maintain the new equipment, continue training and most crucially to pay for the IT
system maintenance and development. As an immediate effect the MOJ has not managed to
finance the communication lines- and maintenance contracts of the land registration software in
use in the court land registers in the FBiH. These risks are particular to land registry systems
managed through the decentralized justice system because funding will depend on the priorities
of the Court President. In the RS, the decision to take the registration function out of the courts
will help to mitigate this risk. For the FBiH this is an important issue for the new project to
address.

With regard to the cadastre, there are comparable risks as the land registries in the FBiH because
the cadastre is operated by municipalities. The issue is less relevant in the RS as the GA is a
centrally led administrative agency with a direct budget control over its field offices and now,
both the registration and cadastre functions.

Given that the new project is due to start less than a year after the Project’s closing, the risks are
substantially reduced. It should be noted that the inclusion of a subcomponent for project
preparation for a new project was in recognition that all reforms were unlikely to be achieved
within the project period and that a second phase would be required. The new project will
address long-term issues of institutional funding and sustainability directly under the Component
3.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Satisfactory

The Task Team consisted of a number of well respected, knowledgeable and capable specialists
who were able to draw on local and counterparts’ knowledge to formulate the Project’s objective,
targets and activities. The team accurately identified what was needed at a preliminary stage to
improve land administration, and it then formulated a clear, measurable and realistic set of
activities to deliver the improvements. In general, the project design matched the needs and
capacity of country, identified the elements of a well-functioning land administration system,
matched them with appropriate components, and tailored the design to overcome risks or
minimize their consequences.

The Task Team was helped in this regard by its members’ long and varied experience in land
administration, in the ECA region and elsewhere, and a thorough knowledge of best practice in
land administration in Europe. Lessons learned and experience from projects over the previous
two decades were incorporated into the design, with the result that the elements and the mix were
consistent with best practice. Further, the Task Team had extensive experience in transition
economies in the region, particularly the countries of former Yugoslavia, and made a detailed
and thorough assessment of the situation in the BiH. This ensured that the design was appropriate
to the transitional nature of the country’s economy and its public administration.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory

Bank supervision was generally appropriate and well-targeted throughout the Project. The aide
memoires show how the supervision team identified problems promptly, how they delivered
clear assessments, and how they accepted inevitable developments and provided appropriate and
direct advice to move forward. The team did an admirable job in supervising effectively two
projects - one in the FBiH and one in the RS—on a limited supervision budget.

Like the design team, the supervision team was composed of skilled and long experienced
specialists who had both designed and supervised projects of this kind in the ECA region and
elsewhere. The team included key specialists from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) utilizing the World Bank/FAO partnership program, specialists provided
by donors and other consultants as needed. In the BiH, the team accurately identified issues at an
early stage during implementation and demonstrated flexibility and technical competence in
responding to and dealing with such problems or unforeseen events. Further, the team carefully
targeted the TA provided through GTZ on a continuous basis to increase its impact on improving
land administration. Finally, the team provided considered and well-thought out responses to
requests by counterparts.

The team developed close working relationships with the counterparts at all levels, and the client
stated that they were fully satisfied with the Bank team, the guidance provided and the level of
cooperation and collaboration.


                                                18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Satisfactory

The efforts of the Bank preparation and supervision teams ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation, and in doing so, strongly supported and
pushed forward the Project’s activities for achieving the development outcomes.




                                              19
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance: Satisfactory

The national level government played a very small role in the Project, although a more vivid role
was anticipated at the project design. That role was limited to formally negotiating, adopting and
ratifying the Project and financing documents, and, once the Project had commenced,
involvement in LACAB, which was chaired by a representative from the State level MOJ. As
previously noted, land administration is an Entity level responsibility, however the Land
Administration Sector Policy and Strategy for the BiH was approved by LACAB.

The Entity governments in the FBiH and the RS approved many changes to their legal
frameworks and adopted the important joint strategy. They showed solid commitment to the
Project throughout its implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Satisfactory

As with all Bank-financed projects the implementing agencies needed time to understand Bank
procedures. Once they understood the Bank’s procedures and the necessity to implement quickly
the project activities, all of the involved implementing entities performed well and were engaged
and focused on the project and the land administration reforms.

Overall, both Entity MOJs were closely engaged. They took an active interest, established the
LRUs and provided office space for the LRUs promptly. They gave good access to supervision
missions, responded positively to requests, and promoted the land registry reforms.

The GAs and the courts administration in both Entities were closely involved in implementation
and performed well.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Satisfactory

The government’s involvement in implementation was strong, active and positive. The borrower
complied with all covenants and agreements, delivered on the actions agreed during supervision
missions, and actively supported and put in place the activities leading to achievement of the
development outcomes.




                                               20
6. Lessons Learned

Focus in the early stages of similar projects in land registration development should be on
establishing the functioning system rather than on the covering data. The project followed a
common strategy used in the Bank’s ECA land projects, i.e., that facilitation of emerging real
property markets requires efficient registration systems to be quickly established to allow
sporadic registration as transactions happen. The systems are especially needed in areas where
high market activity occurs. Otherwise informality prevails and many potential investments are
lost. If project investments were focused mainly on systematic registration and harmonization of
records the improvements in service to citizens would have been delayed. Also, as very
expensive methodologies for systematic registration were proposed, this would have diverted the
impact from the customers, who had an immediate need for services, to geographical areas where
many did not yet need these services. The project focused on developing processes, premises and
working conditions countrywide, and helped to introduce performance standards and customer
orientation to all offices, and thus succeeded in having a nationwide impact and results. The
second part of ECA’s strategy for land projects is that once the registration system is in place and
serving business, family, and public sector (sporadic) needs, the focus can turn to the data. This
is included in the new project. Thus, the lesson learned is to start land registration development
by ensuring a functional system is put in place and, once the system is up and running, move
towards expanding the data.

In a country with limited IT capacity, an incremental, inclusive and compliant ICT development
approach is the best practice. Unlike many other land administration projects at the time, the
project adopted an incremental approach to ICT development. This started with the development
of an IT strategy, building staffing and resources, and, most importantly, the process had realistic
expectations. The technologies provide unlimited possibilities; the constraints lie in the
institutions; in their resources and their capacities. The strategy was to follow step by step the
general trend of moving from digitization to automation and onwards to data linking, processing
and sharing through the internet. The existing experience was always utilized and simple
technologies and solutions were applied to new development (such as the FBiH cadastre
software, which had no prior software in use). With existing software (such as the land register
software in the FBiH land registers) the approach was to facilitate error correction and to
introduce system upgrades and additional functionalities. Data quality was systematically
improved through separate contracts and user representatives were involved in the design of
functionalities. National and international standards were complied with to ensure system
interoperability with key government registers. The incremental, modular, improvements
required short periods to implement and the user satisfaction was high. This did require a great
deal of support from the Bank team, which was provided through the FAO cooperative program.
At the time, it was common across the region to introduce sophisticated real property registration
systems through a large development contract. Many of them took years to prepare and many
years to implement, and some failed altogether. The process of preparation, contracting and
implementation proved too challenging for public sector organizations with low ICT capacity to
handle. The processing of large contracts was also too long and often technology advanced faster
than the tendering and implementation period. In the BiH, these problems were avoided by
building on the existing solutions and progressing incrementally from simple solutions step by


                                                21
step towards more sophisticated solutions. The government’s capacity increased along the
process and big risks and failures were avoided. Thus it is recommended to: apply incremental
approach to land administration ICT development in order to: serve the needs quickly with
operational systems; make use of the latest technologies; and be able to mitigate risks effectively.
Building in-house capacity is another great benefit of this approach.

Locally based real estate registration systems are no longer feasible in the 21st century. The
decentralized dual agency real estate registration setup retained in the FBiH is a challenge for
today’s real estate registration domain, which operates joint ICT systems and infrastructure, and
is linked to other public datasets. Real estate registration in the FBiH is already reliant on
functioning ICT systems and the dependency will increase in the future. Clients will visit
government offices less frequently and electronic services will prevail. This is all in line with
improving governance in the e-government environment leading to improvements in service
standards, linkages with related services in other agencies and greater utilization of the
information available. The challenge lies in ensuring adequate funds and resources, and timely
decisions in a coordinated manner for the required continuous investment in software, databases,
licenses, equipment and networks. This is particularly challenging in the situation where the
responsibilities are spread across the central-, cantonal- and municipal governments as in the
FBiH. The project approach was understandable due to the initial low capacity in the client
institutions, which were addressed through training, business planning and adoption of
performance standards. However, the team remains concerned that a final sustainable set up for
ensuring quality of service and efficiency in the FBiH is not yet established. This conclusion has
had an impact on the new project design, which will have a strong focus in improving the
institutional sustainability for real estate registration in both Entities. A modern real estate
registration system needs to operate integrated information systems, draw information online
from their original public source, have clearly designated hosts and well established long term
financial arrangements.

An extensive results framework can be a positive factor in project implementation. By the time
of the project design there was already an initial reporting system in place supported by the GTZ
TA. The results framework of the project and the monitoring and evaluation system utilized were
extensive compared to those normally used in Bank funded operations. However, this was a
judgment call made during project preparation and it was felt that the detailed monitoring and
evaluation work could be managed. Both Entity LRUs were able to develop and maintain solid
monitoring and evaluation systems, which became important as a decision making tool and was
used when allocating project resources to reach targets. The extensive monitoring was also
excellent for the Bank team to monitor project progress. The quarterly reports were of a high
standard, which greatly eased and helped to focus the team’s technical work. The only downside
is that the monitoring and evaluation functions were project focused and data collection ended
when the project closed. However, the new project will continue to monitor many of the same
indicators and the institutional knowledge is not lost. The new project will endeavor to integrate
the new project’s monitoring and evaluation function within the government’s permanent
systems during the project period. In conclusion, an extensive project results framework can be a
positive asset, if the indicators reflect actual needs and the client has the capacity for proper
monitoring.

Focus on what is achievable and build on successes: Projects in any country should focus on
technical, practical reforms that can be delivered and incrementally developed, even if these
appear to be very modest at the outset. The Project found low levels of capacity and a lack of
readiness to undertake cadastral survey work because conventional methods were not affordable.
It was only through prolonged work that the capacity increased and through pilot work that
approaches for the cadastral survey work could be agreed. Ambitious activities should only be
undertaken once they are demonstrated as successes, which can be built upon, and capacity has
been proven. The lesson is that land projects require realistic aims and pragmatic approaches that
increase in ambition success by success.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Implementing agency representatives from both Entities have agreed and endorsed the content,
ratings and lessons in the ICR (See Annex 7).

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

GTZ, in their comments to the draft ICR, praised the cooperation with the World Bank as
mutually beneficial, positive for the beneficiaries and a model that should be replicated in other
projects. They acknowledged the moment of friction between the TA and the government, which
stemmed from the differences over the funding of the local experts. They suggest that the
transfer of responsibilities should be addressed at a very early stage of TA projects.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

General

The project development objective was to facilitate the orderly development of transparent land
markets through registration of real estate rights and complimentary policies that enable
transactions to be made with security and efficiency. The LRP helped to improve the security of
land rights and make transactions more efficient and transparent through its support to the
registration of real estate rights in the local court based land registration offices in the FBiH and
in the REC in the RS. This project was successful and achieved its development objective to
develop land markets through secure and efficient real estate registration. The registration
performance and quality have improved, backlogs have been reduced and customer satisfaction
has improved. All three components of the Project mostly achieved or exceeded their targets.
The real estate registration domain in both Entities has leapfrogged into the era of digital data,
automated systems and online access to records.

Component A; Registration

The main focus of the project lay in this Component which was to develop a more efficient and
transparent registration system in both Entities. This was to be done through: improving the
transparency, speed and accuracy of transactions (buy, sell, inherit, mortgage, lease); increase the
number of properties registered; and incorporate the apartment register (Book of Deposited
Contracts) into the main land registry.

Summary. This component was, in general, implemented very well and resulted in more modern,
complete, useable and customer friendly land registries serving customers in hours and days
rather than in months as at the project start. Service standards and business plans were developed
and implemented in the court land registries. Publicity campaigns were successfully conducted
and information from the registry was made available online for both Sarajevo and Banja Luka.
In the FBiH, 24 land registry offices, 4 land registry branch offices and 5 cadastre offices were
renovated and equipped, and in the RS, 16 land registry offices and two cadastre offices were
renovated. The backlog of unresolved cases was dramatically reduced and nearly all land book
records have been digitized (99 percent in the FBiH and 98 percent in the RS). The outcome of
all of this is that now in the FBiH the majority of transactions are complete within 5 days and
while 39 percent of courts register mortgages within one day and 21 percent of courts register
mortgages within 2-5 days; in the RS, 53 percent of transactions are completed within one day.
IT system upgrades were introduced into the land registration software.

A1—Development of service standards and annual business plans: New business plans were
developed and service standards adopted. The service standards include a number of key
provisions to improve service to customers: providing special reception area for clients in land
registry and cadastre offices; providing required assistance and counsel to clients in filling-in
requests; enabling clients to comment on performance of staff either in written or verbal form
(confidential address or phone number); displaying in a visible place in the court/municipality
working hours of land registry or cadastre office and break time; providing a list of all types of
documents that clients can obtain, and what is the procedure; displaying a list of all documents


                                                 25
that clients must enclose for certain types of registration and various requests; ensuring that
information about amounts of fees visible and available to all clients; providing printed
brochures on land administration reform objectives and progress with the aim of keeping service
users informed.

A2—Improvements to working conditions and public reception areas: The Project through this
component provided good working conditions in the land registers held in local Courts through
office renovations and supply of equipment, furniture and archives. Nearly all the land
registration offices have been renovated: 24 offices in the FBiH representing 104 percent of the
target and 16 in the RS representing 100 percent of the target. Better working conditions and
proper customer reception areas improve service and reduce opportunities for corruption by
separating front office (for receipt of requests for transactions) from back office where the work
is completed.

A3—Apartment registration: The methodology for incorporating apartments into the court
registers (FBiH) and into the REC (RS) has been developed. The original intention was to
incorporate apartments directly into the property register; this was found to be difficult based on
the existing legal framework. Following the mid-term review, the outcome indicator was
changed to require the development of a methodology for incorporating apartments into the main
land registry by the end of the Project. The issue of many apartment buildings lacking formal
building permission and other documents needed for registration has also presented obstacles. A
review of the legal framework in the FBiH was completed in November 2010, and it addresses
these and other issues and the methodology for incorporating apartments in the FBiH has been
completed and incorporated into a draft law. In the RS, apartment registration continues to be
managed by the GA and under the law change creating a single entity for cadastre and
registration in the RS all data on property will be merged into one system. The implementation
of apartment registration is included in the new Real Estate Registration Project.

A4—Data harmonization, data entry and system integration: Backlogs have been virtually
eliminated, and the data in the land registry books digitized (99 percent in the FBiH and 98
percent in the RS). In addition the Project has supported the updating and matching of land
registry and cadastre records to improve the accuracy of the information and the speed of
service: 23 percent of registry records in the FBiH and 26 percent in the RS—both exceeding the
20 percent target.

A5—Technical assistance and training: GTZ successfully provided the technical assistance for
registration financed directly by grants from Sweden, Germany and Austria. The purpose of the
preparation and implementation of the systematic training and education program was to
strengthen employees' capacities, and thus strengthen the capacities of the land administration
sector institutions, with the aim of improving efficiency and quality of the provision of services
to users. In the FBiH, the systematic education was carried out in decentralized manner in order
to ensure simpler access to education participants, thus achieving better results. Each seminar is
implemented in the four locations in the Federation—Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla and Bihac. A total
of 39 seminars attended by 1,047 participants were completed, of which 565 were Cadastre
employees, 330 Land Registry Offices and 61 employees of the Administration for Spatial
Planning. From the perspective of gender equality, 55 percent of attendees at the education or
training events were women. Renovation and refurbishment of the four centers for education of
the land administration sector were completed in Sarajevo, Gradacac, Capljina and Cazin.

In 2009, an International Congress on Land Administration was organized jointly by Entity
MOJs and GAs with the technical support of SIDA/ADA/GTZ. The Congress was very
successful with 370 participants attending from around the region. The education of staff in the
RS covered twelve topics in IT, law and human resource management. The training was held in
the Education Centers in Banja Luka and East Sarajevo during the months of September and
October 2011. There were 82 seminars held, attended by 633 participants.

All of the above sub-components contributed to the timeliness and improved quality of services
provided by the land registration offices in both Entities. In the FBiH the majority (60 percent) of
transactions are completed within 5 days; in the RS, 53 percent of transactions are completed
within one day. In the RS 53 percent of the registration offices register mortgages within a day
and in the FBH 39 percent of the offices register mortgages within a day. The average time for
the mortgage registration is 4 days in the FBiH, which represents a significant decrease from the

                                                                    27
average of 65 days in 2007. These improvements in service times have been achieved while at
the same time the number of requests has doubled in the land registry offices from 35,818 in
2006 to more than 70,000 in 2011.

The client surveys commissioned in 2010 confirmed a significant increase in user satisfaction
with services provided. The improved service level was also confirmed in discussions with
private sector representatives (several notaries and real estate brokers). For example, the land
register in Sarajevo registers mortgages and property rights in a matter of days instead of the
months or years it took to register property rights before the LRP. BH thus greatly improved its
profile in the World Bank Doing Business annual report since 2007, from 331 days to register a
property to 25 days in 2012. This compares well with the regional average of 30 days and OECD
average of 26 days. IT systems have been introduced and solutions for online access to records
established.


Component B; Cadastre

The objective of this component was to improve the efficiency and speed of providing cadastre
data for registration of property rights; undertake pilots in systematic registration and digitize
cadastre maps; and develop the cadastre IT system. All the activities have been satisfactorily
completed in both Entities.

Summary. In both Entities service standards and business plans for land registry and the cadastre
were developed and implemented. This led to better services, and better functioning of the land
market. The pilot work to develop a methodology for gathering property data and to harmonize
records in both Entities went well despite delays in the RS. Eight pilots (four in each Entity) to
harmonize and update cadastre and land registration information were completed. Lessons
learned and recommendations from the harmonization pilots impacted the design of the new
project, which adopted a mainstreamed process for harmonizing land records. In addition, 1.39
million hectares of maps were digitized and converted into the new IT system allowing for faster
access to, and updating of, cadastre plans. Both Entities developed and implemented good IT

                                                28
systems for maintaining the cadastre. In the RS the system was completed and is now being
upgraded to the new REC system. The RS GA has established a permanent Sector for
Geoinformatics and has existing contracts for system maintenance and telecommunications. In
the FBiH, the new comprehensive software is in use across the Federation.

B1- Provision of data services: The documents on service standards and business plans for the
cadastre have been elaborated, accepted and are being implemented. In the FBiH three cadastre
offices were renovated using project funds and another two using donor funds thereby improving
working conditions for the staff and clients. In the FBiH, the Rulebook for cadastre services was
completed in 2009 and service standards agreed in 2010 and provided in brochures in 2011. The
E-commerce strategy, included within the adopted IT strategy and business plan, was agreed in
2011 and is under implementation. In the RS, the E-commerce strategy and service standards
were completed and approved as part of the GA’s plan for 2011-2015. Efficient services now
provided by cadastral offices in both Entities. In both Entities cadastre extracts and copies of
cadastre maps are provided within one day of the request for this information.

B2—Systematic registration and mapping: The harmonization pilots were completed in the FBiH
in 2011 and in the RS in 2012—8 pilots in total. The experiences from the pilots helped in
defining a model and specifications for completing this work which will be scaled up under the
second phase project. In the FBiH, the systematic updating of the cadastre– in the Capljina and
Gradacac municipalities - were completed with systematic survey, field investigation and
regularization of 8,200 cadastral units. Systematic updating of the cadastre in Ljubuski and
Travnik municipalities were also completed. The subcontractors completed their work on
updating of the cadastral data which were transferred to the Land registry offices in Travnik and
Ljubuski for the systematic registration of property in these cadastral municipalities and updating
and renewal of the land registers.

B3—Digitizing cadastre maps: The majority of maps have been digitized covering 1.4 million
ha in the BH and a total 1,609,202 land registry folios. In the RS, 150 cadastral municipalities,
covering the area of 189,791 ha, was completed under the project. In the FBiH, the strategy for
digitizing cadastre maps was developed and conversion of data in new format was performed
using government and loan funds. Eight tenders were completed covering the surface area of
272,669 ha. The conversion of 427,000 ha in the new survey format was completed through
government funds. Priority in digitalization in the FBiH has been given to the economically more
important areas, municipalities that participate with its own funds in digitalization (co-financing
arrangements) and municipalities covering the Corridor Vc (motorway construction).

B4—Information technology: In both entities a IT Strategy was completed providing the overall
objective, activities, funding requirements and human resource requirements for IT development
in the medium and long term. An initial IT solution to the cadastre system operated by the Entity
level GAs was introduced. In the RS, the GA has a strong IT Unit with 24 staff members in two
main locations. A sustainability plan was developed, which covers users and IT staff training,
communication infrastructure, maintenance of the existing IT systems. The IT system was
developed and rolled out to all GA offices. In the FBiH, the cadastre IT system has been rolled
out in all the offices and a capable Geoinformatics department has been established in the FBiH GA.
All 37 land registration offices (28 land register offices and 9 branch offices) in the FBiH operate


                                                29
the recently upgraded land registration software called e-Grunt. The system covers a wide range
of functionalities inclusive of the central database replication from the land registers.

B5—Technical assistance and training: The technical assistance support by GTZ/SIDA/ADA
helped to organize systematic training and education of employees in the land administration
sector in both Entities and achieved satisfactory results.


Component C; Policy development and project management

Project management in both Entities was good throughout the project and a great number of
legislative initiatives were completed. Social surveys were done in 2005, 2007 and 2010, and a
property market study was completed in 2012. Monitoring and evaluation work was excellent,
and procurement and financial management efficiently completed.

Summary. The Land Administration Sector Policy and Strategy for the BiH, which includes
plans for addressing a wider variety of land administration concerns, was completed and adopted
and is a significant achievement for the future of land administration in the country. Good
progress was also made in the development of legislation and in preparation of detailed plans for
the future activities of the cadastre and registration services. Each Entity has prepared detailed
plans with costs calculated for the land registration and cadastre activities that need to be
undertaken over the next few years. The FBiH has a comprehensive program of activities
developed and the RS has an officially approved mid-term program (MTP) for the coming five
years (2011 to 2015). The RS Law on Cadastre that unified land registries to the cadastre was
adopted initially in June 2011 and then after a constitutional challenge was revised and the new
Survey and Cadastre law of the RS became effective in February 2012. The RS Law on Property
Rights was also adopted. Policy options and legislation dealing with informal properties,
planning and development and property taxes were also completed.

The major policy achievement was achieved in 2011 when the State level Land Administration
Coordination Board (LACAB) produced a Land Administration Sector Policy and Strategy for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which further elaborated the vision 2016 and integrated Entity level
Strategies into a joint Policy. Both Entities have prepared corresponding plans for
implementation. The FBiH has a comprehensive program of activities developed and the RS GA
have an officially approved mid-term program (MTP) for the coming five years (2011 to 2015).
Both programs are logical and well prepared and were used as the base for the repeater project
design.

The RS National Assembly adopted the new Law on Survey and Cadastre in 2011. In 2008, the
RS adopted the Law on property rights (which together with the Law of Obligations is a
cornerstone of any legislature) and the Law on Court Taxes and Fees (Official Gazette of the
Republic of Srpska, No. 73/08). In early 2010, the Law on Property Rights was enacted. In the
first quarter of 2011, the RS adopted the Law on Construction Land and proposed amendment to
the Law on Privatization. RS passed a new Law on Construction and Spatial planning, which
was published in the Official Gazette No. 55 of 14 June 2010. The Ministry of Finance, with the
support of USAID, drafted the Law on Taxation of Property and it is currently working on


                                                30
establishing the Fiscal Cadastre within the Tax Administration of Republic of Srpska. The Law
on Electronic Signature and Law on E-business have been adopted, which are important pre-
conditions for transition to e-Government.

In the FBiH, the draft the Law on Property (real estate rights) was scheduled for consideration by
the House of Representatives of FBH Parliament on December, 2012. The draft Law on Cadastre
in the FBiH was under discussion for several years and was finally withdrawn in the autumn of
2012. Instead, the Minister of MOJ has appointed a legislative commission to draft a new Law
on Real Estate Cadastre and Surveys. Policy and development of legislation relating to planning,
building permitting, informal constructions, property taxes and valuation methods were
completed and the overarching issues relating to land administration and land management were
constantly discussed and reviewed.

In the FBiH, the Public Information Campaign (PIC) was done in two phases. Phase I sensitized
the public at large to the rationale and importance of land and real property registration, the
rights and obligations of land and real estate owners as the public usually perceives the land
registration and cadastre system as a basis for acquiring their rights, forgetting that ownership
also presents obligation, i.e. to maintain the ownership records up-to-date. During the second
phase, the PIC gradually shifted its messages from awareness raising to educating the public
regarding the government’s plans to improve the registration systems and, while new digital
information archives and registries are put in place, encourage the citizens, municipal authorities
as well as state and private enterprise managers and owners to register their properties in the
revamped registration system. Additionally, the goal of the PIC was to develop communication
capacity in responsible institutions in order to ensure adequate and timely provision of
information to their clients beyond the Land Registration Project’s lifetime.

Both Entities prepared and passed general ICT strategies and progressed with the first phase of
implementation. The repeater project will support further investment. The RS has a good ICT
sustainability plan, a department for geoinformatics that maintains the systems (or supervises
external contracts for some system requirements), including the telecommunications
infrastructure. The FBiH passed a strategy on e-commerce for cadastral works; the FBiH courts
are all linked to one wide area network, and plans for the establishment of a permanent IT
telecommunication infrastructure for cadastral offices have been adopted and implementation has
started.

In the RS, a new law in June 2011 unified the land register and cadastre into one centralized
institution, the REC at the GA. Shortly thereafter, 16 of the 19 courts handed over their land
registers, staff and some resources to the GA. The new law, however, was challenged in the
Constitutional Court. The three remaining courts did not transfer their records as they were
awaiting the Constitutional Court’s decision. In the meantime, the RS government developed a
revised law to address the constitutional concerns. The new Survey and Cadastre law in the RS
was enacted and came into force on February 3, 2012 and the remaining three courts Bijeljina,
Trebinje and Srebrenica proceeded to hand over their land books, staff and equipment to the GA.
In October 2012, the BiH Constitutional Court determined that the Law was in accordance with
BiH Constitution.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) economy has developed since the project’s inception in 2007.
Despite the economic crisis, GDP is at US$18 billion now compared to US$15 billion in 2007,
although the GDP growth rate is relatively low at 1.8 percent as it is still recovering from the
financial crisis. BiH has suffered a slightly slower recovery from the economic crisis than other
similar Eastern European economies (see graph). As an upper middle income country and a
potential European Union candidate country attempting to align with acquis requirements its
economy still is faced with unique challenges compared to its neighbors. The central state-level
BiH government was granted limited responsibilities under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement
and includes two largely autonomous Entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH)
and Republika Srpska (RS). It also includes a self-
governing district, Br?ko, under the direct authority of the
central state government. While its citizens and authorities
have successfully restored peace in the nation, and per
capita GDP has increased more than eightfold since 1995,
the unique government structure makes for a complex and
onerous policy-making environment which is often
fragmented between the state and entities, leading to slow
decision-making and an unclear division of powers (EIU,
2010 and 2009 EC Progress Report). As a result of these
political intricacies investors often are hindered by a lack of information and delayed project
preparation or forgone investments altogether. Since the financial crisis, the policy framework
for the investment climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been set by the Stabilization and
Associate Agreement with the EU (2008) and terms of the stand-by arrangement with IMF
(2009).

Mortgage loans as a financial product were introduced only shortly before the crisis, and hence
were not hit severely by high rates of defaults or foreclosures. According to the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s 2010 Financial Stability Report, the quality of long-term claims on
households such as housing loans was more susceptible to idiosyncratic risk than the worsening
of macroeconomic conditions. For most banks in the system the share of housing loans as a
proportion of total non-performing loans was not significant. Banks began reintroducing housing
loans as a financial product last year because of an increase in activities in home construction.
However, with consumer lending rates over 2 percent higher than the mortgage rate (10.0 percent
and 7.7 percent Effective Interest Rate respectively), consumer lending is much more profitable
for the banks; furthermore, interviews with bank associations confirmed that the banks often use
consumer lending with guarantors in place of mortgage financing due to issues relating to the
registration of property.

At the time of the project inception, lack of policy development in land administration and
inefficiencies within the land registry services hindered business development and hence stifled
real-estate investment in the country. Professionals, businesses and citizens alike were
frustrated with long waiting times to process a transaction, the several trips required to the local
offices to finalize a transaction, and high costs in the local registry and cadastre offices, all of
which made it difficult to complete basic real estate transactions or borrow money based on


                                                 33
property as collateral. The project aimed to provide similar benefits as in other land
administration projects, including increased security of tenure, a decrease in transaction costs,
improved access to land administration services, and improved public sector management
associated with improved governance.

According to the Study on Real Estate Market Dynamics, 5 the land market is now functioning
well in urban areas although it is hindered by uncertainties and delays in obtaining registration
documents and construction permits. BiH is considered to have successfully completed the first
phase on institutional building and establishment of basic registers along with the systems and
services needed to maintain and update them. Now the entities need to work to reduce market
distortions, encourage greater investment and growth by improving the quality of the data held in
the registers, harmonize the entries and address the problems of illegal construction and idle land.
Illegal properties are still not selling as they cannot be easily registered in the land book due to
missing construction permits. Regardless, the GDP components related to real estate, renting
services and imputed rent has grown over 50 percent since 2005 (Statistical Yearbook 2011).
According to the Study on Real Estate Market Dynamics, the overarching problem at the current
time is the lack of harmonization of the cadastre and the land register. Fortunately, a new Real
Estate Registration project financed by the World Bank over the next five years will focus on
harmonizing the cadastre and registration records in the country.

In the latest Doing Business 2013, the country ranked 93 out of a total of 185 countries for
registering a property, improving by eight positions since the 2012 report. Although it still ranks
below the average of other Eastern Europe (EE) & Central Asia (CA) countries in number of
procedures (7 in BiH, 6 in EE & CA) and cost measured as a percent of property value (5.3
percent in BiH, 2.8 percent in EE & CA), it greatly improved its position 44 places from 2008,
not least due to the benefits gained from the Land Registration Project. Furthermore, the effects
of the Survey and Cadastre Law (2012) in Republika Srpska, which required the Geodetic
Administration to take over Ministry of Justice land registries in all courts, are only beginning to
be felt; the takeover should eliminate the need to travel to both a registration and cadastre office
and result in a reduction in fees.

The Land Registration Project which ran from 2007-2012 made excellent progress technically in
terms of digitizing the land register and cadastre maps and creating an operational IT system for
the land registry. Operationally, the project was successful in eliminating the backlogs in the
registry office which helped to reduce the number of days for processing applications for
property and mortgage registrations. The renovation of the offices helped increase the operating
efficiency in the offices, as did the training of staff and introduction of more streamlined
processes.

Efficiency Gains

According to the PAD, most requests took 30 to 90 days to complete, and a growing backlog of
pending requests totaled over 200,000 at the project’s inception. The Customer Survey of the
Social and Institutional Analysis in 2005 found that approximately half of the respondents visited
the land registry office some 2 to 5 times to resolve a transaction, 13 percent between 6 and 10
times and 11 percent made more than 10 visits. Each visit lasted approximately 50 minutes with
long delays particularly in the Sarajevo office. This clearly had a negative impact on
development of financial markets by creating uncertainty for potential investors.

The service standards introduced under the Project, combined with the nearly complete
digitization 6 of land records significantly reduced the time needed to register a transaction. The
digitization, along with increased training and organization of personnel in land registry offices,
led to the reduction in number of backlogs of unresolved cases, 7 as the digitization contributed to
the acceleration of processing the request. Due to these improvements, transactions are now
completed within one working day for more than half of the clients (53 percent) in the RS. In the
FBiH, 39 percent of courts register mortgages within one day and 21 percent of courts register
mortgages within 2-5 days.

Fewer visits were also recorded in the latest Social Survey (2010); 35.8 percent of the
respondents cited that they only had to visit the land registry office once in order to resolve a
certain issue and the percentage of those who visited the land registry office more than five times
had decreased significantly from 24.2 percent in 2005 to 15.3 percent in 2010. The estimated
number of needed visits in order to resolve a certain problem is lowest with the second category
courts.

As a result of the efficiency improvements in the operations within the registration offices there
have been considerable improvements in the average time spent at the office per transaction. The
average time spent at the office by the majority of clients per visit has been reduced to 30
minutes, down from 50 minutes; in addition, assuming that those clients on average needed to
visit the offices 8 times, the average number of visits per transaction was reduced to 3.3 down
from 3.9. Thus the average time spent at the office per transaction was reduced from 197 minutes
to 99 minutes, which is a 50 percent improvement. As mentioned in the PAD, the opportunity
cost in terms of lost wages of multiple trips to the registry office, especially for poorer people,
may represent a significant portion of their income. This reduction in average time spent at the
office per registration can therefore be translated into monetized economic benefits. At 114,000
transactions in 2011 and an hourly wage rate of BAM 5.25 (US$3.24) this equates to an annual
economic benefit of just over US$602,057. These efficiency gains would be even larger if one

  In the FBiH, 99% of the total number of the land registry folios were digitized (1,030,000), which is an increase of
966 percent in comparison to the baseline figure of 96,000. In the RS, 98 percent (or 454,000) of the entries were
digitized from old books.
7
  Backlogs have decreased from 35 percent in 2007 to 2.5 percent in 2012. In 2007 number of pending cases in 19
offices of basic courts in the RS was 17,346. Automation of courts, training of workers and reorganization, all
funded from the loan has resulted in a reduction to 80,000 by 2010, a reduction of 54 percent. 8106 of these were in
the Banja Luka land registry office, which has now been reduced to 2,000.

                                                         35
included the monetary benefit of the increased productivity of government workers in the
registration offices implied by the faster transaction times.

Furthermore, the number of registration requests and registered mortgages significantly
increased. In the FBiH, the number of registration requests was 70,561 in 2011, an increase of 37
percent since 2007 when 51,352 transactions were registered. It should be noted that the number
of transaction requests in 2011 is an increase of 96 percent since 2006 when only 35,819 requests
were registered. Registered mortgages increased over 44 percent from 4,405 8 in 2007 to 6,357
in 2011. By the end of March 2012, a total of 60,349 mortgages were registered in the
Electronically Maintained Land Registry. 45.3 percent of these were transferred from the old
books, while 46.4 percent were newly submitted and registered requests for registration of
mortgages. The remaining 8.3 percent were the mortgages that were taken over from the Real
Estate Cadastre. In the RS, the number of registered transactions actually decreased 26 percent
from 14,445 in 2007 to 10,657 in 2011. However, the number of registered mortgages in the RS
in 2011 was 3,244 which is a significant increase of 138 percent since 2007. The increase of
registered mortgages in both entities indicates a positive trend in the until recent non-existent
mortgage market in BiH, however, it should be noted that the regulation of mortgages still fails
to meet the new needs of the market, and new regulation of the mortgage law is needed for the
modern banking sector.

Most importantly there is an evident trend in the increase in satisfaction with the services
received in the municipality cadastres. In 2005, one-third of the respondents expressed
satisfaction with received services while 52.8 percent in 2010 stated they are very satisfied with
the services given to them in the cadastre. The same level of satisfaction was observed at both
the registry and cadastre offices. Transparency has greatly increased as well; in the PAD, 13
percent of the respondents admitted to making informal payments in order to resolve issues,
which averaged about one third of their cash costs, whilst only 4.3 percent of respondents
affirmed that they needed to pay a bribe in the land registry office in the 2010 survey. The
respondents who provided the bribe in most cases believed that bribery was part of the system of
land administration. The digitization and decrease in backlogs which lead to an increase in
quality of services provided also led to more up-to-date information, thus eliminating
opportunities for corruption.

In the Customer Survey conducted before the PAD, there was a widespread perception that the
land registry and cadastre offices do not treat clients equally, and those with personal or political
connections receive much better services. The land registry and cadastral office clients believed
some 10 percent of clients have been discriminated against because of their ethnic heritage or
gender. According to the 2010 Social Survey the most frequent visitors to the land registry are
unemployed citizens (51.4 percent), domestic workers (70 percent), and those who evaluate their
socioeconomic status as “average? (52.3 percent). A consistent finding was that only a low
percentage of respondents (approximately 5 percent) report being faced with some form of
discrimination when visiting the registration office, and in fact, respondents who were more than



8
    estimated


                                                 36
50 years of age (8.3 percent) and those who state that the economic status is above average (13
percent), more frequently reported having experiences with discrimination than those of other
ages and economic status groups. The PAD also mentioned that poorer people have less access to
information on land administration procedures, less bargaining power due to their poor access to
land administration data, and are generally unaware of the availability of legal aid services.
According to the 2010 Social Survey, close to one-half of respondents (41.4 percent of
respondents) indicated that they are better or significantly better informed now compared to three
years ago regarding the work of the land administration.

Digitization of the land records also made the introduction of online access to land registry data
possible, which is becoming more popular as a source. A survey of professionals indicated at
least half use the Internet to inform themselves about the land administration reform, although
less than 10 percent indicated that they do this on a daily basis. As more services become
available through an online system over the next few years, efficiency and transparency are
expected to increase considerably.

Overall, the project was a success as measured by the majority of respondents (70 percent) in
2010 who stated there had been a general improvement in the work of the land administration
sector since 2005. However, harmonization is still an issue. In 2010, 24 percent stated they had
problems because the activities of the land registry office and cadastre were not harmonized,
representing only a small improvement compared to 28 percent in 2005. In fact, in the survey of
professionals, 95.3 percent emphasized harmonization of cadastre and land registry data as the
top propriety. The developed strategy for digitization of cadastre maps in the FBiH and the
conversion of data into a new format, as well as the actual conversion of 427,000 ha in the new
format completed so far, are crucial as they serve as the basis for harmonization of data with the
land registry and system integration and for the overall goal of implementing a digital land
administration system which will publish all data from the land registry and cadastre. It will also
contribute to even more improvements in efficiency and speed of providing data and service to
the clients.

Fiscal Impact

According to the PAD, land registry fees collected annually throughout BiH totaled less than
US$1.6 million, compared to the estimated registry office annual operating costs of less than
US$2.6 million per year. It was noted in the PAD that the revision for the service standards and
fees, combined with improved performance and a dramatic increase in the volume of transactions
will ensure that the land registry offices operate on a full cost-recovery basis for each entity as a
whole. In 2012, the revenue from real estate sales (including collection of fees gained from
recording taxes on capital gains) was US$10.43 million in the RS and US$10.2 million in the
FBiH. The annual cost of the real estate function in the RS was US$23.75 million and US$17.7
million in the FBiH, making the ratio of real estate registration revenues over costs 44 percent in
the RS and 70 percent and 52 percent in the Land registry and Cadastre offices in the FBiH,
respectively. However, through establishment and implementation of business plans for the
registry and cadastral offices, both entities are strengthening their position by improving
coordination among levels of government as expected in the PAD. In fact, respondents in the
2010 Social Survey most frequently stated they were somewhat satisfied with the cooperation

                                                 37
level of professional organizations regarding land administration reform to date. A sustainability
model was attempted in the Real Estate Market study and its results show that currently the
combined cadastral and land registry are operating on a 60 percent cost recovery basis, assuming
the base assumptions are correct. A large proportion of the cadastral income is from the activity
related to surveying, which will decrease with the introduction of private surveyors. However it
is expected that the cadastre will cut staff in this process. The income of the land registry is
currently flat but the introduction of new products and services (i.e., geoinformation and
valuation) offer an opportunity to strengthen opportunities for income generation. The new
project will aim to increase the sustainability of the registration offices and lower these
percentages.

The Government has significantly benefitted from the increase in transactions due to the Project
benefits through an increase in transfer tax revenue. While the possible benefits of the low
property tax rate between 0.05 percent and 0.5 percent depending on the value of the property
may be negligible, the transfer tax of 5 percent in the FBiH and 3 percent in the RS can result in
large increase in tax revenue due to an increase in property prices and higher market turnover
due to the investment in the registration system which would lead to the harmonization of dual
records and mutual non-compliance in the current registration system. At the inception of the
project the annual property transfer tax revenue was US$123 million. Without the project, the
estimated number would have increased to US$159 million by 2012. The market stimulating
effect of the project has, however, increased this number to an estimated US$176 million in 2012,
resulting in a flow of additional tax revenue of US$52.18 million over six years. Assuming that
about 40 percent of this increase is attributable to project activities this amounts to a Present
Value (PV) in 2012 of US$12.52 million at a 12 percent discount rate, a valuable contribution to
the stretched government budget in BiH.

Economic Analysis

Model 1 analyzes the estimated increase in market transaction volume and value as a result of the
improved registration services. This has most importantly led to direct increases in government
tax revenues due to increases in transfer tax collection. The increase in market turnover size also
translates to direct economic project benefits that can be monetized.

Model 2 analyzes the economic benefits through the lens of access to finance. Inefficient
property registration systems as well as an underdeveloped mortgage market have resulted in
higher interest rates as people have been forced to take out consumer loans instead of mortgages.
Implementing a more efficient and secure system, together with benefits to the housing finance
system provided by more accurate property records and elimination of registration delays, has
reduced these spreads. Furthermore, the mortgage rates in BiH have gradually declined with a
strengthening of both the financial sector and real estate registration institutions and an increase
in total mortgage transactions, although currently the mortgage rate is relatively high (7.70
percent) when compared to a similar economy such as Slovenia, where the mortgage rate is
around 3–4 percent.




                                                 38
Model 1 is considered the baseline scenario for the calculation of the Net Present Value (NPV)
and Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The economic benefits identified in Model 2 are added to
an expanded scenario.

Model 1—Property Market Dynamics
Investments in cadastre and registration systems improve access to finance and other investments
in the housing market. Improvements are reflected in the number of transactions as well as the
average property prices, the product of which determine the total market value. Using “with
project? and “without project? scenarios, incremental market growth due to the project is
estimated within the context of a macro model. The estimate has been adjusted for project
coverage and then subjected to further downward adjustment to arrive at a calculation of
incremental benefits attributable to the Project. A sensitivity analysis is also applied. Table 1
shows this approach.

During the course of the Project, market transactions increased from 65,797 in 2007 to 83,880 in
2012, while average property value increased from US$46,715 to US$54,400 (or 52,472 in 2007
dollars). Assumptions are applied to estimate the scenario without the Project. Under a
conservative estimation, it is assumed that the Project had a 1 percent market stimulating effect,
such that without it market transactions would have increased to 83,041 in 2012. For the
estimation of average property values without the Project, it is assumed that the price in real
terms would have increased at an annual rate of 3 percent reaching the value of US$47,895 in
2012.

As a result the Project generated an average incremental market turnover of US$104 million per
annum, assuming a Project coverage rate of 40 percent. Furthermore, assuming that only 20
percent of the incremental turnover can be translated into Project benefits, the PV at a 12 percent
interest rate of this increase in market turnover over 6 years is equal to US$31 million. This is in
addition to the aforementioned US$12.52 million PV generated by the additional real estate tax
collected.

Model 2—Mortgage Market Dynamics
As a result of improved access to finance consumers have increasingly had easier access to
mortgages instead of consumer loans. This has led to direct economic benefits as the typical
interest rate on a consumer loan is about 100-250 basis points higher than the interest on a
mortgage. Table 2 outlines an approximation of benefits in the form of avoided interest payments
by consumers. In order to be able to compare scenarios with and without the Project the average
property value is assumed to increase along the same schedule in this model and the project is
also assumed to have had no effect on the volume of property transactions per year.

It is assumed that before and continuing without the Project only 12 percent of all loans made to
consumers are in the form of mortgages, while the remaining 88 percent are in the form of more
expensive consumer loans with a guarantor. With the Project, however, we estimate that after the
6 years of implementation 30 percent of consumers taking out a loan of some kind to finance
their home now have access to mortgages. The mortgage interest rates have been obtained from
Raiffeisenbank Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the consumer loan interest rates are those
published by the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The total number of mortgage


                                                 39
transactions for each year has been inferred by dividing the reported number of new mortgages
by the percentage of total mortgage transactions that those represent. Assuming that the Project
covers 40 percent of all mortgage transactions the avoided interest payments due to the increased
access to mortgages amounts to a benefit with a PV of US$15.65 million at a 12 percent discount
rate over 6 years.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
Model 1 is the baseline scenario for calculation of the NPV and ERR. The economic
benefits of Model 2 are added to an expanded scenario. Assuming project costs of US$15
million during the first year of the Project and a 12 percent discount rate, the baseline
scenario has an NPV of US$17.92 million and an ERR of 47 percent. Including the
economic benefits of Model 2, the expanded scenario has an NPV of US$31.89 million
and an ERR of 61 percent. The economic analysis shows that the investments associated
with the Project provided a reasonable economic return to BiH. Table 3 shows these
calculations.

A sensitivity analysis is conducted to calculate these economic parameters under different
assumptions for the Project’s market stimulating effect. Considering a market stimulating
effect of 5 percent, under the baseline scenario the NPV is 37.90 million with and ERR
85 percent and under the expanded scenario the NVP is US$51.87 million with an ERR
95 percent. If the market stimulating effect is increased to 10 percent, the baseline
scenario gives an NVP of US$62.88 million with an ERR of 133 percent and the
expanded scenario an NPV of US$76.85 million with an ERR 141 percent. Table 4 shows
these results.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Three customer satisfaction surveys were undertaken in connection with the Project: in
2005, 2007 and 2010 by a social research firm of users of the land registration and
cadastre services—both members of the public and professionals. The final survey
consolidates the results from all three, and the key findings are set out below.

Survey of citizens

The survey found that between 2005 and 2010 and on a number of bases, the citizens
were more satisfied with the services of the land registries and cadastre, more informed
about the services, and their cases were resolved more promptly. The most common
service at the land registry was filing a request for information, and there was an increase
in the number of visits that were resolved within 30 minutes: 49.4 percent in 2005 against
56.9 percent in 2010, and the number of visits per case was reduced significantly. Two-
thirds of customers were men, and the most common age group was 36-50 years.

Most respondents advised that they completely received the service they needed at the
land registries (60.4 percent) or that they were partially satisfied (33.4 percent). Similarly,
at the cadastre offices, the level of satisfaction grew, with more than half the respondents
saying that they were very satisfied with the services they received. A very low
percentage reported discrimination, mostly on the basis of advanced age or low socio-
economic status, but not on the basis of gender. Only a small percentage reported any
form of corruption.

A significant problems noted by respondents was the lack of harmonized data between
the land registries and cadastre. In focus groups, they reported problems as:

   •   in the FBiH, prolonged waiting in line, prolonged waiting for necessary
       documents to be issued, lack of information and (known) ways to attain it,
       inability to transact all the necessary procedures in one location, insufficient
       number of employees, and corruption;
   •   in the RS, long waits in lines, and waiting for the completion of procedures and
       the issuance of documents, inadequate facilities, mistakes in issued documents,
       lack of information and lack of adequate ways to gain it, high costs, scarce and
       inadequate staff members, and corruption.

They also noted that more information should be available, and that total costs should be
lower. Few respondents reported that they used legal assistance in 2010 (only 11.5
percent), which is significantly down on 2005 (25.2 percent) and 2007 (15.7 percent).

Almost 30 percent of respondents stated that they had noticed publicity relating to the
land registries and/or cadastre, and some 41.4 percent believed that they are better
informed about the work of land administration. Radio and television were a common
source (32.4 percent) of information.

                                              47
Survey of professionals

Most respondents stated that they are ‘generally satisfied’ with the work of professional
organizations that gather experts to deal with land administration reform issues. Overall,
63.7 percent of respondents state that they are either very or somewhat satisfied.
Respondents most frequently stated that they are ‘somewhat satisfied’ (51.7 percent) with
the cooperation level of professional organizations regarding land administration reform
to date. Overall, the respondents are more satisfied than dissatisfied with this cooperation.

In 2010, respondents were asked how often, if at all, they use the Internet to inform
themselves about the land administration reform. Around one-half of them stated that
they ‘rarely’ use Internet for this purpose, and less than one in ten respondents indicated
that they do on ‘an almost daily basis’.

Respondents were in general satisfied with the offer of training and professional seminars
regarding the land administration reforms to date. 69.3 percent of respondents are
somewhat or very satisfied with these trainings and seminars. Somewhat less than half of
the respondents had had the opportunity to attend at least one seminar in the past three
years (46.9 percent). Overall, the respondents are satisfied with what the seminars they
attended had to offer (90.1 percent state that they are either ‘very’ or ‘somewhat
satisfied’).

Respondents considered themselves to be fairly well informed regarding land
administration in the BiH. Overall, 80.4 percent of respondents stated that they are either
‘very’ or ‘somewhat informed’ about land administration reforms in the BiH. Most of the
respondents (57.4 percent) stated that they are better informed than they were three years
ago.

In the 2010 survey, the respondents were more likely to have stated that their clients are
‘inadequately informed’ about procedures for registration of rights to immovable
property (14 percent in 2010 compared to 8.8 percent in 2007). Respondents were also
less likely to state that their clients are ‘somewhat informed’ (34.7 percent in 2007
compared to 23.8 percent in 2010).

In 2010, the ranking of priorities did not change, and again harmonization of cadastre and
land registry data was emphasized as the top priority (95.3 percent). Also, digitalizing
land registry records seems to have received more priority in 2010 (increasing from 84.5
percent in 2007 to 91.5 percent in 2010), even though its rank did not change.
Respondents from each Entity specified different priorities for the improvement of land
administration service.

The majority of respondents (68.6 percent) in 2010 stated that there had been a general
improvement in the work of the land administration sector since 2007. Less than one-
third believe that there was no change (27.3 percent), while only a small percentage of
respondents state that the situation today is worse than in 2007 (4.2 percent).



                                             48
As in 2007, so too in 2010, analysis of respondents’ comments indicates that they felt it
necessary to stress the importance of issues related to the legal framework, quality and
number of employees in land registry offices, status and salaries of the land registry
clerks, and the need to update land registry data.

According to participants in the FBiH and the RS, in the last five years there have been
improvements in the area of land administration and registration of real estate. However,
in focus groups, they noted the following problems:

   •   in the FBiH, the problems are tied to non-registered ownership of property; in the
       area of coordination of land registry offices and the cadastre; problems with high
       fees; ruined land registry books; and the imprecision of the Law on Land
       Registry;
   •   in the RS, the problems that participants reported facing in the RS are in regards
       to non-registered property; prolonged waiting for the completion of procedures;
       organization; unprofessional staff; and poor work conditions in the land registry
       office, cadastral office and urban planning office.

Participating professionals from the FBiH are satisfied with the speed of work in the land
registry office, cadastral office and urban planning. They are also satisfied with the
availability of information, but dissatisfied with the high fees of experts (lawyers, public
notaries and others) and the high fees. Participating professionals from the RS are more
satisfied with the speed of work of these services compared to earlier periods, but are
dissatisfied with the organization of work in general, the behavior of staff members and
the high fees.

Participating professionals believe that certain positive changes have been achieved with
the land administration reforms. It seems that in the FBiH, the suggestion for further
collaboration between the land registry office and the cadastral office is a priority.
Professionals from the RS suggest the improvement of work conditions, professional
development of staff, higher pay for the staff and stricter penalties for unprofessional
behavior, as well as improvement at higher or broader levels, such as changes in
legislation and society as a whole.

One of three participating professionals from the FBiH believes that it is possible to use
informal ways to complete certain procedures in the land registry office, cadastral office
and urban planning office. Surveyed professionals from the RS agree that the informal
ways, that is bribery and corruption, are very much present in the land registry office,
cadastral office and urban planning.

It seems that professionals from the FBiH and the RS are not much better informed
through the media about land administration reforms than are citizens/clients. A couple of
professionals stated that they been acquainted with the reform via the Internet, while
others do not state that they have been informed through flyers, brochures or through any
form of media.

N/A

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR

The Ministries of Justice in the RS and the FBiH prepared and submitted to the World
Bank ICRs for each Entity. Government representatives from both Entities had the
opportunity to provide comments on the Bank’s draft ICR during a workshop held on
December 11, 2012 in Banja Luka. Summaries of the Borrower’s ICRs and comments on
the Bank’s draft ICR are presented in this section.

Summary of the RS ICR

Context: The RS has made significant progress in post-conflict reconstruction, social
integration and state building. All levels of governments are trying to encourage
economic growth through provision of a business friendly environment, improvement in
the quality of government services and reduction of corruption. Economic growth is
highly dependent on the ability to transform real estate into an asset for production,
housing, and collateral for investment capital. It is therefore imperative that a secure and
publicly accepted means of registering and protecting property rights and transactions
with property is in place.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation: The RS National Assembly adopted the Cadastre
Law in June 2011 unifying the land registry and cadastre into one centralized institution,
the Real Estate Cadastre. This law, however, was challenged in the Constitutional Court.
The unification of the land registry and cadastre finally entered into force with the
adoption of the Survey and Cadastre Law in February 2012.

Borrower’s Performance: The borrower's performance can be assessed as satisfactory
considering the dedication in achieving the project goals and support to the reforms in
judicial sector, which are compliant to these goals. The Government has been meeting its
obligations in respect of the deadlines, solving all the problems that appeared in the
course of the project implementation and regularly performed its obligations in terms of
co-financing. All project activities have been implemented effectively and efficiently.

Bank’s Performance: The Bank's performance can be assessed as satisfactory. Almost all
aspects of the bank's performance are of a high standard. The Bank's engagement and
good project supervision contributed to its successful implementation. The cooperation
between the Bank and Land registration unit has largely strengthened the project
management.

Lessons Learned:
   •   Publishing the service standards for land registry offices on the web site of the
       Ministry of Justice contributed to accessibility and transparency of these services.
       The basic elements of the service standards for the cadastre have been translated

                                             50
       into the work program of the Republic Geodetic Administration for the period
       2011-2015. Such practice should be continued in the future.
   •   In future project, it is desirable to continue seeking donor funds, or similar
       financial instruments, in order to conduct complementary activities such as
       trainings, seminars, study tours, technical assistance, procurement of equipment,
       development of web sites, implementation of pilot projects, etc.
   •   In future projects, a Project Implementation Unit should be better supported in
       terms of human resources, office space, equipment and finances.

Summary of the FBiH ICR

Context: Reform of the land administration sector of the FBiH implies implementation of
demanding and complex activities. The vision of the land administration in the FBiH is
development of efficient, secure and sustainable property registration system that will
enable legal security on real estate market and provide security to the investors and
foreign investors. Therefore, provision of services by the competent institutions
throughout the FBiH needs to be ensured through reliable registration of ownership rights
and other in rem rights to real estate, as well as through provision of complete
information on restrictions of ownership rights and provision of up-to-date technical
property data.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation: The Project faced a crisis in the second half of
2007. Due to weak institutional capacity at that time and overly strong presence of
donor’s projects in the land administration sector in both entities, relevant institution
fought to establish a stronger implementation unit and take the full responsibility and
ownership on the Project. Thanks to the support of the World Bank team, this objective
was achieved. Another challenge was to improve the quality of service delivery.
Institutions recognized the need to move from the mindset of an organization that
receives and verifies ‘applications’ to one that provides customer services. In this regard,
the reduction in levels of corruption, the adoption of service standards, and the public
information campaigns have been fundamental for this process. Future challenges include
further improving the quality of service delivery and explore possibilities to ensure self-
financing of the sector. In this case, the quality of services will be directly linked to
potential income generation.

Borrower’s Performance: Overall borrower performance is considered satisfactory. The
Government of the FBiH demonstrated its commitment to the Project through the regular
budgetary contributions and remaining proactive and determined to make the property
registration system simpler, faster and less costly in accordance with the adopted vision
for Land Administration. The MOJ and GA were fully involved in project
implementation. Cooperation between these two institutions was highly satisfactory.



                                            51
Bank’s Performance: (No rating provided). Good cooperation and communication with
the World Bank team was established and maintained throughout the Project
implementation, which helped immensely in timely obtaining “No-objections? required
for the continuation and successful completion of the procurement processes. Support
from the World Bank team was crucial in ensuring that the institutions gained full
ownership over project implementation.

Lessons Learned:
   •   Successful implementation of reforms requires a systematic approach in proactive
       communication targeting the general population and groups of stakeholders. The
       public information and awareness campaign added real value to the modernization
       of land administration system in the FBiH. It contributed to improving the image
       of the institutions and strengthening confidence in the land administration system.
       Increasing the understanding of the system, procedures, rights and obligations
       ensured that citizens became informed costumers.
   •   The successful M&E system established within the implementation unit allowed
       the Borrower and the World Bank team to assess progress against the baseline and
       future targets as well as to make necessary modifications in the Project
       implementation plan, to identify activities which were lagging and to respond in a
       timely manner to identified issues and challenges. The results framework included
       well-defined baseline data and clear targets, which contributed to the success of
       the M&E system.

Comments on Bank’s Draft ICR

A meeting was held on December 11, 2012 in Banja Luka with representatives from the
GAs and MOJs of both Entities and the World Bank to discuss the Bank’s Draft ICR. Mr.
Gavin Adlington from the World Bank opened the meeting explaining the purpose and
structure of the ICR, and mentioning that all ratings in the Project had been considered
satisfactory. Mr. Mika Törhönen (primary author of the ICR) confirmed that the sector in
BiH had dramatically improved since the Project started.

Overall, government representatives from both Entities agreed and endorsed the content
and ratings in the ICR. Some comments were provided for further clarification:
   - Results Framework (PDO Indicator 9 and Intermediate Indicator 13): The review
        confirmed that no canton/municipality decided to apply the property tax in the
        FBiH.
   - Donor Support (Section 2.2): The review acknowledged that the support received
        from GTZ was important, but disagreed with its characterization as vital. The
        technical assistance provided by GTZ had strengths, but also weakness in the
        systematic approach.
   - Assessment of Outcomes (Section 3.1): The review rectified that the new cadastral
        software had been roll out in all cadastral offices in the FBiH and that a


                                           52
       permanent sector for Geoinformatics had been established in the FBiH (similar to
       the RS GA).
   -   Outputs by Components (Annex 2): The review rectified that the 2009
       International Congress on Land Administration was held jointly by the GAs and
       MOJs in both Entities.

During the meeting, the representative of the FBiH GA mentioned the recent appointment
of a commission to draft a Law on Surveys and Registration of Real Estate. The World
Bank representatives acknowledged this action as a very positive development towards
addressing the sector’s structural problems. Nonetheless, with regards to sustainability,
the World Bank representatives expressed concern about the fact that the FBiH MOJ has
not contracted the communication lines from land registers to the server and has not
contracted maintenance for the land register software.

The reviewed endorsed the lessons learned in the ICR. The World Bank representatives
considered that Project design was appropriate for the prevailing context at appraisal. A
representative from the RS GA mentioned that the participation of government staff
during Project preparation was limited, but that during implementation they took
ownership of Project. The World Bank representatives stated that there had been
considerable and detailed participation of government staff in the RS during project
preparation, but that all these people had been replaced during the early years of the
project when management of the GA changed. The Bank team acknowledged that the
government’s decision to redirect IT development towards a step-by-step approach was
appropriate and commended them on this decision. Flexibility in Project design and
activities is always necessary.

The meeting concluded by highlighting the success of the Project and the beginning of
the follow-up operation—the Real Estate Registration Project. The World Bank
representatives encouraged the government agencies to prepare multimedia material to
share this successful experience with the general public nationwide and internationally.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments Received from GIZ (the Former GTZ):

The GIZ team “fully agree[s] with you that there was an excellent, always very open and
constructive cooperation with the World Bank for the benefit of both and especially for
the Bosnian partner institutions.? Synergies were well used where possible. They also
think that the approach was well balanced between the Technical Cooperation with
funding from Swedish, Austrian and German governments, and the Financial assistance
provided by the World Bank and all in all an example of harmonizing both instrument
which could be applied in similar cases.

The GIZ team agreed with the characterization of donor assistance in the Project. The
team “most welcomed that somewhere in the mid of the project the Bosnian partner took
over more responsibility and ownership which actually was important in view of
sustainability.? The GIZ team clarified that some friction arose between the entity
governments and then GTZ over the payment of local experts, which were supposed to be
covered by counterpart funds. The GIZ team agreed with the conclusion that the dialogue
between government and donors and the transfer of responsibilities should be clear from
a very early stage.
