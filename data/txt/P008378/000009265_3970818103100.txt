IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CZECH REPUBLIC
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3644-CZ)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Telecommunications Project in Czech Republic, for which Loan 3644-CZ in the
amount of US$ 80.0 million was approved on September 9, 1993 and made effective
on January 14, 1994.
The Credit had a Closing Date of June 30, 1998; however, after
privatization of SPT Telecom in July 1995, the new owvners decided to cancel the un-
disbursed amount of the Loan (US$ 69.7 million) and pre-pay the disbursed amount
(US$ 10.3 million). Final disbursement took place on March 12, 1996. The Loan
balance was canceled and the amount disbursed pre-paid on May 1, 1996; with this
action, the Loan was closed before the agreed Closing Date of June 30, 1998, and there
are no additional obligations due to IBRD under this loan. Cofinancing for the Project
was provided by the European Investment Bank (EI13) and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The ICR was prepared by Alberto Cruzat of the Telecommunications and
Informatics Division (IENTI) and reviewed by James Bond, Chief,
Telecommunications and Informatics Division (IENTI); Henk Busz, Acting Chief,
Energy/Transport Operations Division (EC2ET), and Franz Kaps, Project Adviser
(EC2DR).
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's December 1996
Mission, which was organized after the cancellation and pre-payment of the Loan
amounts which took place on May 1, 1996. It is based on material in the project file.
The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by discussing a first Draft during
the December 1996 Mission, and expressed its inability to provide additional written
comments.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CZECH REPUBLIC
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3644-CZ)
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.    The first telecommunications project in the Czech Republic, which was
supported by IBRD Loan 3644-CZ in the amount of US$ 80.0 million, was
implemented by the Sprava Post a Telekomunikaci (also called SPT TELECOM, s.p.
or SPT, s.p.). SPT, s.p. was established by decree of 1989 as a State -owned
enternrise. Before 1989 postal and telecommunications services were in the hands of
a traditional PTT, part of a Ministry, without financial independence, though not a
State enterprise. In September 1991 a joint-venture was set up, under the name
EUROTEL, by SPT TELECOM, s.p. with the consortium Atlantic West (Bell Atlantic
and U.S. West International) to install and operate the analog mobile cellular and the
data networks. The separation of postal and telecommunications activities took place
on January 1, 1993, with the creation of Czech Post, s.p. and SPT TELECOM, s.p.
This coincided with the split of the Federation between Czech and Slovak Republics
(see paragraph 5).
Project Objectives and Description
2.    The 1993-1995 expansion plan of SPT TELECOM supported by IBRD Loan
3644-CZ for US$ 80.0 million equivalent, and was co-financed by the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with a Loan of ECU 70.0 million, and
the European Investment Bank (EIB) with a Loan of ECU 65.0 million. The main
objectives of this operation were: (A) to support the digitalization and expansion of the
network to: (a) reduce congestion on key network elements; (b) rapidly provide
modem digital communications for businesses (especially export oriented businesses);
and ( c) provide a sound foundation for future modernization and expansion of the
entire network; and (B) to make institutional and policy improvements aimed at: (a)
increased efficiency in telecommunications investment and operations; (b) improved
quality of service; and ( c) transition to full commercial operation.
The privatization process
3.    The Government of Czech Republic approved in September 1993 a
privatization project, as a result of which SPT TELECOM, s.p. was transformed on
January 1, 1994 into SPT TELECOM, a.s. (joint-stock company). On 11 July 1994
SPT TELECOM, a.s. issued bonds for the second round of the voucher scheme
privatization process. In this Voucher or Coupon privatization, every Czech citizen of



ii
at least 18 years of age chose the company which shares he/she would prefer to own.
As a result of this process the Government kept 70% of the shares, 26% went to
Voucher shareholders, 3 % to the Restitution Fund and 1% to the Donation Fund. In
June 1995, all 23,512,565 shares of SPT TELECOM, a.s. were quoted on the Prague
Stock Exchange. The second step in the privatization of SPT was the selection of a
Strategic Partner, based upon an increase of 37% in the number of shares; the number
37% was chosen in order to keep the Government as dominant shareholder with 51%
(70%/1.37 = 5 1%). As a result of the increase of 37% in the number of shares, the
Government ended with 51 %, the Voucher Shareholders with 19%, the Restitution
Fund with 2%, the Donation Fund with 1% and the Strategic Partner with 27%
(37/1.37 = 27%).
Selection of a Strategic Partner
4.    The strategic partner was selected by international bidding. On July 10, 1995,
TelSource became the Strategic Partner of SPT by payment of US$ 1.32 billion in
cash plus US$ 0.13 billion in the form of management, software and other services, for
27% of SPT's shares. The privatization process as designed by the Czech Government
included the re-injection of the full amount paid by TelSource (US$ 1.32 billion) into
SPT TELECOM, a.s.. TelSource is an international consortium comprising the Swiss
PTT (49%), and the Netherlands PTT (NEPOSTEL) (51%), plus technical support
from AT&T. The contract by which this strategic partner was brought into SPT
established an exclusivity period for Domestic Long Distance and International
services until year 2000. The management contract with TelSource expires on
December 31, 2000.
Project Achievements and Results
5.   Institutional Objectives. In the framework of this project, the institutional
objectives focused on the operating entity: they included changes in SPT TELECOM,
a.s.' s statutes and organization and improvements in its management. The specific
studies focused on institutional improvement are listed in Table 7, and commented in
what follows.
6.    Staff productivity.   SPT  improved  its productivity  during  Project
implementation by going from 13.9 staff/1,000 working lines in 1992 to 9.4
staff/1,000 working lines in 1996. It is estimated that this ratio will improve to 7 by
year 2000 (see Tables 5 and 6).
7.    Operational targets for telecommunications activities.  SPT increased the
switching capacity from 1.99 million lines in 1992 to 3.1 million lines in 1996, and
expects to reach 4.89 million lines in year 2000. The number of working lines has
increased from 1.82 million in 1992 to 2.8 million in 1996, and it is expected to reach
4.4 million by year 2000. With this rapid expansion plan, the telephone density



iii
(working lines per 100 population) has improved from 17.6 in 1992 to 28.0 in 1996,
and it is expected to reach 44.0 in year 2000.
8.    Implementation schedule. The massive increase in new subscriber lines started
in September 1995 with the entry of the Strategic Partner. During the first full year of
operation under the new management/ownership SPT jumped from the level of
200,000 new lines per year to 448,000 new lines installed in 1996. The objectives of
expansion and modernization of the network were exceeded (Part II, Table 5).
9.    Objectives of service quality. The expansion was accompanied by a renovation
of the outside plant network. As a result, the quality of service has improved from 5.5
faults/100 working lines per month, as estimated in the appraisal for 1992, to 2.5
faults/100 working lines per month in 1996
Major Factors Affecting the Project
10.   The Government implemented a sound tariff policy as part of the privatization
process, and has been moving towards the creation of an adequate regulatory
framework for the sector.
11.   The Project benefits are significant; they include: (a) an increase in the quality
and coverage of telecommunications services; (b) the transformation of SPT from a
Government enterprise into a commercially oriented operating entity with private
sector participation in the ownership and management; (c) the organizational split
between post and telecommunications activities; and (d) the implementation of
sectoral reforms leading to an open competitive market by year 2000.
12.   Most of the Project's major physical, institutional and financial objectives have
been achieved and some of them, in particular the sectoral structure, have been
exceeded   The above benefits and substantial results from the Project provided
favorable conditions for the project sustainability and the continuation, through the life
period of the new facilities, of the support to the country's economic and social
growth. Based on the above, the Project is ranked satisfactory in achieving its
development objectives and in its implementation.
Key Findings, Future Operation, and Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a) The full realization of the institutional objectives, and in particular of the
sector reform, was made possible by the involvement of the Government
authorities and company managers in the changing process;
(b) Bank's procurement guidelines may be difficult to follow by a company with
private sector participation in its management-ownership due to the



iv
delays introduced and the need to award to the lowest responsive Bidder after
following an ICB process (see paragraph 22); and
(c) Some of the traditional Bank's legal covenants may prove constraining to a
newly privatized company with an ambitious development program, and even
when the Bank may amend the legal covenants (as opposed to the
Procurement Guidelines which are more permanent), the time and processing
required to amend those covenants add to the non-attractiveness of the Bank's
loan.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CZECH REPUBLIC
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN NO. 3644-CZ
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background and Project Objectives
1.       The first telecommunications project in the Czech Republic, which was
supported by IBRD Loan 3644-CZ in the amount of US$ 80.0 million, was implemented
by the Sprava Post a Telekomunikaci (also called SPT TELECOM, s.p. or SPT, s.p.).
SPT, s.p. was established by decree of 1989 as a State -owned enterprise. Before 1989
postal and telecommunications services were in the hands of a traditional PTT, part of a
Ministry, without financial independence, though not a State enterprise. In September
1991 a joint-venture was set up, under the name EUROTEL, by SPT TELECOM, s.p.
with the consortium Atlantic West (Bell Atlantic and IJ.S. West International) to install
and operate the analog mobile cellular and the data networks. The separation of postal
and telecommunications activities took place on January 1, 1993, with the creation of
Czech Post, s.p. and SPT TELECOM, s.p. This coincided with the split of the Federation
between Czech and Slovak Republics (see paragraph 5). Even when after this split SPT,
s.p. was dedicated only to telecommunications activities, they decided to keep the name
SPT which implies postal functions.
2.        The 1993-1995 expansion plan of SPT TELECOM supported by IBRD Loan
3644-CZ for US$ 80.0 million equivalent, and was co-financed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with a Loan of ECU 70.0 million, and the
European Investment Bank (EIB) with a Loan of ECU 65.0 million. The main objectives
of this operation were: (A) to support the digitalization and expansion of the network to:
(a) reduce congestion on key network elements; (b) rapidly provide modem digital
communications for businesses (especially export oriented businesses); and ( c) provide a
sound foundation for future modernization and expansion of the entire network; and (B)
to make institutional and policy improvements aimed at: (a) increased efficiency in
telecomnmunications investment and operations; (b) improved quality of service; and ( c)
transition to full commercial operation.

B. Sector Reform, Regulation and Privatization
Sector Reform
3.        The project was designed in 1992-93 in a monopolistic environment. The
policy objectives did not address the liberalization of the sector, the introduction of
competition, or active participation of the private sector in development and operations.
The project concept was consistent with the traditional public utilities approach practical
at that time, including only the preparatory work related to company commercialization
necessary to proceed with company privatization. All institutional objectives were
concentrated on relieving organizational, management and financial constraints existing
within SPT TELECOM. However, during the implementation period, a constructive
dialogue started between the Bank and the sector authorities and led toward a new policy
approach to the sector issues and the determination of sector policy objectives in line with
the current worldwide trends, which resulted in the privatization of SPT TELECOM and
introduction of competition earlier than expected during appraisal..
Regulatory and Sector Structure
4.        Since 1964, the telecommunications sector in Czechoslovakia has been
regulated by the 1964 Telecommunications Law. Major amendments to this Law were
issued in 1992 and 1993; these amendments authorized the creation of a Regulatory
Agency and, following the principles stated in the European Union Green Paper,
prepared the sector for future demonopolization, liberalization and private sector
participation. The regulatory authority was the Czechoslovakian Federal Ministry of
Posts & Telecommunications (FMPT), under vkhich the main operating entities were: (a)
Sprava Pogt a Telekomunikaci (SPT), Praha, s.p.; (b) Sprava Post a Telekomunikaci
(SPT), Bratislava, s.p.; (c) Sprava Radiokomunikace, Praha, s.p.; and (d) Sprava
Radiokomunikace, Bratislava, s.p.. In October 1992, a new Ministry was created, the
Ministry of Transport, Communications and Public Works (MTCPW).
5.        On January 1, 1993 the Federation was split into the Czech and Slovak
Republics, and as a result, the following new entities were created: (a) SPT Praha, was
split into SPT TELECOM, s.p. and Czech Posts, s.p.; (b) Czesche Radiokomunikace
(CR) remained unchanged; (c) SPT Bratislava was split into: Slovak Telecommunications
(ST), s.p., Slovak Posts, s.p. and Slovak Newspaper Distribution, s.p.; and (d) Sprava
Radiokomunikace, Bratislava was merged into ST, s.p.. With effect from January 1,
1993, the Ministry of Economy (MOE) assumed all responsibilities within the sphere of
telecommunications activities in the Czech Republic.  Inside MOE, the Czech
Telecommunications Office administers all regulatory issues related with the sector,
while the Department of Telecommunications Policy determines the strategy for the
sector, and represents the Government in its ownership function of SPT's shares. Tariff
approval for domestic services are under the Ministry of Finance (MOF).



3
6.        On August 10, 1994, the Government of the Czech Republic approved the
"Main Principles of the State Telecommunications Policy", which includes the following
principles/targets: (a) to double the number of telephone lines by year 2000; (b) to
maintain the integrity of the existing operator, SPT TELECOM, a.s.; (c) to enable the
entrance of a strategic partner in the ownership of SPT, by tendering by March 1, 1995;
(d) to maintain Government ownership of not less than 51% in SPT after the entrance of
the strategic partner; (e) to complete the regulatory framework by June 30, 1995; (f) to
keep SPT's exclusivity in the provision of domestic and international long distance up to
year 2000; (g) to authorize the entrance of new operating companies for the provision of
local network services; and (h) for the MOE, to license two companies for the provision
of mobile telephone cellular GSM service.
The privatization process
7.        The Government of Czech Republic approved in September 1993 a
privatization project, as a result of which SPT TELECOM, s.p. was transformed on
January 1, 1994 into SPT TELECOM, a.s. (joint-stock company). On 11 July 1994 SPT
TELECOM, a.s. issued bonds for the second round of the voucher scheme privatization
process. In this Voucher or Coupon privatization, every Czech citizen of at least 18 years
of age chose the company which shares he/she would prefer to own. As a result of this
process the Government kept 70% of the shares, 26% went to Voucher shareholders, 3 %
to the Restitution Fund and 1% to the Donation Fund. In June 1995, all 23,512,565
shares of SPT TELECOM, a.s. were quoted on the Prague Stock Exchange. The second
step in the privatization of SPT was the selection of a Strategic Partner, based upon an
increase of 37% in the number of shares; the number 37% was chosen in order to keep
the Government as dominant shareholder with 51% (70%/1.37 = 51%). As a result of the
increase of 37% in the number of shares, the Government ended with 51%, the Voucher
Shareholders with 19%, the Restitution Fund with 2%, the Donation Fund with 1% and
the Strategic Partner with 27% (37/1.37 = 27%).
Selection of a Strategic Partner
8.        The strategic partner was selected by international bidding. On July 10,
1995, TelSource became the Strategic Partner of SPT by payment of US$ 1.32 billion in
cash plus US$ 0.13 billion in the form of management, software and other services, for
27% of SPT's shares. The privatization process as designed by the Czech Government
included the re-injection of the full amount paid by TelSource (US$ 1.32 billion) into
SPT TELECOM, a.s.. TelSource is an international consortium comprising the Swiss
PTT (49%), and the Netherlands PTT (NEPOSTEL) (51%), plus technical support from
AT&T. The contract by which this strategic partner was brought into SPT established an
exclusivity period for Domestic Long Distance and International services until year 2000.
The management contract with TelSource expires on December 31, 2000.

C. Achievement of Project Objectives.
Institutional Development
9.       Institutional Objectives. In the framework of this project, the institutional
objectives focused on the operating entity: they included changes in SPT TELECOM,
a.s.' s statutes and organization and improvements in its management. The specific
studies focused on institutional improvement are listed in Table 7, and commented in
what follows.
10.      Organization. Supported by consultant's studies, SPT TELECOM's internal
structure was reorganized. The Project assisted SPT's reorganization by financing a
study on Corporate Strategy, Service Planning & Organizational Development. The
organizational aspects of the institutional objectives as designed at project appraisal were
satisfactorily reached.
11.      Management. Management improvements were achieved under the Project
through a Human Resource Study and the funding for Training Material for Project
Management Courses.
SPT's obligations
12.      Staff productivity.   SPT  improved  its productivity  during  Project
implementation by going from 13.9 staff/1,000 working lines in 1992 to 9.4 staff/1,000
working lines in 1996. It is estimated that this ratio will improve to 7 by year 2000 (see
Tables 5 and 6).
13.      Operational targets for telecommunications activities. SPT increased the
switching capacity from 1.99 million lines in 1992 to 3.1 million lines in 1996, and
expects to reach 4.89 million lines in year 2000. The number of working lines has
increased from 1.82 million in 1992 to 2.8 million in 1996, and it is expected to reach 4.4
million by year 2000. With this rapid expansion plan, the telephone density (working
lines per 100 population) has improved from 17.6 in 1992 to 28.0 in 1996, and it is
expected to reach 44.0 in year 2000.
14.      Financial targets. The Revenue per Working Line has improved from CZK
7,323 in 1992 to CZK 11,084 in 1996. The rate of return on operating fixed assets has
been larger than 30% for the period 1993 through 1995, which is higher than estimated at
Appraisal.

Financial Objectives
15.       Annual audit requirements. Audits of the SPT TELECOM, a.s. accounts have
been performed by Coopers and Lybrand in full compliance with the provisions of the
Loan Agreement
16.       Accounting system. The reliability of the accounting system has improved
through the introduction of more computerized systems.  However, still today the
accounts are initially prepared following Czech accounting rules and later transformed
following International Accounting Standards. There is a legal obligation to continue
using domestic accounting standards as long as the Income Tax Forms are supported by
accounting books using domestic accounting standards.
17.       Tariffs. A tariff study was concluded by consultants as a condition for
effectiveness. The Request for Proposals leading to the privatization of SPT (selection of
Strategic Partner) included the Government commitment to re-balance tariffs.  In
compliance with this clause, tariffs were re-adjusted in 1995 and 1996, resulting in a 16%
increase in local and domestic long distance rates and a decrease of international rates by
20%. The Czech Government has agreed to continue with annual adjustments under a
typical Price-Cap formula; i.e.: tariff adjustments in a percentage equal to the annual
inflation minus an efficiency improvement factor of I to 2 %.
18.       Financial situation. The self-financing ratio, the operating ratio, and the debt
equity ratio, as defined in the Loan Agreement, were satisfied from 1992 to 1995 (see
paragraph 32).
Physical Objectives
19.       Implementation schedule. The massive increase in new subscriber lines
started in September 1995 with the entry of the Strategic Partner. During the first full
year of operation under the new management/ownership SPT jumped from the level of
200,000 new lines per year to 448,000 new lines installed in 1996. The objectives of
expansion and modernization of the network were exceeded (Part II, Table 5).
20.       Objectives of service quality. The expansion was accompanied by a
renovation of the outside plant network. As a result, the quality of service has improved
from 5.5 faults/100 working lines per month, as estimated in the appraisal for 1992, to 2.5
faults/i 00 working lines pei month in 1996.
Cost of the Project
21.       The cost of the project was estimated to be $ 891.5 million at appraisal, with
the Bank contributing $ 80.0 million (See Part II. Tables 8a and 8b). The actual cost of
the Project is estimated to be $ 1,226.90 million. The cost increase is due to: (a) the
increase in the number of lines installed in the project period 1993 - 1996, with 669,000



6
lines installed compared with an appraisal estimate of 538,000 lines; and (b) the increase
in transmission and outside plant investment necessary to support the larger expansion
plans for the period 1996- 2000 resulting from the new operational targets as stated in the
tender for selecting the Strategic Partner,
Procurement
22.       The very limited use of funds under this Loan was mainly due to the
reluctance of the management of the company to follow World Bank's Procurement
Guidelines. In particular, once the process of selection for a Strategic Partner started, SPT
considered: (a) that the Bank's Procurement Guidelines are too lengthy to follow; (b) that
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) w.s against their new internal policy which
calls for restricting bidding to only some four or five Bidders, well known to SPT, for
each major type of equipment; and (c) that the Bank's policy to always award to the
lowest responsive Bidder was not always in compliance with the new policies of the
company. These objections are not related with the type of equipment
(telecommunications in this case) but with an approach which prefers to optimize costs
by relying on a limited number of known suppliers, rather than risking procurement from
new  suppliers.  These reservations against Bank's Procurement Guidelines were
discussed at Project Appraisal, and were considered in allocating procurement packages
among EBRD, EIB and IBRD; however, when the entrance of the strategic partner
provided with extra funds, SPT decided to cancel the loans from EBRD and IBRD.
Disbursements
23.      No particular difficulties and no delays were encountered in the disbursement
against applications for withdrawals made by SPT TELECOM, a.s. in accordance with
the provisions of the loan agreement.
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors not generally subject to Government control
24.       One important factor that positively affected the overall cost of the project is
the substantial reduction of international market prices for the high technology digital
switching and transmission equipment. In addition to lower costs, the new technology
systems provide better and more reliable services and require less maintenance. This has
a positive impact on staff productivity.
Factors generally subject to Government control
25.       As explained above, the Government implemented a sound tariff policy as
part of the privatization process, and has been moving towards the creation of an
adequate regulatory framework for the sector.

E. Project Sustainability
Project Benefits.
26.       The Project benefits are significant; they include: (a) an increase in the
quality and coverage of telecommunications services; (b) the transformation of SPT from
a Government enterprise into a commercially oriented operating entity with private sector
participation in the ownership and management; (c) the organizational split between post
and teiecommunications activities; and (d) the implementation of sectoral reforms leading
to an open competitive market by year 2000.
Sustainability
27.       Most of the Project's major physical, institutional and financial objectives
have been achieved and some of them, in particular the sectoral structure, have been
exceeded The above benefits and substantial results from the Project provided favorable
conditions for the project sustainability and the continuation, through the life period of
the new facilities, of the support to the country's economic and social growth. Based on
the above, the Project is ranked satisfactory in achieving its development objectives and
in its implementation.
F. Bank's Performance
Preparation, Appraisal
28.       At the beginning of the transformation process from a centrally planned
economy towards a market driven economy, the Government of Czech Republic
identified the telecommunications sector as a major priority for investment and reform
and approached the Bank for support in implementing these changes. The Bank sent, on
December 1992, a mission to consider separate Projects for Czech and Slovak Republics.
Although the company pre-paid the full disbursed amount from this Loan, the operation
was successful in assisting the Czech Government in achieving the final objectives of
moving the telecommunications sector from the traditional Government-owned
monopoly to a modern, more competitive sector with private sector participation.
29.       Negotiations for this Project took place in April 1993, in Luxembourg,
together with EBRD and EIB. The project was approved by the Board on September 9,
1993, and became effective on January 14, 1994. At the time of appraisal, it had been
estimated that each of the Financial Institutions would provide a loan of US$ 80.0 million
equivalent, which was modified by the time of effectiveness, with EBRD providing ECU
70 million; EIB providing ECU 65 million; and IBRD providing US$ 80.0 million. The
eventual shortfall was covered by SPT.



8
Supervision
30.      Regular supervision took place with two visits in 1994 and one each in 1995
and 1996. The cooperation between SPT and the Bank's project team was excellent. (see
Table 13).
G. Borrower Performance
31.      SPT TELECOM, a.s. was the Borrower and the Government of Czech
Republic was the Guarantor. With respect to the achievement of physical objectives,
SPT's performance was highly satisfactory, particularly by the efficiency with which it
handled an investment program double the size of the previous years; regarding the
institutional component and the sector reform, both SPT and the Government of Czech
Republic showed a remarkable performance in introducing fundamental changes in the
sector and the company without affecting the provision of services.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
32.       The status of compliance with legal covenants is shown in Table 10. SPT
complied with all legal covenants. However, the World Bank's legal covenants were
considered too constraining for the new privately owned company with an ambitious
development program. Specifically, the Bank's covenants obliged SPT to: (a) produce
funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 55% of annual average capital
expenditures; (b) maintain a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenues
not higher than 65%; and (c) not incur any debt unless the estimated net revenues be at
least 2.5 times the estimated maximum debt service. The World Bank was aware of the
limitations introduced by these covenants in the new privatized environment, and
discussed in 1994 with SPT the possibility of amending the legal covenants as required
under the new circumstances; additionally, the self-financing ratio covenant for 1995 was
lowered from 55% to 35%. However, SPT later decided that: (a) due to the difficulties in
following Bank's Procurement Guidelines, (b) the availability of funds provided by the
entrance of the strategic partner; and (c) the limitations in financial freedom introduced
by these obligations and the time necessary to amend the Loan Agreement was more
appropriate for SPT to request cancellation of the un-disbursed amount of the Loan (US$
69.7 million) and pre-pay the disbursed amount (US$ 10.3 million).
H. Assessment of Outcome
33.      The Project outcome is satisfactory. The Project exceeded its physical and
institutional objectives and achieved major changes in the sector structure far beyond the
targets envisioned during project appraisal.



9
I. Future Operation.
34.       The Project achieved the ultimate goal of creating an open competitive
market with private sector participation in the provision of services. Therefore, no
further participation of the Bank is necessary.
J. Key Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a)    The full realization of the institutional objectives, and in particular of the
sector reform, was made possible by the involvement of the Government
authorities and company managers in the changing process;
(b)    Bank's procurement guidelines may be difficult to follow by a company
with private sector participation in its management-ownership due to the
delays introduced and the need to award to the lowest responsive Bidder after
following an ICB process (see paragraph 22); and
(c)    Some of the traditional Bank's legal covenants may prove constraining to a
newly privatized company with an ambitious development program, and even
when the Bank may amend the legal covenants (as opposed to the
Procurement Guidelines which are more permanent), the time and processing
required to amend those covenants add to the non-attractiveness of the Bank's
loan.
