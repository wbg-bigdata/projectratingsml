                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to assist the Government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) in strengthening its policies to improve fiscal management,
                         competitiveness and social service delivery and covering the projected fiscal gap during 2010 resulting from a temporary fall in revenues associated with the
                         recent global financial crisis and economic slowdown. The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the Brazil CPS,
                         2008-2011. Sound macroeconomic management, fiscal consolidation, efficient public sector management, quality of education and health expenditures,
                         especially at the sub-national level, and better investment climate are key pillars of the 2008-2011 CPS for achieving inclusive economic growth in Brazil.
