PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Multiproject in
Western Samoa, for which Credit 1657-wso in the amount of SDR 2.3 million was
approved on February 4, 1986, and became effective on May 1, 1986. At the time of
approval, the amount of the credit was equivalent to us$2.5 million. The credit was
closed as of May 18, 1994, compared with the original closing date of June 30, 1992,
effectively fully disbursed. The total disbursements of SDR 2.3 million were equivalent to
us$3.1 million.
The main financier for the project was the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
which provided an amount of SDR 4.3 million (at inception equivalent to us$4.4 million)
from its Special Fund resources. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
provided a technical assistance grant of us$250,000. During implementation additional
financing was made available by the OPEC Fund for International Development in the
amount of us$1.7 million.
Under an agreement between the International Development Association
(IDA) and ADB, ADB was responsible for administration and supervision of project
implementation. This ICR consists of an evaluation summary prepared by Dennis Notley,
Agriculture Operations Division, Country Departnent III, East Asia and Pacific Region,
which was reviewed by Gershon Feder, Division Chief, and Richard Calkins, Operations
Adviser of the Department. Accompanying the evaluation summary are the normal
statistical tables, and the Project Completion Report prepared by the Asian Development
Bank in December 1995, subsequent to an ADB project completion mission in November
1994 and a follow-up mission in November 1995. The ADB loan closed on November 25,
1994. The Government, ADB, and the OPEC Fund for International Development were
asked to comment upon the IDA evaluation summary, and the response received from
ADB is attached.

IDA EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       This project was to be an innovative approach to the small scale, by
intemational standards, of many development opportunities in Westem Samoa. The
President's Report noted that IDA lending operations in Westem Samoa were constrained
by the small size of the projects and the limited absorptive capacity, which made the use
of standard Bank Group project evaluation and implementation procedures very costly in
terms of both deployment of the Bank Group manpower and financial costs.
Encountering similar constraints, ADB had developed a multiproject approach for use in
the small Pacific islands where the scale of individual investment projects is frequently
too small for multilateral financing. This concept, under which investment projects too
small individually to be considered for extemal financing were grouped together, was
seen as a cost-effective method of addressing the multisectoral needs of such countries. It
also was considered to make a special contribution to building institutional capacity for
project implementation. At the time, three IDA projects were under implementation in
Westem Samoa, two in the agriculture sector, and one supporting the Development Bank.
The agriculture projects had encountered difficulties, but project implementation was
improving. The hiring of consultants under Multiproject to assist the Government was
seen as a means to avoid similar delays.
Project Objectives
2.        The project consisted of a group of high-priority subprojects in the
agriculture, industry and infrastructure sectors. These subprojects complemented each
other, andlor supported specific production activities, with a view to strengthening and
diversifying of the economic base, enhancing generation of new economic activities, and
creating new employment opportunities. The subprojects were accorded a high priority
by the Government in its fifth development plan (1985-87) and were supported by ADB
and UNDP, they were of a complementary nature and supported productive activities, and
they had estimated acceptable economic rates of returns, especially in the cases of the
agricultural and road development subprojects.
3.        Although these subprojects had been evaluated to determine their suitability
for ADB/IDA financing, detailed economic analysis of the individual subprojects was to be
undertaken by the Govemment, with the assistance of consultants, and were only to
proceed if approved by ADB/IDA and if they met a cutoff point of a 12 percent economic

rate of return, and/or recovered costs. Subprojects could be added to or substituted for
the four tentative subprojects which were: (i) tree crop development; (ii) rural road
upgrading; (iii) construction of a small industries center; and (iv) upgrading of Apia
harbor's container park. An additional subproject was added in 1991, to repair power
facilities on Upolu, the country's main island. At that time the OPEC Fund for
International Development became a cofinancing partner of Multiproject, in the amount
of us$1.7 million equivalent.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.         The project was implemented under ADB'S supervision.  This section
describes the experience of the different components, and the table summarizes the costs,
and economic outcomes of the five subprojects, and the project as a whole. Further cost
details are in Tables 8 and 9 of the Statistical Information section. The costs of the four
original subprojects, excluding technical assistance, were 23 percent higher in US dollar
terms than the original estimate, equivalent to the average appreciation of the SDR relative
to the us dollar during the period. In other words, the aggregate costs of the four
subprojects were contained with the available SDR funds. However, within the aggregate,
the Us dollar costs of the two major components, the rural road and the container park,
increased substantially, by 83 percent and 127 percent respectively, due to coordination
and contractual difficulties. These costs eventually comprised 71 percent of the original
project scope compared with 53 percent at MOP. The cost of consultant services
quadrupled to reach finally 14 percent of the original scope. The costs of the other two
components, tree crop and small industries center, reduced significantly to comprise
finally only 5 percent of the original project scope compared with 34 percent at MOP.

5.        The tree crop subproject, to introduce farmers to improved material and
husbandry coming out of research experience, was originally intended to encourage
planting of 800 ha of hybrid coconut and 440 ha of cocoa. Cocoa was deleted from the
project scope, as it was included in an Australian assisted project, and the coconut target
decreased to 500 ha after a review of market prices in 1987. This target was met. The
small industries center subproject was to construct an 800 in2 factory building, with
access road and utility connections, capable of being subdivided to enable local
entrepreneurs to expand or start operations. The Public Works Department was unable to
provide intended staff resources for design, and the building was constructed several
years late, and occupied in November 1991 by a joinery manufacturer whose existing
premises were limited. The tenant has not yet paid any rent. The 29 km rural road was
completed in mid-1993, some four years of delays arising due to design delay, land
access, quarry and contractual disputes. The road construction is of a high standard and
the design standard is comparatively high for the low volume of traffic. A short 0.2 km
length was damaged by unusual flash floodings, but general maintenance by PWD is
likely to be satisfactory. The container park upgrading subproject was carried out
satisfactorily, with completion in November 1991 some four years behind schedule.
6.        Cyclone Ofa struck Western Samoa in 1990 and Cyclone Val in 1991, with
continuous wind speeds in excess of 140 km/h, causing damage estimated at over us$450
million. The Upolu power subproject was added in 1991: the emergency component,
financed mainly by IDA was to supply a new 3.5 MW diesel generator; and the
rehabilitation component, financed mainly by the OPEC Fund, was to repair damaged
hydro power stations. Both components were satisfactorily completed, but behind
schedule.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
7.        Achievement of project objectives. The project objectives were clear and
important for Western Samoa's development objectives, but they proved to overburden
the capacity of the concerned Government agencies and the level of technical assistance
originally envisaged. A project with an ERR of 18 percent would normally be ranked as
satisfactory. In the case of Multiproject, two factors cloud the satisfactory result. Firstly,
the overall return is entirely due to the high marginal benefit of rehabilitating the power
supply infrastructure.  By the ERR measure, the four original subprojects were
unsatisfactory, with negative net present values when costs and benefits are discounted at
10 percent. While, as noted by the ADB project completion report, the tree crop
subproject has provided a valuable ongoing supply of improved variety coconut
seedlings, the rural road has improved market access for farmers and access for tourists,
and the container park has met with the universal approval of users, the fact is that these
undertakings, by strict economic criteria, were not implemented in a viable manner.
Multiproject did not meet its goals of making a special contribution to building



- 4 -
institutional capacity for project implementation, or of being a cost-effective method of
addressing the multisectoral needs of a small country.
8.        Sustainability. The second area of caution relates to the sustainability of the
project benefits.  All five subprojects have put in place good quality assets, but
maximizing the future benefits depends upon proper operation and maintenance of the
facilities, and upon attention to the level of, and to the collection of power tariffs, port
user fees and factory rentals. In turn this will facilitate the Government being able to
service the external debts of US$10.6 million arising from the project, and to recover part
of its own contribution of us$5.4 million. This latter contribution was twice as high as
originally envisaged, mainly due to the need to settle road contract claims at project end.
9.        ADB makes a primary recommendation which IDA strongly endorses: that the
Government and the Electric Power Corporation need to develop a maintenance
program to ensure that adequate budgetary and resource allocations are made for
ongoing maintenance of the constructed facilities. IDA would comment that such a
program needs to consider the level of, and collection rates, of power tariffs and user fees.
By planning the physical requirements for maintenance and financing their costs, and by
ensuring that electricity consumers, port users, and the factory tenant pay fair charges for
the modem facilities now available to them, the likelihood of Multiproject being
sustainable would be greatly enhanced. IDA also comments that separately under the IDA
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project and other donor assistance, PWD is strengthening
its maintenance program and capability, thus improving the likelihood that the rural road
subproject will be sustainable.
10.       Assessment of outcome.  The factors that caused delays in project
implementation and necessitated a higher level of technical assistance than forecast, could
also mitigate against sound maintenance, economic operation, and prudent financial
management of the Multiproject facilities, unless the Government promptly takes steps to
prepare and implement a specific plan for the operational phase of the project. The
Government has not responded to requests to do so. In these circumstances, this ICR
considers the outcome of the project as satisfactora but its sustainability uncertain, and
its impact upon institutional development only partial.
11.       Performance of borrower, consultants, contractors and financiers. The
problems encountered cannot be laid at the door of poor choice of subprojects in terms of
relevance to national development goals, lack of "borrower ownership", or unduly large
subprojects. The ex-ante assessment of potential modest economic benefits was not at
that time unrealistic.  Nor were the devastating cyclones a significant cause of
Multiproject difficulties.  The assessment of the performance of the Government
agencies, consultants, contractors, and financiers is therefore critical for understanding
what went wrong. The PCR considers the performance of the Public Works Department
was generally less than satisfactory, and this evaluation summary ranks the overall
performance of Government agencies in both preparation and implementation as



- 5 -
deficient, although satisfactory in covenant compliance.  ADB criticizes its own
performance for not appraising the input capabilities of the Public Works Departmnent and
the Electric Power Cooperation adequately, and not providing necessary consultant input
and other resources, particularly in the area of project design and supervision. IDA's
concern with the initial slow pace of implementation correctly translated into not
supporting a then current proposal for a second Multiproject. IDA did not however
question whether the implementation delays of the original four subprojects needed a
much more clearly defined remedial action plan if a satisfactory outcome was to be
achieved. However, IDA with ADB's cooperation, seized the opportunity to add the Upolu
Power subproject, to help Government mobilize additional funding from the OPEC Fund,
and to contribute strongly to appraisal and supervision of the subproject. Given that this
subproject is the reason for the overall satisfactory outcome of Multiproject, but
recognizing the less favorable outcome of the other subprojects, this evaluation summary
ranks IDA performance as satisfactory.
12.       Key lessons. A key lesson is that the experience of this particular project
carnnot be taken, on its own, as demonstrating the Multiproject approach as a cost-
effective method of delivering assistance to small countries. While it might be argued
that the multi-sector approach unduly increases the skills required, and costs of
supervision, in fact the three principal original subcomponents were linked by their civil
works nature, and thus did not pose an undue supervision burden. The tree crop and
power subprojects required different supervision skills, which were forthcoming, but at a
cost. This particular project appears to have struck a reasonable balance between meeting
the available small investment opportunities - which may range across sectors - and cost-
effectiveness of supervision. The experience of the project should be taken as indicating
that great caution is needed towards the Multiproject approach, and the need for a
concerted effort during preparation to consider component design and a detailed, costed,
supervision plan. It reconfirms the importance of making an upfront judgrnent as to
whether the quantity, quality, and skills mix of supervision resources which can
realistically be budgeted, is in line with the needs for successful implementation.
13.       The results also confirm findings from earlier Pacific Island projects that
cofinancing and delegation of IDA responsibilities adds complexity to implementation and
supervision.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
WESTERN SAMOA
MULTIPROJECT
(Credit 1657-WSO)
Unedited comments on Evaluation Summary received from ADB
Thank you for the copy of your 30 April 1996 letter which asks for the Bank's
comments on the IDA draft evaluation summary for the completed Multiproject in
Western Samoa.
Generally, the comments and conclusions of the draft evaluation summary are
supported. This office is in agreement with your overall assessment that the outcome of
the project is satisfactory, but its sustainability is uncertain and its impact upon the
institutional development is only partial.
In the seventh sentence of paragraph II of the draft evaluation summary, there is a
reference to a second Multiproject. You may want to consider the rewording the sentence
to make it clearer, including in relation to the point about a detailed review of the
implementation difficulties.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft report.
IDA Note:
The wording of para. 11 of the draft has been altered in the final version,
in the light of ADB's comment.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.          The Project was to assist the Govemment in the implementation of its Fifth
Development Plan for 1985-1987 through high-priority subprojects in the agriculture, industry,
and infrastructure sectors. The subprojects were to provide direct or indirect support for
production activities, strengthen economic diversification, raise rural income, and create job
opportunities. Four subprojects were identified at appraisal, and a fifth subproject in the
energy sector was added in January 1991. These were:
(i)    Tree Crop Development, comprising a five year planting program for coconut,
cocoa, coffee, and mixed crops, and farmer extension services;
(ii)   Small Industries Center, comprising construction of an industrial building for
small-scale industries and encouragement of growth in those industries;
(iii)   Rural Roads Upgrading; comprising rehabilitation and upgrading of 26
kilometers (km) of rural roads;
(iv)   Apia Container Park Upgrading, comprising construction of a container handling
and storage facility at the main wharf in Apia, the capital of Westem Samoa;
and
(v)   Upolu Power Rehabilitation, comprising supply and installation of a 3.5
megawatt (MW) diesel generator and rehabilitation of hydropower stations.
equipment, and pipelines.
2.          The objectives and rationale for the selected subprojects were:
(i)    Tree Crop Development -  to help accelerate the introduction of improved
varieties of tree crops (coconut, coffee, and cocoa); provide extension services
for smallholder farmers; diversify the country's cropping pattern; and increase
agricultural production;
(ii)   Small Industries Center - to provide incentives to private entrepreneurs to
expand and establish small-scale industries for import substitution and exports;
(iii)   Rural Roads Upgrading - to reduce transport costs, open up new agricultural
areas, and improve transport efficiency;
(iv)   Apia Container Park Upgrading - to improve the efficiency of and facilitate
goods handling, and reduce the berthing time of ships; and
(v)   Upolu Power Rehabilitation - to provide an urgently needed 3.5 MW diesel
generator, repair and restore the hydropower and diesel generating stations
damaged by Cyclone Ofa, and provide parts and tools for repair of diesel power
stations.
3.          The criteria used in selecting the subprojects were that they were accorded high
priority by the Govemment: were prima facie viable; were suitable for Bank financing; and



2
would directly support production activities and take social considerations into account.
Although each subproject was prima facie suitable for Bank financing, individual appraisals
were prepared for the Government by consultants financed from an accompanying technical
assistance (TA) grant. Subproject appraisal reports were submitted to the Bank for approval
before Loan funds were made available.
II. EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Project Components
4.          The Tree Crop Development (TCD) subproject followed six years of research by
the Department of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (DAFF) on hybrid coconut and improved
varieties of cocoa and coffee. The intention was to introduce farmers to improved planting
materials and appropriate crop husbandry, and to diversify the traditional cropping pattern.
The subproject originally comprised a five-year planting program for about 800 hectares (ha) of
hybrid coconut, about 320 ha of Amelonado cocoa, and about 120 ha of improved Robusta
coffee. As a result of a review of market prices in 1987, the planting targets were changed to
about 500 ha of coconut, 380 ha of cocoa, 280 ha of coffee, and 120 ha of mixed crops. At a
later stage the cocoa planting was deleted from the Project scope, as it was undertaken under
the Samoa Cocoa Project funded by the Australian International Development Assistance
Bureau. The extension services - including identification of farmer participants, provision of
nurseries, and planting and maintenance of selected crops - were provided by DAFF.
Planting material was provided from the existing hybrid coconut seed nursery at Olomanu,
from the coconut seedling nurseries established under the Project at various locations, and
from the cocoa and coffee Crop Development Station at Nu'u.
5.          In 1990, Cyclone Ofa caused significant damage in Western Samoa, and
resulted in some reduction of planting under the TCD subproject.  When the tree crop
specialist left Western Samoa at the end of 1990 about 400 ha of hydrid coconut trees had
been planted under the sub-project (i.e. about 80 percent of the revised target), but only 20 ha
of coffee (about 7 percent of the revised target). No records could be located for further areas
of hybrid coconut and coffee plantings which can be directly attributed to the subproject.
Demand for hybrid coconut seedlings remains high, and, notwithstanding Cyclone Val at the
end of 1991, it seems reasonable to presume that the subproject has led to at least 500 ha of
hybrid coconut production. Coffee production has also increased in recent years, but in part
this has been due to the inclusion of coffee within the Govemment's bonus payment program.
Apart from the increased planting of hybrid coconuts and coffee, the Project helped with the
re-establishment of DAFF seed nurseries following cyclone damage and assisted DAFF
extension staff with the dissemination of information about new crops.
6.          The Small Industries Center (SIC) subproject included construction of a small
industries center within the existing Vaitele Industrial Estate about 6 km west of Apia. It
included site development, access road, utility connections, and construction of a factory
building of about 800 square meters, capable of being subdivided for smaller rental tenancies.
The intention was to allow local entrepreneurs with limited financial resources to obtain factory
space for expanding operations or establishing new enterprises.  The Public Works
Department (PWD) was unable to provide staff resources for design and documentation as
intended under the Loan, and the consultant Project Manager's role had to be expanded to
cover that. The building was constructed several years later than scheduled at appraisal as a



3
result of delays in design, documentation, and bidding.  It was, however, occupied in
November 1991, some 6 months after its completion, by a joinery manufacturer whose existing
premises limited the range and volume of products that could be manufactured.
7.         The Rural Roads Upgrading (RRU) subproject covered about 29 km of rural
roads in the center of the eastern part of Upolu Island. The upgraded roads included 8.6 km
between Falevao and Vaipu (portion of the Le Mafa Pass cross-island road) and 19 km
between Vaipu and Samusu (known as the Richardson or A'tua Road, which runs to the
eastern end of Upolu Island). Construction work was completed in mid-1993 after significant
delays (4 years) contributed to by land access and quarry disputes and lack of equipment and
personnel resources applied by the contractor.  There were significant claims by the
contractor, causing a lengthy dispute that was not completed until the second half of 1995.
The roads constructed under the Project are of high standard, and have stood up well apart
from a short-section (0.2 km) that was washed out during unusual flash-flooding combined
with buildup of debris in the surrounding water(mourses shortly after completion of construction.
However, inadequate maintenance is allowing vegetation to grow over road drainage and
verges, resulting in blockage of drainage and water damage to some road edges.
8.          The Container Park Upgrading (CPU) subproject included paving of roads and
container storage and handling areas at Apia Wharf; dismantling an existing fire-damaged
shed, and improving electrical, drainage, and fire-fighting services.  Initially there was
disagreement between PWD and the consultants about the type of paving material to be used
(poured concrete or concrete paving blocks). The paving block material originally provided by
the contractor failed to pass performance tests, and had to be replaced from a different
source; however, the concrete paving blocks finally installed have proven to be durable apart
from some cracking where concentrated or impact loads have been applied  Construction
occurred between July 1990 and November 1991. The work was carried out satisfactorily, but
4 years behind schedule.
9.          The Upolu Power Rehabilitation (UPR) subproject was added to the Project in
1991 as a result of International Development Association (IDA) and Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund financing to assist in remedial work for the power
stations damaged by Cyclones Ofa and Val. It had two components: the "emergency"
component for supply of an additional 3.5 MW diesel generator at the Tanugamanono Power
Station; and the "rehabilitation" component covering repair and restoration of damaged
hydropower generating stations, particularly the Fale Ole Fe'e power station, whose equipment
had been damaged by the 1990 cyclone, supply of control and communications systems, and
repairs at the Samasoni, Lalomaunga, and Tanugamanono power stations. The Fale Ole Fe'e
power station was commissioned in April 1994 and has been providing valuable input to the
cost-saving use of hydropower in the Upolu power grid. Repairs were carried out on other
power stations, and some repairs that were not completed under the Project as planned were
arranged by the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) subsequently. Taken overall, the objectives
of the subproject were achieved, and in the process EPC developed some capacity to
undertake repairs and maintenance that was not evident before the subproject was
implemented.

B.    Implementation Arrangements
10.         The Treasury Department (TD) of the Ministry of Finance was the Executing
Agency (EA), under which the Project Executing Office (PEO) coordinated the work of the
consultants and implementing agencies (lAs) for each subproject. Interagency coordination
was facilitated by the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) set up under the Project. The
Implementation arrangements for various subproject were as follows:
(i)    Tree Crop Development: DAFF in association with the Development Bank of
Western Samoa (DBWS). DAFF's performance was sound, although initially
there were problems because of the lack of suitable counterpart staff with
experience in specialist tree crops.  DBWS processed credit applications
satisfactorily, and farmers were able to obtain finance to assist in the planting
programs.
(ii)   Small Industries Center: The Department of Economic Development (DED) in
association with PWD. The arrangements were generally satisfactory, although
the primary tasks involved design and construction activities for which PWD was
responsible. PWD experienced performance problems because of the lack of
sufficient qualified technical staff, and additional consulting services had to be
provided subsequently to complete the job. To date no rent has been collected
from the single tenant occupying the building, although the Government
believes that it will be able to collect back rents.
(iii)   Rural Roads Upgrading: The Public Works Department. PWD was to provide
design, documentation, and supervision services with the assistance of a United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-funded civil engineer/construction
management consultant. PWD was unable to perform its responsibilities in a
timely manner, and additional consulting services were provided to allow the
work to be completed.
(iv)   Apia Container Park Upgrading:  The Marine Division of the Ministry of
Transport in association with PWD. There was good cooperation between
Ministry of Transport (MOT) and PWD, and the arrangements were satisfactory.
However, the majority of the work fell on PWD, which was unable to provide the
required technical personnel to complete design/documentation and supervision
work. As a result, additional consulting services had to be provided.
(v)   Upolu Power Rehabilitation: EPC. There were some probiems in coordination
among EPC, TD, and PWD; and EPC lacked the staff to adequately plan and
coordinate implementation activities. EPC also was unable to process payment
applications in a timely manner, resulting in poor relationships with consultants
and equipment suppliers, and in delays in implementation.
C.    Project Costs
11.          The total Project cost at completion was US$17.54 million compared with
US$12.01 million projected in 1991 when a fifth subproject was added to the original Project.
A summary cost breakdown by subproject and financing agency is shown in Table 1, and a



5
more detailed break down is given in Appendix 1. The Bank loan of US$4.4 million from
Special Funds resources was to cover about 45 percent of the orginal Project costs. The
Project was jointly cofinanced by (i) an IDA Credit of about US$2.5 million to finance the TCD
and RRU subprojects, and (ii) the OPEC Fund in the amount of US$1.7 million for the UPR
subproject.1 The overall Project cost was affected by the addition of the UPR subproject,
which caused additional funding to be added. However, there was a significant cost overrun in
the overall cost of the original subprojects (US10.37 million compared with US$5.12 at
appraisal).   Although the TCD  and SIC  subprojects cost less than  estimated  because of
reductions in scope, there were significant cost overruns in the CPU and RRU subprojects.
With the addition of OPEC funding and increased funding by the Govemment, disbursements
under the Bank loan financed 34 percent of the Project.
12.               In conjunction with the Loan, the Bank provided a TA grant of US$0.25 million
to assist the Government in appraising the individual subprojects and to help in establishing
the PEO and reviewing designs and specifications for civil works contracts. UNDP provided a
TA grant of US$0.25 million for supervision of implementation, and that TA was administered
by the Bank.

I       In June 1991, about five years after the original Bank loan became effective, the OPEC Fund approved a
loan for US$1.7 million to cofinance a new, fifth subproject (UPR), and the loan was administered by the Bank. The
UPR subproject was financed by IDA/OPEC (for the emergency component) and ADB/OPEC (for the rehabilitation
component - ADB for consultants and OPEC for equipment and physical works).

D.    Project Schedule
13.         The Project was approved in November 1985, became effective in April 1986,
and was scheduled for completion by December 1991. Appendix 2 compares the
implementation schedule envisaged at appraisal with actual Project implementation.
Significant delays of 1-2 years occurred in the early stages of implementation, particularly in
the appointment of consultants (about five months delayed, partly due to late Loan
effectiveness); and in the preparation, evaluation, and approval of subproject appraisals. A
chronology of Project events is given in Appendix 3.
(i)    The TCD subproject was completed in 1992, about one year later than originally
scheduled, partially because of Cyclone Ofa, which disrupted planting in 1990,
and partly because of the longer period taken for subproject appraisal and
approval. Seednut production vas also badly affected by the cyclone, which
destroyed about 60 percent of the mother palms.
(ii)   The SIC subproject was delayed by lack of access to land, by topographic and
geological surveys not being done on time, by PWD's lack of staff resources not
allowing bidding and contract documents to be prepared on schedule, and by
late recruitment of consultants. The subproject started about 30 months later
than scheduled, construction started about 36 months late, and completion
occurred about 41 months late. Construction took 10 months compared with 5
months scheduied at appraisal.
(iii)   The RRU subproject was completed about four years later than scheduled as a
result of initial delays of more than a year because of PWD's inability to prepare
bidding and contract documents and because of delays during construction. A
substantial part of the delay during construction was caused by land ownership
disputes about one of the quarries from which the road materials were to be
obtained, but other delays were caused by wet weather and by the need for re-
design of culverts and alignments caused by survey discrepancies.
(iv)   The CPU subproject was completed in 1992, about four and half years later
than scheduled, as a result of construction starting 36 months late following
delays in engagement of consultants and because of PWD's inability to
complete bidding and contract documents as scheduled. Construction took 16
months compared with 6 months scheduled at appraisal because of inadequate
application of staff and construction resources by the contractor, combined with
the need for coordination with construction work on an adjacent reclamation
project and staging of work to allow continuation of normal port operations.
(v)   The UPR subproject was completed in 1994, some two years behind schedule,
largely due to problems in coordination between EPC, TD and PWD, lack of
staff within EPC to plan and co-ordinate implementation activities, and delays in
payment processing.

E.    Engagement of Consultants and Procurement of Goods and Services
14.         Consultants were to be provided through a Bank-financed TA (four persons to
assist in appraising subprojects and in reviewing detailed designs); through a UNDP-financed
TA (two persons to assist in physical implementation of the subprojects); by two individual
consultants (a coconut specialist, and a cocoa and coffee specialist) financed under the Bank
Loan and IDA Credit; and by one individual consultant (a crop diversification agronomist)
financed jointly by UNDP, the Bank, and IDA. Only two of the four consultants financed under
the Bank TA were engaged for subproject appraisal and review of designs; the services of the
economist and institution/credit specialist (5 person-months) were deleted as a result of
consultations between the EA, lAs, and a Bank review mission in October 1987. Of the two
positions financed by UNDP to assist in implementation, the civil engineering/construction
management expert was the same consultant used in subproject appraisals. The other
position of crop diversification agronomist was not filled as a result of conclusions reached
during the TCD subproject appraisal, when it was decided that the component could be
implemented effectively without the consultant.
15.         For the UPR subproject, introduced later in the Project implementation phase,
two consultants were engaged by direct selection as a result of their prior involvement in
related aspects of the subproject. One was engaged for installation of the Tanugamanono
diesel generator for the emergency diesel component (8 person-months), and the other for the
hydropower rehabilitation component (23 person-months).  There were some delays in
appointment of the hydropower rehabilitation consultant as a result of EPC objecting to the
primary consultant's proposed arrangements for use of a local consultant.
16.         Although it had been intended that PWD would provide services for design,
documentation, and supervision of civil works for the SIC, RRU, and CPU subprojects, lack of
PWD staff resources caused the consultants for those subprojects to be required to carry out
additional work, with associated resulting delays in bidding and contract awards.  One
consultant provided services for the three subprojects, and there were strained relationships
between the consultant and PWD during some phases of implementation.
17.         The procurement of civil works and goods was carried out in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The contract for the RRU subproject was awarded on
an intemational competitive bidding basis. However, this contract experienced significant
claims from the contractor, resulting in a dispute about variations to the contract and access to
quarries. The dispute was settled in 1995. The same contractor was awarded the contracts
for the SIC, RRU, and CPU subprojects.
18.         Bidding for the diesel component of the UPR subproject was through a limited
invitation to EPC's previous suppliers of generators to bid for the supply and installation of
diesel generating equipment and its related cooling system in view of the propriety nature of
this procurement. While supply and installation of the diesel generator were done according to
schedule, operational problems were experienced at commissioning when overheating
occurred, and changes had to be made to the cooling tower. Bidding for the UPR component
was arranged in small specialty packages coordinated by the consultant; PWD repaired the
power station building, and contractors repaired and reinstated damaged equipment, control
systems, headworks, and penstocks. Although progress was relatively slow, the results were
of a good standard.



8
F.    Performance of Consultants, Contractors, and Suppliers
19.         The consultant and suppliers for the TCD subproject performed satisfactorily,
and some useful results came from the planting packages and crop diversification efforts.
Training activities occurred mainly as on-the-job training, field days for farmers, and radio talks.
The consultant provided a Coconut Planting Manual, translated into Samoan, and a pamphlet
on coffee growing.
20.         The consultant for the SIC subproject performed satisfactorily, but there was
friction with PWD in preparation of documentation for bidding. The contractor performed
satisfactorily, although completion was delayed.
21.         The consultant for the RRU subproject performed satisfactorily, but the design
standards are unnecessarily high for a road with little traffic, and the design does not properly
cater for maintenance of drainage and clearance of vegetation by the type of mechanical
equipment available to PWD.  The contractor's work was satisfactory, but there were
significant cost claims.
22.         The consultant for the civil works for the CPU subproject was the same as for
the SIC and RRU subprojects, and similar problems occurred with PWD. The consultant for
electrical services was criticized for failing to cause the contractor to complete the underground
electrical installation on time. The civil works contractor performed the work to a satisfactory
standard, but did not apply sufficient equipment, material, and personnel resources to
complete the work on time. In addition, the works had to be coordinated with other port
contractor works in adjacent areas, and the result was a significant delay in the completion
date. The contractor initially provided paving blocks that were not up to standard, and a new
shipment of paving blocks had to be obtained, contributing to the delays. Although these
problems occurred, the consultants and contractors performed sufficiently well to complete the
works to a good standard.
23.         The consultant for the "emergency" diesel component of the UPR subproject
was strongly criticized by EPC for a perceived bias in favor of the contractor in disagreements
about the unacceptable performance of the new generator and cooling tower during
commissioning and testing.  It appears that the consultant may not have pressed the
contractor sufficiently hard initially to take remedial action. The contractor initially did not
attend to the overheating problems and cooling tower's structural sufficiency, but those
problems were subsequently remedied by the contractor/supplier.
24.         The consultant for the hydropower rehabilitation component performed well
technically, but there were problems caused by the consultant spending more time than was
budgeted for the work.  EPC limited the consultant's work to the critical parts of the
rehabilitation work and arranged for the remaining work to be handled directly by EPC
personnel.
G.    Conditions and Covenants
25.         As shown in Appendix 4, the covenants relating to the Borrower's provision of
personnel were not complied with.  In some cases, it was agreed during appraisal of
subprojects that the consultant or staff positions were not required in view of changed



9
circumstances or changes to Project scope, but others were not provided because of PWD's
lack of staff resources. For the latter cases, changes were made to provide the necessary
services by expanding the scope of services of consultants. That was done to cover PWD's
responsibilities for completion of designs and bidding documents and supervision of
construction for several subprojects (Loan Agreement Section 4.01, Schedule 5, para. 6[a] and
para. 6[b]).
H.    Disbursements
26.          Disbursements occurred much later than scheduled, initially because of delays
in the preparation of bidding documents and award of contracts, and subsequently as a result
of implementation delays during construction. In addition, processing of payment applications
by the EA and lAs was generally not done in a timely manner in the first years of the
construction period. The comparison of actual and projected disbursements in Appendix 5
shows that no disbursements occurred in the first two years, and disbursements in other years
were well below projections. The disbursement at Project completion stood at US$5.8 million
as against US$4.4 million estimated at appraisal. The change in value of the US dollar against
SDR's caused an increase in the total US dollar amount disbursed.
I.    Environmental Impact
27.         All the subprojects involved development or upgrading of existing facilities, and
as such had limited adverse environmental impact. In some cases the rehabilitation and
improvement work contributed to some positive impacts.  The TCD subproject involved
undeveloped agricultural land, which was improved by tree crop planting; the SIC building was
constructed on an existing industrial estate for light industries, and the building is occupied by
a joinery manufacturer with minimal polluting effects; the CPU was an upgrading of existing
port facilities on land already being used for port purposes, and resulted in improved, clean
conditions with proper services for disposal of waste, although inadequate stormwater
drainage in and around the electrical boxes remains a potential hazard; the RRU rehabilitated
an existing road alignment with a paved, improved surface with proper drainage and soil
erosion protection; the diesel component of the UPR subproject comprised installation of a
new generator and cooling tower in an existing power station building and site, and replaced
older, more polluting equipment; and the hydropower component of the UPR subproject
involved rebuilding of existing, damaged hydropower stations, equipment, and water storage
and pipeline systems. Negative environmental impact arose from the quarrying work required
for the RRU subproject and this also caused some disharmony with local villagers.
J.    Project Benefits
28.          The multiproject approach with individual appraisal of subprojects had the
benefit of allowing the subprojects to be refined and better tailored to the needs of the
Borrower. The subproject appraisals were done closer to the time of implementation, and the
EA and lAs were closely involved in the process. This also allowed sharing of staff and
consultant resources in appraisal and supervision of the subprojects.  The October 1985
Project appraisal set the criteria that subproject appraisals (to be carried out after Loan
approval) must show an EIRR of at least 12 percent for the TCD, RRU, and CPU subprojects.
The SIC subproject criteria were that there should be no profit and no loss, and sufficient



10
revenues should be generated to recover the capital costs and meet recurrent costs.   A
summary of Project benefits is given below, and details are provided in Appendix 6.
(i)    The TCD subproject provided a valuable ongoing supply of coconut and other
fruit crop seedlings and improved varieties, and, combined with the results of
concurrent bilateral assistance, provided training and staff development that led
to an experienced core of tree-crop personnel in DAFF. The TCD subproject
appraisal carried out early in 1988 was based on the revised, reduced scope
and significantly reduced consulting services, and the related revised cost
estimate was US$726,000 compared with the original appraisal estimate of
US$1,861,000. The appraisal indicated that the economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) would be about 12 percent. On the assumption that the TCD subproject
has led directly to the planting of some 500 ha of hybrid coconuts (in place of
the local tall coconut variety) and 130 ha of coffee at the time of PCR, a revised
EIRR for the subproject of 4.9 percent has been estimated. This is a lower
bound estimate, since it does not take account of the "demonstration benefits"
of the project, which in conjunction with interventions, such as the Government's
bonus scheme for new plantings of coconuts and coffee, will have indirectly
contributed to additional areas of new plantings of improved species and new
crops.
(ii)   The SIC subproject did not result in the expected relocation of a number of
small-scale industrial enterprises to share the building constructed under the
subproject, as only one tenant (an existing joinery manufacturing business)
occupied the building. The SIC subproject appraisal estimated a revised cost of
US$341,000 compared with the original appraisal cost of US$630,000, and the
actual cost was US$342,000 excluding consulting services Since occupation of
the building in late 1991, the tenant has not paid rent. However, it is understood
that the Government has a signed agreement which will enable back rent to be
collected. Assuming that this occurs and that, at each five yearly rental review,
rental adjustments can be made to keep pace with inflation, an EIRR of 3.5
percent has been estimated for this subproject. The EIRR is similar to the FIRR
for this subproject, and the analysis indicates that the facility is capable of
generating sufficient revenues to recover capital costs and meet recurrent costs.
(iii)   The RRU subproject has resulted in much improved market access for farmers
in the eastern end of Upolu Island, and has opened up and improved access to
that area for tourist activities; the improved roads also provide all-weather
access for agricultural development, materials extraction, and hydropower
stations as well as being the only cross-island link in the southeastern third of
Upolu Island. The RRU subproject appraisal estimated a revised cost of
US$3.948 million, compared with US$3.436 million originally and an actual cost
of US$8.387 million, excluding consulting services. An EIRR of 17.8 percent,
including passenger time savings, or 12.4 percent excluding passenger time
savings, was calculated at subproject appraisal. Because of the cost overruns,
and the extended implementation period, the EIRR for this subproject including
passenger time savings, is now estimated to be 7.6 percent.
(iv)   The CPU subproject has met with universal approval from port users. The CPU
subproject appraisal estimated a revised cost of US$978,000 compared with the



11
original estimate of US$486,000 and an actual cost of US$1.349 million,
excluding consulting services. An EIRR of 18.5 percent was calculated at
subproject appraisal.  Because of the cost overruns and the extended
implementation period, the EIRR is now estimated to be 9.3 percent. The
appraisal anticipated that port charges would need to be increased to cover the
full financial and maintenance costs of the improvements. However, no such
price adjustments have been implemented, although legislation is being
prepared to establish the port as an independent authority and it is hoped this
will eventually lead to a port pricing structure more closely aligned with costs.
(v)   The diesel component of the UPR subproject resulted in a vital addition to the
generating capacity, and the new equipment has performed satisfactorily after
initial problems of overheating and running below its designed capacity. The
hydropower component of the UPR subproject resulted in repair and
rehabilitation of important small-scale power generating facilities, and the
reinstatement of the hydro source of power has created significant cost savings
because of the reduced use of diesel fuel. The cost appraised in 1991 was
US$4.051 million, compared with an actual cost of US$3.72 million. There was
no prior economic evaluation done for the two components of the subproject -
one component having been committed to procurement before the subproject
was added to the Loan under IDA and OPEC Fund financing, and the other
involving rehabilitation of damaged existing equipment. In fact the EIRR now
estimated for this subproject is a very high 52.6 percent reflecting the
considerable benefits of utilizing existing installed hydro-generating capacity
and installing a large more efficient diesel set to displace expensive hired diesel
sets. The FIRR for EPC is even higher at 64.1 percent, reflecting EPC's higher
tax inclusive price for diesel as compared to the economic price.
(vi)   Overall the multiproject is now estimated to have an EIRR of 18.8 percent,
largely due to the very high EIRR for the UPR subproject offsetting the lower
EIRR's now expected for the TCD, RRU and CPU subprojects. The subprojects
have contributed to employment opportunities in a wide range of activities, and
the TCD subproject has provided livelihood for the families of participating
farmers. The SIC subproject building tenant employs about 50 persons, whilst
the CPU subproject is, to some extent, a contributory factor to decision making
on businesses location in 'Nestern Samoa.
K.    Performance of Borrower and Executing Agency
29.         The Borrower and Executing Agency performed satisfactorily in overall terms,
although considerable delays were experienced in Loan effectiveness, project implementation,
and disbursement. Lack of sufficient staff in the EA and lAs was a significant problem, but
was most pronounced in PWD. The EA and lAs did not provide a project completion report for
the overall Project or for the subprojects, and relied on consultants' reports for subproject
PCRs.
30.         Of the Implementing Agencies, DAFF performed satisfactorily on the TCD
subproject, although the lack of qualified or trained staff delayed implementation in the early
stages. DED performed satisfactorily as the IA for the SIC subproject, but resolution of the



12
problem conceming the collection of rent is now urgently required. PWD's performance was
generally less than satisfactory because of staff constraints and lack of expertise; it had to
seek supplementary consultant assistance to meet its responsibilities in arranging design
contracting and construction of subprojects.  EPC was unable to provide sufficient staff
resources for implementation of the UPR subproject, and did not organize the consultants'
work well; relationships between EPC and the consultants were sometimes strained, and some
of the repair and rehabilitation work was not completed under Loan financing.  The
consultants' progress reports for the TCD, SIC, RRU, and CPU subprojects were forwarded by
the EA in a timely manner. Progress reports for the UPR subproject were similarly provided
during the majority of the equipment installation period, but were not provided during the latter
part of the hydropower implementation period (due to the consultant's being directed by EPC
to provide services only on the priority installation activities). Although initially submission of
audited accounts was not done in a timely manner, that was corrected during the latter stages
of implementation after appointment of a new Controller and Chief Auditor.
L.    Performance of the Bank
31.         The Bank may be criticized for not appraising PWD and EPC's input capabilities
adequately and not providing necessary consultant input and other resources, particularly in
the area of Project design and supervision. The Bank and cofinanciers were, however, very
flexible in making changes in Project scope and cost allocations to respond to changes arising
during implementation, and augmenting consulting services to overcome the problems caused
by PWD's lack of staff resources. The Bank and cofinanciers processed subproject appraisal
reports and disbursements in a timely manner.
32.         The Borrower, EA, and lAs experienced difficulties with the different procedures
of the cofinancing organizations (ADB, IDA, OPEC, and UNDP), and there were some delays
caused by the time taken to resolve them.
Ill.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.    CONCLUSIONS
33.         The Project, comprising five subprojects in different sectors, was implemented
consistently with the original concept, including the UPR subproject added to the Project scope
in 1991 in response to emergency conditions. A number of problems were experienced during
implementation, and, there were significant delays in those subprojects that involved
construction of substantial civil works. However, the completed works in all subprojects are of
good quality, are consistent with the Project objectives defined at appraisal, and have
indicated in the period since their completion that they are sustainable and sound.
34.         The most significant problems in implementation were caused by inadequate
staff resources in the EA and lAs, particularly in PWD, which was unable to provide technical
design, bidding, and supervision services for construction of civil works. During the later
stages of implementation there was some improvement in PWD's capacity as a result of
bilateral assistance in providing consultants to fill line positions in PWD, other Govemment
departments, and EPC, but the major delays had occurred earlier in the implementation period.
The risk associated with the lack of experienced personnel in the Government was foreseen at
appraisal, and the Project included some provisions to deal with it, however, the provisions



13
departments, and EPC, but the major delays had occurred earlier in the implementation period.
The risk associated with the lack of experienced personnel in the Govemment was foreseen at
appraisal, and the Project included some provisions to deal with it; however, the provisions
were inadequate, and significant additional resources had to be allocated through changes in
Project scope and cost reallocations.
B.    RECOMMENDATIONS
Project Related
(i)    Operation and Maintenance: The Government and EPC need to develop a
maintenance program to ensure that adequate budgetary and resource
allocations are made for ongoing maintenance of the constructed facilities.
Organizational responsibilities for maintenance work and operational
arrangements to implement that work need to be better defined and specified.
(ii)   Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) Preparation:   This may be
undertaken any time after 1996, by which time the last constructed Project
facility would have been in operation for more than a year.
General
(iii)   Project Implementation: Although the Project attempted to make provision for
additional staff resources to implement it, the measures were insufficient. For
future projects in small Pacific Island Developing Member Countries (PIDMCs),
capacity building needs to be a major component, and provision should be
made for implementation personnel resources to be provided without reliance
on the EA or lAs. Resources may be provided through consulting services or by
bilateral funding of line positions or through provision of Project positions in the
Project implementation units.
(iv)   Project Completion Reports: PAI No. 7.3, dated October 1990, requires that
PCRs be prepared within 6-12 months of the completion of a project, and the
draft revision dated 1 December 1994 changes that to within 12-24 months of
completion. For multiprojects, which may involve a wide spread of completion
dates for subprojects, it would be desirable to define the time limit from the date
of completion of the subprojects rather than the whole Loan project.
(v)   Cofinancing Procedures: For cofinanced projects special attention should be
given to simplification of procedures so that EAs/lAs have to comply with only
one set of procedures for processing payment applications and approvals of
changes of scope, loan closing date extensions, etc.  Otherwise, it is too
complex for a borrower or an EA to comply with varying requirements of several
donors in a timely manner.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   ASSUMPTION FOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.    Economic Costs
1.    Economic costs for each of the subprojects by year were determined
from disbursement records and data held by the Western Samoa Government.
Taxes and duties were excluded, and costs were expressed in constant 1995
prices and WS$, using a consumer price index and a series for the exchange
rate between the US$ and WS$.
2.    Consulting services costs were apportioned between the various
subprojects. The ADB TA grant of US$250,000 spent on appraising the original
four subprojects (TCD, SIC, RRU and CPU) is apportioned equally between the
four subprojects in 1987 and 1988.
2.    Economic Benefits
3.    Tree Crop DeveloDment. An area of 1200 acres of hybrid coconuts
(replacing the local tall variety) and 300 acres of coffee is assumed to be
planted under the subproject. The benefits per acre are based upon the
following assumptions:
Hybrid coconut
-     additional average yield per acre: 413.75 kg.
-     additional non labor costs per acre: WS$45
-     additional labor costs per acre: WS$200
-     current copra price paid to farmers: WS$0.75 per kg.
Coffee
-     average yield per acre:                   1135 kg.
-     non labor costs per acre:                 WS$236
-     labor costs per acre:                     WS$675
-     price paid to farmers (undried coffee red cherries): WS$1 per kg.
4.    Small Industries Center. Back rent of WS$60,120 per annum is
assumed to be collected from 1 November 1991. A maintenance cost per
annum of 0.15% of the building capital cost and a land lease cost of
WS$11,620 per annum from 1 September 1989 are assumed. The land lease
cost is assumed to reduce by 60% in 1994 when 6 acres of the 10 acre site
were subleased. It is assumed that the renegotiation of the building and land
leases in 1996 and thereafter will result in adjustments which reflect movements
in the CPI since 1991.



32                 Appendix 6, page  2
5.    Rural Roads Uparadina. World Bank data on vehicle operating cost
savings on sealed and unsealed roads have been used to give a weighted
average saving per vehicle per kilometer of WS$0.293. Travel time savings
have been estimated at WS$0.118 per vehicle per kilometer. This gives
benefits on the Mafa Pass of WS$3.58 per vehicle and WS$8,59 per vehicle on
Richardson Road. These benefits have been combined with traffic count data
from a survey undertaken at three sites within the subproject area. Traffic
growth of 5% per annum is assumed.
6.     Container Park Uparade. The costs per hour of operating a forklift truck
in the container terminal with and without the subproject have been estimated at
WS$70 and WS$139 per hour respectively. The subproject is assumed to
reduce average container handling time from 6 minutes per container in the
average saving in container washing time based on
a 25% reduction in containers requiring washing;
20% of outward containers previously requiring washing;
-     a washing time of 3 minutes per container.
7.    Ships time savings are assumed to equate to the 1.075 minutes per
container, with ships time estimated to cost WS$1050 per hour.
8.    Ministry of Transport statistics on container movements in 1993, 1994
and 1995 are combined with the estimated savings in forklift truck and ships
time costs. It is assumed that container movements will grow at 5% per annum.
9     UPolu Power Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of the hydro system under
the subproject is estimated to add 3470 kws of capacity generating 9.4 GWh on
average per annum, resulting initially in savings in:
-     the hire cost of small diesel sets costing WS$756 per kw per
annum;
-     diesel and other consumables costing around 38 sene/kWh.
After 1995, these savings are instead the cost of electricity from a
large installed diesel set of around 61.4 senelkWh.
10.   The new 3.5MW diesel set installed under the subproject is estimated to
save 1500 kw of diesel set hire costs and (for 4 Gwh per annum) a saving in
diesel and other 0 and M costs of WS$0.096/kWh.
3.    Analysis Period
11.   The analysis period for each of the subprojects has been taken as
follows:
TCD  :      1987 to 2015
SIC         1987 to 2031
RRU  :      1987 to 2031
CPU  :      1987 to 2032
UPR  :      1991 to2016

been estimated as follows:

*      The Ministry of Transport had statistics for container movements in 1993, 1994 and the first 10
months ot 1995. The 1995 data were factored up for a full twelve months. For 1992 half the
benefits of 1993 are assumed, since the container park upgrade civil works were completed in
1992.
b      = WSS 8.07 + 0.43 + 18.81 = WSS 27.31 per container
Subsequent to 1995. container movements are assumed to grow at 5% per annum. This is high
compared to the 2% assumed in the subproject appraisal report but should be sustainable given
growth rates of 8.2% and 16.5% in 1994 and 1995 respectively; the low base from which the 5%
per annum growth is being projected. Container movements in 1995 are still less than those in
1987; and the potential for increased trade volumes if tourism grows at even half of Government's
projections.

B.   Financial Analysis
1.    Tree Crop Development
13.   Additional retums to farm families from the subproject are estimated to be
WS$265 per acre for hybrid coconuts and WS$900 per acre for coffee.
2.    Small Industries Center
14.   The FIRR for the small industries center is essentially the same as the EIRR -
i.e. 3.5 percent.
3.    Rural Roads Upgrading
15.   Since the Western Samoan Government has yet to institute any system of direct
road user charges, it is not possible to calculate any FIRR for the subproject.
4.    Container Park Upgradinq
16.   No specific adjustment to port charges was made after the CPU. and therefore
the subproject has no FIRR.



40                Appendix 6, page 10
5.    Upolu Power Rehabilitation
17.  The FIRR for EPC from the subproject is 64.1 percent, higher than the EIRR,
reflecting the higher price for diesel paid by EPC (82.5 sene per liter) as compared to
the economic cost of diesel to EPC (53.8 sene per liter).

financial analysis can be found in Consultant's Report "Economic Analysis Undertaken
for PCR on Westem Samoa Multiproject; M.C. Copeland, Brown, Copeland & Co.; 27
November 1 995" in the Project Files).
