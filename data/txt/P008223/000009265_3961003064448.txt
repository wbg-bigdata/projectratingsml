MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDAnON OF THE PRESDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIUECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO VENEZUELA
FOR A HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Venezuela for the equivalent of US$150 million to help finance a projeat for highway
management. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maurity of 15 years,
including 5 years of grace. The Inter-American Development Bank would cofinance the project for the
equivalent of US$200 million.
BIaftund
2.    Roads are the principal mode of transport in Venezuela; they carry almost all the cargo traffic
(the main exceptions are petroleum and ore products), and account for 99% of inter-city passenger trips.
The road network consists of arterial and local highways (20,003 km), which carry over 90% of the non-
urbm  traffic, and of feeder and access roads (60,000 km). The highway network, built in the 1960s and
1970s, has been used more heavily than expected, and, with inadequate maintenance, has entered into
a phase of rapid deterioration. Many highways in poor condition (about 20% of the total network) already
requi extensive and costly rehabilitation, and many more sections (about 54%) would soon reach that
point if they do not receive timely preventive maintenance and/or strengthening. Ihe higher cost of road
transport on deteriorated highways, which represents many times the infrastructure cost, is adversely
affecting economic growth, especially in the agricultural and industrial sectors, with a negative impact
on the competitiveness of Venezuela's exports.
3.    The management of the road network, including the construction and maineance of rural roads,
has been highly centralized in the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). Road expenditre
programs, including those for maintence, are funded essentially through annual budget allocations from
the nationa treasury. This situation has resulted in: (a) heavy expenditures on high-type expressway
facilities and feeder road construction programs at the expense of the maintence of the existing network;
(b) poorly designed rural road prgrams with little consistency with the needs of local communities and
agricultural development objectives; and (c) largely unpredictable budget allocations which have hampered
the  popriate planning and programming of expenditures and the effective management and maintenance
of the road system. Recently, however, there has been a greater awareness of these problems and of the
need to improve road mantennce. The Government, in line with its broader decentalization objective,
set-out by the Decentrization Act of 1989, is committed to, and has aready started to reform the
highway administration. There is stil a need, however, for formulating a clear policy and a phased plan
for transferring highway maintenance responsibilities and related technical services to state governments,
and for establishing appropriate road cost recovery and maintenance funding mechanisms.
Project Objedives
4.    The project's primary objectives are to: (a) rehabilitate and maintain the national paved highway
network; and (b) establish sustinable institutional mechanisms to ensure effective road maitenance in
the futme and a framework to decentralize road administration. Other related objectives are to:
(c) develop and implement policies and mechanisms for adequate funding of road maitenance and
efficient recovery of road costs; (d) encourage private sector participation by contracting out routine
maintenance activities and transferring expressways to private concessionaires; (e) strengthen the
opeational road administration units, and the policy formulation, planning and monito,ing capabilities
of the central administration; and (0) develop and improve compliance with environmental standards in
the transport sector, particularly for highways.



-2-
Project Description
5.    Ihe project would consist of: (a) a polcy and institutional development program, including
technical assi3tance and training of staff, to: (i) prepare and implement a program to decentralize the
maienance of the road network and help transfer management of expressways to private concessionaires;
(ii) design and establish appropriate road cost-recovery and maintenance funding policies and mechanisms;
(iii) develop and establish a highway management system to help DGSVT prepare and monitor efficient
highway and bridge rehabilitation and maintenance strategies, standards and programs; (iv) formulate and
Implement a plan to contract out maintenance; (v) strengthen the technical capacities of MC state
directorates and state public works departments to manage and supervise maintenance contracts; and
(vi) establish a capability in MTC/DGSVT to develop, implement and monitor environmental standards
and guidelines for roads; (b) an Investment program consisting of the highest-priority highway, bridge
and tunnd rehabilitation, resurfacing and signalling components of DGSVT's 1993-97 program, including
rehabilitation of about 3,000 km and resurfacing of about 4,800 km of highways; and (c) a maintenance
program consisting of the routine and other periodic maintenance works, which would be fully funded
with local resources.
6.    'Te total cost of the project is estimated at about US$840.0 million equivalent, including
US$349.2 million for highway rehabilitation and resurfacing, US$ 102.4 million for bridge and tunnel
rehabilitation, US$18.7 million for pavement marking and signalling, US$27.6 million for engineering
and work supervision, US$218.3 million for routine maintenance and US$13.7 million equivalent for
technical asistance and training. The project would be fimanced from: (a) the proposed Bank loan of
US$150.0 mfllion (or 18% of the project cost); (b) a proposed loan of US$200.0 million from the Inter-
American Development Bank; and (c) Government resources for about US$490 million. A small portion
of Government resources may be provided from state budgets, in those states which may meet at a fi.ture
time the eligibility criteria for participating under the investment program.
Project bmplementation
7.    The Maintenance Directorate (DCV) of DGSVT would be responsible for implementng the
investment and maintenance programs and the related components of the institutional development
program. Execution functions, including contract management and works supervision, would be entrusted
to MTC state directorates' maitenance divisions, which report to DCV. Some subprojects, however,
could be implemented by state administrations, where the state has assumed road maintenance
responsibilities under the decentralization program. A state administration could implement a subproject
on the conditions that: (a) the Federal Government and the Bank have mutually determined that the State
bas adequate capabilities and resources to carry out the relevant project activities; and (b) the Federation
and the State have entered into a Decentralization Agreement and a State Project Agreement, both
satisfactory to the Bank. Technical assistance and training would be provided to state administrations to
develop the necessay technical capabilities prior to transferring the execution of subprojects. For that
purpose, MTC has entered into Cooperation Agreements and prepared instiutional development
subprojects with three states for implementation, on a pilot basis, under the project. Other states could
become eligible to participate in the institutional development program on the conditions that MTC and
the Bank have agreed, taking into account the experience with the pilot states, that the state dministraon
has satiactory organizational structure and counterpart staff, and that the state has entered into a
Cooperation Agreement with MTC. The management of the investment and maintenance programs,
however, would remain with DCV/DGSVT. MTC's Planning Office would be responsible for
coordinating the decentralization program and for developing the cost-recovery and maintenance funding
policies and mechanisms.



-3-
8.    DC V/DGSVT would select the road segments Included inthe annual rehabilitztion and resurfacing
programs on the basis of: (a) the agreed network maintenance strategy and plurlannual program,
periodically updated and refined in accordance with the development of the pavement and bridge
management systems, and related technical and economic criteria a&d methodologies included In an
Operational Manual; and (b) funding expectations for the given year. Before initiating detailed
engineering designs, DCVIDGSVT would, for each subproject, prepare a subproject application (in a
standardized format) providing the agreed information on the technical, economic and financial aspects
of the proposed investment, on the basis of which the Bank would approve the preparation of detailed
engineering. After completing the engineering designs and prir to contracting the works, DCV/DGSVT
would update and finalize the siCbproject application as required to reflect the final design solutions and
cost estimates, on the basis of which the Bank would approve financing of the works under the project.
The application and approval process will be tied to the Government's annual budget cycle. All the
investments included in the programs would have a minimum economic rate of return of 12%.
DCVADGSVT would prepare and update procurement and execution programs and furish quarterly
reports to the Bank. The Bank would monitor implementation against agreed procurement and execution
targets included in an agreed lmlementation Progran.
Project Sustainability
9.    The project has been designed to help establish sustainable institutional mechanisms to ensure
effective maintenance of the network in the future. Developing and implementing appropriate policies and
mechanisms for adequate funding of road maintenance and efficient recovery of road costs, which are
essential to project sustainability, would be important conditions of the loan. The procedures and
methodologies to be established for planning, programming, budgeting, and management of maintenance
activities are consistent with the administrative capacity of the central office and decentralized units of
the road a&- istration. The proposed eforts for both formal and on-the-job training would contribute
to sustamability by improving the competence and motivation of the staff. In addition, the involvement
of private contractors in the maintenance of the networks, besides substantially reducing the management
requiremeno imposed on the public agency, is expected to provide incentives to the private construction
industry to take an active interest In the allocation of adequate budgetary resources for road maintce,
and to provide decision-makers with some assurance of improved performance.
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Projects
10.   Since this would be the first highway project in Venezuela, lessons have been drawn from similar
highway projects, which were recendy completed in the region and elsewhere, and reviewed by OED
(Annual Reviews of Project Performance Results for 1990 and 1991). In summary, a good proportion
of the highway projects (78%) have been rated as satisfuctory, but less (60%) have been rated as having
likely prospects of sustainability. The physical objectives of the projects have generally been attained. Ihe
major problems have been with the institutional building components, which often fell short of their
objectives of establishing sustainable capabilities for the maintenance of the road systems. Maiteace
has continued to suffer from lack of finds and inadequate cost-recovery, from poor organiztional and
staff performance and insufficient accountability, and from unenthusiastic government support, especially
where it is carried out by force account. Progress has been made where maintenance has been contracted
out, such as in Brazil and Chile, and where appropriate funding mechanisms, such as road funds, have
been established. This experience has been incorporated in the design and preparation of the project.



-4-
Rationale for Bank Involvenent
11.   Trough ibis project, the Bank would help protect past investments in highways by establishing
ustnable instittional mecbanisms to ensure the appropriate maintenance of the network in the fiure.
The emphasis would be on efficient resource allocation in the subsector, especially with regard to the
balance between new constuction and maintenance progm, and on road cost recovery from road users.
The Bank would help improve the management of the road subsector, and in particular encourage
accountability and better use of resources, by assisting the process of decentralizing the maintenance of
the road networks and strengthening the highway policy formulation, planning and monitoring capabilities
Of the central government.
AFeed Actions
12.   During loan negotiations, the Government has agreed with the Bank that:
(a)  MTC wouldpreparethefollowingplans, includingtherelated implementaotimetables, preset
them to the Bank for comments by the respective following dates, and thereafter implement the
plans in accordance with the agreed timetables, taking into account the Bank's comments:
(i)  a road macagement decentralization plan to reclassify the road networks, redefine
administrative and financing responsibilities of DGSVT, SAVA and the states, reassign
personnel, reallocate assets, strengthen the decentralized units, and assist the states in
establishing concessions for expressways, by March 31, 1993;
(ii) a plan to establish appropriate cost-recovery and finding mechanisms, to be based on
policies and objectives set forth in a policy statement dated October 15, 1992, and to
gaually adjust road user charges to at least recover rehabilitation and maintenance costs
according to cost-recovery targets to be set forth in the plan, by June 30, 1993;
(iii) a plan to establish pavement management and bridge management systems, formulate
highway and bridge maintenmce strategies and programs, monitor the condition of the
road system, and to implement axle-load regulations, by September 30, 1993; and
(iv)  a plan to contract out maintence operations, strengthen the capabilities of MTC's stat
directorates and of state public works departmen  to manage contracts and supevise
works, and to strengthen DOSVT's program monitorin systems, by June 30, 1993;
(b) MTC would update DGSVT's plurannual and prepare DGSVT's anul road expndiure and
funding programs in accordance with policies and economic criteria included in the Operational
Manual and, by October 31, each year, present the programs to the Bank for comments;
(c) MrC would, by June 30, 1993, adopt appropriate environmental guidelines for highways and for
the transport sector, establish an adequately staffed enviromental unit within DGSVT to carr
out the envronmental assessments of the roads programs, and assign MTC's Planning Office the
functions of dissminatng and monitoring the implementation of the guidelinee, all in accordance
with MTC's environmental management plan dated May 1992;
(d) MTC would contract one or several consulting fims not later than March 31, 1993 to assist in
carrying out the above actions, and, by October 31 each year, present to the Bank for commets
a tining program for the following year;



-5-
(e)  the Botrower would guaee the necessary counterpart funds for the project, including aff the
finds necessary to cary out the maintenance progranm; In order to permit the timey
implementation of urgent subprojects, the Bank would finance retroactively civil works, goods,
consultant and training expenditures incurred after the appraisal mission, and not earliet than
twelve months before the date of the loan agreement, up to a maximum amount of US$15.0
million; and
(t)  a midterm, detailed review of the implementation of the project would be carried out during the
third quarter of 1995, to assess Borrower compliance with the covenants of the Loan Agreement,
particularly regarding counterpart funds, cost-tacovery mechanisms, and the decentlization
program.
13.   Prior to loan effectiveness: (a) MTC should have put into effect the agreed orgni
arrangements for project 'mplementation; (b) MTC should have formally approved the Operational
Manua; and (c) the Borrower should have provided for adequate budgetary allocations for DCVs 1993
rebabilitation and maintenance programs.
Environmental Aspects
14.   The project, which consists of maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads, will have no
significant impact on the environment; it is therefore in the environmental category B. Possible adverse
effects could, nevertheless, result from quarrying, borrow pits, or the disposal of used pavement
marials. The environmental assessments for the first-year subprojects have been completed, reviewed
by the appraisal mission, and found satisfactory. In order to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects,
MTC/DGSVT will, as part of the agreed envirornenta plan, which includes appropriate guidelines for
that purpose, !ntroduce adequate standards and specifications in the contracts for engineering and civil
works, and carry out adequate supervision and control. The main objectives of the agreed environmental
plan, however, would be to assist MTC and DGSVT in adopting and implementing appropriate
environmental guidelines for the other programs in the transport sector, particularly for highway
construction programs.
Progrm Objective Categories
15.   The main thrust of the project is to strengthen the management of public highways and related
funding through a program of decentralization and institutional strengthening. The project would als6
encourage private participation by contracting out highway maintenance activities and by helping tansfer
the operation and maitenance of expressways to private concessionaires. Another objective is to
streagthen environmental assessment and control in the highway subsector of the Borrower.
Projec Benfts
16.   The project, by helping to retard the deterioration of existing highway network through Improved
maintenance, would: (a) avoid further losses of valuable capital invested in public roads; and (0)
contnrbute to growth in agriculture, industry and exports by subsnially reducing the cost of road
transpot. It would also contribute to: (c) enhanced accountability and more efficient use of public
resources in the highway subsector; and (d) mitigation of adverse environmental impacts of highway
construction and maintenance. The esfimated economic rate of return of the first-year program is 53%.
The economic rates of return for the remaining investments are expected to range from above 12% to
about 100%, with most of them exceeding 30%.

RWs
17.   Project risks include: ineffecti', -management of project by MTCIDGSVT; inadequate supervision
of works and contracts by the decentralized state-level agencies; and insufficient allocation of resources
by the Government. In order to minimize these risks, the project includes: (a) well-defined project
implementation program and organizaonal arrangements; 0b) strengthening of DGSVT's key planning
and control responsibilities as well as implementation capabilities of the decentralized units; and (c) a
supervision and monitoring plan with annual reviews of DGSVT's expenditure and funding programs,
and a detailed mid-term review of project implementation.
Recommendation
18.   I am satisfied that the loan would comply withi the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
