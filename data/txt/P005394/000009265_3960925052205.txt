CIR IV
(LOAN 1943-MOR)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the CII IV project
in Morocco, for which Loan No. 1943-MOR in the amount of US$100 million
was approved on January 22, 1981.   The loan was close.d on December 31,
1987, two years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last dis-
bursement was in September 1988.
2.       The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Operations Divi-
sion of the Europe. Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Eval ation Summary, Parts I and IIT).  The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I
and III with the request to prepare Part II, but none was received.
3.       Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final super-
vision mission of the project in 1988, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal and President's Reports, the Loan, Guarantee, and Project
Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

E.ALUAION  UMR
1.          In 1980, Morocco's tourism sector was expanding, earning
-conIWderable ioreign exchange, and creating employment at an investment cost
per job which was less than 40X that of the manufacturing sector (Part I,
pares. 1 and 2). However, the sector faced some significant constraints--an
underdeveloped institutional structure, the lack of qualified personnel,
inadequate data bases for policy development, and minor financial/
organizational difficulties facing the major tourist development bank, Credit
Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH). The Bank, prior to 1980, had extended three
lines of credit to CIG, totalling US$ 48 million and financed an
infrastructure development project for US$ 21 million. The performance of CIH
under these loans generally had exceeded Bank expectations and the Bank had
disbursed the loans close to or ahead of schedule (Part I, para. 4).
Objectives-
2..         The objectives of the CIH IV Project were to (a) increase hotel
*  capacity in Morocco, (b) maximize foreign exchange and employment generation
capabilities of the tourism sector, (c) improve the information base in the
sector as well as its analytical use and (d) strengthen the listituitional and
financial capabilities of CIH (Part I, para. 5). To achieve these objectives,
the US$ 100 million loan had four components (Part I, para. 6): (a) the
financing of sub-loans for tourism projectis(US$ 99 million), (b) a
cost/benefit study on tourism investments (US$ 0.6 million) and (c) training
of CIH staff along with improvements and computerization of its investment
appraisal capabilities (US$ 0.4 million).
IJmplmnatiogn Experience
The major challenge of the Project was transforming CIH into a
sustainable entity that could function without further Bank assistance. The
issues concern.:ng CIH's loan portfolio, finances, institutional set-up and the
adequacy of information systems are outlined in Part I, para. 7. Overall, CIH
and the Bank dealt with the issues in these areas successfully, enhancing the
financial and institutional viability of CIH as an independent entity. CIHI
approved a greater number of sub-projects than expected and loan disbursements
were well above projections. Commitments, however, were below projections due
in part to a delay in the expected revision of Morocco's investment code.
Furthermore, the Bank conditioned the extension of the commitment date on the
Implementation of certain measures to reduce arrears and expedite the tourism
study.  Although the Implementation of these measures delayed the loan closing
by two years, they were successful and the loan was fully committed and
disbursed (Part X, para. 7 and Part III, Tables 2 and 3).

Results
4.          The loan financed 230 sub4loans to 99 companies for sub-projects
'totalling DH 1.27 billion. Of these sub-loans, 91X financed new hotels and 9%
financed extensions to existing establishments. The sub-projects created an
estimated 14,1') new hotel beds and 6,800 new jobs at an investment cost of US$
48,000 each. These results were very close to SAR estimates --7,000 beds and
an average investment cost per job of US$ 42,000. Furthermore, using the SAR
estimated ratio of three indirect jobs (i.e. restaurants, bars sporting
facilities, atc.) created for each direct one, the total estimated number of
jobs created is in the order of 20,000. The economic rates of return for
these sub-projects averaged 18.5% and ranged from 121 to 351. The arrears for
the sub-projects amounted to only 2.41 of the value of the sub-loans.
Project Sustainability            _
5.          The tourism sector in Morocco, CIH, and the sub-projects that the
Bank financed under the loan are sound and their future prospects are
promising (Part I, paras. 20-24). CIH, as a development bank, is a solid
financial institution with increasing profits and revenues. Although critical
financial ratios had exhibited signs of deterioration during 1986-87, the
Bank, within the Second Housing Financing Project, will seek agreements from
CIH that it will maintain the ratios witbin certain levels. Moreover, the
management of CIH is committed to growth through diversification of its
services. The Government's support of tourism and the central role of CIH are
unlikely to diminish. Ongoing financial reform in`Morocco, which may allow
commercial banks to expand in the tourism sector, could affect the continued
growth of CIH.  However, CIH has a comparative advantage in the tourism sector
and increased competition should further increase the efficiency of its
operations.
Lessons Learned
6,          The early success of CIH depended on its monopoly position which
was justified in order to establish a national institution in a risky sector
and develop standards of financing and appraisal. However, the monopoly is no
Longer justified (Part I, para. 27d). The demonstrated flexibility and
versatility of CIH's management indicate that commercial banks and CIH may now
compete for investment opportunities in an important growth sector for the
economy. Although there is no single formula for the success of a development
'finance institution, efficient, independent, professional management is an
important prerequisite. In addition, the development of a viable
sector/portfolio information base and a system for its utilization are
crucial components of a financially sound institution. The high economic and
financial rates of return that resulted from the Project indicate that
financial subsidies and tariff limitations are not always necessary for a
sector to compete internationally.

1.    The Mloroccan economy, in the 1973-77 period, witnessed impressive growth
rates averaging 7.3X annually. Rising investment expenditures and aggregate,
consumption, combined with a worsening budget deficit, led to balance of
payment problems culminating in a 1977 resource gap pf 221. The stabilization
measures of 1978, with the basic tenets of reducing public expenditures as
well as import and credit restrictions, resulted in a slowdown of economic
growth averaging 3.11 in the period 1978-79.
2.  _ The-tourism sector, ai which Morocco had.a geographical and cultural
advantage, became important because of its potential for generating foreign
exchange and employment. The sector was expected to grow at an average of
6-8X annually.. It had generated 151 of gross foreign-exchange receipts during
the period 1973-77, and its investment cost per job created was 401 that of
the manufacturing sector. Certain institutional deficiencies delayed the
development of the tourism sector in Morocco relative to that other comparable
Mediterranean countries. By the end of the seventies, the time when the CIH
IV project was being prepared, the Government was liberalizing the regulations
governing the sector's operations. This liberalization included rationalized
incentives for tourist investments, and removal of hotel tariff ceilings and
floors.
3.    rn 1980, the tourism sector faced a number of constraints, particularly
the still underdeveloped institutional set-up'/, the lack of qualified
personnel, the lack ol! data bases that would allow the formulation of a
ratioiial and forward-looking policy, and mild financial and organizational
difficulties facing the country's major tourist development financial bank
(Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH)). A ten-year dialogue between the bank
and the Moroccan Government, as well as three Bank loans directed to the
sector, led to the-following recommendations for tourism sector development:
'/ The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) became an independent entity as late a8
1977.



(i) increasing thas sector's capacity by financing econ)mically viable hotel
investments; (ii) strengthening the sector through the development of
effective methods of formulating sector plans and development strategies;
(iii) enhancing NOT and CIH's institutional capabilities through improved
collection of statistical data, reinforcement of investment analysis and
forecasting, and rationalizing sector administration; and (iv) improving
CIH's financial position through the adoption of a prudent debt/equity ratio
and the diversification of sources of foreign capital.
4.    Prior to 1980, the Bank had extended three lines of credit to CIH for a
total of $48.7 million, and had made a $21 million loan to finance
infrastructure for tourism development in the Bay of Agadir. Implementation
of the past projects had indicated improvements in the institutional
development of the sector and in relevant Government policies. Tne
disbursement of past loans to CIH had been close to or even ahead of schedule.
The second and third loans financed 85 hottls and created around 17,500 new
hotel beds at the total investment cost of $1C4 million. The related sub-
projects had economic rates of return ranging br ween 81 and 35X and created
5,700 jobs directly. CIH, under these lines of >d 4it, had generally exceeded
expectations regarding its institutional and operatiknal performance. The
direct objective of the project under review was financing additional hotel
capacity over the period 1980-1983. However, from a broader perspective it
represented the culmination of a ten-year dialogue be-Aten the Bank, the
Government and CIH, which had resulted in the emerge. ie of the latter as a
sound institution and the achievement of substantial sectoral reforms in
Morocco.
Proiect Sbiectives-and Description
S.    The objectives of the CIH tV Project (the Project) were:
(a) increasing the hotel capacity of Morocco; (b) maximizing the foreign
exchange and employment generation capabilities of the tourism sector;
(c) deepening the informational sources relevant to the sector and utilizing
these sources for analytical purposes; and (d) strengthening the
institutiom.l and financial capabilities of CIH.
6.    The allocation of the $100 million loan was as follows:  (a) US$99
million to finance tourism projects, mostly hotels, with sub-loans
administered by CIH; (b) US$0.6 million to finance a cost-benefit study on
tourism investments, the third and final phase of a major study, whose first
two phases were completed by the World Tourism Organization; and (c) US$0.4
million to train CIH's staff and to improve andecomputerize its investment
appraisal capabilities.
Najor Issues in Prpoect Organuatiron and imolementation
7.    The first Bank loan to CIH in 1970 was also the Bank's first loan to the
tourism sector anywhere in the world. In the subsequent ten years, not only
did CIH grow into a sound development financial institution, but the Bank's
lending to that sector also matured. The Project under review (incidentally,



~~~~~~-3-
the last by the Bank in that sector) utilized the accumulated experiences of
the Bank, while simultaneously refining CIH into a development finance
institution success story. There was a conviction in the Bank that CIH would
use the substantial Bank recources efficiently. The major challenge of the
Project was transforming CIH into a sustainable entity that could function
efficiently without further Bank assistance.  The Wiues on which the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) and the various supervision reports focused were rare)-
,problems that threatened the viability of the Project or CIH but were rather
.frictions" whose solution would help to institutionalize CIH's success.
These issues, and the Bank's role in them, are detailed below.
Portfolio Issues
S.   Early on in the Project's life, there was a clear distinction drawn
Vatween the publicly and privately-owned loans extended by CIH. The former
category soon proved to be a problemL with arrears peaking at 45X of hotel
loans. CIH was providing unwarranted treatment of Government-owned or
guaranteed loans and the confusion over the official bodies responsible for
the tourism sector exacerbated the problem. Parts of these arrears were due
to legal disputes between CIH and public entities owning some hotels. CIH
initially lacked a computerized system to provide a detailed analysis of its
portfolio situation. Only in the latter part of 1984 did the institution
create a separate division for loan collection.
- Since one of the LQan's covenants provided that CIH keep public debt
arrears below a certain level, the Bank missions seriously focused on the
deteriorating portfolio situation. They arranged for meetings between CIH and
the owners of the bad loans, secured agreements for-the resolution of legal
problems,pursued the MOT for a better definition of inter-sectoral
responsibilities, encouraged CIH to improve its loan collection mechanirms,
and clo3ely monitored the implementation of the portfolio data base. The
missions first threatened to stop approving sub-project applications and then
conditioned the requested extension of the commitment date on the
implementation of detailed measures intended to rectify the situation. It is
partly to the credit of the mistlons that the arrears situation improved and
is no longer a looming threat at present. Indeed, the Bank, in other loans
directed to CIR (e.g Second Housing Finance loan) is closely monitoring the
portfolio problem.
10. Problems of private s.vitor arrears were less serious. These were rarely
a result of weak appraisals or collection mechanisms but were rather due to
delays in start up and increasing costs. CIH promptly dealt with the
difficulties by rescheduling some debts and instituting gradual payment
schedules for those investors with long-term prospects. This problem, which
never reached major proportions, improved over the life of the Project. The
Bank missions found CIH's _pproach as sound and appropriate,
Financial Issues
11.   CIH's financial situation was consistently sound.  Profitability
improved despite capital increases, assets rose rapidly as the rate of sub-
project approvals increased faster than anticipated, and all financial ratios



-6-
were within the Bank specified Iimits. CIH, at one point, needed additional
resources which it stbsequently received through a law that required all
Moroccan cormercial banks to cummit 3X of their deposits to CIH bonds.
Periodic liquidity crunches resulting from the Central Bank's restrictive
monetary policies and the arrears situation, were often resolved through CIH's
access to rediscount facilities at the Central Bank. The more fundamental
problem of shorter-term liabilities being used to finance long-term assets was
to be dealt with through better liability management. The problem of a DFI
extending long-term loans in an economy with an underdeveloped capital market
is one that transcends CIH (and indeed Morocco), and whose solution is within
the realm of overall fttancial sector reform.
Institutional Issues
12.   Two crucial factors behind the success of CIH were tha stability of its
management and its role in CIH's development. In the last 15 years, CIH has
had two presidents, both of whom contributed enormously to the growth and
viability of the institution. Prior to joining CIH, neither of them had any
banking or tourism experience. Their views on policies, operations, strategy
and management were quite Aifferent and often opposed. But they both had a
common denominator: a strong desire for autonomy and growth. Autonomy was, of
course, enhanced by the de-facto monopoly of CIH in hotel financing
operations. Nevertheless, CIH developed innovative activities both in
investment financing and in diversifying resource mobilization, which allcwed
it a wider freedom of manoeuver than in the early seventies, when its policies
and financial resources were almost exelusively determined by the Government
and the Bank.
13.  Other relevant institutional issues were CIH's project appraisal
capabilities and its organizational structure. The Bank, in its previous CIH
loans, provided training to CIH staff in calculating economic rates of return
and devised a related computer package. Initially, data unavailability as
well es the incomplete understanding of the methodology precluded the
efficient utilization of the package. CIH hired a number of professionals and
provided them with sufficient training. It also established a detailed data
base and assisted in the preparation of the tourism sector study. A review of
the sub-project appraisals submitted by CIH indicates the high proficiency
achieved by CIH in this regard.  For each sub-project, CIH provided very
detailed technical, economic, financial, legal, and marketing analyses. In
addition, CIH prepared extensive quantititive simulations and qualitative
judgments prior to deciding on a sub-project. It is worth mentioning that the
Project's SAR realized the importance of sub-project appraisal and focused on
methods to improve it through training and data base development. Close
monitoring by the Bank missions was of significant value.
14.  To cope with its considerable growth in the early eighties, CIH
underwent, in 1984, a major reorganization, which reinforced its supervision
and loan collection capabilities, and strengthened its regional offices and
its ability to monitor the quality of its portfolio. The reorganization had a
role in increasing the rate of project applications, improving their quality
and reducing CIHI's arrears. The Bank missions assessed positively the impact
of the restructuring.



-7-
Informational Is sues
15.   The SAR heavily focused on issues of deepening the understanding of the
sector to better anticipate its trends, the profile of required services, the
changes in clientele, and the outlook of demand and supply. The Project was
to finance the third phase of a major study on the benefits and costs of the
sactor and one of the Project's covenants was the finalization of CIH's data
system. The evolution of the Project indicates the importance of this focus.
For example, the portfolio situation would have improved earlier if the system
of monitoring arrears had been in place promptly. Also, the aforementioned
study included an investigation of the saturation of certain markets but
unfortunately, the initiation of the study was delayed for three years with
the consequence of high levels of investments in markets (temporarily)
oversaturated (e.g. Marrakesh) leading to substantial under utilization of
capacity. Better and earlier application of the Bank's appraisal methodology
would have resulted from the prompt implementation of CII's data base.
Furthermore, optimal long-term planning and the long gestation pariods
required to design and build tourist facilities required that CIH forecast
market demand for tourism and its credit. The availability of the analytical
requirements for such a forecast was constrained by the informational gaps at
CIH.
Commitments and Disbursements
16.   The SAR based its projections of disbursements and commitments on a
conservative scenario of 61 annual growth in demand for tourist services over
the life of the Project. The actual growth surpassed the projection with the
consequence of CIH approving a greater than expected number of sub-projects.
Disbursements of the Bank loan were often above projections (at one point 300X
above the SAR estimate). Cc-mmitments, on the other hand, were below
projection. There were several apparent reasons for the delay. One reason
was the delay in the expected revision of the investment code and the pace of
commitments accelerated after the March 1983 enactment of the new code.
Another reason was that the Bank stopped approving sub-project applications
for the Marrakesh region once its occupancy rate fell below the pre-specified
minimum of 40X. Furthermore, the Bank conditioned the extension of the
commitment date (from the initial late of December 31, 1983) on CIH's
implementing certain measures that would reduce its arrear problems and
expedite the implementation of the tourism study's third phase. It took two
years for these measures to be taken, and as they were effective in solving
the said problems, the Bank did extend the date till the end of 1985. By
then, the Loan was fully committed.
Project Results
17.   The loan partially financed 99 companies receiving 230 sub-loans.  The
total cost of the sub-projects was DH 1.27 billion. Around 721 of the sub-
projects had a cost lower than DH 5 million, with the balance above that
level. Of the sub-loans, 911 financed new hotels while 91 financed extensions
to already existing establishments. As anticipated, 55 of the hotels
financed by the Loan were of the four-star category, 381 of the three-star



-8-
category, 5X of the two-star category, and only 21 of the five-star category.
18.   The maturity structure of the sub-loans was of a long-term nature
averaging 10.7 years. The sub-projects created an estimated 14,100 new hotel
beds and 6,800 new Jobs'/ at an estimated investm'   cost per job of $48,0002I.
These figures ere very close to the SAR estimate.. of 7,000 new jobs at an
average investmenr "ost. eh $ 42,000 each.  The sub-projects' economic rates of
return averaged 18. 1   -r anged between 91 and 331.  The sub-project's
arrears, as of Marc( .6 1989, amounted to-only 2.41 of the total value of the
sub-loans, still anoth¢ar indicator of COI's satisfactory appraisal and
collection capabilitisa.
19.   The quantitative results provided above only partially include the
indirect benefits accruing from the non-hotel investments. Most of the sub-
projects included restaurants, bars, and sporting facilities. Using the SAR
estimated ratio of three indirect jobs created for each direct one, the total
estimated number of jobs created by the Loan rises to around 20,000--a
significant achievement compared to job creations in manufacturing.
?roiect Sustainability
20.   CIH, the tourism sector in Morocco, and the sub-projects which the Bank
loan has financed, are in a sound position and their future prospects are
promising. The sub-projects are likely to be viable over the long term, as
indicated by their high range of economic and financial rates of return. CIH
substantially improved its supervision operations during the Project, and the
tourism sector has renewed vitality.
21.   CIH, as a development bank, is basically sound financially and
institutionally. Profits and revenues are increasinge. Even though critical
financial ratios indicated signs of deterioration over the;period 1986-87, the
World Bank, within the Second Housing Financing Project, will seek agreement
from CIH that it will maintain these ratios within certain levels. The
management of CIH is committed to growth through the diversifi:ation of
services offered. Finally, the Moroccan Government's support of the tourism
sector is substantial and the central role of CIH is unlikely to diminish
soon.
tl A number of sub-project appraisal reports did not report the number of
jobs created by the sub-project. A ratio of 0.53 labor/bed created was used
for the two and three-star category of hotels, and a ratio of 0.4 for the two-
star category hotels. These were the average ratios for the reports that did
mention the number of jobs created.
2f This is based on the exchange rate prevailing at the time the SAR was
prepared; i.e. 3.9 DH/$.

statement and balance sheet for the years 1983-87.

22.  Tourism in Morocco is thriving. Morocco's policy of diversifying
tourism investments (as opposed to countries which targeted these investments
exclusively to mass tourism and to a quasi-uniform type of medium-category
hotels) paid off in the long run by making the country a major tourism center.
Presently, hotel capacity utilization is high, even in previously saturated
markets, and the trend is expected to continue growing. Between 1984 and
1987, the number of tourist entrants to Morocco grew from 2.3 million to 2.66
million. The share of the sector remained, in the same period, at 1.5Z of GDP
despite a growing economy.
23.  A factor that could affect CIH's continued growth is the ongoing
financial sector reforms in Morocco. If pursued, and if commercial banks are
allowed to proceed with their expansion into the tourism sector, CIH stands to
lose its monopoly rosition. Indeed, the elimination of the medium-term credit
ceilings on commercial banks is seen as a first step in that direction.
Commercial banks are anxious to diversify their loan portfolios utilizing
their newly freed funds. However, CIH has the comparative advantage in the
tourism sector and increased competition would only serve to render its
operations even more efficient. In the longer-term, it is essential that CIH
itself be allowed to brancb out from its specialization.
24.   In the context of the Financial Sector Study conducted by the Bank in
1984, the question f the quasi-monopolistic position of Morocco's development
banks was raised as a potential source of inefficiencies in resource
allocation and mobilization and lack of financial competitiveness. However,
in the case of CIH, one should balance the costs of the subsidies given to
CIH's loans (in terms of interest rate rebates and other incentives),--which
have been very effective in stimulating a strong supply response from the
sector--with the benefits resulting from CTH's unique expertise in the tourism
sector during its period of growth from the early 1970's till the present.
Most of the subsidies have now disappeared. At the same time, since the mid-
eighties, and in the light of the excellent results of the sector, other
financial institutions have financed hotel development on their own or in
joint financing with CIH. As of this report, the outlook for the sector is
quite good and an increasing number of commercial banks are now involved in
its financing.
Bank/Borrower Performance
25.  The Project represented a culmination of a long-term dialogue with the
relevant authorities and it benefited from the experiences of previous CIH
projects. Bank staff working on the Project were familiar with the previous
ones and had an excellent rapport with their Moroccan counterparts. Both the
SAR and the supervisory missions rightly focused on the informational needs of
CIH specifically and the tourism sector more generally. As seen above, the
lack of required knowledge postponed the accrual of certain benefits to CIH.
Bank missions were strict in their demands of CIH and once problems were
identified and solutions prescribed, the Bank refused to approve further sub-
projects and subsequently refused to postpone the commitment date pending
CIH's action on the Bank's recommendations.

26.   CIH is considered a DPI success story and most of the credit should go
to its management, which followed an aggressive but prudent policy of
financial, organizational, and operational strengthening. CIH, however, could
have responded more promptly to the Bank's recommendations concerning the
arrears problems. Once these suggestions were adopted (two years later), the
situation improved substantially, but earlier actions by CIH would have had a
more rapid result.
Lessons Learnod From the groJect
27.   Four lessons may be derived from the CIH IV Project. These are the
following:
(a) There is no unique approach that leads to the success of a DPI.
However, similar to any other commercial enterprise, an efficient,
professional, and independent management is the cornerstone of success.
Favorable external circumstances are also prerequisites in that a company can
often "grow out" of its problems.
(b) The role of information is crucial, especially in a financial
enterprise where the risk characteristics of its financial assets determine
long-term health. It is especially important in the tourism sector, where
long gestation periods for investments exist, where the clientele is in large
part of foreign origin, and where long-term forecasts are necessary.
(c) The high economic and financial rates of return on the sub-projects
indicate that financial subsidies and tariff limitations are not indispensable
for a sector to compete internationally. This became clear to Government
officials largely as a result of the studies conducted under the Loan.
(d) While the early success of CIH, in the 1970s And early 1980s,
closely d6pended on its monopoly position, it is no longer necessary. The
initial monopoly was justified by the argument that an important national
institution needs to establish its expertise in this very risky sector and
develop,standards of financing and appraisal. The flexibility and versatility
of CIH's management should enable it to compete with commercial banks for
investment opportunities in an important growth sector for the economy.
