MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PE
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON TWO PROPOSED WANS
TO THREE YUGOSLAV WATER WORKS
FOR AN ISTRMA AND SLOVENE COAST WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed loans to
the Rizana Water Works (RW), the Istrian Water Works (IWW) and the Pula Water
Works (PWW), in the amount of US$60 million equivalent, is submitted for
approval. The proposed loans would have 15 years maturity, including 5 years
of grace, at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, and would help finance
a water supply and sewerage project.
2.       The project area includes the Slovene Coastal Region consisting of
the communities of Koper, Izola and Piran and the west coast of the Istrian
peninsula consisting of the Croatian communities of Buje, Porec, Rovinj,
Buzet, Pazin and Pula. The permanent population numbers 242,000; however,
during the summer months, the population doubles due to the arrival of
temporary residents and tourists. Tourism provides about 25l of the gross
domestic product in the project area and is an important foreign exchange
earner.
3.       Water supply in the project area is provided by three water
works-the Rizana Water Works which serves the Slovene Coastal Region, the
Pu2la Water Works which serves only the community of Pula, and the Istrian
Water Works which serves the remaining five Croatian communities. Water
shortages which occur regularly during the summer months have resulted in
tourist complaints and early departures. Although there is no official
estimate of lost revenue, all industry experts agree that water shortages are
a major constraint to continued development and would cause a reduction in the
area's tourism business if not corrected. Tariffs of the three entities, RW,
rwW and PWW, are increased frequently during each year to compensate for the
impact of inflation on operating costs. The entities are managed well and are
financially sound. They have satisfactory accounting, billing, management
information systems and organizational structures.
*        4.       Sewage disposal in the project area is a community respon&ibility.
The main method of disposal for the coastal communities is by sea outfall to
the Adriatic after preliminary treatment. This method is considered by
experts to be environmentally sound. Only one of the three communities with
inland urban centers has an adequate collection and disposal system. The
other two discharge to the nearest water course without treatment. Sewage
from Pazin, one of these centers, is polluting a ground water supply source
for Pula and another community outside the project area. Most tourism areas



-2-
along the coast are free of pollution, but this could change if the
construction of pollution control facilities in the tourism areas does not
keep pace with increased water use and planned tourism development.
Rationale for Bank bIolvement
5.         The main thrust of the Bank's assistance strategy in Yugoslavia is
to support the country's ongoing economic reform. Since the early 1980s, the
Government has embarked on a long-term economic adjustment and reform program
intended to give the economy a greater market-based orientation, with a view
to the Europe of 1992 and beyond. By mid-1988, an IMF Standby Arrangement in
support of this program was approved and rescheduling agreements were reached
with the Paris Club and Yugoslavia's major commercial creditors. In the
context of the preparation of a second SAL, the Bank participated actively
with the Fund and the bilateral and commercial creditors in the discussion of
the Government's stabilization and adjustment program. The proposed SAL IT is
seen as the linchpin of the Bank's strategy for intensified assistance to
Yugoslavia. Its approval and successful implementation would pave the way for
subsequent policy-based operations and would justify an enlarged overall
lending envelope to Yugoslavia which would also include several sector and
investment loans in industry, transport and power and smaller investment
projects in environmental improvement, water resource management and possibly
other areas of infrastructure. The proposed Project fits in the category of
smaller investment projects in the area of infrastructure and environmental
improvement. This category of project consists of projects which essentially
stand on their own merit and whose developmental impact is not critically
dependent on overall policy reform.
6.       The proposed Project would be the Bank's ninth operation in the
sector. Four of the previous projects were multi-purpose, with irrigation,
power, or flood control components, and thus had benefits outside the sector.
One, in Dubrovnik, was similar to the proposed Project in that it supported
tourism development. Most were designed to meet basic needs and improve
health in the lesser developed republics. All of the completed projects had
satisfactory ex-post rates of return on completion, and all are considered to
have had positive development impacts. Most of the Bank's assistance in the
sector has focused on the strengthening of institutions and the development of
sound financial strategies. The Bank's involvement has often acted as a
catalyst in securing the required local financing, which is otherwise
difficult to obtain.
7.       The Project would fill three important needs. First, it is essential
to the tourism industry in an area where tourism is important for the region's
development and a major foreign exchange earner. Second, pollution control
works and studies included in the Project would ensure that sewage resulting
from existing water use and increased water use made possible by the Project
would be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Third, it would
promote improvement in system operation and management through studies, action
plans for the reduction of unaccounted-for water, and technical assistance.
The Bank's presence is necessary since under Yugoslavia's present economic
environment, it would be very difficult for the water works to secure foreign
financing for the Project without the Bank. More importantly, the Bank would
insure that the pollution control issue associa'ed with the Project is
adequately addressed.

Pro*ect Objectives
8.       The Project would in the service areas of the borrowers:  (i)
eliminate existing water shortages; (ii) provide additional water supply
capacity needed for expansion of the tourism industry and growth in domestic
and industrial/commercial demand; (iii) reduce unaccounted-for water; (iv)
protect existing water sources and coastal tourist areas from pollution; and
(v) increase efficiency in the delivery of water supply and sewerage services.
PFroect escriMton
9.       The Project would have an Istria component and a Slovene Coast
component.  The Slovene Coast component comprises:  pumping equipment for
existing wells; a water treatment plant expansion; an 18 km transmission
system; distribution network rehabilitation; a sewage treatment plant and sea
outfall; main collector sewers; the purchase of operating equipment; technical
assistance for the reduction of unaccounted-for water and a tariff study. The
Istria component comprises: a new water treatment plant; an 87 km
transmission system; sewage treatment plants for Pasin and Buje town centers;
sea outfalls and sewerage collectors; the acquisition of operating equipment;
a study for combining IW and PWW; a master sewerage plan for central Istria;
technical assistance for unaccounted-for water reduction and tariff studies.
10.      The total cost of both project components is estimated at US$243.9
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$86.6 million
equivalent (362). A breakdown of costs and the financing plans are shown in
Schedules Al and A2. Retroactive financing in the amount of US$2.0 million
(3.31 of the loan amounts) would be provided for expenditures incurred on
selected works awarded after June 1, 1988. The works in question can be put
into service immediately and are an important part of the Borrowers' plan to
manage water shortages before completion of the Project (para. 14).
Therefore, they could not be delayed until after loan signing. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedules
are shown in Schedule B. Special accounts will be opened for the Slovene
Coast and Istria components of the project. Initial deposits will be $3.0
million for each of these two components. A timetable of key Project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Yugoslavia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal keport, No. 7971-YU dated May 1, 1989 is being distributed
separately.
Ad-e Aetff
11.      Agreements were reached that:
(a) RWW, IWW and PWW would (i) enter into agreements with the
implementing agencies for the execution of the sewerage works
included in the Project (condition of loan effectiveness); (ii)
carry out studies of the tariff structure not later than
December 31, 1990, consult the Bank on the recommendations
before March 31, 1991 and take measures for their
implementation promptly thereafter; (iii) maintain annual
operating ratios of not more than 801 beginning in 1989; and
(iv) agree with the Bank before introducing increases in a
given year's projected expenditures for investments other than
the Bank Project that would result in average annual
expenditures in excess of specified amounts.



-4-
(b)   IWW and PWW would (i) through the Committee for Water
Management of the Republic of Croatia, carry out a master plan
sewerage study for Central Istria not later than December 31,
1990; and (ii) carry out a study of the management of water
supplies in Istria, including a study of how best to manage the
water supply system completed under the Project, not later than
December 31, 1992, consult the Bank on the recommendations
before March 31, 1993, and take measures to obtain the approval
of the agreed recommendations by the appropriate authorities
promptly thereafter; and
(c)   RWW and PWW would carry out action plans for the reduction of
unaccounted-for water by December 31, 1994.
Benefits
12.      The main benefits of the Project will accrue to the inhabitants and
tourism industry in the project area. Without the Project, foreign exchange
earnings from tourism in the project area would stagnate and possibly
decline. Approximately 70X of the tourists visiting the project arci are
foreign and 50% of the water demand during the summ6ir is tourism re±ated. Net
foreign exchange earnings from tourism in the project area in 1986 are
estimated at US$0.5 billion. Until the beginning of the water shortage, the
annual grovth in tourism as measured by tourist overnights was about 5 percent
per annum. The permanent population would also benefit from improved
environmental conditions and water service since it is also affected by
pollution and water shortages. Implementation of the Central Istria Sewerage
Master Plan recommendations will have a significant beneficial impact on the
environment in this area of the project.
RAsks
13.      There are two potential risks.  One is the risk of possible damage to
the area's tourism development if the water shortages are not managed properly
until the Project is completed. However, at the present time, the available
water is being distributed equitably and efficiently and the Bank would try to
minimize the risk by Monitoring operational procedures of the three water
works as part of its supervision. The other is a risk that the overall
investment climate in Yugoslavia could deteriorate further and become a
constraint to tourism development in the project area. However, the demand
for tourism services is likely to remain strong even in the presence of
macro-economic uncertainty and turbulence.
14.      Recomnmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loans.
