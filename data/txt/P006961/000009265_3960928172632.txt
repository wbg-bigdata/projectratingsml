LOAN/CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
Beneficiaries:  Public and private entities and enterprises in CDB member
countries eligible for receiving IBRD/IDA funds.
Amount:         $20.0 million IBRD loan
SDR 9.1 million IDA credit (US$12.0 million)
Terms:          IBRD loan to CDB - fixed amortization schedule:  17 years
including a grace period of 5 years at the IBRD standard
variable interest rate.
IDA credit to CDB: standard, with 40 years maturity.
Onlending
Terms:         (i) The proceeds of the IBRD loan would be onlent by CDB
at CDB's variable rate, adjusted annually to cover its
cost of borrowing and administrative expenses. This
rate is currently 9.3% plus a 1% front-end fee. The
amortization period of the subloans would be
determined by CDB on project grounds.
(ii) Disbursements of the IDA credit, blended with IBRD
funds, would be authorized to be relent by CDB for
subprojects in OECS countries which have sound
economic policies or would have agreed to adopt
adjustment programs acceptable to IBRD/IDA and CDB.
Blending of IBRD/IDA funds would be no softer than a
50:50 IBRD/IDA blend for national subprojects in OECS
countries and 33:67 for OECS regional subprojects.
The onlent credits to the OECS governments would have
maturities not exceeding 35 years. Guyana, when
eligible, would be entitled to maturities rot
exceeding 40 yjars. The borrowing governments would
onlend IDA resources to subborrowers on commercial
terms so that the benefit of IDA concessicnary terms
could accrue to the governments. For both the IBRD
loan and the IDA credit, the foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the CDB's subborrowers and
governments, respectively.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMEN- BANK (CDB)
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
US$20 million loan and SDR 9.1 million (US$12 million) development credit
to the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) is submitted for approval. The
loan and the credit would help CDB finance subprojects of the types which
the Bankl itself would finance. The proposed loan would be repayable over
a period of 17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the IBRD standard
variable interest rate and the proposed credit would he on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity.
2.       Background.  CDB was established in 1970 by 16 Cimmonwealth
Caribbean governments as "regional members", Canada and the UK as
"r,onregional members", and with financial assistance from the USA, a
nonmember. Venezuela joined CDB in 1973, Colombia in 1974, Mexico and
Anguilla in 1982, France in 1984, Italy in 1988, and the Federal Republic
of Germany in 1989. CDB's Charter provides that the regional members must
hold not less than 60% of its shares. CDB has the task of promoting
economic development and integration in the Commonwealth Caribbean, with
special regard to the needs of the less developed countries (LDCs) in the
region. The LDCs consist of Antigua and Barbuda, D>minica, Grenada,
St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize,
Montserrat, and other UK dependencies. The first six countries listed
above and Montserrat are members of the Organization of East Caribbean
States (OECS). To fulfill its task, CDB assists its regional members in
formulating their development programs, provides technical assistance and
finances their projects and programs.
3.       Since its inception, CDB, with substantial assistance from
bilateral and multilateral aid agencies (including the Bank), has developed
into an important regional development finance institution. Its cumulative
loan approvals through the end of 1988 amounted to US$650 million, covering
national and regional projects in such sectors as transport, public
utilities, housing, industry and tourism, agriculture, and financial
intermediaries. CDB's financial condition remains basically sound with a
strong capital structure and comfortable liquidity, reflecting sound
financial policies. Its loan portfolio, reflecting economic difficulties
which some of the Commonwealth Caribbean countries have been encountering
in recent years, includes (non-performing) loans to Guyana and (to a lesser
extent) to Antigua and Barbuda. However, by refusing to approve new loans
in countries in arrears, CDB has managed to keep its borrowing members
(with the above two exceptions) from accumulating substantial protracted
arrears. CDB has a strong, well-knit management team and generally
competent professional staff, supplemented by donor-financed special
experts and consultants. Its operating policies and procedures, by and
large, are similar to the Bank's own.
j./ As used in this report, the term "Bank" normally refers to IBRD and
IDA.



4.       The Bank has been associated with CDB since its inception,
provibing technical assistance arid four loans/credits. The first three
operations were of the line-of-credit type, designed to finance projects
which were too small to warrant direct IBRD/IDA involvement. In the fourth
operation (a regional OECS technical edueatiOII project), CDB acted as the
financial conduit for IDA, the project coordinator and a co-financier. On
the whole, the Bank's experience with CDB hias been quite satisfactory. A
PPAR on on the first CDB projecL has been issued (Report No. 6306-CRG).
Its conclusion regarding the desirability of a hetter focused institution-
building effort by the Bank has been reflected in the subsequent lending
operations and will actively be addressed unider the new Bank/CDB
collaborative program. A PCR on the second CDB project is being prepared.
The third CDB project, some delay notwithstanding, is being im?lemented
satisfactorily. The fourth CDB project is by and large progressing well.
Through implementation of these projects, certain institutional
shortcomings which constrained the CDB operations (mainly in the areas of
loan administration and fina;acial policies) have been overcome in recent
years and the proposed project will help CDB overcome others.
5.       Last year, a general review and analysis of the future Bank/CDB
relationship was conducted. The review has concluded that a closer
collaboration between the two institutions, tinder which CDB would
progressively take over certain Bank roles in the Commonwealth Caribbean
over a 3-5 year period, would offer a good opportunity for both
institutions to improve the efficiency of their operations, to the benefit
of their common member states. CDB, in general, has a comparative
advantage over the Bank for less complicated investment lending,
principally because of its lower manpower costs and its proximity to the
borrowers. To the extent CDB can take over Bank roles in such project
lending, and gradually in other activities, the Bank would be able to focus
its attention more on economic dialogue and policy advice to its member
states, adjustment lending and aid coordination. By broadening the scope
of its services, CDB would be able to solidify its role in the region. As
a basis for their closer collaboration, the Bank and CDB have recently
negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding, setting forth the main areas and
modalities of collaboration. This Memorandum of Understanding calls for
preparation of 2-year rolling work programs by the Bank and CDB, for annual
(or more frequent) reviews between them to coordinate their collaborative
activities. During these reviews, attention would be given to CDB's
manpower/staff training needs to fulfill its role under the collaborative
program.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Bank operations in the Caribbean
have emphasized the need to respond better and more efficiently to its
Commonwealth Caribbean member states' developmental needs. Closer
collaboration between the Bank and CDB would enable each institution to
take the lead on lending operations and other development work reflecting
its comparative advantage. This division of labor offers incremental
benefits in terms of the scope and focus of development assistance to the
common member states being served.



- 3 -
7.       Project Obiectives.  The project would seek to: (a) enhance the
amount and scope of development and financial services offered to common
Bank/CDB member states in the Commonwealth Caribbean by appropriate
division of labor between the Bank and CDB under the new collaborative
program; (b) strengthen CDB to become a wore effective regional development
institution; and (c) ehannel, at a lower cost than the Bank could do
directly, the Bank loan/credit funds to eligible Bank/CDB member countries
in the Commonwealth Caribbean.
8.       Project Description.  The IBRD loan and IDA credit proceeds would
be re-lent by CDB for public and private sector projects of the type which
the Bank normally finances. The eligible sectors include: agriculture,
agroindustry, manufacturing, tourism, transportation, water and sewerage,
power, and housing. Emergency recovery assistance lending would also be
included. IBRD/IDA may add new sectors, or delete one or more of the
existing sectors in consultation with CDB. Under the new Memorandum of
Understanding, the Bank and CDB would jointly review, at least once every
year, their respective operational and lending programs, including
subprojects to be financed out of proceeds of the proposed lending.
9.       All IBRD/CDB member courtries in the Commonwealth Caribbean, which
are creditworthy and have not been graduated from IBRD lending, would be
eligible to borrow the IBRD loan proceeds. The Bank would inform CDB from
time to time on countries eligible to borrow under the proposed IBRD loan
and the IDA credit. Guyana, when eligible, would benefit from CDB
relending of the IDA credit proceeds. The OECS countries, which have not
fully attained their creditworthiness for exclusive IBRD lending, would
also be eligible for some IDA financing blended with IBRD funds. In 1985,
the Executive Directors allowed an IDA phase-out period for them (through
FY90), during which some IDA funds are being blended with IBRD funds
(R85-335, IDA/R85-134, dated November 18, 1985). Thus, eligible OECS
countries would benefit from a blend of IBRD/IDA funds under the proposed
lending, with the understanding that the blending ratio will not be softer
than 50/50 for national projects and 33/67 for OECS regional projects. As
under the first three IBRD/IDA lending operations (which were lines of
credit) IBRD's and IDA's charging of commitment fees would be delayed until
each subproject is authorized by IBRD/IDA for disbursements, given the time
required for CDB to appraise subprojects and to enter into the required
agreements including country guarantees required by IBRD. CDB's current
pipeline of IBRD and IDA subprojects covers more than the amounts of the
proposed loan and credit. The total cost of the proposed project is
estimated at US$102 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$75 million (73.5%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group
lending operations to CDB are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8353-CRG, dated
March 26, 1990, is also attached.

10.      Act_ins Agreed   CDB has, in consultation with the Bank, adopted
its medium-term lending strategies covering the infrastructure, industry,
tourism, and agriculture sectors and indirect lending through financial
intermediaries. It has adopted eligibility criteria, acceptable to the
Bank, for financial intermediaries to have access to CDB's resources. It
has also adopted Guidelines on environmental impact assessment, acceptable
to the Bank, and has prepared Guidelines on emergency recc%ery assistance.
CDB has agreed to assign to IDA its rights to subloan contracts made !Ath
IDA resources. Consequently, this approach would be equivalent to a direct
IDA credit to the country receiving it. CDB's liabilities in respect of
the credit would be limited to amounts paid to CDB by sub-borrowers in
respect of subloans. To reimburse CDB for its estimated costs in relending
the proposed IDA credit on IDA terms, IDA would pay to CDB a fee totalling
US$660,000, in five equal annual installments. CDB has agreed to submit
each year to IDA a statement of actual admini-'rative costs for making and
administering IDA subloans. CDB has agreed t. reserve US$7.8 million of
the proposed IBRD loan for the OECS subborrowers during the first three
years from the loan effective date. Eor further strengthening CDB's
capabilities and improving its operational performance, the Bank and CDB
would agree selectively (as part of the collaborative program) on short-
term secondment of CDB staff to the Bank, joint missions for
economic/sector work and project work, the Bank's review of CDB documents
and joint programming of operational activity. During negotiaticis,
agreements were reached that CDB would- (a) financo subprojects n
accordance with its "Operational Policies and Procedures Manual   ith
adherence to its "Financial Policies and Operating Guidelines';   b) send
to the Bank for review and comment a project description and an appraisal
report on all projects to be financed by CDB out of the proposed loan and
credit; (c) not use more than 35% of the proceeds of the proposed loan and
the credit (separately) in any one of its member cour.tries; and fi) use
guidelines acceptable to the Bank for procurement under the proposed
project. Conditions for loan and credit effectiveness would include CDB's
adoption of acceptable Guidelines on emergency recovery assistance.
11.      Benefits.  Because of CDB's lower costs per operation, it can make
a larger number of loans in the region, whereas the Bank, due to staff
constraints, would have to limit itself to fewer loans/credits in the same
period. Thus, lending through CDB will enable the Bank to have greater
country coverage and economic impact than if it tried to make loans/credits
directly. The proposed project would be instrumental for the Bank and CDB
to develop closer ties within the framework of a new collaborative program
for the benefit of their common member states. Through closer association
with CDB, the Bank would assist CDB to build up its strength as a major
development institution in the Commonwealth Caribbean.
12.      Risks.  First, commitment of funds under the project could be
delayed due to the proposed formula for blending IBRD/IDA funds, as some
OECS borrowers may consider it a hard blend and may be reluctant to accept
CDB subloans. Second, significant changes in world commodity prices could
slow subproject execution and, hence, loan/credit disbursements. However,
CDB has an adequate pipeline of subprojects, most of which are well
advanced in preparation. Finally, a multi-year comprehensive Bank/CDB



collaboration will require special efforts to operate smoothly. Close
relationships being developed between the two institutions at various
levels would help resolve difficulties that could arise from time to time.
13.      R9c2jZ&U4atiom. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the
Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan and credit.
