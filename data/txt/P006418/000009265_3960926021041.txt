1. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Country:               BRAZIL
Project:               Electric Power Sector Loan
Borrower:              Federative Republic of Brazil
Intermediary:          Ceo,trais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
Beneficiaries:         - Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF)
- Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.
(ELETRONORTE)
- Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil S.A.
(ELETROSUL)
- FURNAS Centrais Bletricas S.A. (FURNAS)
Amount:                US$500.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                 Repayment in 15 years, including three years of
grace, with interest at the Bank's standard variable
rate.
Relending Term":       The Borrower will transfer an asmount equivalent to
the loan proceeds, in cruzados (Cz$), as equity
contributions to ELETROBRAS which, in turn, will
transfer these funds as equity contributions to four
of its subsidiaries, the beneficiaries of the loan.
Project Objectives
and Description:     The proposed project is based on the 1986-1989 Power
Sector Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP) which has been
prepared during the last two years by the Government
and ELETROBRAS, with the technical support of the
Bank. The PSRP has been analyzed and found
satisfactory by the Bank. The sector rehabilitation
is to be achieved by: reducing the investment
program to minimum acceptable levels; following
appropriate investment priorities; balancing the
composition of the program among generation,
transmission and distribution; increasing
substantially the sector's internal cash generation,
mainly through tariff increases; increasing, through
Government contributions, the sector's equity
capital; and promoting energy conservation. The
proposed loan will help the Government provide the
equity contributions required by the sector in
1986. These contributions will be given to the
utilities with the mDst urgent financial needs on
the basis of rehabilitation plans acceptable to the
Bank. The equity contributions will enable these
utilities to implement priority investments included
in the PSRP.

Risks:                  No particular physical risks are expected to affect
the implementation of the sector's 1986-1989
investment program, as similar works (generation,
transmission aud distribution) have been
successfully constructed in the past. The main risk
derives from the financial difficulties faced by the
Brazilian power sector. These problems are being
addressed through a program of financial measures
included in the PSRP, which will progressively
improve the financial condition of the sector.
Failure to implement the above measures may
adversely affect the sector finances and may result
in delays in the execution of the investment
program. To reduce this risk, during loan
negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government and ELETROBRAS on the implementation of
the financial measures included in the PSRP, which
will be supervised closely by the Bank.

1/ These estimates were calculated utilizing constant price levels
prevailing in March 1986. They include taxes and import duties as
applicable (which amount to about 10% of the cost) as well as
physical contingencies.  They exclude price contingencies as explained
in para. 3.13. The investments during 1986-1989 for the Itaipu
hydroelectric scheme, and for nuclear plants, were excluded (see para.
3.12).

Disbursements;          The proposed loan will help the Government to
finance the equity contributions which are required
by the sector to achieve the investment and
financial targets envisaged in the PSRP for 1986.
The proceeds of the loan, therefore, should be made
available to the Government during this year. The
loan will be disbursed against acceptable general
country imports which are to be procured in
accordance to practices acceptable to the Bank. It
is expected that US$250 million (first tranche) will
be disbursed by July 31, 1986 and the remaining
US$250 million by December 31, 1986.
Rate of Return:         Near 11% rate of return on the 1986-1989 investment
program, using, as a proxy for benefits, the retail
tariffs required to attain the legal 10% rate of
remuneration level by 1990.

2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Sector
- Energy Resources
2.01      Brazil's energy resources comprise a vast hydropotential, as well
as oil shaie, coal, nucl3ar fuels and biomass.  Proven oil and gas reserves
while limited, are growing. Of the indigenous energy resources hydro,
biomass and oil currently play a significant role in the country's energy
supply mix. Domestic oil production has increased significantly in recent
years; in 1985 it covered about 50% of the market requirements. The
potentlal for hydroelectric development is estimated at about 213,000 MW of
which about 50,000 MW are in use or under construction.
2.02      The Government has made important efforts to increase domestic oil
production and substitute domestic alcohol, natural gas, coal and other
sources of energy for oil. Started in 1975, production of alcohol for use as
fuel in internal combustion engines amounted in 1984 to nine billion liters,
equivalent to 120,000 bbls. of oil per day. In view of the falling oil
prices, the Go -.iment is currently reassessing the goals of the alcohol
program. In 1/', coal production was 6.2 million tons, equivalent to 35,000
bbls. of oil per day or about 5% of the energy supply.  In the early 70's,
Brazil started to develop a nuclear generating capaclty, but the presen-
Government has slowed down such development substantially, and nuclear energy
is not expected now to play a significant role in the foreseeable future.
Nuclear power generation might have an important role in electricity
generation beyond the year 2010, when most of the economically exploitable
hydro resources would be utilized. Efforts have also been made for a more
intensive utilization of other domestic energy resources, including burning
wood and sugarcane bagasse for electricity generation in isolated areas.
Although lower oil prices over the medium-term may alter the speed and
magnitude of the substitution effort in the future, Brazil's reduced
dependence on imported oil today gives the country more flexibility in
managing its economic growth than it had previously.
- Energy Demand and Supply
2.03      In 1984, Brazil's gross energy consumption was 167 million tons of
oil equivalent (t.o.e.), or 1.3 t.o.e. per capita. Oil products, about 50%
of them imported, accounted for 32% of energy consumption and
hydroelectricity for 32%; and the remaining 36% was met mainly by coal, wood
products and bagasse.
- National Energy Policy
2.04      Brazil's national energy policy has been designed to promote the
economic use of energy resources and reduce the country's dependence on
foreign energy imports. As such, it has the following main objectives:



- 5 -
(a)  Conservation and rational use of energy to encourage maximum
efficiency in the utilization of energy resources;
(b) substitution of imported energy sources by domestic ones,
especially "renewables', wherever technically and economically
feasible, to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and coal; and
(c) exploitation of existing domestic energy resources and
intensification of search for new sources.
While (b) and (c) are desirable objectives, it is important for Brazil to
scrutinize further development of domestic energy sources carefully. Given
the country's domestic and external resource constraints and the prospects of
lower real oil prices for the rest of the decade, only cost-effective
substitutes which require relatively modest investments should be
undertaken. The Government is now reassessing the alcohol program, in view
of the new oil trends, and will be reexamining its long-range petroleum
program. Controlling energy consumption is also important. Conservation is
still a cost-effective energy investment, and pricing policy an effective way
to promote conservation. The Government has not yet established a formal
policy on cogeneration. The study on the sector's institutional structure to
be carried out under this operation (para 2.10), will address this matter.
As discussed later on in this report, electric power rates are currently
below the long-run marginal cost of production, and they are expected to
reach that level by December 1989 (see paras. 2.11 and 2.17). Finally, more
coordination in the development and use of the major fuels is needed, in
order to reduce overexpansion of capacity. The issues related to power are
being dealt with through this and other Bank power loans, while loans for
transportation address issues related to other fuels.
Power Sector
- Organization
2.05      The institutional development of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of small utilities into a relatively compact structure of state and
federally-owned utilities. The power sector is under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) created in 1960. Since then, there has
been a trend towards increasing sector efficiency and coordination with the
establishment of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS) in 1962,
and the strengthening of the Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia
Eletrica (DNAEE), within MME, as regulatory agency.  The aim has been to
combine, as much as possible, regionalization of operations with country-wide
optimization of resources.



- 6 -
2.06      Though complex, and one of the largest in the world, the
electric power sector is well organized. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967,
established the current sector organization under which DNAEE performs
regulatory functions, grants licenses for generating plants, assigns
concessions, approves expansion plans and sets tariffs, after approval by the
Ministry of Planning, under the principle of service-at-cost plus an adequate
return on capital (Annex 2.1). ELETROBRAS serves as a holding company and as
a sector development bank. ELETROBRAS also analyzes expansion plans for
major generating and transmission facilities and coordinates and supervises
the public power system.
2.07      Four ELETROBRAS subsidiaries (FURNAS, CHESF, ELETROSUL and
ELETRONORTE) are responsible primarily for regional generation and
high-voltage transmission systems. They act as bulk suppliers to state and
municipal utility companies which generally are responsible for
sub-transmission and electricity distribution. In addition to the four
regional subsidiaries, ELETROBRAS also owns ESCELSA (Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricas), the power distributor for the State of Espirito Santo in the
Southeast, and LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A., servicing the
metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. ELETROBRAS also holds the Brazilian
Government's 50% interest in the Itaipu Binacional, the binational agency set
up in April 1973 by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay to build jointly
the 12,600 MW Itaipu hydroelectric racility on the Parana river.
2.08      Since 1967 the Government policy has been to consolidate public
electricity service in the individual states into single state-owned
utilities primarily responsible for distribution activities, although some of
them have also generation and transmission. This policy has resulted in the
absorption by the major state-owned companies of many municipal and privately
owned utilities and in the gradual transfer to the state-owned utilities of
ELETROBRAS' ownership in distribution utilities.
- Institutional Aspects
2.09      The Federal Government takes most of the important decisions
affecting the power sector: it approves investment programs, sets tariffs,
authorizes external borrowings, and sets constraints on wage policies. This
decision making process is carried out in a centralized fashion and reflects
broader macroeconomic concerns. In the past, such process has meant that
tariff adjustments have been inadequate to meet real cost increases;
subsidized tariffs have been approved to promote exports and to stimulate the
substitution of electricity for imported oil products; and the borrowing
capacity of the sector has been used beyond prudent limits, taking advantage
of the sector's access to foreign financing resources. The result of all
this has been adverse to sector finances.
2.10      In order to introduce a more decentralized decision-making process
- financial and otherwise - it has become necessary to review the
institutional structure of the sector as well as some of its policies. In
this respect, several efforts have been made by Government and sector



entities but little has been achieved because of lack of coordination and
clearly defined goals. The review should include tne sector's policies,
organization, legislation, roles of sector entities, and degree of autonomy.
Among the policies, especial emphasis should be given to the tariff
equalization scheme and the participation of the private sector (see Annex
2.2). During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Federal Government
and ELETROBRAS to carry out, by June 30, 1987, a study to review the
institutional structure of the sector, and to implement the recommendationa
of such study. Terms of reference will be furnished to the Bank for its
approval, by August 31, 1986.
- Growth of Demand
2.11      In 1985, national average priduction of electricity was about 1,250
kWh per capita. The industrial sector used 55% of the electricity and the
residential sector 20%. Owing to the high industrial and urban concentration
in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the geographical distribution
of demand is uneven. Though the most developed states have promoted rural
electrification, access to electricity in rural areas for the whole country
is still low (about 22%). During the period of 1970 to 1980, public service
electricity consumption rose at an average annual growth rate of 13%, which
is very high when compared with other countries. Though the annual rate of
increase in the last five years has been lower than the previous decade's,
about 8% p.a., it is still high when compared with other countries. The
revised projections of electricity consumption recently prepared by
ELETROBRAS show that demand is expected to grow about 10% in 1986 and at a
moderate rate of about 8% p.a. in the period 1986-1990 4nd of about 6% p.a.
thereafter. The estimate of power market growth after 1990 will be further
analyzed by Bank staff next November in the framework of the planned review
of the updated sector investment and financial plan that will be presented
then by the Government (para. 3.02), and of macroeconomic projections based
upon the results of the ongoing revision by the Government of its medium-term
economic program. Details on the market as well as on the power system
energy balance and losses are included in Annexes 2.3 and 2.4. The lower
forecast rates of growth imply a certain degree of energy management through
pricing. The Government's intention now is to increase tariffs over time to
reflect long-run marginal cost. Under loans 2564-BR and 2565-BR, the
Government agreed on a plan of action to implement by December 1989 the
recommendations of a long-run marginal cost study financed by the Bank
(para. 2.17).
- System Expansion Planning
2.12      ELETROBRAS has the primary responsibility for the coordination of
planning in the power sector and for the preparation of system generation and
transmission expansion plans. Distribution planning is the responsibility of
each individual utility company and participation of ELETROBRAS in the global
assessment of the adequacy of the level of investments of the individual
utilities ensures a consistent approach. ELETROBRAS is subject to the
supervision of DNAEE in the preparation of its plans, and the plans
themselves are subject to the formal approval of MME. However, since 1981,



- 8 -
the responsibility for approving the investment programs of public utilities
has been exercised by the Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN).
2.13      ELETROBRAS has developed a comprehensive and satisfactory set of
planning models for the preparation of long-term (20 to 30 years),
medium-term (10 years) and short-term (about five years) generation and
transmission development plans. The long-term plans are revised every five
years and the medium and short-term plans are revised annually (Chapter 3).
- Electricity Pricing
2.14      Brazilian electricity revenues have two components in addition to
the basic tariff: the sole tax and the compulsory loan which together account
for almost 16% of electricity revenues (see Annex 2.1, para. 1). Tariffs for
each class of consumer and rates of remuneration for the utilities are
equalized on a nation-wide basis.
2.15      The equalization scheme for tariffs and rates of remuneration is
implemented through the Global Guarantee Fund (RGG), a mechanism by which
companies with a rate of remuneration higher than the sector average make
payments to the RGG, and companies with a rate of remuneration lower than the
sector average receive funds from the RGG. In the past, when the sector
enjoyed robust financial health and the Federal Government was sufficiently
strong to enforce its centralized decision making process, the equalization
scheme worked reasonably well. At present, however, when the sector is
facing financial difficulties and the new government is restoring authority
back to state governments, the equalization scheme has developed significant
problems, as companies with a rate of remuneration higher than the sector
average but lower than the 10% established as a minimum by Brazilian law are
reluctant to make payments to the RGG and, in some cases, have refused to do
so. Thus, the financial crisis tends to be exacerbated for the utilities
that are recipients of RGG funds as long as the sector's average rate of
remuneration remains lower than 10%. This has created serious financial
imbalances among sector companies and the difficulties in solving such
imbalances suggest the need for modification of the equalization scheme.
During loan negotiations it was agreed that under the study to review the
sector institutioual structure (para. 2.10) special coasideration 'i '1 be
given to the equalization scheme.
2.16      The tariff schedules differentiate between classes of consumers and
provide discounts to certain consumers, as part of the country's general
economic and social policies. Thus substantial discounts (about 80%) are
given to promote substitution of oil derivatives. However, in view of the
power sector's financial difficulties (para. 2.21) and the oil price trends,
tihe Government has decided to discontinue these discounts starting January 1,
1987 (see para. 3.17).
2.17      A comprehensive study of electricity tariffs was completed by DNAEE
(in association with ELETROBRAS) in 1985; the study began in 1977 with
technical assistance from Electricite de France, and Bank financing through
loans 1300-BR and 1939-BR. The results of this study are being put into
effect over several years in the framework of currently enacted legislation,



- 9 -
and should result in more efficient use of installed capacity by encouraging
conservation and efficient resource allocation. As a result of the study, a
new electricity tariff policy has been established for country-wide
implementation. The new policy features three tariff groups for each of the
main voltage levels: high, medium, and low. High voltage consumers account
for 53% of total electricity consumption in Brazil; electricity rates in this
range include peak and off-peak levels, seasonality schedules, and power and
energy demand ratel. High voltage electricity rates were initially optional,
but have become mandatory since January 1986. Pilot implementation of medium
and low voltage rates is underway; medium voltage rates are scheduled for
introduction in the second half of 1986. The full implementation of the new
tariff policy is scheduled to be completed by end-1989. This is in line with
the contractual agreements between the Bank and the Braziiian Government
under loans 2564-BR and 2565-BR. Present tariff levels are about 66% of
long-run marginal cost and are expected to reach 100% by December 1989.
- Sector Finances
2.18      In the early 1960's the Government reorganized the power sector to
make it an important contributing factor to national economic development
(para, 2.05). At the same time, the Government implemented financing
policies which led to the setting of tariffs at realistic levels and the
provision of equity contributions. These financing policies resulted in
adequate levels of non-borrowed financing for an ambitious investment program
which would satisfy the electricity requirements of the national development
program.
2.19      As a result of those tariff policies, the consumer-based fund
generation and its contribution to the growing investment program increased
steadily through the mid-1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of
financial soundness. In 1973, the net (after debt service) consumer-based
fund generation had a share of 56% in the sector's funding mix whereas
borrowings had a share of only 30%, the rest being equity contributions.
Coincidentally with such peak in sector financial soundness, the sector
initiated an even more ambitious investment program which included three
major generating schemes: the Itaipu (12,600 MW) and Tucurul (7,600 MW)
hydroelectric projects, and the nuclear program.
2.20      The heavy investment program ir. non-oil-fueled generating schemes
became mDre justifiable because of the oil crises. The oil crises of the
1970's, however, also created a different set of financial conditions for the
Brazilian power sector: (i) inflation affected substantially the unit costs
of the investment program; and (ii) the Government, in its fight against
inflation, allowed tariff levels to deteriorate in real terms. In the early
1980's, as part of its economic policies and to make better use of excess
hydroelectric capacity then available, the Government also established
special low tariffs to promote substitution of electricity for energy
generated by imported fuel and to promote the export of electricity-intensive
goods. As a result of such promotional tariffs, the average sector revenues
declined, and the need for sector investments increased.



- 10 -
2.21      As a consequence of the above conditions, since 1978 the sector
rate of remuneration has not reached the legal minimum of 10%. It is
estimated that this deficiency represented a loss of sector revenues
equivalent to US$4.3 billion through end 1985. Furthermore, to finance its
investment program, the sector became increasingly dependent on borrowings
which were provided on ever more stringent terms and which involved a heavy
debt-service burden. Since 1983, debt service has exceeded the level of
consumer-based fund generation, resulting in a negative net self-financing
ratio.
2.22      In an attempt to reverse the deteriorating trend in sector
finances, the Government and the Bank reviewed them in 1981 and 1983. It was
agreed then that the Government would undertake appropriate measures for the
sector to achieve a 10% rate of remuneration by 1989. This was to be
achieved by increases in the rate of remuneration by one point each year,
through real increases in tariffs and measures aimed at reducing costs.
Despite these agreements, the financial situation of the sector continued to
deteriorate because of (i) distortions in the tariff structure caused by
promotional tariffs; (ii) a higher than expected rate of inflation which
eroded the average level of tariffs in real terms; and (iii) some delays in
the implementation of tariff increases. These factors forced the sector to
cut back or delay parts of its investment program and to continue to rely
heavily on borrowings as a source of financing. Consequently, the
deterioration in sector finances was accompanied by impairment of the
sector's ability to provide electricity to users at acceptable levels of
reliability.
2.23      In 1985, in line with the priority attached in its economic
adjustment program to the rehabilitation and development of essential
infrastructure, the new Government undertook to prepare a program for the
financial rehabilitation of the sector. For this purpose the Power Sector
Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP), consisting of a four-year investment program and
financial plan for the 1986 tc 1989 period, was prepared by the Government
and ELETROBRAS with technical assistance from Bank staff.
2.24      The PSRP establishes acceptable targets for the rehabilitation of
the sector during the 1986 to 1989 period (para. 3.02). Only high-priority
investments that are required to provide electricity to final users at
minimum acceptable reliability levels were included in the investment
program. Also, high priority is given to transmission and distribution
investments in order to enable the sector to utilize more efficiently the
existing generation capacity developed in the past ten years (paras. 3.04 and
3.05). The associated financial plan provides for the reversal in the
deteriorating trend of the sectors' finances through a combination of equity
contributions, tariff actions, and other measures. Its objective is to
reduce the sector's heavy reliance on borrowings by increasing the sector's
internal fund generation capacity and capitalization.
2.25      The PSRP was evaluated by the Bank in April 1986 and found to be
satisfactory. It was signed by the President of the Republic in May 1986,
with the support of Ministers of Finance, Energy and Planning. The
Government has agreed that the Bank would monitor closely the rehabilitation



- 11 -
process of the sector. For this purpose during loan negotiations it was
agreed that the Government, each year until 1990, will prepare a four-year
rehabilitation plan for the sector and present it to the Bank for its review
and approval. The monitoring will be done, inter alia, through periodic
reports to be submitted to the Bank (see Annex 2.5), and by frequent Bank
supervision missions.
- Bank Participation
2.26      Since 1949, Bank loans to the Brazilian power sector have amounted
to about US$3.1 billion. Most of the loans have been for hydroelectric
plants and associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and
Southern regions, but the most recent loans have been mainly for transmission
and distribution projects, including beneficiaries outside these two
regions. Besides financing high priority projects, Bank lending in the
sector has sought to promote rational tariff policies, to monitor sector
finances, and to help strengthen sector coordination and planning. Over the
past several years there has been a continuous dialogue on measures required
for the sector's progressive improvement. The Bank has also acted as
catalyst for the mobilization of funding from external sources.
2.27      The Bank began to assist the Government's efforts to improve the
financial situation of the sector with the tariff agreement of September
1981, and later with the rate-of-remuneration agreement of November 1983
(para. 2.22). During the last two years, the Bank and power sector
authorities have collaborated in preparing a power sector rehabilitation plan
covering the period 1985-1989, which is the basis for the proposed operation
(see para. 3.02). Brazil has entered a period of economic growth which
present sector conditions, technical and financial, cannot support
effectively over the medium-term. Therefore, the Bank's role in the sector
would be to assist Government and sector authorities in their efforts to
improve the financial condition of the sector so as to ensure its effective
contribution to the economic growth envisaged in the Government's national
development plan.
2.28      Twelve performance audit reports on power sector projects 1/ have
been distributed to the Executive Directors. These reports conclude that,
despite construction delays, cost overruns in some cases, and the beginning
of a deteriorating financial trend in the late 1970s, Bank-financed projects
have been substantially successful. In general, these reports emphasize the
important role played by the Bank in the Brazilian power sector.

3. THE PROJECT
Origin and Preparation
3.01      In January 1984, in view of the financial difficulties faced then
by virtually all power companies, and of the strategic importance of the
power sector for the long-term development of the country's economy, the
Brazilian Government requested the assistance of the Bank for the
preparation, implementation and financing of a sector rehabilitation
program. The Government elected in March 1985 confirmed that request, in the
framework of the intensive policy dialogue started then about the
requirements for the long-term development of the country's economy and,
also, about the Bank's role in assisting such development. In response to
these requests, Bank staff have cooperated closely over the last two and a
half years with ELETROBRAS, and with staff of SEPLAN and the Ministries of
Finance and of Mines and Energy in: (a) the diagnosis of the sectoral
problems to be overcome; (b) the definition of an appropriate policy
framework for the medium- and long-term development of the sector; (c) the
identification of investment priorities, and of requirements and possible
sources of financing; and (d) the final preparation of the 1986-89 PSRP.
While the 1985 change of Government, and the 1986 economic policy reforms,
affected, in some aspects negatively, the timing and policy contents of the
PSRP, the end result of this process -- the final draft of the PSRP, which
was evaluated by Bank staff in April 1986 -- constitutes a substantial
improvement in the planning of sectoral investment and policies.
Objectives and Long-Term Strategy
3.02      The proposed project would support the Government efforts referred
to above to rehabilitate the Brazilian power sector through the
implementation of the 1986-89 PSRP. This plan, which the Bank has reviewed
and found to be satisfactory, is based on: (a) the minimum investments to be
made on priority projects which are necessary to meet electricity demand with
acceptable levels of reliability (paras. 3.06 and 3.07); (b) increasing
substantially the sector's internal cash generation through tariff actions
and other acceptable measures (para. 3.17); (c) comaitment of the Government
to provide equity contributions to the utilities with financial
rehabilitation needs (paras. 3.15 and 3.16); (d) securing adequate financing
sources for the sector to execute its investment program (para. 3.19); and
(e) promoting adequate energy conservation measures (para 3.07). The above
plan is satisfactory. It sets acceptable targets for the financial
rehabilitation of the sector during the period 1986-1989, and lays out an
integrated action program to achieve them. The 1986-89 PSRP, moreover,
should be considered as the first step in the process of ensuring the
technical adequacy and financial soundness of the power sector over the long
term. For this purpose, the Government expects to have, also over the long
term, the technical support of the Bank. Until 1990, or such other date on
which the objectives of the 1986-89 PSRP shall have been attained in terms
satisfactory to the Bank, the Government will furnish to the Bank, not later
than November 30 of each year, a satisfactory updated plan for the



- 13 -
rehabilitation of the sector, covering at least the following four years.
Such updated plans would include a sectoral investment program and a detailed
financial plan, comprising, inter alia: (a) increases in the rates of
remuneration up to, at least, the levels envisaged in the 1986-89 PSRP;
(b) declining shares of borrowings in the financing of the sector's
investment; and (c) specific equity amounts, and time-phased tariff
increases, that will allow the sector to achieve the agreed rates of
remuneration and borrowing targets for the immediately following year. After
the PSRP objectives shall have been attained the Government will furnish to
the Bank, not later than November 30 of each year, an updated five-year
sectoral investment program and financial plan, both to be satisfactory to
the Bank, and cause such investment program to be duly executed and to
provide the resources required for the execution of such investment program
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
The Investment Program
3.03      The sector's investment program for the period 1986-1989 was
prepared on the basis of the latest version of the long-term expansion plan,
Plano 2000, a comprehensive planning study completed in 1982, which the Bank
haL reviewed and found to be a sound development program for the sector. The
investment program maintains the least-cost expansion sequence of generation
and major transmission projects recommended in the Plano 2000. ELETROBRAS is
now making arrangements to prepare a new long-term expansion plan (Plano
2010). As this plan is essential to update the least-cost expansion program,
agreement was reached during negotiations that ELETROBRAS will submit to the
Bank for its approval, by November 30, 1986, terms of reference for the
preparation of the plan. The plan will be carried out by May 31, 1987, and
promptly thereafter submitted to the Bank for its comments. It was also
agreed that the Government and ELETROBRAS will not enter into contractual
arrangements regarding the implementation of generation and major
transmission projects until their technical, economic and financial
justification has been confirmed in a manner satisfactory to the Borrower and
the Bank.
3.04      The 1986-1989 investment program was defined on the basis of
criteria agreed between the Bank and the sector authorities. The criteria
include: (a) maintaining the same least-cost expansion sequence for
generation projects recommended in the "Plano 2000"; (b) giving priority to
the completion of transmission and distribution projects required to transfer
and distribute the energy generated by projects now being commissioned and to
construct new networks required to improve system reliability; (c) postponing
and scaling-down the nuclear and coal programs, considered to be a deviation
from the least-cost expansion program; and (d) restraining implementation of
transmission and distribution projects related to industrial loads served
under subsidized tariffs.
3.05      As a result of the above considerations, the imbalances in the
composition of the power sector's past investments, which resulted from the
large proportion of the investment (about 65%) allocated to generation
projects (mainly hydro, nuclear and coal plants) during the late 1970's and



- 14 -
early 1980's are now substantially corrected. The investments included in
the proposed 1986-1989 program for generation (45X of the total investment),
transmission (31%), distribution (18%) and general investments (6%) reflect
realistically the sector's minimum investment requirements.
3.06      The sector investment program in the period 1986-1989 would be
about US$5.0 billion per year. This level of investment is relatively low
considering that it is about the same in nominal dollar terms as the average
sector investment level realized in the period 1978-1983. The proposed
program includes only essential investments required to provide service at
minimuuw acceptable levels of reliability. Further substantial reductions in
the investment program would result in severe power supply shortages during
this period.
3.07      As a result of the delays in the completion of projects under
construction and in the starting of new ones, as well as of the imbalance in
the composition of the sector's past investment programs, when not enough
funding was provided for construction of new transmission and distribution
works, the risk of energy shortages during the 1986-1989 period exceeds
levels traditionally used for sector planning. By 1992, the probabilities of
energy shortages, about 17%, and not meeting demand, 9%, are above the normal
level of 5% as detailed in Annexes 2.4 and 3.1 respectively. To minimize
such risks, agreement was reached during negotiations with ELETROBRAS to
prepare and submit to the Bank, by November 30, 1986, a satisfactory program
of preventive and corrective measures to reduce the risk of power shortages
to acceptable levels. The preventive measures will include, among other
actions: (a) restraining demand growth by (i) implementing the
recommendations of the marginal cost tariff study (para. 2.17) in a timely
manner, (ii) postponing expansion plans for large electricity-inteksive
industrial consumers, and (iii) discontinuing subsidized tariffs for
promotion of oil substitution ("Eletrotermia" loads); and (b) increasing
electricity supply by utilizing existing oil-fired thermal generation, by
increasing investment in hydro-generation, and by supporting cogeneration.
Some of the corrective actions may also include selective electricity supply
curtailments.
3.08      The 1986-1989 investment program includes the commissioning of
about 16,000 MW of generating capacity, of which about 93% is hydroelectric
(Annex 3.2). The program also includes starting construction of about 19,000
4W, of which 94% are hydroelectric plants to be commissioned by 1996, as well
as expansion of the interconnected transmission systems and distribution
networks.
3.09      Engineering designs as well as bidding documents for the
construction of generating plants, transmission lines and substations
included in the program are now being prepared. They are expected to be
completed on time and in a satisfactory manner, because the power sector
staff are competent and have had considerable experience in preparing such
documents.



- 15 -
3.10      Procurement procedures utilized by the sector give due
consideration to economy and efficiency.  During implementation of the
1986-1989 investment program (for which contracting of goods and services
will not be financed by the proposed loan), the sector utilities are expected
to use the following procedures: (a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
for those contracts to be financed by multilateral agencies (IBRD and IDB);
(b) Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) for those contracts to be financed with
internal funding (only among suppliers/contractors operating in Brazil); and
(c) Limited International Bidding (LIB) for those contracts to be financed
with bilateral funding (usually restricted to suppliers/contractors both from
Brazil and from the country providing the financing).
3.11      For construction works, the utilities will retain contractors,
which have vast experience in this type of works. Installation of equipment
will be carried out, depending on the complexity of the equipment, by
suppliers or force account. Both construction works and installation of
equipment will be under the supervision of the corresponding technical
departments of the utilities. With the above arrangements, it is expected
that the works included in the program will be commissioned in a timely and
efficient manner. Implementation of the investment program will be monitored
through periodic reports to be submitted to the Bank (Annex 2.5), and through
the work of frequent Bank supervision missions.
Cost Estimates
3.12      The estimated cost of the 1986-1989 power sector investment program
amounts to about US$19,844 million, of which about US$4,647 million, or 23X,
is the estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange component. These
estimates exclude investments required during the period for: (a) Itaipu
hydroelectric scheme (US$1,773 million), which is a binational entity, owned
both by Brazil and Paraguay. The power sector purchases the energy from
Itaipu Binational and its corresponding costs are included in the sector
operating costs; and (b) nuclear plants (US$1,240 million), which are being
constructed by NUCLEBRAS (agency of the Government for nuclear development).
The nuclear program is financed by the Government and the corresponding
assets will be transfered to the power sector when the plants become
operational during the mid 1990's, at the cost of the equivalent
hydroelectric plant which would be then next in the sequence of the Plano
2000. Details on these estimates are included in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5. A
summary is given below:

~-_
3.13      The cot-t estimates were prepared by the sector utilities' planning
and construction staff. They are based both on preliminary and detailed
design and comprehensive bill of materials and equipment as well as detailed
evaluation of the corresponding civil works and erection costs. These
estimates were calculated utilizing constant price levels prevailing in March
1986. They include taxes and import duties as applicable (about 10% of the
base costs). Physical contingencies were calculated at about 13% of the base
costs, which is considered appropriate given the nature of the works and the
degree of accuracy of the above estimates, Because of the uncertainty of the
effects on costs and prices resulting from the macroeconomic measures taken
recently by the Government, the above estimates have been prepared without
price contingencies. However, these contingencies have been evaluated
separately utilizing Bank expected price increases of 7.2% for 1986, 6.8% for
1987 and 1988, and 7.0% for 1989. On this basis, price contingencies for the
period 1986-1989 amount to about US$3.2 billion, or 16% of the base cost.
The proposed operation provides measures to cover a possible gap arising from
price increases (see para. 3.38).
Financing Plan
3.14      During the first half of 1985, sector finances continued on a
deteriorating trend (paras. 2.18 through 2.21) mainly because of lack of
adequate tariff actions during the transition period between Governments.
Recognizing the unsatisfactory financial position of the sector, the new
Government, with the technical support of Bank staff, completed in September
1985, the preparation of the first version of the PSRP, which included
significant Government equity contributions ($1.2 billion each in 1986 and
1987) and substantial tariff increases during the 1985-1989 period. The 1986
equity contributions were to be financed by external sources, mainly the Bank
and commercial banks. As envisaged in the original PSRP, during the second
semester of 1985 tariff increases of about 20%, in real terms, were
implemented. However, during January and February 1986, nominal tariff
increases were not sufficient to cover the high and increasing rates of
inflation during those months.



- 17 -
3.15      Mainly because of such rates of inflation, on February 28, 1986,
the Government enacted its program for stabilization and monetary reform
which introduced, among other measures, a freeze on prices, including
electricity tariffs for the present, and potentially for a full year. This
reform affects substantially the finances of the sector. An increase of
about 28%, in real terms, had been envisaged in the original PSRP for the
average tariff in 1986, over the average tariff of 1985. Under the new
macroeconomic conditions, this increase is expected to be only 1.2% in real
terms. As a result of the freeze in tariffs and other actions considered by
the Government, in order to have a reasonable funding mix, Government has
agreed to make payments of US$1.8 billion in 1986, of which US$1.63 billion
would be in the form of equity contributions and US$170 million in
reimbursement for expenditures incurred by the sector on behalf of the
Government for the nuclear program. During loan negotiations, it was agreed
that the US$1.8 billion of payments to be made by the Government to the
sector in 19b6 will be funded as follows: US$600 million from its own
resources, US$500 million from the Bank loan, and US$700 million from
cofinancing arrangements to be made with Bank assistance. Should the
cofinancing not materialize or should it generate less resources than
envisaged, it was agreed that the Government contributions from its own
resources would increase from US$600 million to at least US$800 millior.. The
remainder (US$500 million) would be covered by increases in the sector's
operational receipts and/or postponement to 1987 of investments included in
the PSRP for 1986. In the event that such postponement occurs, the
Government agreed to increase the investment envisaged in the PSRP for 1987
by an equivalent amount and to provide the required financing for such
increase in investments as additional equity contributions over and above
those envisaged in the PSRP for 1987. Therefore, if the cofinancing
arrangement does not materialize, the Government contributions to the sector
in 1986 would be, at least, US$1.3 billion, including US$1.13 billion in
equity and US$170 million in payments of Government obligations to the
sector.
3.16      The Government equity contributions aim at reducing the sector's
dependence on borrowings, and thus attain an adequate funding mix, for
financing its investment program. Under the revised PSRP, the Federal
Government would also make equity contributions of US$1.2 billion in 1987.
Both the 1986 and 1987 equity contributions will be transferred to individual
power utilities most in need of financial resources, under criteria and
rehabilitation plans satisfactory to the Bank. The allocation of equity
zontributions, and the corresponding rehabilitation plans of the individual
utilities, aim at improving their financial condition and to diminish the
differences among them. The financial condition of the utilities will be
measured by the trend of their debt service coverage ratios. The
Beneficiaries of the equity contributions will commit themselves to carry out
action plans, acceptable to the Government and the Bank, which aim at
improving their operational efficiency as a complement to the financial
rehabilitation objectives, Bank staff have discussed, with ELETROBRAS and
the four utilities selected to receive equity contributions, the work being
done by them in the preparation of the rehabilitation plans of the individual
companies. Such work -- which is expected to be completed within the next
two or three weeks -- was found to be consistent with the criteria described
above. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government and



- 18 -
ELETROBRAS on those criteria (see Annex 3.10). As a condition of loan
effectiveness, satisfactory rehabilitation plans for each of these utilities
must have been prepared and adopted, and ELETROBRAS and the beneficiaries
must have taken all corporate actions necessary to make the proposed equity
contributions legally possible (see Annex 3.11).
3.17      The revised PSRP aims at achieving the following rates of
remuneration: 5.0% in 1986, 6.4% in 1987, 7.7% in 1988 and 9.1% in 1989, in
accordance with the method of calculation established by Brazilian law (see
Annexes 3.6.1 and 2.1). It is also expected that the rate would reach at
least 10% by 1990. It should be noted, however, that if the rates of
remuneration were to be calculated including the reversion tax which is
charged to consumers and remains in the sector, they would be 6.0% in- 1986,
8.4% in 1987, 10.0% in 1988 and 11.8% in 1989. These rates of remuneration
would be achieved through measures that would increase average sector
revenues by about 20% in 1987, 18% in 1988 and 17% in 1989. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government for it to take all
the necessary measures for the sector to achieve the target rates of
remuneration. Among such measures, the Government has agreed that starting
January 1, 1987 it would discontinue the promotional tariffs for oil
substitution. This single measure is expected to increase the average sector
revenue by about 6% in 1987.
3.18      The financial plan reflects the constraints created on sector
finances by the macroeconomic framework within which it operates. Thus: (a)
the sector's dependence on non-consumer-based fund generation (equity
contributions and borrowings) has been prolonged because of the freeze on
prices enacted under the stabilitation program; (b) the repayment of the
existing debt of the sector is heavily concentrated in the next few years,
with more than $11 billion (or about 55% of the total outstanding long-term
debt) becoming due in the 1986-89 period; this situation contributes
substantially to the low level of net consumer-based funding shown in the
table below; and (c) under the above circumstances, the substantial equity
contributions included in the first two years of the projection period are
justified to reduce the sector's dependence on borrowings as a source of
financing its investment, so as to improve its funding mix. Within such
macroeconomic framework, the financial plan is satisfactory as the key
indicators show the positive trend expected for sector finances. The
financial plan for the sector is detailed in Annexes 3.6.1 through 3.6.4, and
is summarized in the following tables:

Cofinancing
3.19      In order to close the financial gap of the sector in 1986, the
Government has requested Bank assistance for obtaining tesourcec FiAuugh



- 20 -
cofinancing arrangements. This operation would aim to raise about US$700
million of "new money" for Brazil on a voluntary basis. For this purpose the
Government intends to make, at the appropriate time, informal contacts in the
market in order to determine the extent to which such operation is possible.
During negotiations, it was agreed that should such cofinancing operation
turn out not to be possible, the Government would provide these resources to
the sector in a manner acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.15).
Executing Agencies
3.20      The borrower of the Bank loan will be the Government, which will
transfer an amount equivalent to the loan proceeds, in cruzados (Cz$), as
equity contributions to ELETROBRAS, which in turn will transfer these funds
as equity contributions to four of its operating subsidiaries (ELETRONORTE,
ELETROSUL, FURNAS and CHESF). This will improve the financial situation of
these companies and enable them to complete ongoing works, and start new ones
which are included in the 1986-1989 investment program. The organization
charts of ELETROBRAS and its subsidiaries are presented in Annexes 3.3.1 and
3.3.2.
3.21      ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation (sociedade de economia
mista) operating under MME. The Government owns 99.8% of company shares. In
its financing role, as development bank and holding company for the power
sector, ELETROBRAS finances projects of its subsidiaries and associated
companies with statutory resources, Government allocations, internal fund
generation, and local and foreign borrowings. Statutory resources include
the Compulsory Loan and the Global Reversion Fund (Annex 2.1).
3.22      An administrative Board of Directors governs ELETROBRAS.  The Board
consists of the Presalant (appointed by the President of the Republic); five
directors (elected at the General Shareholders meeting for a term of three
years); and six counselors (also elected for a term of three years by the
General Shareholders). Four of the counselors are associated with the public
companies and have experience in technology, finance, or business
management. Of the remaining two counselors , one represents public bodies
other than the Government; the other represents private shareholders (see
Annex 3.3.1).
3.23      The beneficiaries of the proposed loan would be the four major
regional generation-transmission companies of ELETROBRAS: FURNAS, CHESF,
ELETROSUsL, and ELETRONORTE. In 1985, these four companies had installed
generating capacity of 19,832 MW, provided 55% of all the electrical energy
consumed in Brazil, generated revenues amounting to about US$1.7 billion (in
mid-1985 prices), and employed 30,000 people. The need for financial
restructuring is greater for these companies than for other power utilities
owing to the concentration in them of most of the sector's debt. Typical of
the organizational structure of these companies is that of FURPAS.  The
Government appoints a Board composed of a President and five Executive
Directors, who are heads of the Departmente of Engineering, Planning and
Construction; Operations; Administration and Contracts; Finance; and Nuclear



- 21 -
Generation. Additionally, the shareholders general assembly annually elects
a three-member Fiscal Council to review financial operations. The
organizational structure of FURNAS is sound (see Annex 3.3.2), as are the
organizational structures of the other beneficiaries.
3.24      The management systems of the beneficiaries are adequate -
financial planning, budgeting, reporting, accounting, and billing. These
companies prepare annual budgets and five-year financial forecasts which are
revised in the light of new information on a periodic basis. They maintain
satisfactory internal audit groups and good training facilities. Their
independent external auditors have been satisfatory. The quality of their
managerial, administrative, and technical staff is also good.
3.25      The Bank has made six prior loans to FURNAS amounting to US$396
million, three loans to ELETROSUL amounting to US$317 million, and two loans
to CHESF amounting to US$96 million. The Bank has also made additional loans
amounting to US$422 million through ELETROBRAS to benefit FURNAS and CHESF.
ELETRONORTE will benefit (US$28 million) from loan 2364-BR (US$250 million)
to ELETROBRAS. In general, the experience of the Bank with these companies
has been satisfactory.
Conditions of Disbursement
3.26      The proposed loan will be disbursed in two tranches of US$250
million each. Most of the key conditions for the release of both tranches
are related, in general, to the financial plans of the sector and of the
individual utilities and, in particular, to the rebuilding of their equity
capital and - for the second tranche - to the increase in the average
sector revenues planned for 1987. As indicated in para. 3.15, if the
commercial banks provide, before the end of 1986, $700 million within the
cofinancing arrangement envisaged in the PSRP, the Government would provide
US$1.8 billion to the power sector during the year. If the planned
cofinancing arrangement does not materialize, the Government contributions to
the sector in 1986 would be at least US$1.3 billion. The remaining US$500
million gap would then be covered by additional sectoral operating revenues,
additional equity contributions financed by the Government's own resources,
and/or postponement until 1987 of investmert expenditures. Out of the US$1.3
billion in Government contributions, US$670 million require an additional
budget allocation. The reminder will be tiade effective by turning into
equity US$630 million of debt repayments which are due to be made by the
sector to the Government during 1986; these US$630 million do not require a
budget allocation. In this frameworkk, the specific conditions for releasing
the two tranches would be as follows:
(a) the first tranche will be disbursed upon loan effectiveness which
will be subject to receipt of evidence satisfactory to the
Bank on compliance with the following conditions: (i) that the
Government has effectively allocated in its 1986 budget an additional
US$670 million; (ii) that the amount of about US$3.0 billion of new
borrowings envisaged in the PSRP is available to the sector in 1986;
(iii) that satisfactory rehabilitation plans for the utilities



- 22 -
selected to receive equity contributions have been prepared and
adopted; (iv) that the stockholders of ELETROBRAS have approved and
subscribed a capital increase equivalent to not less than US$1.13
billion (see para. 3.15) in terms satisfactory to the Bank; (v) that
the Government has paid-in equity contributions of US$300 million
equivalent; and (vi) that the stockholders of the beneficiaries have
approved capital increases of US$1.13 billion, consistent with their
rehabilitation plans and in terms satisfactory to the Bank, and
ELETROBRAS has subscribed the shares corresponding to such capital
increases; and
(b)  the second tranche will be disbursed after the Bank: (i) has reviewed
and is satisfied with the sectoral performance up to
then; (ii) has received an acceptable 1986 to 1990 Sectoral Plan;
(iii) is satisfied with progress in the rehabilitation process of the
selected utilities in accordance with the rehabilitation programs
agreed upon with the Bank; (iv) has received an action plan
acceptable to the Bank for achieving the target rate of remuneration
envisaged in the PSRP for 1987; (v) has confirmed that the Government
has paid-in, as equity contributions, the total amount of ELETROBRAS'
capital increase except the amount equivalent to the second tranche
of the proposed loan; the resources of the second tranche will be
paid-in as capital for the sector immediately after disbursement by
the Bank; (vi) has confirmed that the Government has reimbursed the
sector US$170 million equivalent for expenditures incurred by the
sector on behalf of the Government for the nuclear program; and (vii)
has received, and found satisfactory, a Master Plan for strengthening
the sector's environmental units. The release of the second tranche
will also depend upon the progress made by the Government and the
sector in the areas covered by dated covenants of the proposed loan,
which are scheduled to be complied with before then.
Disbursements
3.27      Disbursements would be made against acceptable general imports from
eligible countries and territories, imported to Brazil and paid after January
1, 1986. Proceeds of the loan will be disbursed based on satisfactory
evidence of: (i) physical entry of the imports into the country; (ii) actual
payment in foreign exchange for such imports; and (iii) evidence that the
prices of the imported goods are reasonable and in line with international
price quotations and past experience. The Central Bank will ensure that
these requirements are met for all imports to be financed with loan
resources.
3.28      The proceeds of the loan wourd be disbursed in two tranches of
US$250 million each (para. 3.26). Bank disbursements would be made on the
basis of statements of expenditures, each of not less than US$1.0 million, to
be submitted to the Bank by the Central Bank. The detailed documentation
evidenciug expenditures, which is to be retained by the Central Bank and



- 23 -
available for inspection by the Bank, will be duly audited in accordance to
standard Bank requirements. Based on estimated import requirements by the
cou..cry, disbursements are expected to be completed before December 31, 1986
or about five months after loan effectiveness. It is expected that US$250
million (first tranche) will be disbursed no later than July 31, 1986, and
the remaining US$250 million no later than December 31, 1986. The loan
closing date is June 30, 1987. Given the nature of the proposed loan, IBRD
standard project disbursement profiles are not applicable.
Procurement
3.29      The general imports would be made by public entities and private
sector importers, under procuremeat procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Contracts for the procurement of imports exceeding US$5.0 million would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
procedures consistent with Bank procurement guidelines. Contracts under
US$5.0 million would be procured through normal procedures used by the
importing entities. The Bank has reviewed the procurement procedures used by
Brazilian companies for a substantial number of commodities - including
commodities imported, directly or indirectly, for the power sector such as
copper, steel, metallurgical coal, insulating oil, and other insulating
materials -- and found them to be satisfactory.
Economic Justification
3.30      The economic analysis was based on the 1986-1989 investment program
for the sector which includes all the investments in generation (including
nuclear plants and 50% of the investments in Itaipu, which represents the
Brazil's share in the project), transmission, and distribution facilities
necessary to meet electricity demand.
3.31      The proposed investment program is based on the "Plano 2000", a
comprehensive long-term planning study completed in 1982, which is considered
to be a sound development program for the sector. The investment program
maintains the least cost expansion sequence of hydroelectric projects
recommended in the Plano 2000 (see para. 3.03 and Annex 3.7).
3.32      The rate of return on the investment program was estimated as being
the discount rate which equalizes the present value of the economic net cost
and benefit streams associated with the investment '-ogram (Annex 3.8).  The
economic net cost streams include: (i) capital investments on generation (see
para. 3.30), transmission, sub-transmission, distribution and general
investments (building, furniture, etc.) to be made by the sector; (ii) costs
of operation and maintenance related to the capital investments and (iii) 50%
of the energy purchased from Itaipu, which represents Paraguay's share in the
project, at the unit cost estimated in the PSRP. Since benefits in the power
sector arising from the investment program cannot be quantified with
precision, the use of a proxy is required. Therefore, the economic net
benefit streams were measured by the forecast revenues from the incremental
sales of electricity, attributed to the facilities included in the investment
program, on the basis of retail tariffs (inclusive of the s 'e tax) required
to attain the legal 10% rate of remuneration by 1990.



- 24 -
3.33      The rate of return of the sector 1986-1989 investment program
utilizing the above tariffs is estimated at about 10.6%. Sensitivity
analyses were carried out to evaluate the impact on this return as a result
of possible changes in the sector capital investment cost and in revenues.
If investments are increased by 10% or revenues are decreased by the same
percentage, the rate of return will drop to 9.6% and 9.0%, respectively. If
investments are increased by 10% and revenues are decreased by 10%
simultaneously, the rate of return will drop to 8.1%. If the sector revenues
are valued at tariff levels prevailing in March 1986, the rate of return
is 1.6%.
3.34      The above results confirm that, if the planned tariff increases are
adopted on schedule, the rate of return of the 1986-1989 investment program
(10.6%) would be very close to the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil
(about 11%). The above rate of return does not fully measure some of the
benefits to society such as the social benefits of residential and public
uses, or the indirect benefit to industry and commerce, whose production and
employment depend on reliable electricity supply. In this case, the rate of
return of the base case (10.6%) is deemed to be a minimum measure of the
benefits conferred by the project.
Environmental Aspects
3.35      The increasing demand for electricity in Brazil requires the
construction of large hydroelectric generating schemes, which in general have
an important impact in the social aspects of surrounding human communities,
including the Amerindian population, and in the balance of ecological
systems. For this purpose ELETROBRAS and its regional affiliates have
created environmental units, carried out studies on this subject and issued
guidelines which addressed the problems derived by the construction of the
above power schemes. However, neither the environmental units have had a
fully active role nor the guidelines were adequately enforced because of the
lack of: (i) legal enforcement mechanisms; (ii) institutional coordination;
(iii) specialized staff in social and environmental sciences; and (iv)
adequate relevance given to environmental aspects.
3.36      The sector authorities are aware of the above issues and they
should implement corrective measures to adequately preserve the environment
in the areas affected by the construction of such projects. To achieve this,
agreement was reached at negotiations with ELETROBRAS that it will submit to
the Bank an acceptable Master Plan which will include the implementation of
specific measures to protect and enhance the adaptive capacity of the
riverine ecosystem and human communities. This plan will address aspects
related to: (i) resettlement of the population to be affected by the
Itaparica hydro-plant presently under construction; and (ii) strengthen the
sector environmental units through training, research, legal assistance,
staffing and funding. Annex 3.9 includes specific criteria for the
preparation of the Master Plan. At negotiations it was agreed that: (i) not
later than July 15, 1986, ELETROBRAS will submit to the Bank a satisfactory
plan to resettle the population to be affected by the Itaparica hydro plant;



- 25 -
(ii) as a condition for releasing the second tranche of the Bank loan the
Government will submit to the Bank a satisfactory Master Plan for
strengthening the sector environmental units, and (iii) not later than
October 15, 1986, the Bank wll review whether the progress achieved in the
initial implementation of the Itaparica resettlement program is satisfactory.
Risks
3.37      No particular physical risks are expected to affect the
implementation of the sector's 1986-1989 investment program as similar works
(generation, transmission and distribution) have been successfully
constructed in the past. The power sector has been adversely affected by
financial problems which are now being addressed under this operation
(chapter 4). Insufficient action or failure to implement the agreed
financial measures may adversely affect the sector finances and result in
delays in the execution of the program.
3.38      It is still too early to predict all the effects on the sector of
the macroeconomic measures taken by the Government, and there are great
uncertainties regarding their possible influence on costs and prices. For
this reason, the investment plan has been prepared without price
contingencies and the financial projections are in constant monetary units.
As such, the projections are an expression of the expected trends in sector
finances, as represented by improvements in the forecast funding mix and
financial indicators. The risk of deviations to occur from 1987 onwards will
be addressed through specific yearly measures to be defined during the annual
reviews of the updated investment and financial plans for the sector (see
para. 3.02). The 1986 figures represent the best estimate at this time, and
the net deviations are expected not to be significant. For instance, the
price contingency for the 1986 investment program would be 3.6% or about
US$138 million, which is within the margin of error for this type of
estimates. However, to address the risk of possible deviations in 1986,
during negotiations agreement was reached with the Government to provide the
sector with adequate funding for the timely implementation of the investment
plan. In addition, a particular condition was included in the legal
documents for the provision of financing of additional fuel costs that could
be derived from the operation of thermal plants, over and above the estimates
of the PSRP (see Annex 3.6.1).

4. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
4.01      During loan negotiations, the following agreements were reached
with the Government of Brazil and ELETROBRAS:
(a)  to carry out, by June 30, 1987, a study to review the institutional
structure of the sector and to implement the recommendations of
such study. Terms of reference will be furnished to the Bank by
August 31, 1986 (para. 2.10);
(b)  that until 1990, or such other date on which the objectives of the
1986-1989 PSRP shall have been attained in terms satisfactory to
the Bank, the Government will furnish to the Bank, not later than
November 30 of each year, a satisfactory updated plan for the
rehabilitation of the sector, covering at least the following four
years (paras. 2.25 and 3.02);
(c)  to furnish the Bank by November 30, 1986 satisfactory terms of
reference for the Plano 2010 study, which should be carried out not
later than May 31, 1987 and promptly thereafter submitted to the
Bank. ELETROBRAS and the Government agreed not to enter any
contractual arrangements related to the implementation of electric
power projects until the economic, technical and financial
feasibility of each such projects has been demonstrated in terms
satisfactory to the Bank, as a least cost solution, consistent with
the PSRP and the Plano 2010 (para. 3.03).
(d)  to prepare and submit to the Bank, by November 30, 1986, a
satisfactory program of preventive and corrective measures to
reduce the risk of power shortages to acceptable levels
(para. 3.07);
(e)  on a satisfactory contingency plan for the provision of the
required resources to the sector in 1986 if the planned cofinancing
operation with commercial banks does not materialize, or if it
generates less resources than what is envisaged in the PSRP
(paras. 3.15 and 3.19);
(f)  on the criteria for the preparation of the rehabilitation plans of
the beneficiaries (para. 3.16);
(g)  to take all the necessary measures for the sector to achieve the
target rates of remuneration envisaged in the 1986-1989 PSRP
(para. 3.17);
(h)  that the loan be disbursed in two tranches of US$250 million each,
under conditions acceptable to the Bank in line with the provisions
set forth in the PSRP (para. 3.26);



- 27 -
(i) to furnish the Bank with an acceptable list of eligible general
country imports that have been procured on satisfactory
international commercial practices and from countries and
territories referred to in the Bank's procurement guidelines
(para. 3.29);
(j) to furnish the Bank by July 15, 1986 a satisfactory plan to
resettle the population to be affected by the construction of the
Itaparica hydroplant (para. 3.36);
(k) on submitting an acceptable Master Plan of specific measures to:
(i) resettle the population to be affected by Itaparica
hydro-scheme; and (ii) strengthen the sector environmental units.
Not later than July 15, 1986, ELETROBRAS will submit to the Bank a
satisfactory Plan to resettle the population to be affected by
Itaparica hydroplant. The second tranche of the Bank loan will be
released upon submission to the Bank of a satisfactory Master Plan
for strengthening the sector environmental untis. Not later than
October 15, 1986, the Bank will review whether the progress
achieved in the initial implementation of the Itaparica
resettlement program is satisfactory (para. 3.36); and
(1) if significant deviations with respect to the financial plan of
1986 result in a shortfall of funding, on providing the sector with
the necessary resources in a fashion acceptable to the Bank, for
the timely implementation of the investment program (para. 3.38).
4.02      With the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan to the Government of Brazil of US$500 million equivalent,
under applicable terms and conditions for Brazil.

BRAZIL
POWER SECTOR LOAN
SECTOR ELECTRICITY REVENUES
1.   Consumer bills contain the following charges:
(a) The basic tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about 84%
of revenues collected from consumers.
(b) The sole tax (IUEE) on residential, commercial and small
industrial 1/ consumer bills, which provides about 8% of sector
revenues. Yorty percent goes to the Federal Government, fifty
percent to state and federal utilities, and ten percent to
municipal utilities; and
(c) The Compulsory Loan (8% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers using more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 6%
annual interest and revalued through monetary adjustments).
2.   The basic tariffs are set at a level designed to cover:
(a) operating, maintenance and administrative costs;
(b) taxes other than income, principally property taxes;
(c) straight-line depreciation on gross fixed assets at rates of 5%
for thermal facilities, 4% for distribution and 3% for hydro
facilities;
(d) a charge of plant in service reduced by the sum of accumulated
consumer advances, contributions and grants (the "Reversion
Base"). This charge consists of:
(i) a tax of up to 4% of the Reversion Base levied by the
Government, the proceeds of which are credited to the Global
Reversion Fund. This fund is used to compensate utility
companies when their concessions revert to or are taken over
by government and to help finance electric utility expansion
programs throughout Brazil;
1/ Industries using less than 2,000 kWh per month.

(ii)  contributions to the Global Guarantee Fund, a mechanism
designed to assist in the equalization of electricity
charges throughout the country. Until 1980, the Global
Guarantee Fund (GGF), financed through a surcharge of up to
2% on assets in operation, was used in the tariff
equalization process to supplement the earnings of eligible
utilities. In January 1981 the Brazilian Government
expanded the role of GGF, from a tariff equalization
instrument for the sector.
(e) a fuel tax (ccc) earmarked to pay the fuel expense in each
interconnected system;
(f) a return of between 10% and 12% on remunerable investment.
3.   The remunerable investment consist of:
(a) plant in service including capitalized interest, plus monetary
correction;
(b) le.s accumulated depreciation, monetarily corrected;
(c) less the year-end sum of contributions from customers and
government grants;
(d) plus other remunerable assets, including an allowance for working
capital and inventories; and
(e) less the accumulated excess in previous years remuneration.

STUDY TO REVIEW THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE SECTOR
I. Obiective
The "Study to Review the Institutional Estructure of the Sector"
seeks (i) to identify the main inconsistencies between the present sector
institutional structure and the new regional and political realities of the
country, especially regarding decentralization and participation of the
private sector; and (ii) to make a series of recommendations for the
institutional restructuring of the sector trying to achieve its organic
development and improving its overall efficiency.
II. Scope
The study should include the following aspects of the sector's
institutional structure:
A. Pf icies
(a) The sector's role within the national developmental policy
and the national energy policy.
(b) Decision making process (centralization vs.
decentralization).
The concentration of decision making authority in the hands of the
Federal Government has led to contradictions with the general policy of
decentralization established by the new government, which took office in
May 1985. In order to introduce a more decentralized decision-making
process - financial and otherwise - it has become necessary that the
institutional structure of the sector as well as some of its policies be
reviewed. In this respect, several efforts have been made by Government
and sector entities but little has been achieved because of lack of
coordination and clearly defined goals. The review should include the
sector's policies, organization, legislation, roles of sector entities, and
degree of autonomy.
(c) Participation of Private Entities in Sector Activities
The policy of nationalization also merits a review as most of the
sector is now in the hands of federally and state-owned utilities. It may
be convenient, from the country's economic point of view and from the
sector's financial point of view, to analyze the participation of private

entities, especially in the areas of cogeneration and other schemes of
electricity supply to the national grid.
(d) Pricing:
The equalization scheme for tariffs at the retail level is
undergoing a crisis that seems to anticipate its waning. Companies which
have to make payments to the compensation fund (Global Guarantee
Reserve/RGG) have questioned the validity of the interpretation of the
legislation made by DNAEE which calculates the amounts of payments on the
basis of the sector's average rate of remuneration which at present is
lower than the 102 minimum allowed by law. The weaknesses of the system
have become more evident at a time of significant financial crisis in the
sector and of a decentralization trend which contradicts the centralized
decision making inherent to the equalization scheme. Another major problem
of the system is the lack of regionalized tariffs to reflect the economic
cost of electricity. In that sense, the study will include a review of at
least the following matters related to electricity pricing:
-    tariff equalization
-    at retail level
-    at bulk sale level
-   marginal cost
-    regionalization of tariffs
-    cross-subsidies
-    intra-sector transfers of funds
-    surcharges to the electricity bill (sale tax and loan
compulsory
-    the reversion fund
B.       Strategy
-   Define the sector strategy to perform its policies
C.       Activities
-   Define the activities that the sector should perform to carry
out its strategy.
D.       Orsanization
-    Define the organization of the sector necessary to carry out
its activities.
E.       Roles of Sector Entities and Coordination of Functions
There exists indefinition and overlapping of functions among sector
entities and among these and government agencies, both federal and state.

ANNEX 2.2
Page 3 of 4
The concentration of decision making in the hands of the Government has
deprived sector entities of fulfilling their main roles. Thus ELETROBRAS'
planning responsibility has been overshadowed by the absorption in the
hands of SEST (Special Secretariat for Government Enterprises) of decisions
on the public sector investment program. DNAEE's responsibility as sector
regulatory agency has also been overshadowed by SEAP (Secretariat of
Supplies and Prices) which has basically taken full control of the tariff
setting process. Of course If this is so for federal agencies like
ELETROBRAS and DNAEE, the situation of state utilities and state
regulatory agencies is worse as their participation in the decision making
process is almost lnull.
Great progress has been made in the planning and operational areas of
generation and transmission with the creation of coordinating groups, which
have been performing reasonably well. However, much remains to be done in
the areas of financial information and planning, in urban and rural
distribution, and in the institution building of utilities in the less
developed regions.
The study will review and propose a clear definition of the role of
sector entities, their degree of autonomy and their interrelationships of
dependence, supervision and coordination, at least in the following main
areas of responsibility:
-   ELITROBRAS in
-    planning
-    coordination
-    financing as
-    holding
-    development bank
-   DNAEE and state regulatory agencies in
-    tariff setting
-    intra-sector transfers of funds
-    granting concessions
-    approving investments
-   Utilities in
-    generation
-    transmission
-    distribution
-    rban
-    rural
F. Legislation
-    Define the necessary changes in legislation to implement the
recommendations of the study.

Methodologies
1.        ELETROBRAS coordinates the preparation of electrlcity demand
projections with the participation of the power sector utilities. For the
short term (three or --ur years), the Coordinating Group for the Operation
of the Interconnectt:  *y6Lem (GCOI) annually prepares demand projections
based on specific guidelines established by DNAEE. For the long term
(about 20 years), the Coordinating Group for System Planning (GCPS)
prepares demand projection taking into account, among other things,
macroeconomic and demographic variables.
2.        Total electricity demand is projected on the basis of the
aggregation of individual projections prepared by 61 utilities. The GCPS
ensures that the methodologies and basic assumptions used by the utilities
are consistent. For the short term, the projections are based on trend
analysis of past demand by sectors, information about new industrial loads,
and expectations about consumer connections. For the long term, the
projections are based on sectoral analysis (residential, commercial,
industrial, public lighting and government), taking into account
correlation with macroeconomic (gross regional product, industrial product,
household income, etc.) and demographic (population, number of dwellings,
etc.) variables, expansion plans for large electricity-intensive
industries, and analysis of particular loads. Although the methodology is
adequate, future studies would be carried out to take into explicit account
price-elasticity and the impact of other energy conservation programs.
Structure of Electricity Consumption
3.        The sectoral and regional structure of electricity demand has
changed steadily during the past fifteen years. On the one hand,
industrial demand as a percentage of total demand has increased from 45% in
1970 to 55% in 1985, this change reflecting the process of
industrialization in Brazil. On the other hand, the electricity demand of
less developed regions -- the North and the Northeast -- has increased from
12% of total demand en 1970 to 17% in 1985. This increase is mainly
because of the development of large electricity-intensive industries in
that region. In 1985 about 70% of electricity demand remained concentrated
in the Southeast, a geographic area representing just about 15% of Brazil.
Consequently, the participation in the Brazilian electricity market of the
less developed regions, the North and the Northeast, is expected to
increase from 17% in 1985 to 23% in 1995.



- 36 -
ANEX 2. 4
4.        The projected growth of demand by regions is expected to vary
widely. Electricity consumption in the North and Northeast regions is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of about 27% between 1985 and
1990, mainly as a result of the expansion plans for large aluminum plants.
Meanwhile, consumption in the South and Southeast regions is expected to
increase at an average arnnual rate of about 6%. This growth rate is lower
than the one projected for the North-Northeast due to greater saturation of
the electricity market which is the most developed in Brazil.
Power Balances
5.        In 1985, gross generation amounted to 181 TWh, of which 95% was
generated at hydroelectric stations and the rest at thermoelectric
stations. Due to an extended drought in the South and lack of adequate
transmission capacity between the Southern and Southeastern systems, in
early 1986 it was necessary to curtail capacity supply by about 20% of
demand. It was also necessary to operate, for the first time in several
years, oil-fired thermal stations in the Southern regions. For the period
1985-1995, the power system is expected to rely, by an large, on
hydroelectric generation to meet demand. Thermal generation may increase
substantially during dry periods; and the system may experience additional
energy shortages (Annex 3.1).
System Losses
6.        Total transmission and distribution losses in 1985 amounted to 9%
of net energy requirements, a reasonable value. It is expected that losses
would probably decrease to about 8% by 1990 due to better utilization of
the transmission systems and improvement in distribution feeders, provided
that the investment program in distribution is implemented as planned.

Notes
Is Figures under DEF>0 indicate the probability of energy shortage. Calculation is
based on a montly sidulation of the generation system under 2000 different hydrological
series. The number of cases for a given year in which the supply is not sufficient to
meet projected demand, expressed as a percentage of the 2000 cases, is called the
probability of energy shortage. Figures under DEF>101 indicate the probability of having
an annual energy shortage larger that 102 of projected demnd in a gien year.
2: Figures for the South and Southeast regions aere calculated under the assuption that
the oil-fired thermal plants vould be converted to use residual asphalt and that the
availability of the Itaipu units during the initial years of operation would be increased.
3: Reslts for the North and Northeast system were based on demend projections prepared
in hec184. New projections prepared in Nov./185 show substantial reduction due to delays
of industrial projects. Risks are reduced as follows:

POWER SECTOR LOAN
JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
1.        The economic analysis presented below focuses on the 1986-1989
investment program for the sector as a whole, which includes all
investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities
necessary to meet electricity demand.
Least-Cost Solution
2.        The proposed expansion plan for the Sector reflects the results
of severe financial constraints that the country and the Sector have
experienced in the past and continue to face in the short term. Extensive
consultation between the Sector and the Government has been necessary,
therefore, in order to reconcile the traditional planning criteria used by
the Sector with current severe financial constraints. Due to these special
circumstances, the proposed expansion program does not meet the projected
demand for 1986-1995 at the reliability levels traditionally used for
sector planning, and it presents deviations from a purely least-cost
solution which are discussed below.
3.        The proposed generation expansion program was based on the "Plano
2000", a comprehensive long-term planning study completed in 1982. The
Plano 2000 was considered by the Bank at that time to be a sound
development program for the Sector, taking into account that the imposed
restrictions (the nuclear and coal programs) to the purely economic
least-cost solution seemed to have reasonable basis. The proposed plan
maintains, by and large, the least cost expansion sequence of hydroelectric
projects recommended in the Plano 2000, and scales down and postpones
considerably the most questionable programs - the nuclear and coal
programs.
4.        Regarding the proposed generation expansion sequence, it is
necessary, however, to confirm the priority of some projects programmed to
commence construction in 1987 and thereafter, based on up-to-date
information about expansion alternatives. The PSRP calls the sttention
about this matter, and ELETROBRAS is now making arrangements to prepare a
new long term expansion plan (Plano 2010) in 1986, as it was envisaged in
1982.
5.        From the point of view of the reliability of the supply, the risk
of energy shortages for 1986-1995 exceed the economic levels normally
accepted for systems planning, especially during the period 1991-1995 (see
Annex 3.1). The comparison of the marginal expa4sion cost and the marginal

ANNEX 3.7
Page 2 of 2
operation cost for 1991-1995 Illustrates this point. While the marginal
expansion cost is estimated at about 23 US mills/kWh, the marginal
operating cost, 45 mills/kWh, almost doubles this value. This means that
it would be more economic to expand the system than to incur in these high
operation costs. This imbalance can be transitorily Justified by the use
of a higher opportunity cost of capital in the economic analysis of
alternatives, which would reflect the financial constraints facing the
sector. As long as the financial constraints continue, and in order to
reduce the risk of energy shortages to acceptable levels, the sector should
implement measures to restrain demand.
6.        The investment program includes hundreds of generation,
transmission, and distribution projects. It was decided, therefore, to
focus on the main criteria used to optimize the global investment program,
rather than examine the optimization of individual projects. However, it
can be stated that, in general, the power utilities routinely analyze
expansion alternatives and select the least cost solution at a discount
rate (10%) which is reasonable.

BRAZIL
POWER SECTOR LOAN
Social and Environmental Planning in the Brazilian Electrical Sector
and Resettlement of the Population to be affected by Itaparica Hydro Plant
Main Recommendations
I. Social and Environmental Planning in the Brazilian Electrical
Sector
1.       A major challenge which the Brazilian electrical sector faces is
how to generate the necessary electricity demanded by an expanding
population and industrial society, while at the same time protecting and
enhancing the adaptive capacity of the riverine ecosystems and human
communities where most large-scale hydroelectric projects are under
construction or planned.
2.       Since the late 1970's, ELETROBRAS and Its various regional
affiliates have been aware of these social and environmental issues. Over
the past decade, environmental units have been created in a number of the
regional electrical companies, and a special manual ("Manual of Studies of
Environmental Effects of Electrical Systems", ELETROBRAS, May 1985) has
been published, which provides a set of detailed guidelines for mitigating
the adverse effects of electrical-generating facilities on the physical,
biological, and social environments. More recently, numerous studies have
been commissioned of the social and environmental impacts of specific
hydro-electric projects.
3.       The ELETROBRAS manual, which was designed in cooperation with the
environmental units of the regional electrical companies and the federal
agency charged with environmental affairs (SEKA), provides a methodology
for coordinating the actions of the electrical sector In the social and
environmental fields. If applied consistently, it could provide responses
to the serious problems which the electrical sector faces by matching
engineering sophistication with high quality social and environmental
protection measures.
4.       For several reasons, the methodology contained In the ELETROBRAS
manual so far remains intentional rather than operational, because - among
other things - the electric sector:
a)   until recently lacked legal enforcement mechanisms;
b)   lacks institutional coordination between the Incipient
environmental planning apparatus in ELETROBRAS and the various
environmental units in the regional electrical company affiliates;
c)   lacks professional staffing in the social and environmental
sciences to assess and mitigate the adverse consequences of



54                ~~~~~ANNEX 3.9
Page 2 of 8
hydro-electric projects for riverine ecosystems and human
communities;
d)   depends too heavily upon private consulting and engineering firms
which are often not sufficiently oriented toward social and
environmental aspects;
e)   pays only rhetorical attention at higher managerial levels to
sociological and environmental variables, as reflected in some of
the projects presently under construction and most notoriously
Balbina;
f)   lacks mechanisms for introducing energy and site-selection
alternatives, based upon sociological and environmental
considerations, in the feasibility and design stages of proJects;
g)   lacks institutional means for increasing local, regional, and
national participation in the electrical planning and
decisic-:-making process; and
h)   lacks institutional coordination between the electrical sector and
other government agencies (SEMA, INCRA, MIRAD, Ministry of
Agriculture, FUNAIf, regional development agencies, etc.)
concerned with land-use and environmental planning, agrarian
reform, rural development, and Indian affairs.
Recommendations for Strengthening Social and Environmental Performance
5.      Funding.
The power sector should allocate funds for strengthening and making
operational the secial and environmental guidelines contained in the March
1986 ELETROBRAS Manual. The corresponding costs should be included in the
financial planning of the electrical sector and for an integral part of the
planning of all specific electrical-generating projects envisioned in the
National Rehabilitation Plan.
6.       Institutional Strengthening
Social and Environmental Coordinating Committee. A Coordinating
Committee should be set up to periodically review the progress of the
Brazilian electrical sector in the social and environmental fields. The
Committee should be comprised of prominent Brazilian social and
environmental scientists, public policy makers, and citizens and should
meet at least once a year to review the social and environmental work of
ELETROBRAS and its regional affiliates.
Professional Staffing in the Regional Electrical Companies
The regional electrical companies should increase their
professional staffs in the social and environmental sciences. Specific
attention should focus upon increasing the capacity of the regional
electrical companies to implement the guidelines and methodology contained
in the ELETROBRAS environmental manual.



- 55 -                           ANNEX 3.9
Page 3 of 8
Professional Staffing and Capability of ELETROBRAS
The professional staff and capability of ELETROBRAS should be
increased in order to assist in the planning, coordination, and evaluation
of the studies and programs of the regional electrical companies. The
environmental unit in ELETROBRAS should include an Environmental Manager
and (a) social scientists with specialization in rural sociology,
community development, resettlement and tribal societies; (b) biological
scientists with specialization in conservation and ecosystem management;
and (c) physical scientists or chemists with specialization in pollution
monitoring and control. Where needed, high-level consultants on long-term
contracts should be hired by ELETROBRAS to increase its professional
competency in these fields.
Contracts with Universities, Foundations, and Research Institutes
Funds should be allocated to increase the capacity of both
ELETROBRAS and the regional electrical companies to contract the most
qualified universities, foundations and research institutes to conduct
social and environmental studies. These bodies should be made competitive
with private consulting and engineering firms, in order to insure that the
highest quality scientific talent is mobilized to assess the social and
environmental impacts of both proposed and initiated projects.
7.       Trainig and Research
Training Courses A major constraint for prudent environmental
management is the lack of specialized professionals in Rrazil. In order to
reduce this constraint, the necessary funds should be allocated to organize
a training program for the sector, involving (a) professional development
courses for power sector environmental managers or unit chiefs; (b)
technical training courses for specialists in social and environmental
management in the electrical sector; and, (c) scholarships and academic
courses, which could be administered by the National Research Council
(CNPq) and federal environmental agency (SEMA), in collaboration with
ELETROBRAS.
Training Manuals -- ELETROBRAS should allocate funds to update and
further detail the methodology and guidelines contained in the Mlarch 1986
environmental manual and to produce new training manuals in the social and
environmental protection fields. (Among others, the electrical sector
should consider producing an operational training manual which looks at (a)
the process of planning and decision-making within the electrical sector
and regional electrical companies; (b) ways of integrating sociological and
environmental factors into the electrical planning and decision-making
process; and (c) alternative electrical and energy development strategies
which have more benign effects on the environment and society.).
Regional Research - Funds should he allocated to contract
regional studies of the social and environmental effects of different
electrical generating strategies and plans at the identification of design
stage of projects. Specific attention should focus upon river basins as
integrated systems, especially in the Amazon region where proposed
hydro-electric projects have potentially dramatic and synergistic effects



56                             ANNEX 3.9
Page 4 of 8
on the tropical forest ecosystem, species extinction, riverine ecology,
rural peasant communities, and Amerindian populations. These studies
should be combined with regional hydrological and engineering studies to
determine the least cost/risk scenarios for energy development projects in
the ecologically and socially sensitive northern part of Brazil.
8.       Amerindian Protection
Health and Land Demarcation
Special programs should be developed to mitigate the adverse
effects of a large number of hydro-electric projects on Amerindian
populations. All projects which have foreseeable impacts (either direct or
indirect) on Amerindian groups should include special health and land
demarcation components at the design stage of projects. The costs of such
components should be included in the project budget and the electric
companies should assure that anthropoligists who know the languages and
cultures of Amerindian groups are contracted to study the social and
environmental impacts of such projects and design action components prior
to project initiation.
Contractors should be obligated to observe safeguards regarding
contacts with Indian population in the vicinity of construction sites.
The electrical companies should comply with Article 20 of the
Indian Statute, which states that Amerindian groups can only be relocated
under 'exceptional circumstances" and with a decree of the President of the
Republic. In cases where such relocation is necessary, Amerindian groups
should be compensated not only monetarily but in land of equal size and
quality and within the same general region as that which they tradionally
occupied.
9.       Rural Resettlement
Resettlement Planning -- At the design phase the electrical
companies should have a thorough knowledge of the characteristics of the
local population (e.g. social composition, land tenure arrangements, and
perceptions) affected by such projects, and a well-designed and operational
resettlement plan. This plan should be worked out in collaboration with
the local community and be coordinated with other regional and national
agencies charged with land-use planning, agrarian reform, and rural
development. Before construction begins, a broad consensus on the
resettlement plan should be reached between the electrical company and the
local population; and an institutional coordination apparatus should be in
place with other regional and national agencies to implement the plan.
Information Dissemination and Public Participation - The
electrical sector should institute a formal process of public education,
information dissemination, and dialogue in the local communities and
regions where large hydro-electric projects are planned or under
construction. Specifically, it should develop a comprehensive program of
public education and community outreach (as opposed to public relations) in
order to increase local-level participation in the electricity planning and



- 57 _
ANNEX 3.9
Page 5 of 8
decision-making process. All resettlement and indemnification plans should
be designed in collaboration with local covmnuties and their
representatives (i.e. municipal authorities, rural syndicates, residents
associations, etc.), rather than-as in common at present-unilaterally
imposed by the electrical companies.
10.      Public Health Issues -  Public health problems associated with
hydroelectric projects should be investigated prior to construction and
where applicable included within resettlement plans. These public health
impacts should be brought to the attention of the engineering firms
contracted to construct the project and to the local populations affected
by it. Special progress, coordinated with other regional and national
health authorities, should be established in order to mitigate the adverse
effects of the project on the health and safety of the local populations.
II.      Construction Site Impacts -- In the design phase, attention should
also focus upon the potential social and environmental impacts of the
construction phase of hydro-electric projects. As part of resettlement
planning, the electrical companies should design procedures for avoiding
the so-called "boom'town' effects associated with large public works
projects. Specifically, the companies should work out formal arrangements
wizh local municipal authorities and the contracted engineering firms to
assure (a) maximum employment of local labor in the construction of tihe
project; (b) adequate housing and other public services for workers who
migrate to the area; (c) adequate security measures to control alcoholism,
crime, and prostitution; and (d) measures for the relocation of the
workforce at the end of the construction period.
12.      Bank Supervision
Given the scope and complexity of the proposed Bank loan, the
Bank-in collaboration with RLETROBRAS--will develop a systematic program
for supervising compliance with the social and environmental measures
outlined above on a sectoral basis and in terms of project-level spot
checks, especially of critical cases.
Bank staff will he provided with comprehensive reports on progress
in these areas, as well as access to all sites where projects are under
construction or being planned.
A supervision check-list will be developed in order to measure
electrical sector compliance with the social and environmental measures and
to assure that administrative changes can be made rapidly if compliance
does not occur.
II. THE ITAPARICA RURAL RESETTLEMENT PLAN
1. Background
1.1      Among the hydroelectric projects under construction in Brazil, the
Itaparica project of Companhia Hidroeletrica do Sao Fransisco (CHESF)
deserves special attention because of a major sad unresolved resettlement
problem.

1.2      The Itaparica project has been under construction since the late
1970's and is scheduled for completion in November 1987. The Itaparica
area comprises seven municipalities - four in Pernambuco (Petrolandia,
Floresta, Itacuruba, and Belem Sao Francisco) and three in Bahia (Gloria,
Rodelas, Carrocho) - with a total population in 1980 of about 118,000
inhabitants. A cadastral survey indicated that 8,062 families would
require relocation in late 1987, including 3,501 urban and 4,561 rural
families. About 68% of the labor force is directly involved in agriculture
and farming operations, including owner operators, tenants, sharecroppers
and labor. Consequently the livelihood of about 5,500 families depends on
agriculture and should be given access to land in other areas.
1.3      Extensive livestock production is also important and has to be
considered in the resettlement process. CHESF estimates that about 92,000
heads (goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, horses and donkeys) exist in the area.
The resettlement project would also include relocation of four towns
(Petrolandia, Rodelas, Itacuruba and Barra do Tarrachil) and relocation of
basic infrastructure, mainly roads and power lines.
1.4      The reservoir area would be expropriated on grounds of public
utility. Corresponding decrees are signed by the President of Brazil and
have a validity of only five years. They can be revalidated twelve months
after their expiration date. A first decree, No. 79826, for expropriation
of part of the municipalities of Petrolandia and Gloria was issued on
June 20, 1977, and revalidated in June 1985. For the remaining area the
Federal Government issued a second decree No. 84966 on July 28, 1980, which
expired in July 1985 and could only be reissued in July 1986. The two
mentioned decrees would allow for expropriation of rural and urban areas,
improvements, houses and other privately by owned infrastructure. The
basis for expropriation would be the 1982 cadastral survey, updated in
1984. CHESF proposes to expropriate owners (with titles) paying 100% of
the value of the land plus improvements and traditional tenants (posseiros)
60% of the value of their land plus improvements.
2.       Relocation of Urban Centers and Basic Infrastructure
2.1      Urban Centers.   The project requires relocation of the towns
Petrolandia (2,079 families), Itacuruba (380 families), Rodelas (470
families), Barra do Torrachil (284 families). New sites have been selected
with the following criteria:
(a) closeness to the old town and reservoir;
(b) integration with other cities and development centers;
(c) agricultural potential of sorrounding areas;
(d) availability of land for future expansion;
(e) topography and drainage conditions;
(f) maximum use of existing infrastructure;

(g) in the case of municipal seats (Petrolandia, Itacuruba and
Rodelas) geographic centralization;
(h) opinion of municipal and community leaders.
The development of the new towns should include systematic consultation
with the population through its leaders and directly. Construction of the
new towns has already started and could be completed prior to November
1987. Total relocation costs, based on data provided by CHESF, have been
roughly estimated in US$21 million.
2.2      Basic Infrastructure.  Basic infrastructure refers to roads and
power transmission lines. Relocation would require construction of 141 km
of roads, 65 km of 69 kV and 220 km of 13.8 kV power transmission lines.
Construction could be completed in time if started promptly. CHESF
estimates that total costs for relocation of basic infrastructure would
amount to about US$12 million.
3.       Rural Resettlement
3.1      Farmers should be given the opportunity to opt for indemnification
in cash, settlement in the lake area or integration into new or ongoing
federal or state irrigation schemes. A survey showed that 32% of the
rural families prefer resettlement in the lake area, 16% want to move to
the new towns and 32% prefer integration into federal and state irrigation
schemes. About 21% would move into other areas. Assuming that only 15% of
the families would opt for indeminification in cash and move on their own
to other areas, about 4,700 families would have to be settled on new
agricultural plots.
3.2      Studies of potential settlement areas are presently underway.
Some of the areas will drop out as more information becomes available. It
will be impossible to develop all resettlement areas and relocate everybody
in time. The overall resettlement program would have to consider
intermediate solutions, such as employing settlers as labor for
construction and on farm development activities.
3.3      CHESF expects to settle up to 2,500 families in the area around
the lake. CODEVASF agreed to carry out necessary studies and surveys for
resettlement of up to 2,500 families in the public irrigation projects of
Manicoba, Curaca, Pastos Bons, and others. Consideration should also be
given to settle 700 families in the state projects Brigida and Jusante de
Itaparica.
4.       Conclusions and Recommendations
4.1      Total costs for the resettlement and relocation of the deplaced
population from the Itaparica reservoir area have been roughly estimated at
US$240 million, comprising US$21 million for relocation of urban centers,
US$12 million for relocation of roads and power transmission lines, US$177
million for agricultural resettlement and US$30 million physical
contingencies.

4.2      Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to develop all
resettlement areas and relocate all farmer families in time on their new
land. The resettlement program should therefore provide interim solutions
such as employing settlers as labor for land clearing and construction
activities in the proposed develipment sites.
4.3      The relocation of the townships, roads and power transmission
lines could be achieved in time if diligently persued. However, as with
filling the reservoir the economic life in the Itaparica valley would come
to a momentary stand still, CHESF should set up an employment program and
community activities for the urban population during the transition period.
4.4      Not later than July 15, 1986, ELETROBRAS will submit to the Bank
an acceptable action plan of specific measures to resettle the population
to be affected by the Itaparica hydro-scheme. It should comprise the
relocation of urban centers, roads and power transmission lines,
agriculture resettlements and interim employment programs for the deplaced
rural and urban population. The action plan should specifically include:
(a) definition of all major activities, time schedules, schedules of
expenditures, financing arrangements and organizational set up for
its implementation;
(b) selection of an organization external to CHESF acceptable to the
Bank which may include experts from CHESF and ELETROBRAS, to be
operational not later than November 30, 1986, to (i) monitor the
resettlement process and measure its impact and consequences for
the social and economic well-being of the deplaced population; and
(ii) evaluate its implication for general resettlement policies in
the electrical sector;
(c) provide necessary arrangements for the expropriation of the
Itaparica reservoir area (revalidation of the presidential Decree
No. 84966) and for land acquisition of all areas considered for
resettlement of the deplaced population;
(d) furnish letters of intent (protocolos) for agreements (convenios)
satisfactory to the Bank between CHESF and CODEVASF and/or all
other institutions involved in the resettlement process, which
will clearly specify the dates in which the final formal agreement
will be signed.
4.5      Not later than October 15, 1986, the Bank would review whether the
progress achieved and initial implementation of the program is
satisfactory.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR LOAN
CRITERIA FOR THE ALLOCATION OF EQUITY
CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG SECTOR UTILITIES
Objective
To establish the basic principles governing the allocation, among
sector utilities, of equity contributions from the Federal Government to
the sector as envisioned in the Power Sector Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP).
Amounts and Proposed Sources
The amounts of such equity contributions would be funded under
the following tentative scheme (in millions of constant March 1986 US$):
1986    1987   1988    1989      TOTAL
World Bank I Sector Loan            500                                500
Cofinancing                         530                                530
World Bank II Sector Loan                   250                        250
Cofinancing                                800                         800
World Bank III Sector Loan                  150                        150
Budgetary Resources                 600    106      121     151        978
TOTAL                   1,630   1,306    121      151     3,208
Principles
(a) All sector state and federal utilities would be potential beneficiaries
of the capitalization program envisioned under the PSRP.
(b) The capitalization program would aim at improving the financial
condition of the individual utilities by allocating the equity
contribution resources so that all companies would show positive trends
in their debt service coverage ratio.
(c) The allocation of equity contributions would seek a balanced financial
situation among sector utilities, i.e., diminishing the differences
among them.
(d) The Beneficiaries would commit themselves to carry out efficiency
improvement action plans, acceptable to ELETROBRAS and the Bank.
(e) Companies which do not carry their activities under sound public
utility practices would have to initiate an efficiency improvement
action plan before receiving the equity contributions.

ANNEX 3.10
Page 2 of 2
(f) The allocation of equity contributions of one year should not go under
any circumstances to one single utility.
(g) The I World Bank sector loan and the proposed I Cofinancing Operation
would be allocated as equity contributions to the generation and
transmission companies of the ELETROBRAS Group, as they have been the
most affected by the financial condition of the sector.
(h) The proposed II and III World Bank sector loans would be allocated to
the sector part as equity contributions and part as loans. The part of
equity contributions would be only the portion whlch is expected to be
disbursed in 1987. The ELETROBRAS holding company would receive a
portion of the equity contributions from the Government and would
transfer the resources as equity or loans to the Beneficiaries,
according to their financial needs. The state governments would
receive the rest of the proceeds as loans from the Federal Government
to be transferred as equity to the state utilities. The Beneficiaries
of these operations would use the loan proceeds to buy goods and
services for their investment program under procurement and
disbursement procedures which follow Bank guidelines.
(i) When equity contributions are to be made through the conversion of debt
(or debt service) into equity, they would remain in the same company.
(j) The proposed II Cofinancing resources and the Budgetary resources would
be allocated only on the basis of the financial criteria hereby
described.
(k) Unless the above principles are substantially altered, every effort
would be made for the companies to remain within the limits established
under on-going loans for indebtedness (no more than 67%) and funding
mix (no more than 70% of borrowings).
Definitions
Debt service coverage is the ratio of gross internal funding to
debt service.
Gross internal funding is the sum of all revenues excluding
interest revenues, after payment of all cash expenses excluding interest
expense and including net dividend and income tax payments.
Debt service is the sum of total amortization and interest
payments less amortization and interest receipts and/or financing already
committed for this purpose.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR LOAN
CAPITALIZATION OF BENEFICIARIES
CORPORATE ARRANGEMENTS
Since the disbursement of the proceeds of the loan will not be
directly related to expenditures or equity contributions to be made under
the PSRP, the following arrangements will be followed:
1.       ELETROBRAS shareholders will approve a general capital increase
equivalent to the US$1.63 billion to be contributed by the Government under
the PSRP during 1986 and the Government will subscribe the corresponding
shares as a condition of effectiveness. The equity contributions will be
paid-in as required under the PSRP and the individual rehabilitation plans
of each of ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries.
2.       Also, general capital increases for each subsidiary equivalent to
the Government's equity contributions under the respective rehabilitation
plans will be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
3.       To ensure that the amounts disbursed under the loan will be used
exclusively for purposes of capitalizing the ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries,
assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the Government will
maintain in the Central Bank an account in dollars where amounts equivalent
to each disbursement from the Loan Account will be deposited. Withdrawals
from such accounts will be made exclusively to pay the equity contributions
to be made to ELETROBFAS under the PSRP.  The account will be audited in
terms satisfactory to ihe Bank.
4.       ELETROBRAS will also maintain an account (in cruzados) for
purposes of channeling the proceeds of the Government's equity
contributions to its subsidiaries. Withdrawals from this account would be
made as and when required under each utility rehabilitation plan. This
account would also be yearly audited in aceordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
