F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
As a stand-alone project of the Montreal Protocol, the Global Environment Objective is
the same as the Project Development Objective. The project objective is stated in two
different documents stemming from 1993 and 1994, respectively, namely the official
Montreal Protocol Project Document and the Trust Fund Grant Agreement between the
World Bank and Government of Tunisia. The project objective in each document is
phrased slightly differently, but the essence of the objective remains the same.

The original Project Document of April 1993, stated the project objective as follows:
"The project's objectives are to: a) establish the institutional and regulatory framework
for decreasing ODS uses; and b) introduce ODS-free technologies to the refrigeration,
foam and aerosol industries as a first demonstration phase in completing an early ODS
phaseout program?.

As per the TF Grant Agreement of June 1994, the project's objectives are "to assist the
Recipient in implementing a strategy aimed to establish the institutional and regulatory
framework for decreasing the use of ODS and introduce, on a demonstrational basis,
ODS-free technologies to the country's refrigeration, foam and aerosol industries so as to
initiate actions leading to an early ODS-phaseout program".

Per the original Project Document and TF Grant Agreement, no exact indicator value was
established at the beginning of the project. However, the Project Document did establish
that it aimed to phaseout about one-third of the 1991 consumption baseline of 1045 ODP
through the demonstration of new technologies in 5 subprojects in the three sectors.
Following appraisal, it was determined that the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) used in the 5
subprojects identified amounted to 227 ODP tonnes; hence, this can be interpreted as the
value originally targeted.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The GEO was revised twice by amendment of the TF Grant Agreement of 1994.

The first revision of December 12, 1997 widened the scope of the second part of the
objective of the project by including an additional three ODS-using sectors. The revised
GEO is "to assist the Recipient in implementing a strategy aimed to establish the
institutional and regulatory framework for decreasing the use of ODS and introduce, on a
demonstrational basis, ODS-free technologies to the country's refrigeration, foam,
aerosol, solvent, halon and bromide industries so as to initiate actions leading to an early
ODS-phaseout program". This change reflected additional funding (US$ 3.3 M) granted
through the Montreal Protocol for new subproject investments in those sectors.

The second revision on March 28, 2007 made a slight change to the last sentence of the
GEO to reflect a new broader, national objective of Tunisia to phase out selected ozone
depleting substances by 2010. The revised GEO is "to assist the Recipient in
implementing a strategy aimed to establish the institutional and regulatory framework for
decreasing the use of ODS and introduce on a demonstrational basis, ODS-free
                                            vii
technologies to the country's refrigeration, foam, aerosol, solvent, halon and bromide
industries so as to initiate actions leading to fulfillment of the Recipient's commitment to
phaseout ODS by 2010?. This change reflected the approval by the MP Executive
Committee (ExCom) of Tunisia's National Ozone Phaseout Plan (NOPP), which altered
the scope of the project significantly from financing primarily sub-investments to
supporting a national plan for complying with MP phaseout targets.

Three revised indicators were developed when the NOPP was adopted, but the process
for the inclusion of these indicators is unclear. Those revised indicators were closely
aligned with the original indicator associated with phaseout from the five demonstration
projects, above. The revised indicators were as follows:

      Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the
      introduction of ODS free technologies;
      Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the
      introduction of ODS free technologies (in ozone depleting potential (ODP);
      Develop an institutional framework within ANPE to regulate the elimination of
      ODS in Tunisia.

An intermediate indicator was included in the most recent ISRs: "Replacement of CFC 11
and CFC 12 by HFC 134a". The ICR Team has not been able to ascertain when this
indicator was added or how it was established. Further, the values listed for this
intermediate indicator in the ISRs are not consistent with those reported for GEO
indicator number 2, below.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Country and Sector Background. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer (MP) is a multilateral environmental agreement that was adopted in 1987 based on
international recognition of the need for firm measures to protect the earth’s ozone layer.1 The
Protocol established time-bound targets to reduce the production and consumption of a number
of ozone depleting substances (ODS), initially (i) chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in
refrigeration, air conditioning, and aerosol, solvents and foam applications, and (ii) halons, used
in fire protection2.

2. The Government of Tunisia (GOT) ratified the MP in September of 1989 and thereby
committed to the complete phase out of the regulated substances found in Annexes A-E of the
MP in accordance with its provisions and amendments. Developing countries, such as Tunisia,
are classified as Article 5(1) Parties. Ratification of the Protocol made Tunisia eligible to receive
grants from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of Montreal Protocol (MLF) to support
its ODS phaseout targets.

3. Tunisia was one of the early countries to receive financial assistance from the MLF for the
development of a Country Program (CP) and the development of a national strategy for phasing
out the use of ODS in accordance with the milestones given for Article 5(1) countries by the
MP.3 Tunisia’s original CP was under preparation for over two years, the intervening period
being used for data collection and developing the required strategies and defining the required
policy and legal frameworks. The CP was completed with the assistance of the World Bank in
1994. The Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Multilateral Fund (MLF) subsequently
approved the Tunisia CP at its 19th meeting in May 1996.

4. Tunisia neither produced, nor exported, any of the substances controlled under the Protocol
and hence, its consumption demands were met solely through imports. As a result, the CP spelled

  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (a protocol to the Vienna Convention for the
Protection of the Ozone Layer) was amended four times, in 1990 (London), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1997 (Montreal),
and 1999 (Beijing). The international agreement is being implemented in 197 countries, and scientists estimate that
the ozone layer should return to pre-1980 levels between 2050 and 2070. The Protocol has been ratified by 197
states and the European Union.
2
  About 90% of all ozone in the atmosphere is found in the stratosphere, beginning about 11 miles above Earth and
extending upwards to 30 miles, and therefore called the “ozone layer?. The stratospheric ozone layer is important
because it protects life on Earth from short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation produced by the sun. Solar ultraviolet-C
radiation is lethal, and ultraviolet-B radiation is damaging to almost all forms of life. Excessive ultraviolet-B
radiation can result in smaller crop yields and damage to plant genetic material, damage to marine ecosystems,
reduced fishery yields and animal health problems. It can also cause human health problems such as skin cancers,
eye cataracts and weakening of the immune system.

  The standard reference we use used in this report for ozone-depleting potential (ODP) is as follows: ODP is the
ratio of the impact on ozone of a chemical compared to the impact of a similar mass of CFC-11. The ODP of CFC-
11 is defined to be 1.0. Other ODS have ODPs that range from 0.01 to 12.0.


                                                          1
out regulatory measures needed to control ODS imports, and fiscal and technology transfer
measures to encourage the use of ODS substitutes and the adoption of non-ODS technologies.

5. At the time of appraisal, 97 percent of ODS consumption in Tunisia was in the form of CFC-
11 and CFC-12, which was heavily used in the local refrigeration, foam and aerosol industries.
Annual consumption was growing rapidly from 585 tonnes ODP/yr. in 1986 to 1,065 tonnes
ODP/yr. in 1991. Of this, 55 percent was consumed as a foam blowing agent; 22 percent as a
refrigerant; and 22 percent as a propellant for aerosol sprays. Servicing of domestic refrigerators
alone accounted for 54 percent of CFC consumption in the refrigeration sector in 1991.

6. Rationale for Bank Assistance: One of the Bank’s major commitments to its clients is to
provide support to them in meeting their obligations under international or multilateral
agreements, of which the Montreal protocol is one. Such support often takes the form of targeted
investments and capacity strengthening. In the early 1990’s, the Bank was beginning to play a
larger role in the protection of the global environment by incorporating global environmental
concerns into its strategy for sustainable development. Given the Bank’s recognized ability to
support large-scale, investment projects, and given the opportunity to link environmental efforts
more closely with broader development objectives, the Bank agreed to be one of the original
three implementing agencies of the MLF, along with UNEP and UNDP (UNIDO became the
fourth Implementing Agency at a later date).

7. As an implementing agency of the MLF, the Bank assisted the Government of Tunisia in
identifying opportunities for ODS phaseout in the manufacturing and service sector. At the time
of appraisal, a number of similar projects were under development by the Bank, including
another in the MNA region (i.e. Jordan). The Bank had a strong technical team that was involved
in these operations and able to transfer experiences and best practices between countries. The
Bank’s focus on economic development while ensuring environmental sustainability placed it in
a good position to support ODS phaseout where industrial expansion would need to include
environmental considerations.

8. As spelled out in the Bank’s Operational Policy 10.21, Investment Operations Financed by
the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, funding for the
implementation of MP projects is channeled to recipients through the Ozone Projects Trust Fund
(OTF), which the Bank established and administers. The OTF is constituted by funds approved
by the MLF ExCom. Projects, and umbrella grant sub-projects, greater than $500,000 are
prepared and pre-appraised by the World Bank, following which they are submitted for approval
to the MLF ExCom. Such operations are then processed according to the procedures set out in
Bank Procedures 10.21, which include project documents and reviews similar or identical to
those that apply to regular investment projects, and then approved at the Regional Vice President
level.4 The World Bank Procurement and Consultant Selection Guidelines apply.

 Montreal Protocol operations have evolved somewhat since OP/BP 10.21 was originally established but its main
feature, the umbrella grant agreement, was employed through 2010. As part of Bank-wide Investment Lending
Reforms, there are plans to retire OP/BP 10.21 in FY2013.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

9. As a stand-alone project of the Montreal Protocol, the Global Environment Objective is the
same as the Project Development Objective. The project objective is stated in two different
documents stemming from 1993 and 1994, respectively, namely the official Montreal Protocol
Project Document and the Trust Fund (TF) Grant Agreement (GA) between the World Bank and
Tunisia. The project objective in each document is phrased slightly differently; however the
essence of the objective remains the same.

10. The original Project Document of April, 1993, stated the project objective as follows: “The
project's objectives are to: a) establish the institutional and regulatory framework for decreasing
ODS uses; and b) introduce ODS-free technologies to the refrigeration, foam and aerosol
industries as a first demonstration phase in completing an early ODS phaseout program. “As per
the TF Grant Agreement of June 1994, the project's objectives are "to assist the Recipient in
implementing a strategy aimed to establish the institutional and regulatory framework for
decreasing the use of ODS and introduce, on a demonstrational basis, ODS-free technologies to
the country's refrigeration, foam and aerosol industries so as to initiate actions leading to an early
ODS phaseout program".

11. Per the original Project Document and TF Grant Agreement, no exact indicator value was
established at the beginning of the project. However, the Project Document did establish that it
aimed to phaseout about one-third of the 1991 consumption baseline of 1045 ODP through the
demonstration of new technologies in 5 sub-projects across the three sectors. The CFCs used in
the 5 subprojects identified was determined to amount to 227 ODP tonnes and this became the
original target value.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

12. The GEO was revised twice by amendment based on the project objective stated in the TF
Grant Agreement of 1994.

13. The first revision of December 12, 1997 widened the scope of the second part of the
objective of the project by including an additional three ODS-using sectors. The revised GEO is
"to assist the Recipient in implementing a strategy aimed to establish the institutional and
regulatory framework for decreasing the use of ODS and introduce, on a demonstrational basis,
ODS-free technologies to the country's refrigeration, foam, aerosol, solvent, halon and bromide
industries so as to initiate actions leading to an early ODS phaseout program." This change
reflected additional funding granted through the Montreal Protocol for new sub-project
investments in those sectors.

14. The second revision of March 28, 2007 made a slight change to the last sentence of the GEO
to reflect a new broader, national objective of Tunisia to phase out select ozone depleting
substances by 2010. The revised GEO is “to assist the Recipient in implementing a strategy
aimed to establish the institutional and regulatory framework for decreasing the use of ODS and
                                                  3
introduce on a demonstrational basis, ODS-free technologies to the country’s refrigeration, foam,
aerosol, solvent, halon and bromide industries so as to initiate actions leading to fulfillment of
the Recipient’s commitment to phaseout ODS by 2010.? This change reflected the approval by
the MP Executive Committee (ExCom) of Tunisia’s National Ozone Phaseout Plan (NOPP),
which altered the scope of the project significantly from financing primarily sub-investments to
supporting a national plan for complying with MP phaseout targets. Three revised indicators
were developed when the NOPP was adopted, but the process for the inclusion of these
indicators is unclear. Those revised indicators were closely aligned with the original indicator
associated with phaseout from the five demonstration projects, above. The revised indicators
were as follows:

   -   Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the introduction of
       ODS free technologies;
   -   Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the introduction of
       ODS free technologies (in ozone depleting potential (ODP);
   -   Develop an institutional framework within ANPE to regulate the elimination of ODS in
       Tunisia.

15. An intermediate indicator was included in the most recent ISRs: “Replacement of CFC 11
and CFC 12 by HFC 134a.? The ICR Team has not been able to ascertain when this indicator
was added or how it was established. Further, the values listed for this intermediate indicator in
the ISRs are not consistent with those reported for GEO indicator number 2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

16. The direct beneficiaries identified in the original Project Document (April 1993) were local
enterprises who would be eligible to receive funds to introduce appropriate ODS reducing
technologies and production processes.

17. Indirectly, the global population is the main beneficiary group of the ODS phaseout program
as ODS reduction will have positive effects on the stratospheric ozone layer.

18. Finally, other beneficiaries include various governmental entities, who have received funds
for strengthening the institutional environment governing the phaseout of ODS.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

19. Per the original Project Document, the project consisted of six components organized in two
main parts: Technology Development and Institutional Strengthening.

Part A: Technology Development. This part consisted of 5 components in three ODS-using
sectors focusing on demonstration projects, technical assistance and training aimed at assisting
the Government of Tunisia (GOT) in the transfer of technology suitable to allow it to reduce
ODS in the refrigeration, flexible foam and aerosol sectors:



                                                4
Refrigeration Sector:
   i.  HFC-134a Refrigerator Prototypes: Introduction of HFC-134a as a substitute for CFC-12
       as a refrigerant in the manufacturing of refrigerators;
  ii. Rigid Foam Conversion Demonstration: Replacement of CFC-11 as a foam-blowing
       agent for refrigerator insulation;
 iii. Technician Training (Refrigeration): Introduction of a CFC-recycling and refrigeration
       maintenance program through training.

Flexible Foam Sector:
 iv. Flexible Foam Conversion Demonstration: Replacement of CFC-11 with a non-ODS
       substitute.

Aerosol Sector:
 v.    Aerosol Study and Conversion: A sectoral study to determine assistance needs and
       training.

Part B: Institutional Strengthening. This component was designed to establish and operate the
Ozone Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to assist ANPE in managing the project, specifically
through recruitment of staff, provision of consultant services, training and equipment, and
identification of feasibility studies for new investment projects required to complete the phaseout
of ODS. These new projects would be submitted to the MLF ExCom for financing of
incremental costs:

 vi.   Institutional Strengthening: Develop an institutional framework within ANPE to regulate
       the elimination of ODS in Tunisia.

The original project cost was US$ 2.23 million, of which US$ 1.79 million was financed through
the OTF grant.

                                                5
1.6 Revised Components

20. The components were slightly revised over the life of the project, though the administrative
mechanism for their revision is unclear. Montreal Protocol projects did not require approval by
the Board of Directors of the World Bank.

21. Component A6 (Additional Foam Sub-Projects) was added approximately in 1997, after the
completion of the first round of demonstration sub-projects to include the group of foam sub-
projects between 1998 and 2000. Component A7 was added for the National Ozone Phaseout
Plan (NOPP). Institutional Strengthening (IS - Part B) was renewed more than originally
planned to ensure there was IS funding during implementation of Components A6 and A7 and
other sub-projects (under UNIDO). The grant ceiling was raised incrementally from US$1.79
million to US$5.12 million as outlined in section 1.7.

22. The table below shows the revised components and the approximate disbursement for each
component. Tunisia received project approvals from the ExCom in excess of the latest US$5.12
million grant ceiling amount. However, given a disbursement rate of 86 percent, the most recent
GA extensions associated with the renewal of the IS component were not accompanied by a raise
in the grant ceiling. An effective quota system and lower ODS demand than estimated in the
NOPP form part of the explanation for the lower than anticipated disbursement rate. However,
another reason is related to the implementation capacity of the NOB following the approval of
the NOPP, which as a national program proved to be much more difficult to manage than the
traditional subprojects and therefore slowed implementation. For more details, please see Annex
2.

1.7 Other significant changes

23. The Project was designed to furnish grant funds approved by the MLF for the targeted
phaseout of ODS. The Project’s implementation structure was governed by an umbrella Grant
Agreement (TF 21936), an instrument that had been created specifically for the Bank’s MP
investment activities. In this instrument, grant commitments were not received upfront but rather,
were dependent on MLF approvals received over the life of the agreement, thereby allowing for
the development of additional subprojects that might be required to assist the Government in
meeting its MP phaseout targets in the future. This unique approval process of grant funding
from the MLF has meant that a frequent number of extensions and amendments are common for
MP projects.

24. Since the ODS Phase-Out Trust Fund Grant Agreement became effective on June 14, 1994,
the original closing date of June 30, 1997, has been extended five times up to the last date of
June 30, 2012 – all at the request of the GOT. The grant agreement was also amended on
November 3, 1994, December 12, 1997, and February 22, 2007 to incrementally increase the
ceiling of the grant from an initial US$1.79 million to US$5.12 million to allow for funding of
additional subprojects approved by the MLF. These increases were primarily to adapt to new
stages of subproject approvals by the MLF based on evolving country needs as phased MP ODS
elimination obligations came into force.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25. The project was prepared and designed in accordance with the operational mechanism of the
MLF, which required the development of Country Program (CP) as a condition for approval of
planned activities for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances of the MP (mainly CFCs and
halon). Subsequently, investments identified in the CP were reviewed and funded separately
based on their ODS phaseout potential, technical merit and cost-effectiveness. The
Government’s commitment had been demonstrated by ratification of the Montreal Protocol and
acceptance of the ODS control schedule therein.

26. The project structure was simple: a single implementing agency with well-defined
responsibilities would implement sub-projects identified in the CP to introduce ODS-reducing
technologies to specific companies in targeted industries coupled with a strong technical
assistance component that would strengthen institutional capacity during implementation. The
transfer of ODS-reducing technologies to the private sector was structured as an umbrella
agreement as provided by OP 10.21 to facilitate the processing and management of multiple sub-
projects under a single Grant Agreement. At the time of appraisal, a Project Manager had been
appointed by ANPE under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. With overall
responsibility for the implementation of the project, the Project Manager was supported by
Component Coordinators and an Institutional Specialist with expertise in complying with Bank
and MP procedures.

27. The three main risks to the project identified at the preparation stage were considered to be:
       (a) a possible delay in implementing start up activities due to ANPE's lack of familiarity
       with Bank procedures, with a resultant delay in adopting the recommended accelerated
       phaseout schedule. This would be mitigated by the following:
               (i) securing an institutional specialist to assist with the preparation of detailed
               TORs, procurement documents, work plans, and procedural guidelines for the
               OPIU and NOC; and
               (ii) presenting a project launch seminar during the first supervision mission
               following grant signing in order to familiarize project participants with Bank and
               Montreal Protocol guidelines and procedures for project preparation and
               implementation;

       (b) the reluctance of manufacturers to cooperate with ANPE in the sharing of ozone
       friendly technology throughout the relevant sectors. This would be mitigated by the
       following:
               (i) the signing of sub-grant agreements which would require the transfer of
               technology - obtained through OTF financing - between enterprises, with
               signatures required as a condition for grant effectiveness;

       (c) the difficulty in enforcing an accreditation system in practice given that there was no
       existing system for monitoring refrigeration technician activities and qualifications. This
       would be partly mitigated by the following:

                                                8
               (i) the provision of training courses to all qualified candidates prior to enforcing
               the system, and by putting in place regulation of ODS distributors and a
               monitoring program of ODS-using industries.

28. In hindsight, despite the fact that most of these risks were effectively mitigated, issues
regarding staffing, financial management and procurement still arose during the implementation
period (see Section 2.2). However, it would appear that no measures taken at project preparation
could have prevented these problems.

29. There were no significant environmental and social safeguards issues identified during
preparation. Concerns primarily related to worker health and safety in the foam and aerosol
industries and were mitigated by adhering to international standards for the safe handling of
flammable and potentially toxic substances.

30. The project was designed before formal results frameworks were required for Bank-
supported projects; however, the objectives, baseline and target values were clearly defined from
the outset and have continued to provide a meaningful framework for measuring progress
throughout the life of the project.

31. Documentation on stakeholder involvement in the preparation of the Country Program was
not available to the ICR team. However, based on MLF guidance in place for CP preparation in
the early 1990s, the team assumes that the Tunisian CP preparation also involved stakeholder
consultations. Participating enterprises were actively involved in sub-project preparation and
selection of alternative technologies.

32. Protection of the ozone layer was an area of new business development for the Bank and a
number of similar projects using the Ozone Projects Trust Fund resources were under
development at the time. No similar projects however, had yet advanced sufficiently in
implementation at that time to provide comprehensive lessons learned that could be applied in
the preparation of this project. In fact, the Tunisia CP and the following ODS demonstration
project were among the earliest MP activities of the World Bank.

2.2 Implementation

33. A number of critical success factors and institutional challenges stand out from the
perspective both of the Bank and of the country. Overall, while the project has performed well
and achieved its global environmental objective, implementation was not without delays or
problems. Various difficulties related to supervision and implementation placed the project at
risk in the last years prior to closing.

34. Changing project objectives: Clearly, the course of implementation deviated drastically from
those original designs in the sense that all phases have been supported under a single project. In
retrospect, it is possible to identify three distinct phases to the project as implemented:

   (i) First, to build the capacity of the GOT by establishing the institutional framework for
       ODS phaseout and pilot an initial set of demonstration activities;

                                                9
   (ii) Second, to fund a series of follow-on investments to assist the private sector in modifying
        production processes using ODS-free technology in participating industries; and
   (iii)Third, to develop a National Ozone Phaseout Plan (NOPP) in 2006, which provides an
        overall strategy and action plan for the complete phaseout of consumption as defined by
        the Montreal Protocol of Annex A, Group I and II and Annex B, group II and III ozone
        depleting substances (i.e. CFCs and halon) by 2010.

35. The first phase met with substantial success thanks to a campaign of sensitization and
dialogue with the affected industries and companies during the preparation of the CP and the
early stages of project implementation. During these early days of the project, the NOB
approached industry associations of the sectors of interest and canvassed their membership for
volunteers to participate in the technology demonstration program. The industry associations also
became part of the information dissemination effort.

36. The technology demonstrations took the form of a grant to reduce or eliminate the cost of
replacing capital equipment in the participating companies; for example, a foam injection
company making rigid foam insulation with a CFC agent used for the blowing process would
receive through the project a replacement injector machine capable of working with a non-CFC
blowing agent such as HFC-134a. The capital equipment would be accompanied by training in
its operation, also provided through the project. At the same time, within the government a
program of targeted capacity building was underway to bring the capacities of the institutions
managing the project into line with the project’s exigencies.

37. The second stage built on the lessons learned from the first, both in technical and capacity
terms. The mode of technology transfer was by this time established and the capacity of the
NOB and other partner agencies substantially stronger. The only modifications required were to
extend the closing date of the grants, and to raise the ceiling amount as required to accommodate
the amount of new funds made available. This stage represented a scaling-up of the activities
initially planned under the project.

38. By modifying the original project objective that had only captured three sectors and
extending the grant and its ceiling, the opportunity and scope for ODS impact widened in a
changing environment where CFC alternatives were becoming more accessible, the extent of
ODS using industries and sectors became known and the MP baseline for developing countries
was being established (1995-1997). The third phase began to introduce new elements that had
not been part of the initial project design. A project that had begun as a technical demonstration
to encourage technological uptake in industry became the primary vehicle for the achievement of
Tunisia’s internationally agreed goals on ODS phaseout. This was the point at which the project
became qualitatively different from its original design. However, the limited monitoring and
results framework in place for the initial, limited project objectives did not keep pace with these
changes and was not well suited to providing consistent measurement of outputs and tracking of
impacts. Furthermore, the institutional capacities built during the prior stages of the project were
not necessarily those which would lend themselves to the successful execution of this stage.

39. As the project grew evermore comprehensive in scope, project implementation performance
suffered - as evident in the performance ratings since 2007, which have shown a general

                                                10
downward trend. This coincided with MLF funding for the National Ozone Phaseout Plan
(NOPP), which signaled a change from the previous approval of sub-project investments to
funding of a national program. The new, country-driven, performance-based approach embodied
in the NOPP and which was adopted by the ExCom at its 35th Meeting might have proven to be
too much for the GOT without also increasing support to build capacity in project management.
With the project-by-project approach in earlier days, consultants and direct contracting lightened
the implementation burden for ANPE. All of this, coupled with changes in WB operational
requirements (fiduciary procedures in particular) and with the fact that the NOPP may have
overestimated the magnitude of the phaseout still required in the private sector, led to setbacks in
implementation.

40. In hindsight, perhaps the best performance outcomes would have been achieved by dividing
the task into separate phases with proper preparation and objectives for each phase. Another
valid approach would have been to evaluate the project at intervals during its long
implementation, such as via mid-term reviews (discussed in greater depth below), and to
restructure the project according to the findings of those evaluations. This would provide the
team with systematic opportunities to revise the legal agreement so that it continues to reflect
accurately the actual activities being undertaken by the project.

41. Implementation Schedule: The implementation schedule itself never posed any problems as
the nature of the umbrella agreement was amenable to extension as funds became available. The
original project was designed to be implemented in three years with a closing date in 1997.
Initially, as described in the original Project Document, the project was envisioned to establish
the institutional and legal framework for phasing out CFCs and to demonstrate to the private and
public sectors, using a series of activities, the introduction of non-ODS substitutes in the
refrigeration, foam, and aerosol industries. Subsequently, the GOT would submit to the MF the
second phase of the CP consisting of investment projects.

42. Supervision Challenges: Supervision of this project began on quite a successful trajectory as
shown by the series of ISR ratings, and operated that way for more than a decade. Problems
began to occur in later years, particularly after 2007. A couple of key factors have challenged
supervision; in particular, frequent rotation of TTLs in the later years of the project5, and
continuously evolving Bank procedures, particularly in the fiduciary domain.

43. The turnover of TTLs is a well-known issue in many projects across the World Bank, but in
this case it became aggravated in the last few years of the project’s lifespan, as TTL tenure
became less constant, often falling below one year. The net effect of this, noted also by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG), was that the task team became stuck in perpetual learning
mode as new staff took on the project, and were prevented from reaching the level of mature
experience that would have contributed the greatest value to the Client’s efforts. This problem
was further aggravated by the contrasting longevity of the tenure of the main GOT counterparts:

5
 The ICR team has been unable to reconstruct the complete chain of TTL custodianship for the entire lifespan of the
project. Frequent turnover of TTLs has been identified as a problem by both Bank staff and the Client, and was
identified in the QAG report based on FY 2003-2004 information. The partial reconstruction shows that between
                                                                       .
2005 and 2011, there were at least nine different TTLs for this project


                                                       11
they had been involved in the project since its inception and could see the disparity with the
relatively long tenure of the project’s earlier TTLs.

44. Continuously evolving Bank administrative procedures have imposed challenges on the
Client to conform to changing requirements. The challenge of changing procedures is to be
expected over the long lifespan of a project like this, and is not unique. Communication,
however, is the key to managing these routine changes over time. The Bank has a responsibility
to collaborate with the Client during such transition phases (e.g. to new or changing reporting
formats), but it has been noted that in some cases, the Bank did not make every effort to facilitate
this process. It is likely that this has led to slippage on the part of the Client and may have
reflected poorly on implementation performance.

45. While these challenges are not limited to this project, they have had an impact on both Bank
and Client implementation performance. In a step towards creating better synergy between
project objectives, staff expertise, and supervision resources, responsibility for supporting the
implementation of the project was transferred from MNSIF (Infrastructure, Private Sector
Development and Finance) to MNSRE (Environmental Cluster) in 2003.

46. It is nonetheless important to keep in perspective that progress towards the GEO remained
satisfactory and that Tunisia has achieved high levels of ODS phaseout; in fact, significantly
higher than set targets. Instead, it was primarily the relationship between the Client and the Bank
that was affected as a number of supervision challenges hampered the Bank’s engagement with
the project.

47. Mid-Term Review: No mid-term review was ever carried out by the Bank. It has not been
possible for the ICR Team to uncover the exact reasons for this. However, compared to other
ODS phaseout projects recently completed, it is not uncommon for MP projects with over 15
years of implementation to not conduct a mid-term review at all or to undertake this exercise late
in the process. The Philippines Ozone Depleting Substances Phaseout Project (P004406), which
was approved in 1994, completed a mid-term review in 2008 before project closing in 2011. The
Republic of Turkey Second Phase-Out of Ozone Depleting Substances Project (P038404), which
was approved in 1991 and closed in 2007 without undertaking a mid-term review. The same is
true for the China Ozone Depleting Substance Phase-Out Project III (P003409), which was
approved in 1995 and closed in 2008, and for the Jordan Ozone-Depleting Substances Phase-Out
2 Project (P049706), which was approved in 1995 and ended in 2012; neither of which ever
undertook a mid-term review.

48. It should be noted that a mid-term review is not a formal requirement by the MP or the MLF.
Though the MLF does not offer any financial incentives towards undertaking a mid-term review,
the bank budget funding allocated to this project should in theory have been sufficient for all
project implementation costs, including mid-term review(s).

49. Institutional Support: There was strong inter-ministerial support for the National Ozone
Bureau (NOB) and for the project. Other ministries critical to the implementation of this project,
such as Trade, Finance, Industry, and Health, as well as the Customs Office (“Bureau des
Douanes?), have been involved in formal and informal cooperation mechanisms that have grown

                                                12
to maturity over time and enabled the ODS phaseout program to be achieved by concerted action
across these diverse entities. Within the ANPE, the NOB achieved and maintained support from
its managers due in part to persistent high-level political support, to the project’s demonstrated
progress towards established targets, to the self-contained nature of its mandate, and to its ability
to procure funding for its own operations from the proceeds of the MLF grants.

50. Country Ownership: From the beginning of the project, Tunisia has shown a strong sense of
ownership of the project, and benefitted from the leadership of the GOT to make ODS phaseout
a national priority. This strong national ownership has been an asset to the Tunisian ODS
phaseout program at the level of the Montreal Protocol, where the country was among the early
movers on this issue. The strong political commitment from the GOT has also been instrumental,
as has the existing institutional foundation upon which the project has built and strengthened the
capacity of the NOB.

51. QAG Review: This project was subject to a review by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
in 2005 as part of the QSA6 (Quality of Supervision in FY03-04). The QAG review of this
project assigned a Supervision rating of “moderately unsatisfactory?, based in large part on
significant implementation challenges, including lack of continuity in task team composition
leading to a state of perpetually “learning the project from the ground up?, the need to organize
additional expertise to assist with supervision, and incompleteness of supervision documents,
among others. The QAG review and the region’s responses are discussed in greater depth in
section 5.1(b).

52. Arab Spring: In December 2010, Tunisia experienced an unprecedented and spontaneous
wave of massive civil resistance that ended the 23 year rule of former President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali, and which ushered in a new political and economic era. These events prompted a
review of the existing Country Partnership Program for FY10-FY13, and an Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) was prepared to outline the Bank Group's proposed post-revolution engagement in
Tunisia for FY13 and FY14.

53. While Tunisia is currently at a critical turning point, facing unprecedented challenges and
opportunities, the GOT’s commitment to meeting its obligations under the Montreal Protocol has
been unwavering. Traditionally, the highest priority within the GOT has been accorded to
legislation, which gives effect to international Treaties ratified by Tunisia. This includes the MP
and it provisions, which have acquired the status of domestic law.

54. In practical terms, the ICR mission revealed that, though the Arab Spring did pose some
difficulties in terms of general uncertainty within the government as a whole, the project did not
suffer commensurate setbacks. The only specific incident cited was that there was some
procurement difficulty with an international provider under contract who failed to meet the terms
of the contract and delivery of goods was delayed while an alternative provider was found.
However, the overall operation of the project was able to continue largely uninterrupted, due
largely to two main factors: first, the fact that the MP grant paid for the operational budget of the
NOB; and second, the existence of strong and long-standing working relationships between the
NOB and its partner ministries and agencies (e.g. Customs). It must also be noted that the Arab
Spring did not begin until the ODS elimination deadline was almost at hand.

                                                 13
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

55. The project has the advantage of having a single, well-defined, quantitative indicator to track
progress towards meeting the GEO target of zero ODS consumption by 2010: that is, aggregate
tonnes of ODS equivalents consumed per year. With clearly defined annual phaseout targets to
measure progress towards the goal, the project results framework allowed for regular monitoring
against the baseline value for this prime indicator.

56. The National Ozone Bureau (NOB) regularly collected data through calculation of
enterprise-level phaseout achieved in sub-projects, as well as through ODS imports recorded by
the Customs Authorities. ANPE is responsible for approving ODS import permits and for setting
the quotas in consultation with other ministries and agencies. When reporting on data it draws
from its records of quota issuance/import permits and from Custom Records. The audit reports of
the NOPP lay out the procedures. This allowed the GOT to meet its reporting obligations under
Article 7 of the MP, and in turn also allowed the MP to assess Tunisia’s compliance status. In
addition, and in line with MLF guidelines, this data was also used for preparation and submission
of project completion reports and, eventually, for the annual audit reports required under the
NOPP agreement signed with the MLF ExCom. Three independent audit reports have been
prepared during the period covered by the NOPP. The latest audit report validating government
reported ODS consumption levels for 2010, was submitted to the 68th meeting of the MLF
ExCom in November 2012.

57. A Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared for each sub-project in accordance with
ExCom requirements. Each PCR presents data on financing and expenditures, procured
equipment, phaseout of ODS and consumption of alternatives, implementation efficiency, and
disposal of ODS equipment.

58. For the purpose of evaluating the impact of the project, the first Tunisian CP went beyond
data collection and recording historical consumption to also include estimates of future CFC
consumption for each sub-sector that was likely to occur without intervention via assistance from
the MP. These early estimates were based on a number of factors, including anticipated
population growth, Gross Domestic Product growth, increases in household incomes, etc. It was
estimated that with an unconstrained CFC consumption over the period 1992-2010, Tunisia
would more than double yearly consumption and reach 3,000 tonnes/yr. by 2010. Linking project
inputs and outputs in such a framework, affords the project to establish technical causality
between the impact of the MP program and observed reduction of CFC consumption.

59. As evident by the introduction of a decree to definitively prohibit the import of Annex A
substances, data collected in collaboration with the customs authority has been instrumental in
allowing for such timely action that first sought to support enterprises in converting to alternative
technologies before placing a ban on inputs that otherwise would have no substitutes. Previously
they were banned indirectly by non-issuance of import quotas.

60. The project was restructured numerous times over its lifetime (refer to section H of the
project data sheet, above), but the revisions made were in effect limited to adding sub-project
components, raising the grant ceiling or extending the closing date. Restructuring was not used

                                                 14
as a means of updating the project’s risk management or Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
frameworks. In the early part of the 2000s, the World Bank began introducing measures for
improving M&E, such as results frameworks. These could have been created as part of the
restructuring of the project in 2003, for example. Indeed, the restructuring of 2007 to
accommodate the adoption of the NOPP would have been an opportune moment to strengthen
the M&E of this project with a results framework adapted to the new direction of national policy
on ODS phaseout.

61. The reasons for this inaction on updating the project’s design as newer practices came about
are not clear from the documentary record, though inconsistency of team leadership as noted by
QAG may have played a role. Contemporary ODS phaseout projects in other countries do not
appear to have adopted this approach either (e.g. Philippines). Another possibility is that the
M&E requirements of the MP were deemed sufficient for the purposes of the Bank as well. If
so, this would not have prevented the establishment of a simple M&E framework which would
have captured equivalent information for reporting to the Bank. Such a framework could have
improved access to performance information by the task team.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

62. Safeguards. According to available Implementation Status Reports since 2006 and the
equivalent Project Status Reports prior to 2006, both overall compliance with safeguards
requirements and specific compliance with the requirements of OP 4.01 have been ranked
Satisfactory.

63. While the overall impacts of the project were expected to be environmentally positive from a
global perspective, the project was classified as category “B?, according to Operational Directive
4.01, to address potential local issues. A partial environmental assessment was prepared in 1993,
which revealed that the main issues to be addressed were related to worker health, safety and
awareness in the aerosol and foam industries, which may be using flammable and potentially
toxic gases, such as cyclopentane, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and methyl chloride. For the use
of methyl chloride as a blowing agent for the flexible foam component, health and safety
measures would have to comply with international standards. Safety measures related to the
present use of LPG as a propellant would be investigated during the aerosol study and
strengthened as necessary with any new proposals for the use of LPG. Use of cyclopentane as a
foam blowing agent would require the support of a technology partner experienced in the safe
use of cyclopentane, or a similar agent, for rigid foam applications. All new substances
introduced to the Tunisian industries would have to follow the safety guidelines recommended
by the manufacturers and conform to international safety standards.

64. Investments prepared as sub-projects under the umbrella GA and which exceeded
US$ 500,000 were prepared and pre-appraised by the World Bank according to procedures
similar or identical to those that apply to regular investment projects, including approval at the
regional vice president level. As part of the Bank’s rigorous standards on environmental and
social safeguards, such concerns were considered during the preparation of each investment
project aimed at converting to non-ODS technology.

                                               15
65. Fiduciary Compliance. According to the latest available Implementation Status Report of
June 2012, Financial Management and Procurement were rated Moderately Satisfactory.

66. At project inception, national procurement rules were followed which, when combined with
low initial capacity in the NOB, led to delays in implementing project activities. However, these
weaknesses have since been remedied through (i) capacity/knowledge building and hands-on
training to an identified staff among those in the ODS team as well as to the staff responsible for
public procurement in the ANPE in general (SPCN); and (ii) continuous support and advice
throughout the project life provided by Bank procurement staff based in Tunis. By the second
half of the project period, the situation had markedly improved and procurement, for rather large
contracts, was carried out satisfactorily thanks to the capacity that was built in the local project
team. Despite this, national tender committees continued to be a source of bureaucratic delays.

67. The disbursement amount in one particular category (2.G) exceeded the amount allocated to
that category by 84%. The issue of exceeding disbursement categories has been highlighted in
Aide-Memoires since 2008, where it was recommended that the categories be reallocated, but no
further actions were taken.

68. In addition, the project did not submit its last Interim Financial Report. The Bank team did a
close follow up with the Client but was unable to receive the requested report. Hence, the
project was not compliant with agreed FM arrangements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

69. With the closing of the umbrella project and the expiration of the grant agreement, the GOT
expressed concern regarding the continuity of its ongoing ODS phaseout program as outlined in
the NOPP and to which the GOT remains strongly committed. The NOPP focuses on financing
investments in equipment for remaining ODS-using enterprises and the servicing sector, as well
as on technical assistance to the private and public sector to ensure sustainable and permanent
CFC and halon phaseout.

70. To ensure a sustainable and uninterrupted transition and continued operation of the NOB and
planned activities, UNIDO agreed to take over the responsibility for implementation of the
institutional strengthening component of the project (Part B). UNIDO is already active in ODS
Phase-Out in Tunisia in the industrial and agricultural sectors. A new request for continuation of
the Institutional Strengthening component (Phase VI) was positively considered by the MLF
ExCom in spring 2012, and funds approved for the next phase are transferred directly to UNIDO.

71. It should be noted that during the ICR mission, the Client expressed dissatisfaction with the
lack of consultation from the Bank’s side to discuss the closing of the project and the transition
arrangements.




                                                16
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

72. The need to eliminate the use and release to the environment of ozone-depleting substances
was highly relevant in 1993-1994 when the project was conceived and appraised, coming as it
did on the heels of conclusive scientific evidence about the deleterious effects of CFCs and other
anthropogenic chemicals on the atmospheric ozone layer. At the time, this project was highly
topical and showed a determination to meet this new challenge. In the present day, it remains
equally relevant even if the public eye is no longer so closely focused on the protection of the
ozone layer. In terms of global environmental protection, the objective of the project remained
relevant throughout its entire lifespan.

73. The project was designed in a way that allowed operational flexibility over a long time
frame. It showed itself to be capable of going from a technical demonstration project to a full-
scale, national ODS elimination project, due in large part to the open-endedness and flexibility of
the umbrella grant agreement. Implementation followed this general pattern: moving from
specific interventions with specific enterprises in the early stages, to broader work on a larger
scale as time went on and capacity increased with experience. The achievement of the final
phaseout objective shows that this initial design and the implementation that flowed from it were
appropriate tools that remained relevant to the overall goal of ODS phaseout despite substantial
changes in project activities over time.

74. The events of the Arab Spring have not changed the fundamental relevance of this project for
the country. In concrete terms, the objective of the project remains relevant to Tunisia’s social
and economic development today, as well as to Tunisia’s leadership position on environmental
management in the Region. The Montreal Protocol includes trade-related provisions and indirect
benefits of its implementation accrue – countries can only trade ODS with other countries that
are also Parties to the MP (HCFCs are ODS that can be used into 2020 for Art. 5 countries). In
addition, by shifting to alternative technologies (key objective of this project), The GOTs
continued reforms to introduce more stringent policies on ODS import, to streamline regulations
on ODS consumption, and to scale-up the phaseout of ODS in public and private enterprises
supports the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) Driving Objective 2 “Strengthening the business
environment and deepening integration? by improving private sector competitiveness through
compliance with international standards.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

75. This project achieved its Global Environmental Objectives; namely, Tunisia was able to
achieve the complete phaseout of CFC and halons by January 1, 2010with a total of 974.4 ODP
tones eliminated. This was a reduction 14% greater than the reduction target of 854.65 ODP
tones set for Tunisia by the Montreal Protocol. For this reason, this ICR rates the achievement of
the GEO as “satisfactory?.

76. As mentioned above, the key indicators for measuring achievement of the GEO are:
       Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the introduction of
       ODS free technologies;
       Elimination of the consumption of ozone depleting substances through the introduction of
       ODS free technologies (in ozone depleting potential (ODP);
       Develop an institutional framework within ANPE to regulate the elimination of ODS in
       Tunisia.

77. The initial project baseline value of 1045 ODP tonnes is Tunisia's 1991 CFC consumption in
the foam, aerosol and refrigeration sectors as referenced in the project document. Through the
demonstration of new technologies in 5 subprojects in the three sectors, the project aimed to
phaseout about a third of the total CFCs consumed in 1991. The CFCs used at the 5 subprojects
was determined to amount to 227 ODP tonnes.

78. The revised target value of 854.65 ODP tonnes represents the ozone depleting potential that
Tunisia agreed to phaseout in on-going and additional subprojects, and includes the 227 tonnes
ODP initially targeted. This was adjusted through amendment to the grant agreement in light of
changes in national consumption patterns of ODS in various sectors, and in light of the start of
the Montreal Protocol's compliance period for Annex A substances (CFCs and halon) in
developing countries.

79. The actual value achieved of 974.4 ODP tonnes shows that Tunisia not only phased out the
854.65 ODP tonnes targeted by the revised project, but also was successful in completely
eliminating Annex A substances according to its Montreal Protocol target by gradually bringing
its consumption to zero by 2010. The Montreal Protocol established baseline consumption as the
average of 1995 to 1997 consumption of ODS. In the case of Tunisia, this was 974.4 ODP
tonnes.

The actual value achieved (974.4 ODP tonnes) exceeded the revised target value (854.65 ODP
tonnes) by 14 percent.

80. The objective was achieved through successful demonstrations of new, non-ODS
technologies in the critical sectors of aerosols, refrigeration, and rigid and flexible foam. The
project generally helped companies to replace their ODS-dependent capital production

                                                  18
equipment with more modern versions that could use alternatives to ODS, plus the technical
assistance required to make proper use of the new equipment. A further round of sub-projects
followed on the first, to help bring the gains already realized closer to the national scale.

81. The following table shows the progress achieved in reducing the importation CFCs and
halons into Tunisia over the period 1990-1991.

82. At the same time, the second major component of the project aimed to build the GOT’s
institutional capacity to eliminate ODS nationwide. This component was effective and the
institutions benefitting from this component were able to play their roles effectively as
repositories of knowledge and motivators of changes in industrial behavior. A solid legal and
institutional framework has been established, which allows ANPE to manage the ODS program
effectively. This result affirms that the ozone layer protection program has been fully integrated
into the mainstream of environmental program planning and delivery, and bodes well for
sustaining the results achieved to date.

   a) In accordance with the priorities of the GOT, the Montreal Protocol and its provisions
      have been given the status of domestic law through the adoption of the following laws
      and decrees. Though not all of these may be attributed to the effects of the project, they
      are a good indication of the type of broad-based support that Tunisia has had for the
      project since its inception:

       Law No 89-54 of March 14, 1989 authorizing Tunisia's ratification and adhesion (joining
       the) to the Vienna Convention;

       Law No 89-55 of March 14, 1989 authorizing Tunisia's ratification and adhesion (joining
       the) to the Protocol of Montreal;

       Law No 93-44 of May 3, 1993 authorizing Tunisia's ratification and adherence/adhesion
       to the amended Protocol of Montreal (following the second and third parties meetings in
       London-June 27-29,1990 and Nairobi, June 21,1991;

       Law No 94-72 of June 27, 1994 authorizing Tunisia's ratification and adherence /
       adhesion to the amendment of the Protocol of Montreal (following the fourth parties
       meeting in Copenhagen on November 23 to 25, 1992;

       Law No 99-77 of August 2, 1999 for the ratification of the PM amendments (for ODS)
       adopted during the ninth parties meetings in Montreal on September 15-17, 1997;

       Law No 2004-79 of December 6, 2004 for the approval of the Republic of Tunisia's
       adhesion to the amendment of the Protocol of Montreal for ODS following the eleventh
       parties meeting held in Beijing - November 29-December 3, 1999;

       Decree No 2005-514 of March 7, 2005 for the ratification of the Republic of Tunisia's
       adhesion to the amendment of the Protocol of Montreal for ODS according to Law No
       2004-79.

                                               19
   b) A National Committee has been established that oversees the implementation of the
      Montreal Protocol. A representative of every Ministry of Government sits on this
      Committee. This Committee has a sub-Committee comprised of the six Ministries most
      affected by ODS issues. These include:

           -   Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (the lead Agency) /
               Agence Nationale de Protection de l’Environnement (ANPE);
           -   Ministry of Public Health;
           -   Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources;
           -   Ministry of Industry, Energy and SMEs (small and medium enterprises);
           -   Ministry of Commerce, Arts and Crafts; and,
           -   Ministry of Finance (Customs)

       This sub-committee is supported by the NOB.

   c) The National Ozone Bureau (NOB) was housed at ANPE. It is the facilitation and
      coordination arm of a much broader engagement mechanisms for addressing the
      obligations associated with the ratification of the MP. The activities assigned to the NOU
      are:

           -   expedite implementation of activities for reduction of ODS use and adoption of
               substitute chemicals and technologies;
           -   enhance public awareness of the ozone issues;
           -   if required, utilize economic instruments to cause increases of ODS prices to
               levels where the ODS substitutes become financially attractive;
           -   establish an import quota / licensing system for ODS users;
           -   establish import monitoring procedures and (vi), and;
           -   create a Project Implementation/Management Unit (PIU/PMU).

83. All of the activities, be they financial or purely technical, are part of the overall program of
ANPE. As noted, the recent renewal of the Institutional Strengthening (IS) component under
UNIDO as the new MLF implementing agency will continue to strengthen the country’s MP
program and support the policy reforms currently underway.


Other Factors Attributed to the Achievement of the GEO

84. While the institutional framework and local regulations on ODS has raised awareness of
ODS and contributed to compliance by enterprises with local requirements for e.g. import
procedures, taxation, and disposal, a number of external factors should be considered in
determining causality between project investments, specific component outputs, and global
environmental outcomes.

85. From the outset of the project, it was recognized that due to the very close association of
Tunisian industries with European industries (partnerships, licensing arrangements etc.),

                                                20
European Union policies, regulations and technology replacement choices would likely have a
major impact on the phaseout timing and technology options selected by Tunisia. This, as
expected, did occur, and indeed, contributed to a quicker-than-required phase-down of ODS
consumption.

86. Another key factor influencing project outcomes has been the global phaseout of CFCs,
which has reduced overall supply of CFCs. This trend was mainly driven by the global
implementation of the Montreal Protocol as well as the introduction of less expensive
alternatives in the market. As such, the global supply reduction of CFCs played a significant role
in encouraging enterprises to adopt alternative technologies.

87. The context of global phaseout of ODS raises valid questions about the attributability of the
project results to the project activities. If CFCs and halon were being phased out globally, what
was the incremental contribution of this project to achieving phaseout in Tunisia? One important
consideration to keep in mind is the protection of competitiveness for Tunisia’s industries. In an
environment of global regulatory phaseout, Tunisian industry would certainly have been forced,
sooner or later, to phase them out as well. In that context, the project provided support to help
those industries make the transition more smoothly and reduce any shock to Tunisia’s economy.
A second important consideration is the accelerated timetable on which phaseout was able to be
executed with the accompaniment of this project. In a scenario without the project, industrial
adaptation would likely have taken much longer.

3.3 Efficiency

88. At the time of appraisal, no specific estimates were calculated for the project’s likely
economic rate of return (ERR), net present value (NPV), or financial rate of return (FRR). It is
common among all MP projects, that at the project preparation stage no such analysis is
undertaken. The underlying reason was that MP funded activities involved global public goods
and compensation for external costs as a result of an international treaty obligation.

89. Consistent with the MLF ExCom project approval regime, cost effectiveness is the main
criterion that determines the level of eligible funding for sub-projects. Project cost effectiveness
must fall within pre-established thresholds for different sectors, which means that all approved
MP projects are expected to comply with a pre-set indicator of efficiency. Efficiency is assessed
based on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the phaseout achieved. CE is the amount of MLF grant
per unit weight of ODS phased-out in ODP kg.

90. Full calculations for project CE are presented in Annex 3. They show that the overall actual
CE of the project was better than originally estimated ($3.94/kg vs. $5.04/kg). This overall total,
however, includes some elements which were more cost effective than the estimates, and some
which were less. The two smallest sectors in terms of tonnes of ODP eliminated – refrigeration
and aerosols, at 72 and 50 tonnes, respectively – were both less cost-effective than estimated.
Contrarily, both the rigid and flexible foam sectors were able to achieve better CE than
estimated.




                                                21
91. The performance of three of the four sectors was below the cost-effectiveness thresholds
established by the Montreal Protocol, indicating that they achieved better cost-efficiency than
required. These were refrigeration and both flexible and rigid foam. The CE rating of the
aerosol sub-project exceeded the threshold, indicating that its cost-efficiency did not meet the
required standard.

92. The CE ratings of the project compared favorably with those of other MP projects supported
by the World Bank.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

93. The project has fulfilled the GEO key indicators established and performed beyond
expectations. Tunisia has managed to eliminate ODS within a timeframe similar to other ODS
projects implemented in other country contexts. The project’s concept and design were, and
remains, relevant to Tunisia’s commitment to the full phaseout of ODS as a signatory to the MP,
and Tunisia is currently preparing to eliminate all HCFCs as well (with the support of UNIDO).
The project successfully established a legal and institutional framework which has allowed
ANPE to manage and scale-up ODS phaseout to a national level. This in turn is reflected in the
significant elimination of 974.4 ODP tonnes since project start; and amount substantially larger
than targeted. Total ODS phased out by Tunisia under MLF projects is 1,381 tonnes ODP
including projects implemented by UNIDO.

94. It is nonetheless challenging to determine an overall outcome rating for a project that
spanned 18 years and expanded much beyond its original scope. As discussed above, the
difficulty is further compounded by the fact that the project was part of a global initiative, by
which it was strongly influenced. However, it should be underlined that the program was
designed in this way to allow the incremental achievement of each MP project to create a
synergetic, cumulative effect for the benefit of the global environment.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

95. Overall, the project has resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as
capacity building activities related to this project has imparted valuable skills and experiences on
NOB and its staff – particularly in procurement and financial management. Such skills are easily
transferable to other project management tasks both within NOB and in the GOT at large. In
addition, several workshops and training sessions conducted under IS component, such as



                                                22
training for Customs officers, and drafting of various by-laws governing the quota system and
taxation schemes, have contributed in strengthening relevant institutions.

96. However, the NOB management function has yet to be fully institutionalized with ANPE,
and remains reliant on funding from the IS component for its continued operations.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

97. One of the positively surprising outcomes of the project is that Tunisia has emerged as a
global leader on ODS elimination, with a growing profile in various climate change mitigation
activities. This is further supported by Tunisia’s regional leadership position on environmental
management in North Africa. To this end, Tunisia has been awarded three prizes for the
country’s outstanding commitment to protecting the ozone environment:
        UNDP prize on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol (September
        16, 1997);
        Ozone Secretariat prize (September 16, 2006); and
        UNDP prize on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol (September
        16, 2007).

98. Another unintended positive outcome is the indirect impact that the project has had on
mitigating climate change through reducing global warming potential with an estimated 5.2
million tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) of emissions avoided6.

 Based on phaseout of 560.15 tonnes of CFC-11 with a global warming potential (GWP) factor of 4,750 and 294.50
tonnes of CFC-12 with a GWP factor of 10,900, yielding a total GWP of 5,412,963 tonnes CO2e. A correction
factor of 166,746 tonnes is subtracted from this due to the GWP of alternative substances used, yielding a corrected
GHG reduction of 5,246,217 tonnes CO2e. GWP values used are drawn from the World Meteorological
Organization’s Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006. Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project—

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low to Negligible

99. It is extremely unlikely that industries would revert back to using previous ODS
consuming technologies as CFC technologies are obsolete and alternatives to halon and CFCs
are now more cost-effective. Moreover, global production of CFCs and halon has ceased since
2010. Furthermore, as part of the agreement for each sub-project financed, baseline CFC-using
equipment has been destroyed and sold for scrap metal by the enterprises.

100. With continued political commitment from the GOT and the transfer of the Institutional
Strengthening component to UNIDO, country ownership of and commitment to the project
remains strong. However, continued dependence on funding from the MLF to run the NOB is
cause for concern. While the institutional and legal framework for complete ODS phaseout is
robust, the GOT is strongly encouraged to budget for the cost of sustaining the NOB as an
effective administrative and technical unit under the ANPE. This final step of mainstreaming will
greatly improve overall sustainability of the development outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

101. The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project
was Satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of
project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and
institutional, including procurement and financial management.

102. The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to
ensure quality preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with
the Borrower during preparation and appraisal. The Project Document was finalized in April
1993 and the project became effective one year later, in June 1994.

103. Project preparation was carried out by an experienced Bank team with an adequate
number of specialists who provided the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns.
The team worked effectively with the Montreal Protocol and policy and technical criteria and
guidelines of the MLF. The team worked well with all stakeholders as well as with enterprises
throughout the preparation, appraisal and implementation of sub-projects.

104. The original project document and grant agreement design laid out a fairly simple project
structure that over time proved to be cumbersome in comparison to the level of the original
expected grant (US$ 1.79 million) and as such, did not anticipate the changing basis for and of
MLF assistance at the country and ExCom levels. By the end of the project’s long lifespan, this
resulted in a complicated structure of 16 disbursement categories and 8 project parts. This
understandably led to confusion for both the project teams and the Client, particularly regarding
the correlation of specific sub-projects to disbursement categories. However, these future
changes could not have been anticipated at project conception.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

105. The Bank's overall performance during the entire implementation period is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory due to significant implementation challenges since 2005. While IP
ratings remained solidly Satisfactory or Highly Satisfactory until mid-2007, following the final
transfer of funds from the MLF upon approval of the NOPP the project became increasingly
difficult for the Client to manage given the change in scope from individual sub-projects to a
national ODS phaseout program. This development, which called for even closer Bank
supervision, was confounded by high TTL turnover during the same period and led to a lasting
reduction in supervision quality and in overall implementation performance.



                                               25
106. The project was subject to frequent changes of TTLs throughout its lifespan, which has
affected the quality of supervision. The ICR team has been unable to locate any evidence of
hand-over notes between TTLs, which has likely caused substantial interruptions during
transition periods and stunted the institutional memory over time. Towards the end of the project,
supervision missions became less regular as a result of TTL changes and later due to the political
uprising in Tunisia. The Bank’s engagement with the project decreased over time as the project
was extended multiple times and transferred between departments and TTLs.

107. At critical stages during project implementation, the Bank chose to continue to extend
and fund the project rather than close the project and begin another phase as a new project. This
was not an unusual practice for Montreal Protocol projects managed by the World Bank (e.g. the
Thailand and Philippines ODS projects were 19 and 17 years long, respectively). An increasing
number of activities were incorporated into the existing project, causing supervision to get
increasingly difficult as the component categories no longer reflected the actual activities. The
problem was that the 1997 and 2007 amendments made changes to the Part B categories. As the
GA was simply amended, not enough time was spent explaining to the Client the structure and
where to record expenditures for the different parts. In fact, the categories did reflect the
activities planned, including the NOPP and the second phase, but they were cumbersome since
there were 16 disbursement categories.

108. This cumbersome structure and the lack of communication following GA amendments
did lead to incomprehension and frustration on the part of the Client. During the ICR mission,
the Client expressed dissatisfaction with the qualitative input from the Bank team in the later
stages of implementation. Specifically, the Client referred to supervision missions as fulfilling a
“watchdog? function and not as a partnership in which the Bank contributed value-added to
enhancing the project performance; a notion previously pointed out in the QAG Review.

109. On a positive note, NOB staff managed to build and strengthen a local implementation
capacity with regard to procurement of goods and works, selection of consultants, accounts and
audits, as stipulated in the Grant Agreement.

110. QAG Review: The project was subject to a review by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) during implementation. The QAG review assigned a Supervision rating of “moderately
unsatisfactory?. An overview of the QAG review is summarized in the table below.

Frequent changes of TTL and low task team continuity              There appears to be a disconnect between the low rating given
between supervision missions had a negative influence on the      by the panel and the fact that the Bank is meeting its fiduciary
quality of supervision.                                           and safeguard requirements, the DO is being sustainably
                                                                  achieved, and both Client and donor are satisfied with the
                                                                  results.
Incomplete supervision documents.                                 Supervision transaction costs are exceedingly high for a small,
                                                                  grant based project. However, in the period under review the
                                                                  project was discussed as part of the June 2003 CPPR and there

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

112. Based on the Bank’s performance during project preparation and supervision as discussed
above, overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory by this ICR. While the
Bank provided reliable policy and technical advice during the 18 years of project
implementation, a number of factors as discussed above, related especially to project
supervision, impacted the Bank’s overall performance. Project implementation was challenged
by frequent changes in task team leadership, which affected supervision quality, institutional
memory, and possibly the Client’s implementation performance. Furthermore, the Bank failed to
take advantage of several opportunities to ensure that approved activities would remain aligned
with the project objectives either through a proper restructuring or by closing the project and
starting a new phase in a separate project. However, it is important to keep in perspective that the
project objective has been met and the outcomes exceeded the set targets. This is partly due to a
well-conceived and diligently prepared project design and partly due to the Bank’s leadership on
global environmental issues and commitment to deepening a long-standing Client relation with
the GOT.


5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

113. Government performance, rated across the spectrum of the project’s full implementation
period is Satisfactory. Strong and unwavering political support as evident in the adoption of local
legislation to underpin the objectives of the MP has contributed to creating an enabling
environment for NOB to fulfill its mandate. Positive inter-departmental and inter-ministerial
cooperation has allowed Tunisia to fulfill its commitment to phaseout of ODS consumption in
accordance with the MP control schedule. Ministries and agencies involved through the National
Committee, which was established to oversee the implementation of the MP, such as the
Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources, Ministry of Industry, Energy and SMEs and the Ministry of Finance (Customs) and
others, all played a role in ensuring the adoption of a comprehensive policy framework, and
supporting regulations, for ODS phaseout, in building national capacity to comply with the
objectives of a multilateral environmental agreement, and in promoting awareness about the
importance of protection of the ozone layer.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

114. Through implementation of the Institutional Strengthening component, NOB was
successful in enabling the country to implement the Montreal Protocol. This included ratification

                                                28
of all four MP amendments and the issuance of national ODS regulation. NOB also introduced a
licensing and import quota system, considered within the MP community to be the single most
important piece of legislation to control ODS consumption. Such milestones were achieved by
fostering inter-agency cooperation and promoting the importance of the ozone issue from an
environmental, economic and human health perspective. NOB diligently fulfilled the data
reporting requirements, and provided effective education in both the public and private sectors
about ozone protection and related GOT policy.

115. However, implementation performance suffered from several short-comings. On one
hand, the project benefitted from having in place a consistent and dedicated project management
team, who has served the project since its inception. On the other hand, with a highly centralized
project implementation unit in NOB the need for a more transparent and accountable institutional
set-up has sometimes been called for.

116. During the ICR mission, the Bank team visited several companies to assess their project
experience. These companies were in Greater Tunis and are specialized in foams. Most
expressed satisfaction with the technological changes instituted under the auspices of the project.
In some instances, it was mentioned that upon delivery of new technology and equipment, a lack
of follow-up had left some enterprises without any implementation support. Another challenge
which is seen in other projects too, is that sub-project expenditures were not carefully tracked in
an electronic system.

117. The representatives of these companies expressed their strong commitment to the
protection of the ozone layer and said that all their teams had received adequate training through
the project. These companies have cited the project as an important factor in their subsequent
success.

118. These noted issues are not captured in the ISRs or AMs available to the ICR team. One of
the challenges the World Bank project team had in the last 4 years of project implementation was
the Client’s reluctance to facilitate supervision missions’ visits to the previous beneficiaries. The
last two World Bank project teams did not receive adequate support from the implementing
agency because of an apparent reluctance to share key information about the overall ODS
program in Tunisia. Insistence by the World Bank team on improving contact with their direct
counterparts was only sporadically successful in ameliorating the situation, and greater use of
higher official channels7 did not yield a lasting, satisfactory outcome.

119. Towards the very end of the project, the NOB’s procurement performance was
unsatisfactory with a number of problems encountered. This caused the project to close with a
large undisbursed balance.

 The June 2011 supervision mission attempted to set a meeting with ANPE senior management, seeking to raise the
profile of the dialogue on ozone-related issues broader environmental challenges in Tunisia as means of preserving
a sustained and consistent engagement. However, the meeting was not granted.

120. Based on the above, NOB’s performance throughout the entire project period is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

121. Based on the Borrower’s performance in both the Government and the Implementing
Agency as discussed above, overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned


122. The Bank’s leadership at the sector level was a critical success factor during
implementation: Past ODS phaseout projects have been characterized by their lengthy durations,
as compared to normal Bank lending, with several projects in the portfolio having being effective
for 15 years or longer. MP projects have been governed by a separate Operations Policy / Bank
Procedure (OP/BP) since the start of the program to allow for a unique umbrella funding
mechanism in which the MLF ExCom meets three times a year to approve individual projects
and sub-projects at the enterprise level; taking into account the evolving ODS phaseout
requirements. This structure has been difficult to align with a typical Bank project cycle, and has
led to the project being amended several times through Level 2 Restructuring to extend the grant
closing date and to raise the grant ceiling, as well as to make slight changes to broaden the
project’s phaseout scope. This was done to accommodate the particular demands of the MLF as
the Bank remained committed to its Clients that depended on continued, uninterrupted flows of
MLF financing to fulfill their obligations under the MP.

123. This has required extraordinary support and leadership from Sector Managers and
Directors over the years to defend ODS projects despite their perceived poor performance. In
the words of one Sector Manager: “These projects are not ordinary projects and should be looked
at differently in terms of quality management. There is almost a case for moving them out of the
exception report since they unnecessarily create the impression that the region is lenient with
extensions.? Such informed leadership and unwavering support demonstrated the Bank’s
flexibility and responsiveness to the Client’s needs, and a commitment to fulfill the Bank’s
responsibilities as an MLF implementing agency. This flexibility was not only appreciated by the
Client, but also allowed the program of ODS elimination to continue and evolve to meet
changing needs over an atypically long period; without this willingness to accept extensions of
the GA and increases in its ceiling, the project would likely not have succeeded in achieving the
positive outcomes that it did. As noted elsewhere, however, the project structure should also be
adjusted in parallel to preserve operational effectiveness. The lesson could be applied across a
broad range of operation types. The OP/BP provides for this umbrella structure to take into
account the more frequent ExCom approvals and evolving ODS phaseout requirements. In
future, MP projects will no longer be so long because MLF ExCom has changed the project
modality to sector/national based support (program level) tied to permanent, aggregate
reductions.

124. “Mission creep? can be mitigated through regular reviews: By modifying the original
project objective and extending the grant agreement and its ceiling, the opportunity and scope for
ODS impact widened in a changing environment that was becoming more favorable to ODS
controls. As a result, the project activities increased in scope and became the main mechanism
through which Tunisia aspired to achieve its MP obligations instead of a means to demonstrate
technologies for wider adoption. As such, the Tunisia ODS project experienced “mission creep?:
it went from being a technical demonstration project to being the primary vehicle for the national
ODS elimination agenda, without a corresponding adjustment in the project’s objectives. This
kind of “creep? would and should be detected by more regular review of the proper correlation
between activities and objectives.

                                                31
125. The lack of any formal evaluation of project performance until the ICR has left inherent
weaknesses and performance issues undiscovered for too long. In future, regular mid-term
reviews should be held, and sector units should strongly consider the option of a series of
programmatic or repeater projects to carry out a long mandate such as this. Such an approach
would allow regular opportunities to reassess the project design and objectives and would help to
ensure that a large gap does not develop between the intended purpose of the project and its
actual activities. This lesson is widely applicable across the Bank portfolio, but in most cases
regular review is already in place and prevents “mission creep? from reaching the very large
proportions it reached in the case of this project.

126. The Bank needs to communicate proactively and early when procedures change: One of
the key challenges during such a prolonged project is the on-going evolution of the Bank’s
procedures. This meant that a number of evolving procedures had to be retrofitted to the existing
project, which was quite challenging for the task team and also for the counterpart and required
adaptation on the part of both the Client and the Bank to achieve effective project
implementation. One clear example is the procurement plan which was not required until the last
2-3 years of the project’s lifespan. The introduction of the requirement for a procurement plan
caused enough friction between the task team and the counterpart that it became a point of
contention in the debriefing of the 2011 mission with the Ministry of International Cooperation.
The lesson is that in long-lived projects, early and proactive communication to the Client of
upcoming changes in administrative procedures is an important task that falls to the task team.
This is also an important relationship management consideration, as it helps the Client to feel
like more of a partner who participates in long-term change than an outsider who receives it as a
fait accompli. This lesson is relevant to other Montreal Protocol projects and to series of
repeater projects with a single counterpart.

127. Long-term Bank involvement in capacity building can deliver very good results: Through
the MP project, ANPE has developed significant capacity in the area of procurement and
financial management. This expertise is easily transferable to other projects executed by ANPE
as well as across agencies as staff may move to new positions. This was one of the benefits of the
long project lifespan, and might be an important consideration in the design of new projects. This
was a unique laboratory in which the Bank was able to accompany an implementing agency from
an embryonic state to full maturity over a long time frame, and it shows the value of long-term
engagement and cooperation. This lesson may be helpful to retain in considering future
programmatic approaches with a single counterpart in other areas of the Bank’s portfolio.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

128. At the time of appraisal, no specific estimates were calculated for the project’s likely
economic rate of return (ERR), net present value (NPV), or financial rate of return (FRR). It is
common among all MP projects, that at the project preparation stage no such analysis is
undertaken. The underlying reason was that MP funded activities involved global public goods
and compensation for external costs as a result of an international treaty obligation.

129. Consistent with the MLF ExCom project approval regime, cost effectiveness is the main
criterion that determines the level of eligible funding for subprojects. Project cost effectiveness
must fall within pre-established thresholds for different sectors, which means that all approved
MP projects are expected to comply with a pre-set indicator of efficiency. Efficiency is assessed
based on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the phaseout achieved. CE is the amount of MLF grant
per unit weight of ODS phased-out in ODP kg. CE values at sub-project approval and closure are
presented below by sector.

130. These numbers show that the overall actual CE of the project was better than originally
estimated ($3.94/kg vs. $5.04/kg). This overall total, however, includes some elements which
were more cost effective than the estimates, and some which were less. The two smallest sectors
in terms of tonnes of ODP eliminated – refrigeration and aerosols, at 72 and 50 tonnes,
respectively – were both less cost-effective than estimated. Contrarily, both the rigid and
flexible foam sectors were able to achieve better CE than estimated.

  Note: this table includes data only for those sub-projects which would eliminate a nonzero amount of ODP. Some
sub-projects under the “institutional strengthening? component did not project the elimination of any ODP. For this
reason, total funds disbursed shown in this table is less than the total funds disbursed for the project overall.

131. The performance of three of the four sectors was below the cost-effectiveness thresholds
established by the Montreal Protocol9, indicating that they achieved better cost-efficiency than
required. These were refrigeration and both flexible and rigid foam. The CE rating of the
aerosol sub-project exceeded the threshold, indicating that its cost-efficiency did not meet the
required standard. Note that the threshold values used for this comparison are those available as
of the latest revision prior to ICR completion: July 2012. The threshold values in effect at the
time of sub-project implementation may have been different.

132. The CE ratings of the project compared favorably with those of other MP projects
supported by the World Bank. The following table shows CE ratings for a selection of other
