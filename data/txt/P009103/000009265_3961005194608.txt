MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE DIRECTOR
OF THE COUNTRY DEPARTMENT
TO THE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Global Environmental Trust (GET) grant to the Ukraine for 400,000 SDR, the equivalent of US$
500,000, to finance a project to protect the endangered ecosystems in the Eastern Carpathian
Biosphere Reserve of Ukraine and its adjacent buffer zones.
Background
2.    Seven ecological communities transect Ukraine: European broadleafed forests, the northern taiga,
the interior steppe, semi-and sands and marshes near the B3lack and Azov Seas, the seaside littor&a
estuaries of large rivers such as the Dnieper, and the sub-tropical pine and chaparral of Crimea. The
forest sector of Ukraine (10 million ha, 14 perceat of the land area) is under great envirownental stress,
impacted by poor forestry and agricultural practices and, in some areas, by air pollution. The East
Carpathian mountains are a significant part of this forest resource and are recognized as a key center of
andemism. Steps to protect the area are urgently required.
3.    The Government and the World Bank are presentty finalizing a Joint Environmental Study. This
study included a review of nature reserve and park management needs in the country. Tne establishment
of reserves for the protection of unique natural ecosystems and genetic resources of plant and animals is
an important challenge recognized by the Government of Ukraine1. The network of protected areas
includes 15 strict nature reserves (Zapovedniki), 3 National Parks, 2 Biosphere Reserves and many other
protected landscapes, zoological and botanic gardens and other locally significant reserves. Some 2
percent of the country is under some form of nature protection.
4. The Government is also restructuring its national forest management plans. Tirmber cutting is
prohibited on 30 percent of the forested areas. The government is taking measures to strengthen the
management of the forests and also to extend forest cover in the country.
S.    The Eastern Carpathian Mountains along the borders of the Slovak Republic, Poland and Ukraine
contain some of the least disturbed ecosystems in Eastern Europe. The Carpathians contain one quarter
of the flora of Europe and many endemic and medicinal plants useful to mankind. The largest remaining
European stand (10,900 ha) of virgin beech forest is standing in the Carpathians. This is a remarkable
naural resource for the rest of Europe, which has lost such undisurbed areas. A part of the East
Carpathians has been formally designated by Ukraine as the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve under the
UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program.
6.    Carpathians Biosphere Reserve The Ukinian Carpathians contain unique preserved areas of
beech and spruce forests of significance for analyzing the development history of the East Carpathians
vegetation. The first reserve of beech and fir-beech forests was created in 1932 on the Stuzica mountain
slopes. Since that time the Reserve has been enlarged to 2,952 ha and included in the Ukrainian
Carpathians Biosphere Reserve (CBR). The CBR was creatd in 1991 with a total area of 38,930 ha,
which is subdivided into a reserve zone (21,879 ha), a buffer zone (8,949 ha), and a conservative nature
management zone (8,071 ha). The reserve zone includes the Stuzica scenic reserve, and four separately

located forest or alpine areas. These areas are the Khust massif, the Ugolsko-Shyrokoluy Lansky Massif,
the Chornogirs'ky massif and the Maramoros'ky massif.
Rationale for GEF Involvement
7.    The GEF project has been accorded high priority by the Government. However, funds are not
ava!1able in Ukraine to carry out the work proposed here The Government does not want to borrow
external resources for it at market rates of interest. The GEF project would provide the Government with
urgently needed support to assess and redress the environmental damage to Ukraine's forests.
8.   Tne Eastern Carpathians share transboundary ecosystems. The programs developed for their
integrated m2nagement will be of international utility. The global significance of the areas initially
selected is confirmed and supported by their designations by UNESCO and the World Wildlife Fund
(International), being identified among the "existing ecological bricks" of Europe.
9.    This project will constitnte a contribution to the GEF Portfolio. In its efforts to preserve global
biodiversity, the GEF will encounter more of the transboundary issues being addressed in this project.
It will also frequently encomnter the need to balance in-situ and ex-sltu preservation with innovative
techniques. It will, in particular, face the conflicting demands of a resident population which can be
either a force for further eroding biodiversity or a potent ally in its preservation. In these ways, the
progress of this project will be germane to ongoing activities of the GEF and have utility as a case study
in trying to incorporate community participaiton.
Project Objective
10.   The objectives of this project are to:
(a)   Incorporate this small Ukrainian GEF project ($500,000) as an add-on to the proposed
Slovak Biodiversity Protection Project (GEF $2.3 million). The innovation being
supported under the Ukrainian project is threefold: this would be the first GEF project
in the Ukraine, the first trilateral transboundary project supported under the GEP, and
the first three-country Trust Fund to be organized for biodiversity protection. The
MacArthur Foundation of Chicago, Illinois is willing to contribute $30'v,000 to initiate
this Carpathian Biodiversity Protection Trust Fund.
(b)    Support the Ukrainian portion of the overall trilateral effort (Ukraine, Poland and Slovak)
to protect habitat fragments, stop species loss and upgrade habitat management.
(c)    Develop and implement the legal, institutional and administrative interventions to achieve
the long term protection of the area in Ukraine as well as the abutting zones in Poland
and the Slovak Republic.

11.   The project would start with an ecological perspective and includes both ln-sfu and ex-sti
components to conserve biodiversity. This would entail a program approach involving scientific study
of the flora and fauna of the selected key endangered forests, induding threats to their viability from
human pressures, and developing options to ensure the conservation of species considered at risk.
Modem approaches of conservation biology and restoration ecology will be used to iJentify key
management measures. These measures will include the identification of minimum viable populations
and cri,ical habitats and establishment of wildlife corridors or linked areas of modified land use which
will firffier enhance biodiversity protection objectives called for by the GEF.
Project Description
12.   The GEF operation would support Ukraine's effort to protect its forest ecosysten-s. Seletion of
the parks, reserves and zones under the proposed project are based on agreed conservation priorities.
Project investments include:
(a)    a Biodiversity Protection Program that will initiate a range of activities including:
inventory (biological and geographical), a systems extinction model, genetic studies, GIS
critical habitat analysis and a Teans Carpathian Planning Group. The program will
include the development of a national policy on incentives and easements for select land
uses which buffer the protected areas. To ensure the longer term maint- s;ance of some
of these innovative approaches, a plan and curriculum will be developed for the inclusion
of the study of conservation biology in the tertiary forestry curricula, as forestry is the
base qualification for most of the mountain naural resource managers;
(b)    a Management Resources Program  to enable coordinated management of the
discontinuous reserved areas of the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve and the
implementation of the above protection program. These investments will include: (i)
computer equipment and GIS facilities, (Ji) provision of transport and communications
for e iforcement, protection and management, and (iii) limited assistance with
demonstration activities;
(c)    a Training Program that will include development of communications skldls (extension,
public education, interpretation and media relations), language training, data base and
computer training, park planning and management training; and,
(d)    a Management Program that will include assistance to support a joint Ukraine GEP unit
(both for the Danube Delta GEF and this project) within the Department of Protected and
Recreation Areas and the establishment of a small Project Unit at the administrative
center in Uzghorod.

Actons Agreed
13.   Daring negotiations on the Grant Agreement, assurances were obtained as follows:
(a)    Grant Effectiveness.  Tbe grant would be declared effective upon submission of
documentation satisfactory to the Bank that the Project Coordinator in Kiev and the
Project Manager in Uzghorod has been appointed.
(b)    Accounts. A special account would be established in a commercial bank for the project
prior to disbursement of the grant. This account would be audited annually by an
auditing firm acceptable to the Bank.
(c)    Pro%ct Management. A Project Coordination Unit (Ministry of Environment, Kiev)
and a Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve at
Uzghorod would be established prioi to disbursement of the grant.
Benefits
14.   Tne principal benefit is to protect a substantial zone of international ecological importance. The
Eastern Carpathian forests of Poland, Ukraine and Slovak are unique in Europe and a source of endemic
biodiversity.
15.   Innovation is fostered by the integration of the various levels of biological diversity (species,
population, landscape, habitat) to address issues in conservation planning (as described above).
Technically, the project will break new ground in the development of the preservation of genetic material
and in the applications of GIS and simplified methods of digital processing. It is also fostered by the
unique (for Ukraine) collaboration of grc :ps from a variety of interests in addition to foresters in issues
of forest planning and management, for me balancing of ex-situ with In-situ approaches to biodiversity
conservation, and by the use of consultation at the local level in the identification of viable land use
compatible with the preservation of endangered natural systems.
16.   The project is designed for sustainability. The long-term viability is achieved through the
building of institutions within Ukraine, including some which are relatively disenfranchised but important
to biodiversity such as the forestry and Protected Reserve Managements. Other facets that are designed
to ensure a project legacy are the training and professional development components. The goal of
sustainable revenue generation activities based on consultation w th residents who would engage in these
activities is another way of ensuring longevity of interventions. These activities are premised on their
compatibility with the preservation of biediversity. They include nature and culture-based tourism, the
selling of minor forest products, harvest.ng game, balancing uneven-aged, small-scale forest production
with natural regeneration, and other economically sound and environmentally compatible activities.
17.   There is a demonstration value and replicability through the use of integrated planning, new
technologies, and bilateral organizational structures that foster international resource management
approaches. This GEF project is going to foster solutions for conserving biodiversity. As a test of this
approach to regional issues in biodiversity, the project can have significant demonstration value.



-5^
Risks
18.   The major risks are primarily technical ard managerial. The technical risk is that the basic
approach to biodiversity protection in the Eastern Carpathians protected areas be further delayed, resulting
in continuing degradation of the biodiversity ecosystem. The managerial risk is that Government salaries
are extremely low resulting in the departure of top scientists and technicians expected to manage and
implement the project from the service of the government and research institute. The project would
mitigate these risks by implementing this project in late 1993, 1994 ane 1995 to initiate this protection
program and by providing funding to support the work of the key scientists and technicians working on
the project. Mitigation of the risks would also be achieved by the monitoring and evaluation procedures
built into the terms of reference for the Project Management who will be reporting on a quarterly basis.
Additionally, quality and control will be ac}ieved by the proposed small secretariat located at Uzghorod
which would work closely with the Polish and Slovak units in the Eastern Carpathians to jointly foster
its UNESCO designation as a "Man and the Biosphere" Reserve (MaB). There are built-in quality control
and monitoring elements because of the research that will be published in peer-reviewed journals of
international quality.
Environmental Assessment
19.   The project has been reviewed by the Regional Environment Division and it has been placed in
the environment screening category "C".
Recommendation
20.   1 am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply wih the provisions of Resolution No. IBRD
91-5 of the Executive Directors relating to the establishment of the Global Environment Facility and
recommend that the Regional Vice President, Europe and Central Asia Region, approve~ it.
