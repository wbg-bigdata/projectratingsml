 IRAQ: HOUSEHOLD SURVEY AND POLICIES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT
  (P098979 AND P121754): TF056441 (RECIPIENT-EXECUTED) AND TF056442 (BANK-
                     EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF RECIPIENT)
                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER

                   Extension of Closing Dates for TF056441 and TF056442

1.      This is a Level II restructuring to extend the closing date for Iraq: HOUSEHOLD
SURVEY AND POLICIES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION with two project codes P098979
(Recipient-Executed) and P121754 (Technical Assistance), and the two Trust Funds associated
with the respective projects – TF056441 (Recipient-executed) and TF056442 (Bank-executed on
behalf of the recipient) – from September 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2.     The extension of the closing dates of TF056441 is necessary to ensure that the project
continues to provide logistical support to the continued implementation and completion of the
second Iraq Household and Socio-economic Survey (IHSES-2). This survey was launched on
January 16, 2012 and will be in the field until January 2013. Of the total Trust Fund amount of
US$ 7 million, US$ 5,951,540.71 has been disbursed to-date. The commitments of US$
1,048,459.29 will be sufficient to finance all remaining activities.

3.      The extension of the closing date of TF056442 is necessary to ensure that the World
Bank has sufficient time to deliver technical assistance (TA) activities and build capacity for
relevant policy analysis of data and production of the poverty estimates and their determinants,
which will feed into the formulation of the second PRS in 2013. The need for extension arises
from the delays in forming a government after the 2010 election, which slowed down the
functioning of the government, as well as security concerns impacting on the ability to conduct
field activities. The remaining TA activities will consist of a series of workshops (4-5 in total)
on poverty analysis and links of the PRS to the budget, along with ongoing technical support to
the Government of Iraq (GoI) counterparts as the survey is fielded and raw data comes back in to
the counterpart agencies. Of the total amount of US$ 5.1 million in TF056442, US$5,008,389.70
has been disbursed to-date. Commitments amount to US$91,556.57 and available balance is
US$53.73. Additional resources are being sought separately.
5.      The Project has already demonstrated significant impacts, through financing of technical
assistance to allow the Government to carry out the IHSES-1 in 2007. On the basis of this
survey, the Iraqi authorities developed an official poverty line, which was adopted by the
Council of Ministers in 2010, creating a shared metric for future policymaking and program
planning. In-depth poverty analysis was carried out, and following a process of broad-based
deliberation and consultation, Iraq developed its first PRS, which was adopted by Parliament in
June 2010.

6.      This track record and the commitment of the Iraqi counterparts are also manifested in the
current implementation progress of IHSES-2, which has successfully completed nearly half of
the fieldwork for data collection. In a visit to Washington in April 2012, a high-level delegation
expressed eagerness to continue to build on the TA delivered and to upgrade the skill set of their
team with the vision of becoming self-sufficient for the next round of IHSES.

7.      TF056441 and TF056442 continue to be Highly Satisfactory in both IP and DO ratings
(all other ratings are either Highly Satisfactory or Satisfactory as of the last ISR of June 2012).
There is no change in the project development objectives for the associated projects and no
change in the institutional and other arrangements for the recipient executed activities from those
described in the last project paper dated June 22, 2010. The project objectives continue to be
achievable. The performance of the recipient and project implementing agency is satisfactory.

8.     A specific Action Plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project has been discussed
and agreed upon with the Borrower and is also attached.

9.      There are no outstanding audits under the projects, and the previous audit reports have
been found satisfactory to the Bank. The performance of the Project Management team is
Satisfactory. The Results Framework with the revised target end date is attached in Annex 1.

10. This will be the fourth and final extension of the closing date.
