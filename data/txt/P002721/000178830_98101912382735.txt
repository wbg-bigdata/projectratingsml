I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has requested
the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kuwait Fund,
the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the OPEC Special Fund, the
Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) and the Bank to help finance a pulp and paper
project near Mufindi in South-central Tanzania (Map IBRD 13486). The total
financing required for the project is estimated at US$252 million, of which
about US$194 million (or 77%) will be in foreign excharnge. A Bank loan of
US$30 million and an IDA credit also of US$30 million are proposed. Addi-
tionally, a SKr 200 million (US$45 million) grant, a DM 67 million (US$34
million) grant, a KD 5 million (US$18 million) loan, a US$20 million equiv-
alent loan, a US$10.5 million equivalent loan, and a US$12.5 million loan
are being considered by SIDA, KfW, the Kuwait Fund, CDC, the OPEC Special
Fund and NIB respectively.
1.02      The project consists of a fully integrated puilp and paper mill to
produce 60,000 metric tons per annum of industrial papers, newsprint and
cultural papers. The project would also supply about 1,400 tons of pulp
annually to a small paper mill in Dar es Salaam. Bank involvement in the
project commenced in 1974 when the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Programme began the
preparation of the Sao Hill forestry project. Subsequently, the Bank approved
a loan of US$7.0 million 1/ to finance industrial plant:ations at Sao Hill to
provide wood for sawmills and a pulp and paper plant. In late 1974 a study
of the pulp and paper mill project started under the auspices of the Tanzania
National Development Corporation (NDC) with a grant from SIDA. The study was
executed by Jaakko Poyry and Company (Poyry), a well-known Finnish firm of
forest industry consultants, with the technical support and assistance of the
Swedish State Pulp and Paper Company (Aktiebolaget Statens Skogsindustrier -
ASSI). Early in 1978, NDC entered into agreements withi Sandwell Management
Consultants, Ltd. of Canada (Sandwell) to act as Project Managers, and with
Poyry to act as Project Engineers. With overall guidance from ASSI these
organizations have completed a detailed technical review of the project and
prepared up-to-date capital cost estimates 2/.
1.03      The project was preappraised in August 1976 on the basis of a
feasibility study by Poyry dated July 1976 (revised in January 1977).
The project was appraised in October 1977 by a mission comprising repre-
sentatives of the SIDA, KfW and the Bank. The Bank mission consisted of
Messrs. Andrew J. Ewing and Philippe Lietard of the Industrial Projects
Department, and Mr. Christian E. Keil of the Agriculture and Rural Develop-
ment Department. This Appraisal Report incorporates the results of the sub-
sequent technical review and cost estimate update undertaken by Poyry and
Sandwell in mid-1978, which were reviewed by all of the potential financing
institutions.

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   Industrial Setting
2.01      At independence in 1961, Tanzania had an extremely limited indus-
trial sector dominated by private firms. Three major developments have
characterized the sector 1/ since that time: rapid expansion, an impressive
diversification in products, and a major shift in ownership from private to
public hands. The contribution of manufacturing to GDP had more than doubled
by 1976 as the number of jobs in the industrial sector tripled. Furthermore,
the limited range of products produced in 1961 has been significantly expanded
as new plants producing a wide range of consumer goods and some intermediate
and capital goods were completed. Finally, following the Arusha Declaration
in 1967, the Government systematically transferred the control and ownership
of the large private and foreign-owned industrial enterprises to publicly-owned
parastatals. By 1974, the public sector accounted for about half of manufactur-
ing value-added and employment. Presently, four ministries control 17 holding
companies which have a total of 97 subsidiaries in various productive sectors.
It must, however, be noted that the private sector still remains an important
participant in industry (430 of 500 factories with over 10 employees are in
private hands).
B.   Performance and Problems
2.02      Aggregate manufacturing production grew rapidly between the mid-
sixties and the onset of the economic crisis in 1974. The average annual
real growth of the manufacturing sector was 7.8% between 1964-75 compared
to an average growth rate of 4.8% for total GDP.   While this record of in-
creasing output would seem to indicate satisfactory industrial performance,
a detailed analysis of Tanzania's manufacturing sector indicates that pro-
ductivity has been low and output has been far less than warranted by the
level of investment.
2.03      The problems underlying the suboptimal performance in the sector
are many. At the macro level, the Government has not yet developed the ad-
ministrative capability to effectively monitor and coordinate the operations
of the control systems which iwere instituted along with the increased public
ownership of manufacturing entLerprises. Important components of this control
system include centralized decision-making on investments, detailed alloca-
tions of foreign exchange through import licensing, an extensive regime of
price controls and rules of procedure operated by the National Pricing Com-
mission, and wage-setting by the Permanent Labor Tribunal and the Government.
1/   For a more detailed analysis of the structure, performance, problems,
and prospects of Tanzania's industrial sector, see the Bank's report:
"Tanzania Industrial and Mining Sector Survey" No. 647-TA, March 31,
1975, and "Tanzania Basic Economic Report: Annex V" entitled "Industry:
Perspective and Strategic Choices", No. 1616-TA, December 1977.



-3-
While the Government feels these controls are needed to achieve its develop-
ment goals, their effect has largely been to insulate public enterprises from
the discipline of market forces. At the micro level, two additional sets
of problems operate. First, performance indicators consistent with the
macro control systems and clear guidelines for evaluating performance are
still lacking. Managers and workers, therefore, have few motivating in-
centives in Tanzania. Second, there is not only a scarcity of trained
managerial personnel and skilled labor, but also most enterprises have to
live with periodic shortages of other key inputs.
2.04      These issues have been raised in various Bank reports on the
Tanzanian industrial sector. The Government is well aware of them and
considerable discussion has taken place among Tanzanian economic and enter-
prise managers on possible solutions. The Bank Group has participated
in these discussions within the context of both general economic work and
specific projects in the industrial sector and the Government has recently
begun pragmatically addressing these issues. In particular, it has insti-
tuted a number of trial incentive schemes, reduced staff in overmanned
parastatals, placed an 8% limit on allowable increases in overhead costs
of manufacturing firms which approach the National Price Commission for price
increases, and hired foreign consultant groups to advise on operational/mana-
gerial improvements for the subsidiaries and associate firms of the major
industrial holding company, the National Develoment Corporation (NDC). In a
major recent development the Government has welcomed private participation in
small and medium scale industry. There is already evidence that this move has
stimulated considerable interest in the sector.
C.   Basic Industrial Strategy and the Third Five-Year Plan (1977-81)
2.05      Future development of the sector will be based on the Basic
Industrial Strategy adopted by the Government in 1974. The two main goals
of this strategy are structural transformation and self-reliance and its main
emphasis is on the use of domestic resources for domestic needs. This involves
giving top priority in investment allocations to industries supplying (i) basic
needs of food, shelter, health, education and transport, and (ii) producer
goods which contribute to production of a wide range of industrial products.
However, as it has emerged, the strategy will also permit expansion of export-
oriented production, especially that based on domestic raw materials (for
example cashew processing, sisal spinning, textile manufacture, and meat and
leather processing). A potential problem with the Basic Industrial Strategy
is that attempts to restructure the economy too quickly during this period of
resource stringency may ultimately frustrate both growth and structural change.
A too rapid expansion of particular sectors may lead to excessive reliance on
external finance, know-how and markets, and the massive investment coordination
required by the strategy may overburden the country's already weak planning
capacity. Moreover, effective implementation of the strategy will require
specific changes in the macro policy framework toward a protection and tariff
structure which does not discriminate against backward linkage import substi-
tution and does not discourage domestic production of capital goods or confer
high and widely varying effective rates of protection to the producton of
consumer goods.

2.06      The Third Five-Year Plan (1977-81) envisages an investment program
of about T Sh 23 billion, of which about 27% will go to manufacturing. 1/
Projects earmarked for development and implementation under the Plan are
mainly based on Tanzania's domestic resources. Among the sizeable public
sector industrial projects currently under implementation with Bank Group
support are the industrial complex at Morogoro, several cashewnut processing
factories, the textile mill expansion at Mwanza, and a new textile mill at
Morogoro. In addition, NDC is presently implementing a number of other major
projects, including a tannery, a canvas mill, a bicycle plant, a farm imple-
ments factory, a detergents factory, and a pharmaceutical plant. The textile
plant at Morogoro was recently approved for Bank/IDA financing. 2/
D.   Small-Scale Industry
2.07      The overall responsibility for small-scale industry development
has been given to the Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO).
SIDO's activities include providing technical and managerial consultancy
services, establishing industrial estates, conducting training programs,
providing marketing services and supplying machinery on a hire-purchase
basis. SIDO's performance thus far has been mixed: in some areas impressive
work has been done while in others little progress has been made. Specifically,
while its project preparation skills are satisfactory, its impact on overcom-
ing managerial and marketing problems is less so. One major issue which faces
the Government is the coordination of SIDO's work with other participants in
small-scale industry. The Bank Group has become involved in a pilot effort in
the sector under the Second National Sites and Services Project 3/ and anti-
cipates working closely with the Government in attempting to address these
problems.
E.   Forest Resources and Industries
2.08      About one half of the total area of Tanzania, i.e., about 44.4
million hectares (ha) is classified as natural forest, the greater part of
which is open woodland. There are 540 forest reserves totaling 13 million
ha (or about 30% of the forest area) which serve as a source of wood and
wood products, and as catchment areas. These forests, however, particularly
the savanna (niombo) woodlands, have a low stocking of merchantable timber
and are so widely scattered that prospects for their economic utilization
and development are poor, except for small quantities of valuable hardwood
for export of veneers and plywood and more significantly to meet the large
domestic demand for fuelwood.
2.09      In addition to the naltural forest, there are 42,000 ha of soft-
wood exotic plantations and 6,000 ha of hardwood plantations. The past
planting program has averaged 4,000 ha per year, and this is expected to
1/   Of the amount proposed for manufacturing investment, it is envisaged
that approximately 70% would be for large-scale projects.

increase to 5,600 ha per year during the 1975-80 period. The plantations
cover a very small area of the country, but in the future are expected to
supply most of the timber required for forest industriLes. These plantation
areas, located along the recently built TanZam highway, have come within
relatively easy reach of the country's main consumer centers and the main
port of Dar es Salaam.
2.10      Total wood consumption3 estimated as 34 milLion  3 in 1973, is
expected to rise to 37 million m in 1980 and 48 million m by the year 2000.
More than 95% of this total wood consumption comprises fuelwood. The demand
for industrial wood and wood-basid material (mainly for sawnwood and paper and
paperboard), currently 500,000 m , is expected to almost double by 1980 and
to reach 3 million m by the year 2000.
2.11      Tanzania has not yet developed a sizeable forest industry.  In
addition to pit-sawing which is still fairly widespread, ther   are over
150 small and ill-equipped sawmills producing about 160,000 m per yelr.
The largest mill's annual output Intil 1976 was approximately 5,000 m and only
25 mills produced more than 500 m per year each. The Norwegian financed mill
completed in 1976 by Tanzanian Wood Industry Corporation (TWICO) at gao Hill
is the country's most important and currently produces some 12,000 m per
year. In addition to the sawmills, there are 2 plywood mills, a particle
board factory and a fiberboard mill in operation, as well as a few small paper
conversion plants. Kibo Paper Industries, Limited, an NDC subsidiary, com-
menced operating a small 10 ton-per-day plant using waste paper near Dar es
Salaam in June, 1978. This plant is now operating well but all of the other
paper and paperboard requirements of the country must be imported.
III. THE SPONSOR AND THE COMPANY
A.   National Development Corporation (NDC)
3.01      The National Development Corporation, which is sponsoring the
project, was established in 1964 with its headquarters in Dar es Salaam. It
is Tanzania's largest parastatal holding company, with its plants effectively
operating as separate legal and financial entities, and the country's principal
instrument for industrial investment. The Southern Paper Mills Company has
been established (para 3.07) as an NDC subsidiary to build and operate the
project and will be the ultimate beneficiary of the proposed loan and credit.
Because of NDC's overall responsibility for project implementation, the
operational influence on its subsidiaries, and its position in the industrial
sector (including paper), the organization, activities and financial situation
are presented briefly below. 1/
1/   A complete presentation of NDC's policies and operations was made in the
Appraisal Report of the Morogoro Industrial Complex (Report No. 1213-TA
of March 3, 1977).



- 6 -
3.02      NDC's nine-man Board of Directors functions as a policy making and
controlling body as well as a liaison and coordinating group between NDC and
the Government. The influence of the Government on financial and investment
planning is strong, although there is little interference in day-to-day oper-
ational matters. In 1977, Mr. A.B.S. Kilewo, former Chairman of the East
African Airlines, replaced Mr. E.A. Mulokozi as NDC's Managing Director and
Chairman of the Board. NDC's staff (excluding the employees in subsidiary
companies) totals 247 of which 108 are professionals (including 19 expatriates)
serving in five operating departments: (i) Planning and Finance; (ii) Account-
ing; (iii) Manpower Development; (iv) Administration; (v) Industrial Develop-
ment. The Industrial Development Department, which prepares and implements
projects for NDC as well as monitoring existing operations, is organized into
five Divisions. Each Division is responsible for a specific group of sectors
of NDC's activities; the Pulp, Paper and Printing Division will handle the
Mufindi project.
3.03      NDC holds shares in 23 operating companies of which 18 are clas-
sified as subsidiaries (over 50% NDC shareholding) and 5 are associate
companies (50% or less NDC shareholding). Its total portfolio is currently
T Sh 264.4 million. The 23 companies operate in the following fields: metal
working (7); tobacco and beverage (4); paper converting, printing and publish-
ing (4); chemicals and allied products (4); leather tanning and processing (4);
together, they employ about 12,000 people. Through its four subsidiaries in
the printing, publishing and packaging sector, NDC converts about 50% of the
present paper consumption in Tanzania, representing a sales value of about
T Sh 107 million per year.
3.04      The consolidated operations of the NDC Group companies have been
profitable every year since 1968, though some companies (in the fertilizer and
rubber industries) experienced losses in 1975 and 1976. The overall capitaliza-
tion of the NDC Group is sound with a debt/equity ratio of 12/88. NDC's finan-
cial statements for the years 1971 through 1977 are presented on the following
page.
3.05      Total head office administrative expenses increased to 81% of
income in 1974, and had become a cause of concern. However, they were held
constant in absolute terms over the 1975-77 period and as a result decreased
to 32% of income in 1977, reflecting much improved organization and co-
ordination of NDC's work at headquarters.
3.06      In March 1977 the Barik approved a loan of US$23.0 million 1/ to
NDC for the Morogoro industrial complex, including the development of a 65 ha
industrial estate and the implementation of a canvas mill, a shoe factory and
a leather goods factory. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily
and in spite of some critical delays in the appointment of consultants and in
the commencement of procurement, the project is expected to be completed in
July 1982 as scheduled.

B.   Southern Paper Mills Company (the Company)
3.07      The Southern Paper Mills Company has been formed as a limited
liability company under Tanzanian industrial and commercial laws. Its
initial authorized share capital of T Sh 10 million (US$1.2 million) will
be increased to provide for ad[ditional equity subscriptions as execution of
the project proceeds. While NDC will own all the Company's shares, plant,
sales and accounting management will be autonomous. The total staff of the
Company, after the start of operations, is planned to reach about 1,500
people. The Company's functions during implementation and operations of
the project are described in more detail in Chapter V.
IV. THE MARKET
A.   World Paper Markets
4.01      The industrialized countries produce and consume about 95% of
the world's pulp and paper. With few exceptions, countries of the developing
world rely on producers in Europe and North America for the bulk of their
paper supplies. Although long-run prices are generally related to the long-run
development of production costs, short-term supply and demand imbalances have
a marked influence on prices, particularly for the smaller consuming countries
such as Tanzania. During the last period of short supply (1974-75), prices
in Tanzania rose sharply, and supplies of some grades could not be obtained
at any price. At the present time, international markets (particularly in
Europe and Japan) remain somewhat depressed following the recent world reces-
sion and although prices are now beginning to firm up again, they had fallen
to an extent and are still at levels that investments in new capacity on
present prices are difficult tc, justify anywhere in the world.
4.02      Recent forecasts by FAO and other international agencies suggest
that by the early 1980's, shortages will once again begin to be felt for
certain grades as the current slow rate of new capacity additions will not
keep pace with increasing demand. At that time, rather sharp increases
in prices may once again be expected. A handicap for a newcomer in the
pulp and paper industry is that world market prices for paper reflect the
fact that capital costs for building pulp and paper plants were considerably
lower in the past than they are at present. While the cost of installing
paper capacity in traditional producing countries in the past 15 years has
averaged about US$550 per annual ton, this cost today has risen to between
US$1,000 and US$1,800 per ton, depending on the type of paper to be produced.
Since earlier installed capacity has an economic life of at least 20 years,
such low cost capacity is still in operation and will have a depressing effect
on world paper prices for some ltime to come. While the long-established
companies in traditional producing countries can overcome this problem by
averaging the return they obtain on their various plants installed at dif-
ferent times, a new producer, such as Tanzania, cannot.



B.   Past Paper Consumption Trends in Tanzania
4.03      Consumption of paper in Tanzania has averaged about 25,000 tons
annually, over the past several years, all of which has been imported at a
value of about US$15 million per annum. The use of paper is widely dis-
tributed through all sectors of the economy with main consumers being news-
papers, publishers of school text books, and the packaging industry. Packag-
ing grades are used for goods for domestic consumption such as cement, sugar,
milled products, fertilizer, and consumer goods, and for exported products
such as sisal. Tanzania's printing and converting industry, while relatively
new, has expanded rapidly in the past few years (para 4.05).
4.04      The following table shows imports of paper into Tanzania over the
past decade. All types of paper and paperboard are included in these
figures, including converted products and printed material.

Growth in consumption averaged about 13% annually from 1965 to 1971, but
only about 3% from 1971 to 1977. Over the entire period (1965-77), con-
sumption increased by about 7% per annum. The sharp increase in 1972 followed
by a period with relatively little change in imports is due to a combination
of inventory adjustments and a general slowing down of the economy in 1974
and the following years. Although some of the country's paper imports from
Sweden are financed through SIDA's grant program in Tanzania, consumption has
been somewhat constrained by import restrictions due to foreign exchange
shortages in recent years. The price to the final consumer is unaffected by
the character of SIDA's support and is closely in line with world market
prices.
4.05      The past decade has seen not only growth in paper consumption, but
a marked shift in the type of imports. In 1970, almost 50% of imports were
in the form of converted products or printed material, much of which came from
the well-developed converting industry in Kenya. Duaring the past few years,
however, Tanzania has been rapidly expanding its own converting operations.



- 10 -
By 1974, imported converted products were down to 25% of all -paper and paper-
board imports; in 1977 they are estimated to have accounted for less than 10%,
comprising mainly printed material and sophisticated manufactures from Western
Europe.
4.06      The following breakdown of paper and paperboard consumption into
major grade groups is based on several market studies undertaken in recent
years (para. 4.08).

4.07      Although there are aL large number of ultimate end-users of
paper in Tanzania, approximately 80% of all paper and paperboard brought
into the country is imported by one of six organizations, namely: three
converters of industrial paper and board 1/, two major printing establish-
ments 2/, and one Government importing agency 3/. The converting operations
supply paper bags, paper sacks, corrugated cartons, and other boxes and
wrappers to a wide range of industries. The two major printing establish-
ments each produce a daily newspaper and a number of other periodicals,
and carry out general printing of school and other books. Elimu Supplies

3/   Elimu Supplies Ltd.

Ltd. supplies paper for education purposes, and to most of the 60 or so small
and middle-sized printing companies. The remaining 20% of paper consumed is
imported by the user either directly, or through a small number of commercial
importing agencies. The present system of importing and distributing paper
appears to be satisfactory.
4.08      Forecasts of paper demand in Tanzania have been made in several
studies: (i) two studies by Poyry, undertaken in 1974 and 1976; (ii) a Bank
study carried out in 1976, which projected paper consumption on two bases:
an end-use analysis and by using statistical techni,ques (correlating income
and paper consumption in Tanzania and other African countries); and (iii) a
study by BIS Marketing Research Limited (BIS) of the U.K., carried out in
mid-1977 with a subsequent review in 1978. A graphical presentation of those
projections is shown below.

a/   Actual
For the period until 1985, BIS's 1978 projection of total paper/paperboard de-
mand based on a detailed analysis of end-use factors, although the lowest of
these five estimates, is considered to be the most realistic. It is reason-
ably consistent with the Bank's own statistical projection and any substan-
tially higher projection would imply either a per capita paper consumption in
Tanzania above that in other countries at a similar stage of development, or
a rate of real growth of the Tanzanian economy substantially more than the 5%
annual rate expected over the next decade. In the longer term, end-use
analysis is not so useful for estimating demand. The BIS projection from 1985
to 1990, suggesting an average annual growth in demand of 5.2% annually, would
appear to be overly conservative in view of the past growth rates and the
anticipated future economic performance of Tanzania. For the period beyond
1985, therefore, it has been assumed that a growth rate of at least 7% could
be achieved leading to a total demand for paper and paperboard of 82,500 tons
in 1990. If, in fact, a lower rate of growth in the domestic market is achieved
this would require a higher level of exports and the impact of this on the pro-
ject's financial and economic rates of return is examined in the sensitivity
analyses in Chapters VII and VIII. In terms of the major grades groups, based
on the end-use analysis of BIS, the demand forecast is broken down below
between "basic grades", which t:he proposed MIufindi mill can produce, and
"other grades", which it cannot easily produce and hence does not intend to
make under the proposed project.

Salaam. As its own production expands, Kibo will require about 1,400
TPA of pulp to supplement its waste paper and this will be supplied by
the Mufindi mill.
C.   Export Markets
4.10      The proposed paper mill is designed to operate with an average
output (depending on the paper grades produced) of 60,000 tons annually
(together with 1,400 tons of pulp for the Kibo mill) and by 1987 is expected
to be technically capable of producing at this level. As can be seen
from the above table, the Tanzanian demand for the type of paper the Mufindi
mill will be producing initially will not approach 60,000 tons per year until
1990, and thus for several years the mill will have some excess production
capacity. It is anticipated that this surplus will be exported, although at
the same time Tanzania will be importing other types of paper thereby remain-
ing a net importer of paper and paper products in most years. Quantities of
domestic production, imports, domestic demand and exportable surplus are
shown in the following table.

4.11       In view of the relatively small volume and short-term nature of
the anticipated exports, no detailed survey of possible export markets for
paper from Tanzania has been undertaken. However, in 1974, the potential was
briefly reviewed by Poyry who identified Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique,
Burundi and Rwanda as likely markets. BIS also examined the Zambian and
Malawian markets in somewhat more detail in 1977. Import, production, and
consumption figures for these countries in 1976 are tabulated below:

4.12      Consumption in these countries is growing aLt between 5 and 10%
annually. Apart from a possible export pulp mill in Malawi, which would noL
affect that country's demand for imported paper, the only known pulp and paper
project planned in this region is a 40,000 TPA mill for Zambia, tentatively
scheduled to come on stream in about 1984. If consunmption does increase at 5%
annually, and the Zambian project becomes operational as now scheduled, the
combined supply gap in these countries in 1985 will amount to approximately
130,000 tons of paper. The maximum expected Tanzanian exports of about 11,000
tons in 1987 will represent less than 10% of the total supply to these countries
and there can be little doubt that the relatively modest export tonnages will
be marketable in this area.
4.13      Although there is a very small wastepaper-based mill in Uganda and
another in Kenya, the only paper mill of consequence now operating in East
Africa is that of Panafrican Paper Mills at Webuye in Kenya, which started
operations at the end of 1974. This mill, financed in part by IFC, is now
operating at close to its production capacity of 45,000 tons annually, and is
currently selling about 36,000 tons of this in Kenya. The balance is exported
to neighboring countries, and to Asia and the Middle East.
4.14      The Kenyan mill has been considered as a possible source of supply
to the Tanzanian market, particularly as it is currently planning an expansion
to 60,000 tons annual capacity. While on the face of it this possibility
would seem to have some merit in the near term, Tanzanian importers see the
Kenyan exports as relatively shortlived until the domestic market in that
country reaches the Panafrican mill's output; they are therefore reluctant
to break established ties with traditional suppliers. In fact, it is pro-
jected that by the late 1980's all of Panafrican's production will be utilized
in Kenya and Tanzania would have to continue (or resume) its imports from
Scandinavia and elsewhere.
D.  Prices
4.15      As noted above, actual prices paid by Tanzanian consumers correspond
closely to the international prices for the various paper grades, with suit-
able allowances for delivery to Dar es Salaam, and iLmport duties 1/ levied on
some grades. However, the basis of the analysis presented in this report is
that when the Mufindi mill comes on stream, mill-nelt prices will be such that
the delivered prices to the customer will still be in line with world market
prices, exclusive of duty. Typical recent CIF prices of paper in Dar es
Salaam are as follows:
1/   With the exception of woodfree printing paper, which is admitted
duty-free, all paper imports carry a 20% duty. However, sack kraft,
linerboard and fluting have been allowed duty-free entry for two
years to assist Tanzania's new packaging industry.

4.16      These prices are some T Sh 600-900/ton (US$72-108/ton) above domestic
Western European prices for the same paper grades, primarily because of trans-
portation and handling costs. Prices in Western Europe rose very sharply from
mid-1972 until early in 1975, when world demand dropped significantly. Sub-
sequently prices in that market: have eased for some grades by as much as
30% but prices are already beginning to firm for certain types of paper and
increases for most grades are expected within the next 12 months. As is
typical in small and relatively distant markets, the prices in Tanzania rose
to greater levels at the high point, and for some grades have subsequently
declined further than those in Western Europe. Prices are now beginning to
show signs of increasing in Tanzania reflecting the market situation in other
regions. The variations in the CIF prices at Tanzania, and with them the FOB
prices of the exporting countries, have been of such magnitude that to select
an international price for project analysis on the basis of present or recent
past prices alone is difficult.
4.17      To overcome this difficulty, the Bank has recently undertaken a
study aimed at arriving at prices which would allow efficient producers in
traditional paper producing areas (Scandinavia, Canada and the U.S.) to add
new capacity and continue to achieve customary profit levels on their invest-
ment. 1/ While this study will require continuing additional data input and
updating, the resulting "Computed 1977 Prices" as shown in the following table
are generally within the range of prices actually encountered in Tanzania over
the past several years.

4.18      The graph below compares historical paper price ranges during
1974-77 of the weighted average of all grades to be produced by the Mufindi
mill (CIF Dar es Salaam and adjusted to 1977 terms) with the average weighted
price for Mufindi's products as used in this appraisal. From the above table
it can be seen that the computed prices, except for newsprint, are within the
range of current term prices experienced in recent years (and thLs in constant
prices were still lower than these actual prices). Furthermore the graph
shows that while in 1976 and 1977 actual weighted import prices (CIF Dar es
Salaam) were about 11% and 17% respectively below the weighted price assumed
in the appraisal, actual import prices in the two preceeding years were above
the appraisal price, in 1974 by as much as 28%. Also since international
paper prices do not necessarily move in parallel for individual paper grades
(see also table in para 4.15) and since the pulp and paper industry in tradi-
tional producing countries is arguing that present prices are inadequate
to attract new investment in the industry, it is believed that the assumed
computed price (CIF Dar es Salaam, 1977 terms) used in the appraisal re-
presents a realistic estimate of longer range international prices of paper.

4.19      For exports it has been assumed that one-half of the tonnage avail-
able for export would be shipped to adjacent countries such as Zambia, where
Tanzania has a trading and freight advantage. In these cases, mill revenues
have been estimated on the assumption that Tanzanian paper would be sold at
a discount of 10% below the delivered price of competing sources of supply.
The remaining exports would be shipped through Dar es Salaam to other ports
of Africa at 20% below the assumed CIF Dar es Salaam price, reflecting stronger
competition in these markets. Overall, therefore, an average 15% discount
from CIF prices has been assumed for all export sales. While this substantial
discount makes exports of larger tonnages relatively unattractive, the exports
are small in absolute amounts (together some 46,000 tons over eight years
(para 4.10)), and represent on average only some 10% of Mufindi's total pro-
duction during this period. These sales more than cover production costs
and are welcome in that they allow full technically available capacity
utilization.
E.  Organization of Marketing and Distribution
4.20      At the present time, the 5 or 6 major consumers of paper in Tanzania
(who account for as much as 75% of paper consumed) import directly from the
producing countries, while most of the smaller consumers are supplied by Elimu
Paper Supplies, the Government agency, which imports and warehouses a wide
range of grades of paper. These arrangements are considered to be satis-
factory for domestic sales from the proposed new operation, and their con-
tinuation would facilitate the change-over from imported to domestic paper
supply. Thus it is envisaged that the project will employ a small sales staff
who will deal directly with the major paper consumers in the country, and
directly through Elimu Paper Supplies with the smaller consumers. In arriving
at expected mill-net sales revenues, a deduction of 3% of the gross sales
revenue has been made to allow for the project's share of the cost of these
operations.
4.21      For export sales, two alternative marketing methods are being con-
sidered.  In the first, the sales staff of the Company would be augmented
to handle export sales directly, selling to consumers in the importing
countries. In the second, the Company would sell to existing paper importers
who would in turn deal with the ultimate consumers.  The second method is
likely to be more attractive, as it involves dealing with fewer customers and
moreover with customers alreadly experienced in importing paper from a wide
variety of sources. In any event, the costs of the two methods are likely to
be similar, and 5% of the expected gross selling price in export markets has
been allowed to recover those costs.
4.22      In the Agreement between NDC and ASSI (para 5.28), the latter has
undertaken to review marketing and distribution aspects of the project and to
assist NDC to devise and implement an appropriate organization well in advance
of the projected start-up date. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring
a smooth transition from imported to domestically-produced paper. The Company
has agreed to submit to the Bank not later than December 31, 1980 detailed
marketing and distribution programs for both the domestic and the export
markets.

V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The project consists of the establishment of an integrated pulp
and paper mill with the capacity to sustain a production of 61,400 TPA of
a combination of various grades of pulp, paper and board. Facilities to be
provided include: logging roads and equipment, a chemical pulp mill with a
bleach plant, a mechanical pulp mill, two paper machines with associated stock
preparation and paper finishing equipment, steam and power generation equip-
ment, a chlorine and caustic soda plant, related pollution abatement equip-
ment, and some supporting infrastructure. At full production the mill will
produce annually about 22,000 tons of kraft paper, 23,000 tons of printing and
writing paper, 7,000 tons of newsprint, 8,000 tons of kraft linerboard, and
1,400 tons of market pulp. The principal project facilities will also incor-
porate spare capacity eventually enabling a total of 75,000 tons of paper and
board annually to be produced at minimal additional cost. The mill will be
located about 15 km south of Mufindi in South-central Tanzania, some 590 km
from its major market of Dar es Salaam. The site has good road and rail
connections with Dar es Salaam and with other parts of the country.
A.   Project Concept and Choice of Technology
5.02      The project will have the capability of supplying a substantial
proportion of the paper needs of Tanzania. Of necessity, this has meant
that diverse and sometimes complex processes have been included. Moreover,
the cost of chemicals, most of which will need to be imported, and environ-
mental considerations, have required that the mill be equipped with full
chemical recovery and effluent treatment facilities. This has led to a mill
concept which is expensive in relation to the econoimy of the country, and to
the scale of production.
5.03      Throughout the period of project preparation this problem has
been recognized and simpler and less versatile mill concepts aiming at the
production of fewer grades have been evaluated in an attempt to reduce project
costs. Other technologies, such as mechanical pulping, semi-chemical pulping
and the pulping of sisal or bagasse, have also been examined. In general
these alternatives have necessitated consideration of smaller-sized plants
as the decreased versatility has reduced the potential market volume. Sig-
nificant reductions in plant capital costs could be achieved in some cases
but there is little scope for corresponding reductions in the cost of infra-
structure and related items (para 5.20). The overall effect has been a
sharp loss in economies of scale and economic rates of return which did not
exceed 5%. Another alternative examined has been a phased approach where
certain of the facilities would be added only at a later date. If this
approach were to be followed, a very large proportion of the ultimate ex-
penditures would be required in the first phase and although training and
start-up would be simplified, the adverse financial and economic implications
of high initial expenditures for delayed benefits are severe. The project
concept now being proposed represents a reasonable compromise betwen
project cost and complexity on the one hand, and economic benefits on
the other.



- 20 -
5.04       Within this basic concept, there remained a number of technical
choices with respect to the degree to which labor is substituted for capi-
tal, and the extent to which the mill is appropriate to Tanzanian condi-
tions. Although the designs proposed by Poyry in the original feasibility
study did not fully reflect a commitment to appropriate technology, NDC and
the Bank (together with the other co-financing agencies) have consistently
recognized the importance of such an approach. During the past several
months, Poyry and Sandwell have been involved in developing the final design
concepts for the project and each company has brought to this activity its
respective experience in similar projects in other developing countries.
The outcome of this work is a technical package which is somewhat less
complex than that originally envisaged, without compromising product quality
or environmental acceptability. The concept was reviewed in detail by tech-
nical representatives of the potential financing institutions at meetings held
in Helsinki in July 1978 and in London in August 1978. General agreement was
reached that the concept and technology were appropriate to Tanzanian condi-
tions.
B.   Project Description
1.   The Mill
5.05       As noted previously, the mill will produce pulp, newsprint, print-
ing and writing paper, kraft linerboard, and kraft paper. Fiber furnishes
for these grades will comprise mechanical and chemical pulp in the case of
newsprint and for some types of printing and writing paper, and chemical pulp
for all other grades. Chemical pulp will be produced using the standard sul-
phate process which will provide maximum strength properties together with
the economies and pollution abatement benefits to be obtained from chemical
recovery.
5.06       A suitable mill-site area has been located and secured below the
escarpment south of the town of Mufindi, on the Kigogo-Ruaha river. The
Tanzania-Zambia railway (TAZARA) passes through this area and a road is
planned up the escarpment to link with the main highway to Zambia (Map IBRD
13486).  The average 3waterflow in the Kigogo-Ruaha river is about 5 cubic
meters per second (m Is) whiSh , while well in excess of the projected mill
process requirement of 0.2 m Is, may give rise to some concern with regards
to effluent dilution. However, appropriate effluent treatment facilities are
planned (paras. 5.17-5.19) which are designed to minimize downstream effects
even during periods of low flow. Below the mill-site, the Kigogo-Ruaha
flows through rugged and virtually uninhabited country for approximately 49 km
where it joins the Mnyera river whose minimum flow is of the order of 30 m /s.
5.07       Detailed technical descriptions of the processes and equipment pro-
posed are contained in the various consultants' studies. The pulp mill will
be of conventional design, utilizing batch digesters. A four-stage bleach
plant will use chlorine, caustic soda and hypochlorite produced at the mill
site using Tanzanian salt and a diaphragm-cell electrolytic process.



- 21 -
5.08      The paper mill will comprise two paper machines of the same size
and basic design. Linerboard and kraft paper will generally be produced on
one machine, while the second will generally produce newsprint and other
grades of printing and writing paper. The paper mill will include stock
preparation systems, an additives preparation plant and a finishing depart-
ment. It is anticipated that about one-half of the printing and writing
paper, and smaller quantities of other grades will be delivered in sheets.
Equipment for sheeting, sorting and packing has therefore been incorporated
in the proposed plant design.
5.09      Services within the mill will include a waLter treatment system,
process steam and power supply systems, and maintenance and technical sup-
port services. Water will be pumped from the adjacent Kigogo-Ruaha and
screened mechanically. After screening the water will be suitable for some
process purposes but for more critical uses, further treatment with chemical
flocculation and filtration is envisaged. Steam will be generated within the
plant in the chemical recovery furnace and in a combination wood, coal and
oil fired boiler. The Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) will ex-
tend its national power grid system into south-western Tanzania (para 5.25)
and the mill will therefore utilize a combination of approximately equal
proportions of TANESCO power, and power generated oni-site with a back pressure
steam turbo-generator. Maintenance shops and equipment will be designed
keeping in mind the isolation of the mill from any back-up facility.
2.   Raw Material Supplies
5.10      Wood:  When the project reaches noj5mal operating capacity in 1987
the total wood requirement will be 262,000 m annually. This wood will be
supplied as follows:

Samples of wood from each of these sources have been tested for their pulping
and paper making properties and found satisfactory for the grades to be pro-
duced at Mufindi (Project File, ref. B1).
5.11      The Sao Hill pine plantations currently cover some 10,600 ha of
successfully established stands. An additional 14,000 ha, financed by the



- 22 -
Bank under the Sao Hill Forestry Project will be established during the period
1978-1981. The area required for this additional planting is available within
the existing Forest Reserve. The land is open and without tree cover, requir-
ing only minimal preparation prior to planting. The main species which has
been planted successfully at Sao Hill in the past and is also to be planted in
the future is Pinus patula. However, to avoid dependence on a single species,
others like Pinus elliottii andl Eucalyptus grandis/saligna will continue to be
planted.  Eucalyptus is known to grow well over an 8-year rotation at Sao Hill
although so far no pulpwood stands with eucalyptus have been established in
the Forest Reserve. Nevertheless, there is eucalyptus available from other
plantations in the region and this will ensure an adequate supply of this
species in the first 2-3 years of mill operation.
5.12      Based on the growth rates which have actually been achieved, and
with a generous 30% allowance for losses, the total pulpwood plantation area
required to support the mill is 15,000 ha of which 10,600 ha have already
been successfully established. This is only about 70% of the 22,100 ha of
pulpwood plantations which are scheduled to be established by 1981. Neverthe-
less, some such margin of safety is essential, particularly in view of the
high proportion of poor stocking and failures in the 1975 through 1977 plant-
ings, affecting about 50% of area inputs in those years. The Government has
recognized the serious implications of this performance and has taken steps
to strengthen the Forestry Project both in staff and equipment. The results
of this strengthening has already positively affected the success rate of the
plantings made in 1978.
5.13      An additional resource exists in the form of a 4,000 ha pine planta-
tion in the region of Mbeya, some 240 km by rail from the Mufindi site and
additional wood could be obtained from this area if required. The Government
has agreed that the existing and planned Sao Hill plantations, the Mbeya
plantations, and also any waste wood generated at the TWICO sawmill at Sao
Hill, will be made available to the extent required for use by the project.
5.14      The pulp mill represents an obvious and potentially profitable out-
let for over-mature wattle from the Tanganyika Wattle Company some 170 km
from the mill-site and NDC has already had a positive response to its pre-
liminary enquiries concerning wattle supply. NDC has agreed to enter into
a suitable long-term arrangement for the supply of this material.
5.15      Coal:  Although coal is not currently mined on a large scale in
Tanzania, the Government has given assurances that coal from the large coal-
fields near Mbeya will be available in the quantities required by the project.
The coal will be transported by TAZARA to the Mufundi mill over a distance of
about 260 km. To ensure the availability of coal for mill start-up, the State
Mining Corporation is planning to expand production and stockpile from an
existing small mine while the larger fields are being developed. Should the
full requirement of coal not be available on time, the mill would have to use
fuel oil which is available from the refinery near Dar es Salaam. This alter-
native would, however, have rather serious cost implications as the equivalent
price of coal, in calorific terms, is only about one half that of oil. Even
when coal is available as the main fuel source, some fuel oil will be required
for starting burners and for the lime kiln.

5.16      Other Materials and Chemicals:  Limestone for the project is avail-
able from several alternative locations in the project area and the State
Mining Corporation is currently sampling and conducting chemical analyses to
determine the most economic source for full-scale exploitation. Salt for the
mill's chlorine and caustic soda plant is available on the coast and will be
shipped by rail to the plant. Other chemical raw materials will, at least
initially, have to be imported through Dar es Salaanm.
3.   Environmental Impact and Protection
5.17      At the present time there are a few scattered and unplanned settle-
ments in the area. A Ujamaa village is proposed nearby but its exact location
will not be selected until the mill location is finalized. Although a full
environmental impact study has not yet been carried out, the facilities pro-
posed have been designed with a view to minimizing the undesirable environmen-
tal aspects of a sulphate pulp and paper mill and no undue disturbance to
residents in the area is anticipated.
5.18      There are as yet no Tanzanian standards for pollution control.  In
the project, however, provision has been made to keep the discharge of solid,
liquid and gaseous wastes within internationally acceptable limits. Effluents
from the mill if untreated would contain small amounts of toxic organic
sulphur compounds, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended fiber and other
particulates, color and odor. Treatments will include the stripping of con-
taminated condensates with steam to remove organic sulphur compounds, the
settling out of particulates by clarification, and secondary treatment of all
effluent to reduce BOD by as much as 90%. With the proposed treatment system,
Poyry has projected that the impact on the Kigogo-Ruaha will be approximately
as follows:
Effects of Paper Mill Discharge on
River Water Characteristics
Characteristic              Normal River Flow            Low River Flow
BOD                             + 1.0 ppm                  + 2.5 ppm
Susp. Solids                    + 1.7 ppm                  + 4.2 ppm
Color                           + 40 units                 + 100 units
The water is already characteristically greyish in ccolor although at low
water flow the addition of the pulp mill effluent may produce an observable
change towards brown. Suspended solids' information for the river water is
not available but natural turbidity levels range from 10-70 ppm. The water
will not be toxic to the aquatic ecosystem but during periods of low river
flow, it is possible that slight but characteristic taste and smell phenomena
will occur. As mentioned, about 40 km downstream from the proposed mill site,
the Kigogo-Ruaha joins the larger Mnyera river, and no undesirable phenomena
could persist beyond this point. The projected discharge characteristics are
considered to be satisfactory and a monitoring program to verify this is
planned. If necessary, additional facilities could be added to the mill to
further improve the effluent.



- 24 -
5.19      Air emissions in a pulp and paper mill are primarily from the digest-
ing system, the chemical recovery system and the lime kiln. In the case of
the proposed Mufindi mill there will also be a potential for particulate and
sulphurous emissions from the coal-burning power boiler. Process emissions
are generally sulphur compounds (such as hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan
and others) and particulates. To reduce particulate emissions the mill design
allows for an electrostatic precipitator on the recovery boiler, a recirculat-
ing wet scrubber on the lime kiln, and multiple cyclones on the power boiler.
To reduce odors, digester exhaust gases will be condensed, and the recovery
boiler has been designed with an over-sized furnace. Some of the more recent
advances in odor reduction technology (such as collection and incineration of
non-condensible gases) which have been incorporated in the designs of large
modern mills have not been proposed for the Mufindi mill as the size does not
warrant such treatment and the mill's relative isolation should ensure that
any nuisance effects remain minimal. NDC has agreed that the necessary anti-
pollution measures as broadly described above will be installed in the mill
and will be properly operated and monitored.
C.   Infrastructure
5.20      A number of infrastructural developments are required to support
the project. The following table summarizes the estimated capital cost and
tentative sources of financing for these developments:
Infrastructure - Capital Requirement
(T Sh Million)
Financed by        Financed Outside
Item                       the Project           the Project          Total

d/   First phase of township development.  This would eventually develop
into a town for 6,000 inhabitants, at an estimated total cost of
T Sh 240 million.
e/   Financed by the European Development Fund.
5.21      Although it is proposed that about 90% of the infrastructural re-
quirements be financed outside the project, the cost of such developments,
amounting to more than 15% of the project cost, is an economic cost which must
be considered in reviewing the economic rate of return of the project. This
burden, together with the technical assistance package proposed, has the over-
all effect of increasing the cost of the Tanzanian project by about 30% over



- 25 -
and above what might be expected for a similar project in a country where the
infrastructure and technology are already in place. 1/
5.22      Railway Spur:  The TAZARA railway passes within about 8 km of the
proposed mill site, requiring a spur which will be partly financed under the
project. Following its usual practice, TAZARA will engineer, construct and
maintain the spur but would only finance the "recoverables" in the initial
costs, such as the railway line and ties as well as the station which is
needed at the access point of the spur at the main line. The remaining
costs involved, including a bridge over the Kigogo-Ruaha, have been estimated
on the basis of information provided by TAZARA and are included in the project
cost estimates.
5.23      Township and Forest Villages:  The project's capital cost estimate
includes allowances for 20 houses for senior staff and a 20-room guest house.
Furthermore, it has been estimated by the project sponsor that an additional
540 houses and other township facilities will be required for mill operating
staff as well as several villages for forest workers. These will be financed
separately by the Government and are thus not included in the project cost
estimate. Nevertheless in evaluating the financial and economic returns of
the project, housing costs have been included as an annual charge.
5.24      Escarpment Road:  This 40 km road will provide a valuable transporta-
tion link for the country giving ready access from tlhe whole Iringa region to
the TAZARA railway. Although the road is essential to the project, it will
also have far-reaching additional benefits. Agreement has been reached
between the Government and the European Development Fund to finance construc-
tion of this road. The cost of the road has therefore not been included in
estimates of project cost and total financing required.
5.25      Power Line:  A transmission line into South-western Tanzania is a
part of the proposed extension of the national grid. Without the pulp and
paper mill load, this extension would not likely take place until the early
1990's, but TANESCO has concluded that the mill load justifies immediate con-
struction of the line. TANESCO is currently engaged in calling tenders for
detailed engineering and is investigating possible sources of finance.
5.26      The Government has confirmed that arrangements for financing the
infrastructure elements are well advanced and that the railway spur, the town-
ship, the escarpment road and the power line will be implemented in a timely
manner as required by the project. NDC has agreed to submit to the Bank
quarterly reports describing physical progress of inf'rastructure implementa-
tion. An implementation schedule for each of the above infrastructure invest-
ments is included in the overall project schedule on page 30.
1/   In industrialized countries, costs of this type are often financed
entirely by government. For an isolated mill now under construction in
Canada, where the total investment is expected to be about US$300 mil-
lion, grants and soft loans totalling US$80 million have been made by
the Provincial and Federal Governments.

D.  Project Implementation and Management
5.27      An organization has been developed for project implementation and
operation which includes: (i) the Company's Project Team; (ii) the Project
Advisers, ASSI; (iii) the Project Managers, Sandwell, and (iv) the Project
Engineers, Poyry. The main functions of each of these groups, and an organi-
ation chart for project implementation, are shown in the two charts on the
following pages. The Project 'eam which will eventually comprise a staff of
7-10 Tanzanian professionals has already been established within NDC and will
be transferred to the Company when it (the Company) is formed. The present
chief adviser to the Team, Mr. S. I. Husain, has been with NDC for several
years and was formerly the Gen(eral Manager of Packages, Ltd., a successful
pulp and paper company in Pakistan in which IFC has invested. He will be
joined shortly by a Tanzanian Project Team Chief (not yet appointed) who is
expected to become the Company's General Manager and who will contribute to
continuity during the transition from project execution to operations.
5.28      NDC does not have any previous experience in constructing and oper-
ating a pulp and paper mill of this size. To strengthen the Company's (and
the Project Team's) technical capabilities to supervise the Project Managers
and Project Engineers, and the commissioning and initial plant operations,
NDC has appointed ASSI as Project Advisers. Under the assistance agreement
negotiated between NDC and ASSI, ASSI will advise NDC on all technical matters
relating to the engineering, design, equipment procurement and plant commis-
sioning and operation. In addition, ASSI will organize for NDC the training
of Tanzanian technicians and managing personnel. The major impact of ASSI's
role will be in ensuring that the organization functions efficiently and eco-
nomically and that qualified personnel will be available quickly when required
to perform functions not being handled by others. The initial contract is for
a term of 5 years from the time financing is secured for the project, with
provisions for extensions on terms to be agreed. ASSI will be paid a royalty
of US$225,000 per year, and the cost (including overhead, travel and living
expenses) for managerial and technical personnel provided by ASSI to the pro-
ject is estimated at US$6,250 per man-month. This assistance package and its
cost have been approved by the Government and have been found satisfactory by
the Bank.
5.29      ASSI was formed by the Swedish Government in the 1930's with the
objective of fostering development in the more remote parts of northern
Sweden where private corporations were reluctant to go. Today the company
is one of Sweden's largest forest industrial enterprises with 17 production
plants in the country, and is Sweden's largest producer of packaging grades
of paper and paperboard. Other ASSI operations include converting plants in
the U.K., Denmark and Switzerland, and sales outlets in many countries in
Western Europe. ASSI has been generally profitable, although in 1976 and
1977, financial performance declined in parallel with that of other major
Swedish companies in the paper industry.

5.30        The Company will delegate most management responsibilities  to a
firm of Project Managers who will coordinate all aspects of project imple-
mentation and early operations. With ASSI's assistance, NDC has selected,
from a short list of four competting firms, Sandwell of Canada to be Project
Managers.   Sandwell has had extensive international experience with this type
of work and Mr. H. Verwest, an experienced Sandwell project manager, has
been appointed as the head of t:he Sandwell team. He reports to the Project
Team and provides liaison with Sandwell offices in London, U.K. and Vancouver,
Canada. NDC has negotiated an interim contract with Sandwell to cover the



- 29 -
period until project financing is secured. The average cost of the technical
personnel provided by Sandwell under this contract is estimated to be US$6,000
per man-month. The contract has been approved by the Government and has been
found satisfactory by the Bank. The subsequent contract now being negotiated
will ensure that Sandwell remains as Project Managers during project implemen-
tation and subsequently as Company Managers for at least the first three years
of operations of the mill. There will be provision to extend this contract
as required to ensure continuous satisfactory operation of the mill. The
structure of the Company's organization during operations is intended to be
substantially similar to that during implementation and will, therefore, allow
for adequate continuity from the execution of the project to its operation.
NDC will submit to the Bank by June 30, 1979 a detailed plan for the Company's
organization during operation.
5.31      NDC will rely on a specialized firm of Project Engineers for the
detailed design and engineering of the plant, and with advice from ASSI and
Sandwell, has selected Jaakko Poyry and Co. of Finland for this position from
a short list of three qualified firms. NDC has an interim contract with Poyry
to cover the period until financing for the project is secured. The average
cost of the technical personnel provided by Poyry under this contract is esti-
mated to be US$4,500 per man-month. The interim contract has been approved by
the Government and has been found satisfactory by the Bank. NDC has agreed to
employ and retain qualified Project Advisers, Project Managers and Project
Engineers on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and the signing of
the final contracts with these organization will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
5.32      Plantation establishment and maintenance as well as replanting after
clear felling will be the responsibility of the Sao Hill Forestry Project.
The costs of these services will be covered by the stumpage fees and are thus
included in the price of the wood the Mufindi mill will have to pay. Felling
will be carried out by the Wood Supply Division of the Company. The Division
will be headed by a Tanzanian Wood Supply Manager who will report directly to
the Mill Manager. To ensure friction-free cooperat:Lon between the Company's
Wood Supply Division and the Forest Division's Sao Hill Forestry Project, NDC
has agreed that the Ministry responsible for forestry will be represented on
the Company's Board of Directors.
5.33      Since their appointments in November 1977 and June 1978 respect-
ively, Sandwell and Poyry have been working in close cooperation with NDC
and ASSI to review all aspects of the project, to finalize design concepts
based on technology appropriate to Tanzania, and to develop accurate and
up-to-date assessments of project costs. Concurrently, procurement activity
has commenced with the definition of the various packages to be financed,
prequalification of vendors, and invitation to tender for time-critical
items of equipment. A tentative project implementation schedule has been



- 30 -
prepared and is illustrated below. The schedule assumes that total financing
for the project (paras 6.04 and 6.05) will have been secured by February 1979
and order placement for time-critical equipment commenced by March 1979.
Commercial production from the first paper machine is scheduled for October
1982, and from the second paper machine six months thereafter.

E.   Employment and Training
5.34      The mill will provide direct employment for about 800 Tanzanians
of whom about 40 will be highly skilled, 160 skilled, and 140 semi-skilled
technicians. Preliminary training plans for the technical staff have been
prepared by ASSI; they include acquisition of technical knowledge at the
University of Dar es Salaam and pulp and paper schools overseas; and training
at the Kibo paper recycling plant with practical training abroad at South
Asian and Swedish plants. Ini addition, it is envisaged that as many as 120
skilled personnel from mills in Europe, North America and Asia will be re-
cruited immediately prior to and for the first several years of operation
to assist with the start-up and on-the-job training for Tanzanians.
5.35     Wood harvesting operations are expected to employ an additional
440 skilled and 110 unskilled workers from the fifth year of the paper mill's
operation. The Company's Wood Supply Division will also have approximately
140 salaried personnel of which about five managerial positions will be
filled initially by expatriates. The selection and training of the above



- 31 -
labor force will need to be arranged well in advance requiring expatriate
instructors who will be working in the Wood Supply Division's training section
and who, among others, will train Tanzanian foresters and technicians who
will later take over as the workers' instructors. It is expected that the
expatriate teachers, including their salaries and expenses together estimated
at about US$1 million, can be provided to the project through bilateral or
multilateral arrangements assisted by the principal suppliers of the pulpwood
harvesting equipment. The Company has agreed to submit detailed training
programs for both the mill and the forestry operations to the Bank no later
than June 30, 1979.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
6.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$252
million equivalent, including US$194 million (or 77%) in foreign exchange.
Details of the capital cost estimate and of the assumptions made are given
in Annexes 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 and are summarized on the following page.

a/   The mill will be constructed on Government-owned land which will be
available to the project without cost.
b/   Local costs include approximately US$5 million equivalent of indirect
foreign exchange.



- 33 -
6.02      The estimates were prepared by Sandwell and Poyry in August 1978,
and reviewed by the Bank. The base cost estimate is based on August 1978
prices. Foreign equipment will not be subject to import duties under exemp-
tions drawn up to encourage industrial development. Physical contingencies
of 10% on all cost estimates has been added. Price escalation for (mostly
foreign) equipment is based on annual rates of 7.5% during 1978-79 and 7%
thereafter. For civil works, which are expected to be executed by a foreign
contractor, annual escalation rates of 9% are assumed during 1978-79 and 8%
thereafter. Total price contingencies thus represent 15.4% of the base cost
estimate plus physical contingencies. The above cost estimate, including
contingencies, is considered adequate.
6.03      Initial working capital requirements are estimated at US$7 million
equivalent. This amount is relatively low since felling and logging opera-
tions in the nearby forest area will be the responsibility of the Company
itself and thus log inventories can be kept small; the working capital provi-
sion is considered adequate to meet the Company's requirements during its
critical two first years of operations. Interest during construction of
US$27.3 million is based on total debt financing of lUS$126 million carrying
an interest rate of 10%. It has been assumed that to the maximum extent
possible, equity funds would be made available to the Company prior to debt.
Interest during construction covers the period until the second paper machine
is started and a production rate of about 70% is reached allowing the Company
to generate cash in excess of operational needs.
B.  Financing Plan
6.04      Project financing will be provided in a 50/50 debt/equity ratio,
which is considered satisfactory. All foreign loans and grants will be made
to the Government and passed on to the Company either as debt at a 10%
interest rate, or as equity. KfW has agreed that all of its contribution,
which will be provided to the Government on a grant basis, could be passed on
to the project as equity and it is further proposed that some 67% of the IDA
and SIDA contribution be used in this way. The remaining IDA and SIDA funds,
the Bank loan, and the contributions from CDC, NIB, the Kuwait Fund and the
OPEC Special Fund, would all be passed on as debt. The financing plan for
the project is shown below.

a/   The Tanzania contribution includes funds from budget allocations,
NDC's funds, and about US$10 million equivalent from local banks.
b/   The Kuwait Fund loan would be for a 24 year term, including 6 years'
grace, at a 4% interest rate.
c/   The OPEC Special Fund contribution would include a $5 million equivalent
credit for a 20 year term, including 5 years' grace bearing no interest
but a 3/4% service charge. In addition, a $5.5 million equivalent grant
representing counterpart funds in Tanzania currency available from other
OPEC Special Fund operations would be made.
d/   The CDC loan would be for a 20-year term, including 5 years' grace.
It would carry a 1/2% cormmitment fee, and interest at 8-1/2%.
e/   Terms and conditions of the NIB loan will depend to some extent on the
country where goods are procured. The term would likely be 15 years,
including 5 years' grace. The commitment fee would be 1/2% and the
interest rate would be 8%, or less.
The Government will provide US$51.7 million equivalent during the five year
period of project implementation, according to an agreed time-schedule.
6.05      The project cost estimate, as noted, is considered to be adequate.
Nevertheless one of the cofinancing agencies would prefer to see a larger
contingency allowance and has suggested that the project cost could over-run
by as much as 5% raising the total financing required to US$265 million.
In consideration of this the Government of Tanzania has agreed to commit an
additional US$5.3 million on a contingency basis, and has arranged with NIB
for additional funds of US$7.5 million to be available if required. Given the
magnitude of the project this arrangement is considered to be prudent and has
been agreed to by the Bank.



- 35 -
6.06      A Bank loan of US$30 million and an IDA credit also of US$30 million
are proposed. They will be made to the Government, the loan repayable over
20 years including 5 years of grace, and the credit on usual IDA terms. In
turn, the Government will channel the proceeds of the loan and some of the
credit to NDC for on-lending to the Company at 10% interest for 16 years,
including 5 years of grace. The balance of the credit (US$20.1 million, para
6.04) would be passed through NDC to the Company as equity. The Bank loan and
the IDA credit will become effective concurrently with other loans and grants
to the Government which would be passed on the Company as debt or equity on
similar terms as the Loan and Credit, although some of the financing agencies
are considering longer repayment periods. The 5 years of grace correspond to
the estimated construction period of 3-1/2 years until the first paper machine
is in operation, and a start-up period of 1-1/2 years during which the second
paper machine will be put into service and during which interest will continue
to be capitalized. At the end of the grace period, operations are expected to
reach about 70% of normal output and be capable of generating profits and
servicing debt. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Company.
6.07      The Government has agreed to promptly provide or cause to be pro-
vided any local and foreign funds that may be required to complete the project,
including any necessary working capital, on terms satisfactory to the Bank/IDA.
This would mean that at least 50% of any overrun financing will be provided
in the form of equity or subordinated debt and the t:erms of any additional
loans would be substantially the same as those of the original loans to the
Company. Also at the time of project completion, the Company will have to
have a current ratio of at least 1.5. In this context the project will be
considered completed when the pulp and paper mill has, during a period of 90
consecutive days, produced 12,000 tons or more of paper and paperboard.
C.   Procurement
6.08      With the exception of small items (para 6.09) all contracts to be
financed from KfW, SIDA, CDC, Bank and IDA funds will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding (ICB) consistent with Bank Guidelines
for Procurement. The Kuwait Fund and Opec Special Fund will finance the
Civil Works contracts using ICB procedures, together with part of the Work-
ing Capital. The Nordic Investment Bank will finance the Recovery Boiler
and Evaporator package using competitive bidding procedures within the Nordic
countries.
6.09      With regard to equipment packages to be financed by CDC, SIDA, KfW,
the Bank and IDA, a 15% margin of preference or the actual tariff on equiva-
lent imported goods, whichever is the lower, will be accorded (for purposes
of bid evaluation) to qualified local manufacturers who participate in ICB;
and local civil works contractors will be granted the present preference of
7-1/2%.  Items costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each and totalling
not more than US$5 million in the joint financing paLckage, could be purchased
internationally on the basis of suitability, availability and price. As noted



- 36 -
previously, the contract for tLechnical assistance has already been awarded to
ASSI, an interim contract for project management to Sandwell, and an interim
contract for project engineering to Poyry.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan and IDA Credit
6.10      While SIDA, CDC, Bank and IDA funds will be used for joint
financing on a pari-passu basis, the bulk of KfW's funds will be disbursed
on a single major package (the paper mill) in order to simplify disburse-
ment procedures. Allocation of the proceeds of the Bank loan and the IDA
credit is summarized in the following table. Details of the allocation of
other financing for the project are presented in Annex 6-5.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      The chemical pulp mill and first paper machine are forecast to
commence production in October 1982 producing only pulp and unbleached grades
of paper, while the bleach pliant, mechanical pulp mill and the second paper
machine will come into operation in April 1983. The project is expected to
reach normal production levels by 1987. In view of the need for on-the-job-
training, and the management and operating assistance required, the assumed
build-up, though rather slow by standards of industrialized countries, is
considered realistic. The assumptions used in the financial analysis are
detailed in Annex 7-1.

A.   Revenues
7.02      As noted in para 4.15, actual prices paid presently by the consumers
correspond closely to international prices for the various paper grades with
suitable allowance for transportation to Tanzania and import duties. The
assumption of the analysis presented in this report is that when the mill
comes on stream, the mill net price of each paper grade will be such that
the final price to the consumer, which includes transportation and selling
expenses, continues to be in line with those obtainable from international
suppliers. Duty which is currently 20% on some grades has not been included.
Therefore, for a few grades of paper the price to the consumer will go down. 1/
For exports, it is assumed that Tanzanian paper will be sold at world market
prices, i.e., CIF in those countries minus an average 15% discount to allow
for effective penetration into those markets (para 4.19).   However, the
further reductions necessary for freight and selling expenses lowers the
mill-net revenue on export sales to about 80% of the estimated levels for
domestic sales.
7.03      The financial analysis is done in current prices through 1983, the
first year of significant production, and in constant 1983 terms thereafter.
Financial projections are based upon the "1977 Computed Prices" presented in
para 4.17. The actual prices used in the projections are as follows:
1/   The Government is examining this aspect of the project to establish the
extent of both the revenue loss and the beneficiaries of any such lower
prices. These factors will be taken into account in any future pricing
policy (para 7.03).

a/   The 1977 prices shown are for a "basic" grade of paper or board.  In
fact, the detailed analysis of BIS shows that several grades within the
Printing and Writing category, and several grades within the Kraft Paper
category, should be produced.  This factor makes allowance for the price
variations in these subsidiary grades.
Pricing of the project's output has been discussed in detail with NDC and the
Government. The Government has agreed in principle to set minimum paper
prices so as to permit the Company to operate on a sound commercial basis,
and to allow it a reasonable return under conditions of efficient operations.
B.   Operating Costs
7.04      Pulpwood costs have been estimated on the basis of data developed
in the feasibility study prepared by Poyry in 1977 and adjustments have been
made to raise them to 1978 levels. The results for each type of pulpwood are
presented in the following table:

The indicated stumpage for pine and eucalyptus pulpwood is a calculated figure
to recover the normal costs of growing pulpwood.  On the ~asis of current
planting Sechniques and costs, these values are T Sh 61/m  for pine, and
T Sh 41/m for eucalyptus which are sufficient to enable the industrial for-
est plantations to become financially self-supporting.  However, ths overall
value for pine Is brought down to T Sh 55/m  because up to 20,000 m  per year
of tops and smallwood from sawlogging operations, representing about 10% of
the annual pine requirement, would be available at zero stumpage.
7.05      Manufacturing costs in 1987 (the first year of full production),
including depreciation, but excluding financing charges, are estimated to
be about T Sh 3,480 per ton in 1978 currency value. Large items in these
costs are fuel and power, which together account for about 25% of the direct
manufacturing cost (excluding depreciation). Other major cost items are wood
(23%), and chemicals (22%). Direct labor required for the operation of the
mill and ancillary facilities, on the other hand, is a relatively minor cost
item. More details are contained in Annex 7-2.

7.08      The above forecasts show the Company's tight financial position
during the initial operating years, notwithstanding the fact that interest
during construction will be capitalized through the first full year of opera-
tion, i.e., until after the second paper machine has come on stream. The
Company is expected to maintain an adequate liquidity from the outset, and
there is an accumulation of surplus cash through the early operating years.
Debt service coverage, however, reaches a comfortable level only in the fifth
full year of operation (1987).   The financing plan for the project requires
that 50% of the financing will be in the form of equity; as noted in para 6.07
this will also apply to any possible overrun financing. After start-up, the
debt to equity ratio is expected to deteriorate to about 53/47 in 1984, be-
cause of the project's start-up 'Losses, but to improve quickly thereafter.
7.09      As a capital intensive project, the Mufindi mill requires a high
rate of capacity utilization before it reaches the profit breakeven point.
In 1984, the first full year when both paper machines are in operation (at
an average of 70% of capacity), the profit breakeven point is close to 100%



- 41 -
due to the large expenses in start-up and technical assistance, high interest
payments and the amortization allowances for pre-operating expenditures. By
1987, the first year of full operation, the profit breakeven point is expected
to drop to about 85% of capacity and the cash breakeven point to 70%.
7.10      The initial tight financial position of the Company, the high break-
even point and the sensitivity analysis discussed further below indicate that
it is imperative for the mill to reach full production as quickly as possible
and to preserve a sound financial structure and liquidity in those critical
initial years. To demonstrate the relief the Company, would have financially
if it were allowed to charge somewhat higher domestic paper prices in the
initial few years of operation, the following table gives the most important
financial indicators under the assumption that domestic prices during 1982
through 1985 will be 15% above those used in the financial projections shown
in para 7.07 above, all other assumptions made there remaining unchanged.

It can be seen that all financial indicators, particularly accumulated cash
surplus, current ratio and debt service coverage, improve considerably as a
consequence of the price increase. The Government has agreed to consider the
possibility of granting such a temporary price increase should this be neces-
sary to allow the Company to operate on a sound financial basis.
7.11      To ensure that the Company operates in a financially satisfactory
manner it has agreed to:
(a)  make no investments outside the scope of the project
until the project is completed (as defined in para
6.07) and thereafter seek prior Bank approval for addi-
tional investments in fixed assets in excess of US$3
million per year, until such time as the mlill is oper-
ating at full normal production rates;
(b) take all necessary action not to exceed a debt to equity
ratio of 60/40;



- 42 -
(c) not incur any additional debt if by doing so it could not
maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 in any of
the succeeding fiscal years;
(d) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5 at all times; and
(e) pay no dividends during the first three full years of oper-
ations and thereafter pay dividends only out of accumulated
earnings and only to the extent that, after such payment,
the Company's current ratio is at least 1.5.
D.   Financial Rate of Return
7.12      The cost/benefit streams for the financial return are expressed
in constant 1978 terms (Annex 7-8). The economic life of the project is
assumed to be 16 years following the attainment of full normal production
capacity, or 20 years in all. The return is 8.7% before and 6.8% after taxes.
Results of the sensitivity analyses are presented below.
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return (%)

1.  Base case                                      8.7                    6.8
2.  Sales revenues increase by 10%                10.6                    9.0
3.  Sales revenues decrease by 10%                 6.6                    4.2
4.  Capital cost increase by 10%                   7.6                    5.7
5.  Capital cost decrease by 10%                   9.9                    8.1
6.  Manufacturing cost increase by 10%             7.8                    5.8
7.  6-month delay in project implementation    8.2                        6.4
8.  Capacity utilization decrease by 10%           7.5                    5.8
9.  No export                                      8.4                    6.6
10.  20-year life at full procluction               9.2                    7.2
The rate of return is mostly sensitive to changes in sales revenues, capital
costs and capacity utilization. Should the project not be able to export
(and the assumed export tonnage not produced at all), the return would
decrease to 8.4% and 6.6% respectively before and after taxes. A six-month
delay in project implementation, combined with a 10% capital cost increase
and an eventual drop in sales revenue of 10%, would reduce the return to 5.5%
and 4.2%, respectively before and after taxes. The plant has been assumed to
have an economic life of 16 years after the achievement of full production
some four years after start-up. Adequate allowances have been included for
additional capital expenditures throughout the project's life to achieve this.
If in fact however, the project's life were increased to 20 years at full
production, the rate of return would increase to 9.2% and 7.2% before and
after taxes respectively.
E.   Auditing and Reporting
7.13      It is mandatory in Tanzania that the audit of all parastatal com-
panies should eventually be carried out by the Tanzania Audit Corporation



- 43 -
(TAC) which was established in 1968. The number of such companies audited
by TAC has increased gradually to 270 out of the totaLl of 320 parastatal
companies in Tanzania. TAC conducts both financial as well as management
audits, and the audit reports are submitted directly to the Board Chairman
of the parastatal company concerned with copies to the parent Ministry and
the Treasury. -ae Company has agreed to submit to the Bank the audit reports
of TAC within four months of the end of the year. Further, to facilitate the
work of TAC and effective financial management of the project, the Company
has agreed to employ and train competent accounting personnel to prepare the
accounts satisfactorily. The Company has also agreed to give prompt atten-
tion to audit recommendations. In addition to the annual audit reports, the
Company will submit quarterly financial statements and project progress and
procurement status reports within 45 calendar days after each quarter.
Finally, after completion of the project, the Company will prepare and furnish
to the Bank a comprehensive report on the project, its implementation, initial
operation, and the costs and benefits expected to be derived therefrom.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A.   Adjusted Costs and Revenues for Economic Evaluation
8.01      The economic costs and benefits have been evaluated at world prices;
tradeables at CIF border prices, and non-tradeables at their border price
equivalent through the application of conversion factors that have been
estimated for Tanzania. The assumptions used and adjustments made are shown
in Annexes 8-1 and 8-2. Unskilled local labor contained in the capital and
manufacturing costs has been valued at 50% of its financial costs, and an
overall shadow exchange rate of T Sh 12 to the dollar has been used. Duties,
taxes and other transfer payments have been eliminated from the cost and
revenue streams.
8.02      As mentioned in para 5.20, supporting infrastructure facilities,
though not included in the project scope itself and largely financed outside
the project, will have to be implemented; namely the railway spur, the
escarpment road, the power line and the mill township and forest villages.
For the purpose of this economic evaluation, all costs that are not recovered
through direct charges have been added to the project cost. The cost of the
railway spur will be recovered through TAZARA freightt charges; the cost of the
power transmission line through TANESCO power charges; the cost of housing and
related utilities through rents, water, electricity and other direct charges.
The following items were allocated to the project, with the appropriate
adjustments mentioned in para 8.01:
(i) half the cost of the escarpment road, or about US$6 million.
It is assumed that the road will also be used as a major
link between the TanZam Highway and the TAZARA Railway,
and that in addition to local traffic, another main user
of the road will be a tea estate in the area; and



- 44 -
(ii) all of the township basic infrastructure, or about
US$2 million (25% of the township cost).
8.03      As previously noted (para. 7.04), for financial calculations the
stumpage element of the wood cost has been established at a level which
would recover the costs of growing pulpwood and enable the industrial for-
est plantations to become financially self-supporting. In the absence of
the proposed project, much of the wood in the existing plantations could
not be utilized and would therefore have no value. A calculation based on
possible alternative wood uses presented in Annex 8-1 indicates that the
appropriate stumpage value for use in economic calculations should be about
60% of the financial values. For plantations not yet established, however,
the economic wood cost is the full cost of establishing these plantations
with adjustments only for shadlow pricing labor and foreign exchange.
8 . 0Z4   Since in  he absence of the proposed project, the mill s eutput
would have to be imported, the economic benefits are measured on the basis
of projected import prices. International prices of these commodities are
mainly influenced by the structure of the paper and forest industries in major
exporting countries (USA, Canada and Northern Europe). For the purpose of
project evaluation, estimated world prices are used (in 1978 terms), i.e.,
those already used for domestic prices in the financial analysis. Economic
prices of exported paper, like the financial prices (para 7.02), include an
average 15% discount.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.05      On the basis of the economic projections of costs and benefits
over the project lifetime, the economic rate of return is 11.3% (Page 4 of
Annex 8-2), compared to the 8.7% financial rate of return before taxes. The
difference between the two rattes of return indicates that the adjustment due
to additional infrastructure costs (about 0.4%) is outweighted by shadow
pricing of the unskilled labor and stumpage fees (+1.1%), and by the adjust-
ment in the exchange rate (+1.9%).
8.06      Results of the sensitivity analysis are shown on the following page.
Like the financial rate of return, the economic return is sensitive to changes
in revenues: it would decrease to 9.4% if paper prices dropped by 10%, while
a 10% increase in paper prices would raise it to 13.1%. The return is less
sensitive to investment and manufacturing costs, but is sensitive to a delay
in implementation. Under the adverse circumstances, were the project cost to
increase by 10% and the project: suffer a 6-month delay in completion, the
return would drop to 9.7%; this drop, however, would be offset if at the same
time paper prices were to increase by only 10%. Should the project not be
able to export, the resulting d[rop in capacity utilization would decrease the
rate of return to 10.9%. Should the project's economic life be extended to
20 years of full production (para 7.12) the rate of return would increase to
12.0%.
8.07      As mentioned in para 5.01, the proposed project is designed so that
expansion from 60,000 to 75,000 TPA will be possible at a minimal additional

cost. Such an expansion would cost about US$25 million (in 1978 terms).
The economic rate of return for the expansion alone is estimated at some 34%
(Page 3 of Annex 8-2). If the expansion takes place in 1991, as is presently
contemplated, the return of the overall proposed project, including the ex-
pansion, would be 12.0%. If rnarket conditions allow an earlier expansion
(in 1987), the overall return rises to 12.5%.
C.   Other Benefits
8.08      No allowance has been made in the economic return calculation for
external economies attributable to the project since they are difficult to
quantify. One of the most important of these is the contribution to regional
development in the South-central part of Tanzania by the establishment of what
would be the largest industrial plant in the country. The construction of a
power line extending the national grid into the region will stimulate local
development activity. The creation of a substantial demand for coal and for
limestone, both of which are available locally, will stimulate mining and
quarrying in the region, and the various transportation needs of the project
will stimulate trucking and servicing facilities. In the same general region,
long-range plans call for the further exploitation of major coal-fields, and
possibly of iron-ore deposits, and some of the infrastructure provided for the
project would facilitate these later developments. It is also anticipated
that the project will stimulat:e downstream converting activities in other
parts of the country as paper supplies become more readily available.
8.09      A second important benefit relates to the technology transfer impact
which a major processing industry will have in Tanzania. Through a normal
process of employee turnover, a certain proportion of the large skilled work-
force will find its way into other process plants where newly acquired ex-
pertise may be expected to contribute to improved efficiency in other sectors.
The total cost of training and technical assistance prior to the mill start-
up, and during the early years of operation, amounts to almost US$40 million.
To the extent that these expenditures effectively transfer technology to
Tanzania, they can be considered to be a direct benefit to the country.
8.10      A further benefit relates to the stability which the project pro-
vides to Tanzania's forestry eff'orts. Although reforestation can be justified
for the provision of logs Eor sawmilling alone, approximately 40% of the
timber produced is not suitable for sawing. By providing a market for this
material, the overall economics of plantation establishment are greatly im-
proved and the jobs of the 800 persons employed in this activity are secured.
Additional benefits to the sawmilling and the wattle bark industry accrue as
a result of the project's need, and ability to pay for waste wood from these
operations.
8.11      As previously noted, the proposed project facilities incorporate
spare capacity for a 25% expansion, with minimal additional investment, and
in the base case estimate of the project's rate of return, this benefit has
not been claimed. The impact of the expansion, and the value of this spare
capacity, is better demonstrated in the analysis of the sensitivity of the
project's rate of return to an eventual expansion (para. 8.07).



- 47 -
8.12      Finally, the project will provide direct employment for some 1,500
people in addition to the 800 persons employed in reforestation and will
generate net foreign exchange savings averaging US$30) million per year (1978
terms) during its economic life (16 years at full production)). These foreigr
exchange benefits compare to the project's estimated foreign exchange expendi-
ture of US$194 million and Tanzania's present import requirements of about
US$16 million annually.
D.   Risks
8.13      The above analysis indicates that the economic rate of return of the
project is relatively low (about 11%) and this heralds a number of potential
risks both for Tanzania and for the project that need to be guarded against.
8.14      This is a large project in the context of the Tanzanian economy and
represents as much as one third of the planned expenditures in the manufactur-
ing sector during the current Five-Year Plan (1977-81). While Tanzanian
sources are not expected to contribute more than 21% to the financing of the
project (US$52 million), this is a large amount in the context of that coun-
try's economy, and the substantial external financing the project and related
infrastructure requires could possibly affect Tanzania's future borrowing
capacity if the project were not to generate the expected substantial foreign
exchange savings because of poor operational performance. Also, Tanzania is
carrying the prime financing obligation should there be a cost overun in the
project or should a slow start-up give rise to a need for additional working
capital in the initial operating years.
8.15      Therefore, in order to avoid the project becoming a liability to
the Tanzanian economy, rather than generating the benefits expected from it,
it is imperative that (i) the project be implemented efficiently within the
time and cost presently allowed for, and that (ii) production be brought up
to capacity operations at least as quickly as forecast in this report.
8.16      To overcome these two potential risks three specific countermeasures
have been taken. Firstly, the Project Managers and Project Engineers have
already been appointed to the project on an interim basis and have reviewed
all aspects of the project in considerable detail during the past six months.
The prospective lenders have had several opportunities to participate in this
review process. The project concepts and cost estimates here presented
reflect the results of this review and a high level of confidence can be
attached to them. Secondly, the construction time allowed for the project
in this appraisal is some 12-18 months beyond what might be considered rea-
sonable in an industrialized country situation. Given the high level of
international expertise which has been retained to implement the project
this is considered to be an adequate margin to take into account Tanzanian
conditions. Furthermore, since the key to adhering to the construction
schedule will not be the timely delivery of imported equipment, but the
timely execution of the civil works, these will be bid internationally and
particular attention will be paid to the speed of execution and the reli-
ability with which this can be achieved. Thirdly, substantial expatriate
assistance will be provided not only during project implementation, but also



- 48 -
during the critical stage of initial plant operations. While the scope of
assistance to be provided is eipected to be adequate, its impact can only be
as effective as the close cooperation that needs to be developed between the
Company and those providing the expatriate assistance. Any deficiencies in
such cooperation are bound to result in delays in project execution and
increased project costs which Tanzania can simply not afford. While the
Government and NDC are aware of. the crucial nature of such good cooperation,
the Bank will need to put in a substantial supervision effort to foresee
oncoming difficulties early enough and help correct them.
8.17      The project also faces the risk that the experienced expatriates be
replaced by Tanzanians before the latter may be adequately trained. While the
training of local staff is one of the major tasks of the expatriate assistance,
the premature withdrawal of outside operational personnel would be an expen-
sive proposition. It is therefore intended that the Bank would have to give
its prior approval to any termiination of or substantive changes in these
assistance contracts.
8.18      Furthermore, the project may encounter a certain market risk since
the mill will not only have to be built somewhat larger than the initial
domestic market is predicted to support at the time of project start-up, but
the domestic market might grow somewhat more slowly than now predicted should
continuing foreign exchange constraints reduce paper imports in the meantime.
In such a case, a somewhat higher volume of paper will have to be exported
during the initial operating years of the project with resulting lower net
revenues to the project. This risk, however, is expected to be limited in
time and could be overcome by aL temporary increase during say 4 years in the
project's domestic selling price of paper, which is presently assumed to be
identical to the price of imported paper without any import duty. Such
temporary increase in domestic prices, which appears to be fully justified,
would also help to overcome possible initial liquidity difficulties of the
Company and thus make it independent of budgetary support from the Government
that would otherwise be needed to overcome such difficulties.

Possible alternative uses for each type of wood, and the economic value
derived therefrom, are discussed in the following paragraphs.
2.     Plantation pine:  The plantations have been established primarily
for the pulp and paper mill and the silvicultural treatments (tree spacing,
thinning and pruning) have been designed with this in mind. Nevertheless,
a program of plantation establishment and maintenance could be modified so
that in the long run, up to 70% of the wood could be used for sawmilling.
This would require improvements to the stands and the extension of the rota-
tion age from 15 to about 25 years with attendant higher costs. By age 25
the accumulated cost of the trees would be more than double the amount of
T Sh 55 per m3 accrued by age 15, but as sawlogs they would be worth this
amount. Thus, in the absence of the project, 70% of the trees already
established wouldhave a value of T Sh 55 per m3 at age 15, which would further
increase until full growth to sawlog dimensions has been achieved. The remain-
ing 30% would be removed as thinnings at age 15 but could be used only for
fuelwood or as poles for buildings.
3.     Within a radius of about 25 km of the project area there is an
estimated population of 30,000 people. Fuelwood for cooking and heating in
the region is estimated at approximately 0.5 m3/capita giving a total demand
for fuel wood of 15,000 m3 annually. Based on a coal price of T Sh 285 per
ton, fuelwood has a value of about T Sh 40 per m3 delivered. Allowing T Sh 25

per m  for felling, and T Sh 4 per m  for an average haul of 10 km, the
residual worth of the fuelwood at the stump is about T Sh 11 per m3.
Thus, of the 30% of the volume of pine not suitable for retention as saw-
logs, equivalent to 59,000 m3 meters annually, 15,000 m3 could be used as
fuel. Approximately one-half of the balance could be used as poles, and a
stumpage of T Sh 20 per m3 has been taken as a realistic estimate of the
value of this material. The balance of the volume would have no alterna-
tive use and therefore no economic value.
4.     Of the 196,000 m  reaching age 15, therefore, the alternative uses in
the absence of the project would be as follows:
(i)    70% or 137,000 m3 would be left to continue to grow to
sawlog maturity.  The   accumulated cost of this volume
(and imputed value) at age 15 would be r Sh 55 per m3;
(ii)   15,000 m3 would be sold as fuelwood for a stumpage of T Sh 11
per m3 which is the equivalent coal price adjusted for heat-
ing value, felling and transportation;
(iii)  20,000 m3 would be sold as poles at an assumed stumpage of
T Sh 20 per m3; and
(iv)   24,000 mi  would have no use.
5.     Plantation eucalyptus:  has not yet been established and need not therefore be
considered in determining the economic value of existing plantation stands.
6.     Wattle:  is presently of no value except for aL minimal local use as
fuelwood. In the absence of the project it will continue to have no value.
7.     Sawmill chips:  have some local value as fuel but as noted above
(para. 4) the total requirement for fuel can be more than adequately met by
forest residues.  In the absence of the project, therefore, they would have
no alternative use.
8.     Overall, the stumpage or purchase price of wood in the absence of the
project would be as follows:

9.     The average stumpage of T Sh 32/m3 is thus about 60% of the-average
financial value of T Sh 52//m3 for the existing wood supplies. For the
plantations yet to be established, no such adjustments were made.

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The assumptions used in the economic analysis are identical to those
used for the financial analysis (detailed in Annex 7-1) with the following
adjustments:
(i)    Unskilled labor has been valued at 50% of its financial
cost;
(ii)   An overall shadow exchange rate of r Sh 12 to the dollar
has been used for all foreign exchange costs and benefits;
(iii)  Stumpage for wood to be logged from plantations which have
already been established has been reduced to 60% of its
financial value; and
(iv)   Infrastructure costs not recovered through direct charges
(i.e. 50% of the cost of the escarpment road and 25% of the
cost of establishment of the basic township) have been added
to the project capital costs.
Details of the analysis are contained in the four attached tables.
