THIRD LIVESTOCK DEV'ELOPMENT PROJECT (SUPPLEMENTARY)
SUMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.         In June 1970, the IBRD made a loan (698-UR) of US$6.3 million to
Uruguay for a Third Livestock Development Project. The loan was intended to
meet the estimated foreign exchange costs of the national livestock develop-
ment program for a period of approximately one calendar year (1971). However,
rancher demand for credit under the program has exceeded expectations with
the result that ranch development categories of Loan 698-UR are estimated to
be fully committed by May 31, 1971. The borrower has, therefore, requested a
supplementary loan of US$4.0 million to help carry on the program during the
present year pending appraisal of a longer-term Fourth Livestock Development
Project.
ii.        Since June 1969, the IBRD and the Government of Uruguay have pursued
a dialogue on livestock sector policy improvements and on the reorganization
of the Project on-lending arrangements. During this period, the Government
took a series of difficult policy decisions, such as encouraging private meat
packing plants to modernize, closing inefficient large old public packing
plants, improving the structure and effectiveness of the meat inspection and
hygiene control services, widening the banking base for channelling develop-
ment credit to the livestock sector and restoring ranchers' eroded investment
incentives. These measures were supported by a rise in export prices and
brought forth a large demand for credit in 1971.
iii.       The results of this sector performance have been impressive.  For
example, meat exports in 1970 reached 153,000 m ton, worth a record US$88
million compared to 69,000 m ton valued at US$27.4 million exported in 1961,
the year IBRD lending started to this sector. Meat processors in 1969 and
1970 invested some US$8 million in modernizing 15 plants. Since the livestock
sector contributes over 80% of Uruguay's exports and 25% to GDP, maintenance
of sound sector policies and provision of adequate investment incentives
should contribute greatly to continued real growth in the economy.
iv.        The proposed IBRD loan would be used entirely for ranch develop-
ment. No additional funds for technical services are required at this stage
of the program. The financial rate of return on investments made by parti-
cipating ranchers is estimated to be between 25% and 30%, depending on the
type of ranch. These financial returns have stimulated ranchers to increase
their demands for development loans, which are indexed to cover possible
future inflation.
v.         International competitive bidding would be used for the bulk pro-
curement of pasture seeds and rock phosphate. Normal commercial channels
would be used for the purchase of other inputs such as fencing and water
point materials. This was the procurement procedure followed under Loan
698-UR.



- ii -
vi.       The proposed loan would be for 12 years, including a four-year
grace period. On the assumption that the IBRD interest rate wQuld probably
be 7.25% instead of the 7.0O under Loan (*8-UR, the Central Bank would
reduce its spread of 0.5% to 0.25% for this Loan only. This reduction in
the Central Bank apread would be carefully reviewed by the for-Okcoming
appraisal mission for the proposed fourth project.
vii.      The proposed loan of US$4.0 million would finance the Project's
estimated foreign exchange component.  The Project is techall    ay sound and
economically viable. The borrower would be the Government of Uruguay
which would bear the foreign exchange risk.

THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SUPPLEMENTARY)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Uruguay has requested additional funds to fi-
nance a considerable increase in rancher loan demand during the period of
the Third Livestock Development Project, Loan 698-UR 1/. This Supplementary
Project would be an interim operation similar in scope to the Third, pending
a fourth more comprehensive Livestock Project that should be ready for
appraisal in mid-1971.
1.02      Loan 698-UR, for US$6.3 million, was designed to cover the
period of calendar year 1971, during which the Government's progress in
resolving a number of livestock sector policy issues would be evaluated and
several major changes in Project organization and lending procedures consol-
idated. It continued the national livestock development program begun under
Loans 245-UR and 407-UR. This appraisal report is based on the results of
a visit to Uruguay by Mr. A. Schumacher in February 1971.
1I. PERFORMANCE UNDER LOAN 698-UR
2.01      For the development of Uruguay's livestock industry, 1971 is a
critical year. The Government has pursued a series of policies that has
provided considerable investment incentives to both livestock producers and
meat processors (Annex 1). Preliminary estimates indicate that subloans
under the Plan Agropecuario 2/ (PLAN) program in 1971 will be more than
double the rate of lending in recent years (Annex 2, Table 1). The meat
processing industry has invested US$8 million in 1969/70 for modernization
and plans to keep up the pace with the assistance of an IDB loan of US$13.7
million, signed in March 1971. This rate of investment in Uruguay's vital
livestock industry must be sustained if the agriculture sector is to
contribute effectively to the resumption of economic growth, and, at the
same time, improve the country's balance of payments. Continuity of IBRD
1/   See Appraisal Report Number PA-38a, dated June 11, 1970.  Loan 698-UR
was effective on February 11, 1971, the seven months delay due to the
problems of organizing a Livestock Fund in the Central Bank, obtaining
an approved subsidiary loan agreement between the Central Bank and a
participating bank and delay by the borrower in providing satisfactory
legal opinions.
2/   The Plan Agropecuario is the technical services unit organized under
Loan 245-UR to (i) assist ranchers in preparing ranch development plans
and (ii) supervise the execution of such plans. It is an autonomous
agency of the Ministry of Agriculture.

support is thus essential.
2.02      International and bilateral aid agencies have also been active
for a number of years in assisting the development of Uruguay's agriculture.

(under negotiation)
Total                                       1-11.4
2.03      Under Loan 698-UR, 60% of investment funds for ranch development
are provided by the IBRD, 20% by ranchers and 20% by local participating
banks. These investments form part of the ranch development plan drawn up
by each rancher with the assistance of a Project technician. In addition
to providing technical and consultant services, the Project finances
equipment and machinery to grow, harvest, clean, and certify quality legume
and grass seed.
2.04      The type and composition of ranch investments requested by farmers
in 1971 (pasture seeds, fertilizer, fencing, water points, corrals, handling
yards, etc) correspond in percentage terms to estimates made in 1969.
For example, over 60% of the requested on-ranch investment has been for
pasture improvement. Within this pasture improvement category, however, a
shift in the type of pasture being developed is noticeable. The medium and
large size ranchers are now applying for loans t.o develop the more expensive
(US$53 per ha) but quicker yielding conventionally sown pastures instead of
investing in the slower yielding but cheaper (US$17) methods of sod seeding
and oversowing. Under Loan 698-UR, a ratio of :10% conventional, 40% sod
seeded or oversown and 30% top dressing was forecast. An estimate made in
March 1971 indicates the 1971 ratio will be 36% conventional, 33% sod seeded
or oversown and 31% top dressing. The weighted average cost of pasture under
Loan 698-UR estimates was US$24 per ha. Now due to the above, this cost has
increased to US$28. A proportional increase in fixed investments such as



- 3 -
fencing and water points, however, has kept the overall composition of
on-ranch investments as estimated under Loan 698-UR.
A. Project Progress
2.05      Project progress in recent months has been better than anticipated.
The demand for loans, both in total number and in average size, has exceeded
the estimates. Originally, 3,000 ranchers were forecast to borrow an
average of US$2,400. Current estimates indicate, however, that about 3,360
ranchers will borrow an average of US$3,450. This includes some 160 ranchers
likely to obtain loans averaging US$17,000. This latter group is made up
of larger ranchers (para 3.03); stimulating them to invest on such a
substantial scale is a major breakthrough for the PLAN. Previously, they
had little incentive to intensify production on their properties, yet this
was vital to the development of Uruguay's livestock industry.
2.06      Currently all sizes of ranchers are eligible to borrow under the
EBRD supported PLAN lending program. In recent years, considerable numbers
of small ranchers with areas less than 100-ha have borrowed sums averaging
US$380 per year (see Annex 2, Table 2 for PLAN rancher size breakdown).
The average rancher borrowing under the 1971 Program has a ranch of nearly
500-ha carrying about 400 cattle and 800 sheep. He has partially developed
his ranch from previous IBRD supported programs and is further intensifying
his operation in 1971, reinvesting a portion of the profits made as a result
of his earlier investments. His typical net cash income before development
would be US$3,1001/ rising to US$5,200 in the 6th year of development. This
would compare to an average annual skilled urban worker's (bearing no risks)
household income of US$3,300 in 1970.
B. Organization and Management
Channeling of Loan Funds to Participating Lending Institutions
2.07      The Republic of Uruguay is the borrower under Loan 698-UR and
the Central Bank serves as its financial agent. An important change in
Third Project procedures from those followed in the two previous projects --
Loans 245-UR and 407-UR -- is the new role of the Central Bank in channelling
loan funds which should make it possible for private banks to participate
in the Project as well as the Government owned Bank of the Republic.
Participating Lending Institutions
2.08      Bank of the Republic (BOR).  Under Loan 698-UR, a separate section
in the BOR was created to deal solely with project lending activities. The
BOR has also streamlined its procedures to expedite loan handling since it
1/   This includes US$1,000 for owner's labor plus US$2,100 for returns to
his invested capital and management.



is now subject to competition from other participating banks. An example
of the new attitude was the personal canvassing by BOR branch managers of
ranchers to encourage them to borrow Project loan funds.
2.09      Other Participating Banks.  Three private banks have recently
demonstrated interest to the Central Bank to participate in the Project.
Banco Commercial is one of the largest Uruguayan private banks and has an
extensive branch network in the Project areas. Banco Federal del Interior
was formed from the merger of five smaller banks and is familiar with
livestock lending. The third is the Bank of America, established in Uruguay
in 1967.
Lending Terms and Conditions to Sub-Borrowers
2.10      According to ranchers, the terms of the indexed Project sub-
loans (minimum of seven years, with a grace period of two to three years
and interest of 11%) is one of the major reasons for the increase in credit
demand. Prior to 1969, non-indexed loan maturities had been progressively
reduced to one to three years by BOR to prevent an erosion of funds during
a period of inflation, which averaged nearly 30% annually between 1966 to
1969. Since 1969, development loans to PLAN sub-borrowers have been indexed
to annual changes in the price of meat and wool or the cost of living index,
whichever is lower. For 1969, these adjustments amounted to 8% and in 1970,
18%. The 1969 and 1970 record of interest payments by ranchers to BOR on
the adjusted outstanding principal of these loans has been good. Interest
payments in arrears beyond three months are only 5% of the total due, the
same percentage overdue as under previous non-indexed loans. This wide
acceptance of indexed loans by ranchers has been another major breakthrough
in Uruguay, due mainly to adequate incentives, which, combined with appropriate
loan maturities, has overcome the traditional reluctance of ranchers to
borrow through indexed loans.
Project Administration
2.11      The Project is coordinated by the Honorary Commission for the PLAN.
Its members include representatives from the Rural Association, Rural
Federation, Ministry of Agriculture, and Bank of the Republic. In 1970 a
representative of the Central Bank was added. The Commission meets weekly,
does its work efficiently, and is highly respected throughout the country.
2.12      The technical work of the PLAN is conducted by a Technical
Director, five regional directors and 50 technicians. These technicians,
most of whom live in the ranching areas, are competent and have developed
excellent relations with the ranchers.  In addition to the preparation
of ranch development plans, the Project technical staff devotes considera-
ble time to screening Project inquiries and is especially concerned with
promotional and educational aspects of new pasture development and ranch
management technologies. In 1971, detailed ranch budget and herd development
projections will be prepared by Project technicians for about 10% of the
3,360 ranchers expected to borrow under the Project. They will be subject
to intensive supervision. The Technical Director and a Livestock Economist,
both contracted under the Project, will give special emphasis to establishing
this supervision and budgeting program.

C. Impact of the Loan
2.13      Since mid-1969, following a period of deterioration in the livestock
sector, the IBRD and Government have pursued a dialogue directed at improving
policy management and the overall investment climate in this sector. The
results of these policy changes (3.06), introduced through Loan 698-UR, have
exceeded expectations - both for the rancher and for the economy. Beef
exports are increasing at an accelerated rate, as are also the local production
and consumption of such substitutes as pork, mutton, and chicken; improvements
have been effected in the structure and staffing of the meat inspection ser-
vices; and private meat packinghouses have invested in plant modernization,
including the upgrading of vital hygiene standards.
2.14      The IBRD's livestock lending program has had a number of important
indirect benefits such as:
(a) Livestock Sector Policy. For the first time, Government
policymakers are treating the livestock industry, rancher,
and processor, as an integrated sector, rather than focusing
on isolated sub-components. The Honorary Commission of the
PLAN has played an important coordinating role in this new
approach. Details of these sector policy improvements are
provided in Annex 1.
(b) New Technology. Under the first two IBRD livestock projects,
a new technology of legume/phosphate pasture improvement was
successfully introduced ........ instead of the conventional,
but excessively slow and expensive, ploughing up of whole
fields which were then fertilized and sown to a mixture of
grasses and legumes, the Commission (PLAN) experimented
with and sponsored the introduction of legumes and ferti-
lizer directly into the natural grasslands, first by means
of a special machine, the Australian sodseeder, and later
by dropping pellets of seeds and fertilizer from airplanes...
by 1964 the Commission knew more or less which method
should be primarily relied on in the different regions of
the country" 1/. These inexpensive original swards were
a demonstrated success, particularly in ensuring pasture
availability in the winter. They also provided ranchers with
incremental income enabling re-investment in both a larger
area of improved pasture on each ranch and a shift towards
the costlier but quicker yielding plowed, harrowed and
drilled grass/legume pasture. This on-ranch re-investment
is attributed by Albert Hirschman to the effects of
1/  Hlirschman, Albert 0. Development Projects Observed.  Washington, D.C.
The Brookings Institution, 1967, p. 41. This study was supported by the
Carnegie Corporation and the Brookings Institution. Eleven IBRD projects
were reviewed in depth.



-6-
technological innovation -- in this case the various new
techniques of pasture improvement and ranch management.
He writes:
"....it may fortunately be expected that the threat
of obsolescence and the availability of improved
technology which is characteristic of industries where
innovation is rampant will of itself induce (author's
italics) greater reinvestment even in an environment
that is not normally accumulation minded." 1/
2.15      In the Appraisal Report for Loan 698-UR, the economic rate of
return on the Project was estimated at about 21%. Financial rates of
return on new ranch investment were estimated at 22% for 1,000-ha ranches
and 23% for 500-ha ranches. With rising prices for Uruguayan beef exports
(US$460 in May 1969, and US$686 in December 1970), the financial rate of
return on Project investments has gone up. Ranch-gate beef cattle prices have
risen 70% since May 1969 whereas Uruguayan beef export prices rose 50% during
the same time, reflecting the influences both of Government policy changes
and international price trends on the ranch-gate price. For example, current
financial rate of return estimates are 27% for a typical 1,000-ha ranch
(Annex 3, Table 8). This rate compares very favorably to the 15% minimum
financial rate of return on new productive investment established under Loan
698-UR. At full development, the investments made under the 1971 program are
estimated to result in an annual incremental increase in beef production of
9,800 m tons, valued at US$6.7 million equivalent. Assuming each extra ton
of beef produced from the pasture improved in 1971 is exported, and charging
the taxes currently prevailing (Annex 1, page 4), the 1971 IBRD supported
lending program should result in an annual incremental fiscal revenue of
US$1,800,000 to the Government budget by 1975.
2.16      During the 1930's and 1940's Uruguay deveLoped the most advanced
system of social security, health and welfare benefits of any country in
Latin America. This system was built largely on the revenues generated from
taxation of the livestock sector. While recent inflation has cut into the
available benefits to an extent, the upsurge in livestock exports together
with higher beef prices has provided additional revenues to Government -- a
portion being used to restore eroded social security and other health and
welfare benefits.
2.17      With consultant assistance financed from Loan 698-UR, Government
has taken a number of organizational and training steps to improve its meat
inspection and hygiene control services (Annex 1). The U.S. has already
approved one meat plant and Uruguay intends to invite the U.K. (before June
1971) to inspect the various hygiene and foot-and-mouth control improvements
made by Government in the past 18 months. Related to this, the Ministry of
1/ Hirschman, Albert 0. Development Projects Observed, op. cit. pp. 164-
165.



Agriculture is preparing terms of reference for a study of Uruguay's beef
market potential overseas. The Ministry is also considering a second
study in order to determine the most appropriate type of merger between
the Comision de Abasto and the Instituto Nacional de la Carnes. This merger
is a requirement of Loan 698-UR. A nine months' extension to January 31, 1972
of the merger deadline was agreed to by the IBRD to provide an adequate
period for the implementation of the study.
III. THE THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SUPPLEMENTARY)
A. The Project
3.01      The requested loan is necessary to ensure the continued availability
of development funds to the livestock industry of Uruguay when ranch devel-
opment funds in Loan 698-UR, constituting 86% of the loan, are fully
committed by May 31, 1971. A proposed larger Fourth Project, which may
include sub-projects for pig development as well as beef cattle, is not
expected to be ready for appraisal before mid-1971. Therefore, to meet the
continuing demand for development financing and to maintain the current
momentum of lending, a Supplementary Project, which would be a continuation
of the Third Project, is proposed. This Project would cover the foreign
exchange cost of the additional credit commitments made for the 1971
planting season (February-June) and pasture seed, which must be imported in
September 1971 for use in February 1972. The Loan would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component, US$4.0 million, of the Project.
3.02      The Third Livestock Development Project (Supplementary) would be
restricted to purposes identical with those of Loan 698-UR. Benefits are
expected to be similar to those estimated for the Third Project.
B. Cost Estimates
3.03      Loan 698-UR was designed to finance the long-term on-ranch in-
vestment needs of about 3,000 ranchers, each of whom was to improve, on
average, 67 ha of pasture area as part of his overall ranch development
plan. However, data compiled by the PLAN after January 31, 1971, the dead-
line for applications for the February-to-June planting season, indicated
that original expectations were too modest (Annex 2, Table 4). About 3,200
ranchers with holdings below 2,500 ha and 160 ranchers with holdings above
2,500 ha are now expected to borrow under the PLAN. The 3,200 smaller ranchers
are expected to improve an average of 88 ha of pasture, while each of the
160 larger ranchers is expected to develop an average of 600 ha of improved
pasture. If realized, this rate of pasture development (375,000 ha annually)
would be nearly double the earlier estimates for 1971 of 200,000 ha.

3.04      Original appraisal mission estimates for Loan 698-UR and the
revised February 1971 estimates of on-ranch development credit demand are

Project-supported investments would be about US$13 million. Revised (Feb-
ruary 1971) figures reflect a demonstrated rancher demand that, at the
present rate of commitment, would increase the total investment to US$21.4
million, with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$10.3 million,
about 48% of total Project costs.

1971 planting season starting late January 1972 that must be imported in
September 1971 to replenish depleted stocks and to avoid any lending
gap in 1972.
/b   The total phosphate fertilizer subsidy in 1971 will amount to US$2.6
million. The increase from 1969 estimates is due to a US$4 increase
in the per ton subsidy plus an increase of 60,000 m tons in the estimated
tonnage required for 1971. These phosphate subsidies have made an
important contribution to stimulate rancher interest in trying a new
legume/grass/phosphate technology. Ranch gate phosphate prices are
currently US$40 per ton after deducting the subsidy, compared to nearly
US$70 a ton in the province of Buenos Aires in Argentina without such
subsidy. In New Zealand, by contrast, ranch gate prices are only US$28
ton, after deducting a freight subsidy. Consequently, there is widespread
acceptance of phosphate in Uruguay and New Zealand, but Argentine ranchers
have not had sufficient incentive to use it extensively. In the course
of the forthcoming appraisal of a possible Fourth Project in Uruguay, the
subsidy would be studied in the context of the IBRD's overall review of
Government policy performance in the livestock sub-sector and appropriate
recommenclations made.

3.05      All funds for the supplementary Project would be required to meet
additional rancher loan demand resulting from:
Amount             %
(us$ millions)
(a) an increase of 360 ranchers borrowing
in the present season compared with
original estimates                            1.7               23
(b) the documented loan applications of the
3,000 ranchers to improve an average of
112 ha per ranch, as compared to the 67 ha
per ranch estimated for Loan 698-UR          4.8                65
(c) the expressed preference of ranchers to
invest more heavily in the higher cost
but quicker yielding methods of pasture
development than anticipated under Loan
698-UR (see paras 2.04 and 2.14)             0.9                12
Subtotal                                7.4              100
(d) the requirement for pasture seeds in
September 1971 for early fall 1972
planting season.                             0.9
Total                                   8.3
3.06      Major reasons for the expanded level of ranch loan demand and
lending are:
(a) acceptance by the ranching community of the new
grass/legume pasture improvement and ranch manage-
ment techniques introduced by the PLAN under IBRD Loans
245-UR and 407-UR;
(b) improved investment incentives arising from continually
rising ranch-gate cattle prices (Ur$ 33/kg liveweight
in May 1969 to Ur$ 57/kg in February 1971), resulting
from internal policy reforms as well as rising
export prices for Uruguayan beef (US$460 per ton in
May 1969 to US$686 in December 1970);
(c) longer loan maturities (indexed) that are now a minimum of
seven years and a maximum of 10 years, including two to
three years of grace. In 1968 and 1969, loan maturities,
not indexed, were reduced to one to three years with a
grace period of one year to compensate for inflation.
Also, in late 1970, a more acceptable form of indexing was
agreed between the IBRD and Central Bank whereby the



- 11 -
cost of living index is to be established as the ceiling
on Project loan adjustment whenever the meat and wool index
rise in any year exceeds the rise in the cost of living
index (see para 2.10); and
(d) resumption of lending by BOR to all ranchers,
regardless of ranch size. BOR had previously set a
ceiling of 2,500 ha on ranchers eligible to borrow
under the PLAN program.
C. Procurement
3,07      International competitive bidding procedures would continue as under
698-UR and would be used for the bulk procurement of pasture seeds and rock
phosphate. Purchases of fencing and handling yard materials, farm machinery,
water point pumps and piping and building materials would be made by individual
sub-borrowers through normal commercial channels. An adequate selection of
international suppliers of farm machinery and water point equipment are
represented on the local aarket.
D. Disbursements
3.08      Categories I and II of Loan 698-UR are expected to be fully
committed by May 31, 1971. As of April 30, 1971, US$697,269 has been
disbursed and an additional US$4.5 million committed. No funds under the
proposed supplementary loan would be disbursed if funds for the same purpose
are available under Loan 698-UR. Under the proposed loan, disbursements would
be made for pasture seed (US$900,000) and rock phosphate (US$750,000) imports
on the basis of CIF invoices. For ranch development loans, 39% of the face
value of each subloan to ranchers would be reimbursed by the IBRD. (See Annex
2, Table 3, for quarterly disbursement estimates.) A separate account would
be created in the Central Bank's Livestock Fund to handle funds under the
proposed loan.
E. Lending Operations
3.09      The loan would be made to Uruguay on the same terms as those for
Loan 698-UR -- 12 years, including four years grace. On the assumption
that the IBRD interest rate would be 7.25% instead of 7.0%, the Central
Bank, as an interim measure, would reduce its spread of 0.5% to 0.25% to
compensate for this increase on this Fourth Project only. In the Project
scheduled for appraisal in mid-1971, this reduction in the spread to the
Central Bank would be reviewed. As under Loan 698-UR, the Central Bank
would act as financial agent for the borrower and would channel loan funds
to participating credit institutions. Project administration and lending
operations would be the same as under Loan 698-UR.

IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      A Supplementary Third loan of US$4.0 million is recommended to fill
the gap of approximately nine months between estimated full commitment of
Loan 698-UR funds (May 31, 1971) and the beginning of the proposed Fourth
Project. The assurances obtained in Loan 698-UR would be continued under
this loan, with the exceptlon that the requirement that the deadline for
submission of detailed plans for the Calprose seed cleaning and processing
plant (Section 5.09 of the Loan Agreement) be deleted, as the Government has
already submitted the plans, which were approved by the IBRD.

THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SUPPLEMENTARY)
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY
Importance of Livestock to the Economy
1.        Uruguay's livestock industry is the mainstay of the country's
economy. Exports of beef and wool and their by-products account for ap-
proximately 85% of Uruguay's export earnings. Although official national
account statistics attribute only 9% of Uruguay's gross domestic product
to the industry, it probably generates, with ancillary industries, related
transport and services, between 25% and 30% of Uruguay's national income.
The sector including the meat packing industry also accounts for about 10%
of total recorded employment. Beef and wool are, therefore, the pillars of
the economy and help to provide the country's 3 million inhabitants with a
per capita income of about US$590, third highest in Latin America.
2.        During the period of disbursement on the first two livestock
loans, 245-UR and 407-TR, covering roughly the 1960-68 period, inflation,
discriminatory fiscal policies and Government disregard for modern-day in-
ternational hygiene requirements bore hard on the key livestock sector in
Uruguay. These factors inhibited investment to improve herd and pasture
productivity, and, in 1969, led to a ban by the United Kingdom (Uruguay's
largest single client until then) and by the United States of all imports
of Uruguayan beef products. Thus, despite the successful establishment
of the principle of increased livestock production through modern pasture
inprovement and management techniques, the overall objective of the first
two loans - increased exports of beef products - was not achieved. Worse
still, Uruguay lost access to two important export markets.
3.        In light of these developments, an intensive dialogue between the
IBRT) and Government was established on livestock industry sector policies.
Stress was given to:
(a) rancher investment incentives;
(b) modernization of the meat processing industry;
(c) improvement of the meat inspection and hygiene control
service; and
(d) strengthening of local capabilities in meat marketing.

Production Patterns, Land Use and Farm Size
4.        Uruguay's 14.9 million ha of pasture land supports about o mil-
lion cattle and a sheep flock of 23 million. Carrying capacity averages
about one head of cattle and three sheep per 2 ha. Production per i"a of
unimproved pasture averages some 40 kg of beef (liveweight), 5 kg of wool
and 10 kg of mutton. This compares to about 120 to 150 kg of beef, 10 kg
of wool and 25 kg of mutton on improved pastures, which, as a result of
programs supported by the two previous loans, now account for 7% of Uruguay's
livestock area. As Uruguay can no longer bring large areas of new land into
use, increased livestock production must continue to come from inicreasing
animal and per-ha yields. The possibilities are great, particularly since
the larger producers (some 3,900 farmers have holdings of more than 1,000
ha, see table below) occupy about 60% of the livestock area and manage
about 60% of Uruguay's cattle herd and sheep flock.

Production, Consumption and Exports
5.        From the available data, certain trends in production, consumption
and exports are emerging. While production has continued to rise, exports
have risen faster, with a result that consumption has declined, This trend
is shown in the following tables,

Taxes and Subsidies
6.         Since 1969, Government has initiated a number of tax clianges that
have improved rancher incentives. Beef export taxes were reduced and, more
importantly, the structure of the export tax system was modified. Uiider the
new system, higher processed meat exports pay a reduced tax percentage.
These changes, combined with risinpg beef prices for Uruguayan meat exports,
enabled processors to make more money on exports than they could on local
sales. As a result, the financial rate of return on new rancher investment
rose from 8% in May 1969 to 38% in February 1971 (Annex 3, Table 3).  The
following table indicates the swings in various margins, external prices and
producer gross and net prices:

7.        Rates of return would likely have increased further if ranch-gate
wool prices had not fallen nearly 20% during the same period, due to a drop
in international wool prices and a substantial increase in Uruguay of proc-
essing and marketing costs. These trends are evident in the following table:

In July 1970, the IBRD engaged a consultant to carry out a brief review of
the wool industry. his report indicates that a shift towards sheep for
meat rather than wool is occurring.
8.        Subsidies on phosphate fertilizer, financed from the earmarked
proceeds of beef export taxes, have been a major stimulant to rancher in-
vestment. Government has set aside US$2.6 million for these subsidies in
1971. Ranchers now pay US$40 per ton, as compared to $65 to $70 per ton
charged in   neighboring Argentina.
9.        In 1969, the work force of the Frigonal 1/ went on strike for
four months. During this period, Government suspended its beef and mutton
supply monopoly to Montevideo and allowed private meat plants to sell on
the internal market. In the ensuing scramble for this profitable trade,
meat plants competed for slaughter cattle for the first time and bid up
the price some 30%, to an average of Ur$ 43 per kg liveweight. After the
strike ended, Government found it impossible to force the producer prices
back down to an average of Ur$ 33 per kg and they have risen to the higher
levels of Ur$ 57 per kg.
The Processing Industry
10.       Status.  Uruguay's meat processing industry has altered radical-
ly in the past five years. The importance of the five large old city-based

plants operated by the Government has diminished and some 17 smaller and
more efficient privately-owned plants operating outside of Montevideo now
account for a major portion of Uruguay's beef exports. These smaller plants
have invested over US$8 million in installing modern processing capacity and
in improving their hygiene standards. Part of this investment, plus addi-
tional funds for further plan modernization, is to be supported by an Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) loan of US$13.7 million, signed on March 1,
1971.
11.       Recent Policy Changes.  In an effort to solve the problems that
had plagued the industry for so long, Government began, in 1969, to take a
series of important policy steps that have been basic to the modernization
of cattle slaughtering and processing in Uruguay. The actions outlined
below were specified either by decree or by incorporation in various laws
and all were put into effect between 'May and November 1969. In this pe-
riod, Government:
(a) substituted a cash payment for that portion of the
Frigonal's worker's wage received in beef. Each work-
ing day, all employees formerly got 2 kg of beef, at
least half of which they sold outright. Implementation
of this measure led to general labor strife in Mon-
tevideo (para 9);
(b) abolished Frigonal's monopoly of cattle slaughter and
beef supply to the Montevideo market. All meat packing
plants are now able to supply the domestic market under
a flexible quota system;
(c) designated funds in the 1970 budget to permit the trans-
fer or retirement of 450 of Frigonal's administrative
personnel;
(d) established a 3% sales tax on all meat sold by the pri-
vately and cooperatively owned packing plants in the
domestic market. The proceeds of this tax, to be iheld
in a special fund, are to be used for (1) restructuring
the industry, (2) improving the marketing of beef, and
(3) compensating blue collar wqorkers laid off from
Frigonal and EFSCA (Workers' Packing Plant Cooperative);
(e) closed the inefficient EFSCA plant, Artigas, and took
over EFSCA's Board of Directors; and
(f) abolished all import duties and surcharges on the equip-
ment imported for the modernization program of the packing
industry. The average level of import duties, sales tax,
port charges, and the like on such equipment varied from
50% to 100% of the CTF values. This reduced the proc-
essor's incentive to restructure his plant to meet the
hygienic requirements imposed by the U.K. and U.S. and

desired by other buyers, or to vary his beef export prod-
uct mix to meet the changing pattern of international meat
demand.
Meat Inspection and Hygiene Control
12.       During this period of transformation, the Ministry of Agriculture
initiated a number of measures to improve its meat inspection and hygiene
control services.. While full coordination of the three entities -- foot and
mouth control, hygiene engineering and meat inspection -- under one man has
not been achieved, substantial improvement in each of these areas is evident.
The main policy changes direct:
(a) payment of meat inspectors by Government and not by the
meat plants:
(b) rotation and training of meat inspectors;
(c) training of three enlgineers in hygiene facilities and
control as well as the amalgamation of their office with
the office of "Profrigos." The latter has been set up
to supervise IDB's meat processing loan;
(d) reorganization of the administrative structure of the meat
inspection service; and
(e)  start of construction on a national system of truck and
railwagon washing and disinfectant points to control the
possible spread of foot-and-mouth disease by truck or
railwagon.
These measures are beginning to have results. The U.S. Government meat in-
spectors have cleared one plant and an invitation to the U.K. inspectors is
expected to be issued before June 1971.
Marketinjg
13.       During 1970, Uruguay had no problem in marketing its beef.  The
international shortage continued, compounded by reduced exports from
Argentina during the second half of the year. The situation permitted
an increase in Uruguay's average export beef prices from US$475/m ton in
1969 to US$686/m ton ton in December 1970. Since it is impossible to pre-
dict how long beef prices will rise or if shortages will continue to exist,
it is vital that Urnguay consolidate and expand her present market posi-
tion, especially for more processed forms of beef.
