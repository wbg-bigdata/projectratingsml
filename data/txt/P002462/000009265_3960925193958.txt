MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Somalia
Agov Gas Delineation Proiect (Credit 1464-SO)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Somalia - Afgoy Gas
Delineation Project (Credit 1464-SO)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
No Part II was provided by the Borrower.
The project did not achieve its main objective which was to prove
sufficient commercial 8as reserves in the Af Soy field (the two wells funded under
the loan were dry).   The exploration promotion and technical assistance
components were more successful as they appear to have contributed to increased
exploration activity by foreign oil companies in other areas; however their
sustainability is unlikely given current country conditions.
Overall, the project is rated unsatisfactory, its institutional
impact partial and its long-term sustainability unlikely. The Project Completion
Report is reasonably thorough and informative. No immediate audit is planned.

AFGOY GAS DELINEATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1464-SO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Afgoy
Gas Delineation Project in Somalia, for which Credit 1464-SO
in the amount of SDR17,500,000 was approved on May 1, 1984.
The project was technically closed on June 30, 1991, three
years behind schedule. Because of outstanding claims against
the credit, however, and the continuing civil war in Somalia,
the credit account remains open. The credit was 79 percent
disbursr.. and the last disbursement was on November 26, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division
of the Africa Region Technical Department. As no recognized
government exists in Somalia at the present time, there will
be no Part II of the PCR.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's
last supervision mission in April, 1990 and is based, inter
alia, on the President's Report, the Credit Agreement,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, supervision
reports, personal knowledge and discussions with former
members of the project team.

EVALUATION SUMKARY
obiectives
1.        Exploration for hydrocarbons has been going on in
Somalia since the late 1940s. Some shows of oil and gas have
been encountered, but all have been deemed to be non
commercial. The Afgoy gas discovery, which is reported to
have flowed natural gas from two zones at a combined rate of
over 13 million cubic feet per day, was found by Sinclair Oil
Company in the 1960s approximately 30 km from Mogadishu and
was declared, at that time, noncommercial.   In the early
1980s, the Government asked the International Development
Association to assist them in the development of the Afgoy gas
field so that gas could be made available for generation of
power for the Mogadishu market.
2.        In addition to the development of the Afgoy gas
field, the project also aimed at the strengthening of the
Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (MMWR) by training of
NMWR personnel, construction of a core and sample storage and
the purchase of materials and equipment for the MMWR.
Previous to the Afgoy delineation project, the Petroleum
Exploration Project (PEPP) was designed to promote open
acreage to international oil companies and to assist the MMWR
in negotiation and monitoring of ongoing exploration
activities.   At the closing of the Petroleum Exploration
Promotion Project, the Afgoy Delineation Project was to
continue on with the acreage promotion, monitoring of oil
company activities and continued evaluation of hydrocarbon
resources of the country.
Imlementation 9xnerenceo
3.        A   credit   for   SDR17,500,000   (US$18,000,000
equivalent) was approved by IDA in May 1984 to develop the gas
resources of the Afgoy gas field. In addition, the European
Investment Bank approved a loan for ECU7,000, 000 (US$5,700,000
equivalent) to assist in financing the project. To accelerate



iii
delineation of gas resources, a PPF advance of about US1.0
million was made to finance a detailed seismic survey of the
Afgoy area and the drilling of wells.   The credit also
financed energy studies including a power planning and gas
utilization study. The credit also provided for training of
Somali technicians, continued petroleum exploration promotion,
construction of a core and sample storage and rehabilitation
of the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (MMWR)
premises. Scheduled closing of the project was June 30, 1988
but was postponed three times until June 30, 1991.   The
project; however, was suspended in December 1990 when the
government was overthrown during the civil crisis in the
country.
4.        Under World Bank and European Investment Bank (EIB)
funding, and in accordance with World Bank Guidelines, the
MMWR hired consultants and contractors as outlined below. On
the basis of interpretations of the detail seismic survey, two
delineation/development wells were drilled on the Afgoy
structure. Afgoy No. 2, the first well, was drilled about 3.2
km from Afgoy No. 1, the Sinclair well drilled in the 1960s
but encountered no gas. Afgoy No. 3 was drilled only 800 m
from Afgoy No. 1 and it too encountered no gas. A great deal
of thought and discussion was given to the possible drilling
of  a third  delineation well  on Afgoy.    However  after
addAtional studies ox the Afgoy results were undertaken, the
recommendations of the consultants were to abandon the gas
development project in the Afgoy area until substantially more
was known about the accumulation of gas in thie Afgoy area. A
re-entry of Afgoy No. 1 was shelved based on the seismic
interpretation which suggested that greater gas reserves could
be encountered by drilling in a more crestal position on the
Afgoy structure.
5.        A new geological study and hydrocarbon potential
evaluation of Somalia was made and a personal one-on-one
promotion campaign was undertaken to attract oil companies to
Somalia. The project financed negotiation and legal expertise
to assist the Government in attracting several new oil
companies to Somalia to undertake exploration activities.
6.        The Hydrocarbon Unit, which is a part of the MMWR,
has been strengthened with additional trained personnel and a
new sample storage/files. Personnel are keen about their work
and are diligent in their monitoring of oil company
activities. A rehabilitation of the MMWR was to have been
completed were it not for the onset of the civil strife. New
materials and equipment were to have been procured which would
have aided the Unit in the monitoring of exploration
activities and interpretation of data from on-going oil
company projects.



iv
7.        As a result of the overthrow of the Siad Barre
government, all disbursements and other activities associated
with the project were suspended. Two students, who were at a
university in training financed by the project, for a time
were without financing as the Bank was unable to continue to
disburse  out  of  the  Credit  proceeds.    The  situation
jeopardized the continued education of the students.  Qvite
apart from the Bank project financing, the Bank has made funds
available to the students in order to defuse the situation and
allow them to continue their training.
Results and Sustainability
8.        The results of the drilling activities in the Afgoy
area were negative in that the gas reported by Sinclair in
Afgoy No. 1 was not encountered in the delineation wells.
Unt4l more is known about the gas in the area, there will
probably be no more drilling activity. The strengthening of
the MMWR has gone forward and has resulted in an MMWR which is
technically stronger with a much more useful infrastructure.
Unfortunately, the civil crisis terminated the rehabilitation
efforts of the MMWR.    International  oil companies have
responded to the promotion efforts of the MMWR by taking up
several new blocks  in the country.    Increased drilling
activities (until the outbreak of the hostilities) resulted in
increased foreign exchange expenditures by foreign companies
in the country and a rumored petroleum discovery in the
northern part of Somalia.   If this petroleum discovery is
confirmed, then cessation of the military activities is likely
to be followed by a sustained upsurge in the drilling activity
in Somalia.
Pindinas and Lessons Learned
9.        In retrospect, it would have been more prudent to
first prove the existence of the gas reservoir in Afgoy No. 1
with a careful re-entry program before drilling additional
wells. This was considered during the initial phases of the
project, but was rejected at the time the seismic
interpretations were made, as too dangerous due to the
presence of unknown foreign material in the hole, or ignorance
of the method of plugging. As the perception at the time was
that the seismic interpretation removed much of the risk of
failure, the risk of re-entry therefore was greater than the
risk of non-discovery of gas.   Now that the drillings are
completed, there is doubt as to the amount of gas at Afgoy.
10.       In projects where students are funded to attend a
university or other institution of higher learning, it should
be possible to disburse sufficient funds fox the term of the
training instead of term by term. Thus, credit funds would be



v
disbursed to another agency (university, consulting firm, or
NGO) to cover all of the education expenses insteae. of
individual semesters or quarters, as well as to control the
student's performance.
11.       A midterm implementation review should have been
conducted to assess the validity of the project under
implementation and allow design modification if necessary as
would have been the case with Afgoy. The Africa Region is now
requiring mid-term reviews during implementation of all newly
anproved projects.

Country             : Somalia
Sector              : Energy
Subsector           : Petroleum
B.   BackQround
1.        Somalia Is energy resources are considered modest, at
best, consisting of fuel wood derived from a depleting forest
base and  a small hydro generating  capacity.    Although
petroleum companies have been prospecting in Somalia since the
1950s, no commercial scale hydrocarbon accumulations have been
identified. Petroleum imports accounted for only 17 percent
of the energy consumption in 1982 although commercial energy
consumption has grown 14 percent per year throughout the 1970s
and early 1980s. The remainder, 86 percent approximately, of
the energy consumption is supplied by fuel wood. Electricity
is supplied through isolated systems to Mogadishu and other
centers of population and is based entirely on fuel oil and
diesel-fired generation. Total installed capacity in 1982 was
estimated at about 60 MW and consumption at less than 90 GWh
(22 Kwh per capita), one of the lowest consumption levels in
sub-saharan Africa.
2.        The responsibility for the energy sector at the time
of implementation, was divided among a number of Government
institutions. The Ministry of Minerals and Water Resources
(MMWR) was in charge of developing mineral fuels, including
petroleum as well as hydrological resources.  The National
Petroleum   Agency   was   responsible   for   importation,
transportation and distribution of petroleum products, the
Ministry of Public Works supervised the power utility, Ente
Nazionale Energia Electrica (ENEE), and the Economic
Commission of the Presidency was instrumental in setting
energy prices and in approving energy sector investment.
3.        During the 1960s, the Sinclair Oil Company explored
a portion of Somalia for petroleum. Among those wells drilled
by Sinclair was Afgoy No. 1, located some 30 km from
Mogadishu, which was drilled in 1965 and encountered gas in



2
the Sagalah formation, a sandstone of Cretaceous age.  Gas
tested was 6.4 MMSCF (12710-12720 foot interval) and 7 MMSCF
(12,540-12544 foot interval) both with a small amount of
condensate. Preliminary estimates by Sinclair of possible gas
in place were approximately 50 MMMSCF. The well was abandoned
by Sinclair as being non-commercial at that time. The Qoriole
No. 1 well drilled later by Sinclair also showed non-
commercial quantities of oil and gas and was abandoned.
4.        A seismic survey of the Afgoy-Qoriole areas was
financed under the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project,
Credit 1043-SO. The objective of this project was to prepare
a geological evaluation of the country with the aim of
interesting foreign oil companies in coming to Somalia to
explore  for petroleum.    The project  identified  sqveral
interesting features and suggested that the Afgoy No. 1 well
was located on the flank of a promising structure.   The
results of a follow-up detailed seismic survey, financed by a
PPF were favorable.  However no oil companies were int_rested
in developing the gas potential of Afgoy because of the lack
of export potential. Hence, the Bank undertook to develop the
Afgoy gas resource.
C.   Prolect Oblegtive. a_d Deuoription
5.        Project ObJectives:  The objectives of the project
were:  ti) to delineate sufficient gas reserves for the
production of the Afgoy gas resource, thereby developing a
domestic energy source close to Mogadishu; (ii) to develop an
appropriate local gas authority; and (iii) to continue to
strengthen the Borrower's national petroleum administration
and to support its petroleum exploration promotion efforts.
6.        ProJect Desgrit ion:  The project consisted of the
following parts:
Part A:   Preparation and management of
the drilling operations.
Part B:   Drilling of two wells on the
Afgoy gas structure, followed
(if necessary) by the re-entry
and completion of the Afgoy No.
1 well as a back-up producer.
Part C    Preparation    and    detailed
engineering for a subsequent
gas development project.
Part D:   An electric power planning and
gas utilization study.



3
Part E:   (1).    Strengthening    MNWR
through:
i.  Assistance in drilling ope-ations and sector
management;
ii. Provision of office and technical equipment,
vehicles, construction of a core and sample
storage and other buildings;
iii. Overseas and on-the-job training and study
tours.
(2). Assisting MMWR in the audit of
the  drilling  operations  by  a
qualified  international  auditing
company.
D.   Proiect Degign and Organization
7.        The development of the Afgoy gas resource was to
have been undertaken in two phases, (a) a delineation phase
and (b) a development phase.  This project, Cr 1464-SO, was
designed to be the delineation phase and would finance the
drilling of two Afgoy delineation wells and the re-entry of
the old Afgoy No.  1 hole.   The productive capacity and
deliverability of these wells were to have been confirmed
through production testing.   Assuming that suff3cient gas
would have been proven, the development phase or follow-on
project would have consisted of the installation of surface
facilities at Afgoy, including a pipeline to Mogadishu and
retrofitting investments to convert major potential customers
to natural gas.
S.        The project was set up to be supervised by the MMWR.
A drilling management firm with a drilling manager resident in
Mogadishu had full control over the drilling operations and
the ordering of drilling supplies and material.  Suppliers
were under subcontract to the Government but administered by
the drilling manaaement firm. Exploration consultants had the
responsibility for all of the geological, geophysical and
engineering results and evaluations of the potential
reservoirs.
9.        The  project  concept  -  to  delineate  the  gas
accumulation for eventual production to be used for power
generation and some domestic use of LPG and other power or
energy requirements in Mogadishu - was sound. The cost of the
imported petroleum fuel which would be substituted formed the
basis for the economic justification of the project.
10.       At the time of project design, it was anticipated
that this project would also continue with the petroleum
promotion  aspects  of  Credit  1043-SO,   improving  the
infrastructure of the MMWR, training of its technical
personnel and monitoring of the increasing oil company
activities.

E.   XMJlem_ntatipm of the Projoct
11.       As a result of the interpretation of the detailed
seismic work, Afgoy No. 2 was drilled approximately 3.2 km
east of Afgoy No. 1. The interpretation suggested that the
gas-bearing horizon would be encountered some 250 ft higher
than at Afgoy No. 1, a much more favorable position on the
structure. When Afgoy No. 2 proved to be non productive, a
reinterpretation of the detailed seismic data was undertaken
by the  exploration consultants.    In meetings  with  the
consultants, MMWR and the World Bank, a location for Afgoy No.
3 was chosen close to Afgoy No. 1 in an effort to maximize the
possibiiity for a productive gas well.  When this location
also proved to be noncommercial, the emphasis in the project
was redirected toward exploration promotion, technical
assistance, construction of a core and sample storage and
rehabilitation  of  the  MMWR  offices.    The  exploration
consultants were instructed to prepare a re-evaluation of the
data to explain the results of the delineation and to propose
project activities to follow.
12.       For the project to finance the bulk of the local
costs involved in the construction of the core and sample
storage and the rehabilitation of the buildings of the MMWR,
the Development Credit Agreement was modified to allow for
payment of 80 percent of the local costs incurred under
category 1. At the time of the closing of the project, the
core and sample storage building had been completed and in
use. The rehabilitation of the MMWR building had just started
when civil unrest halted the activities.
13.       In May, 1990, the MMWR and its consultants visited
the USA and the UK to talk with 17 international oil companies
about exploration in Somalia. All appeared enthusiastic about
the oil company reception, however, any possible follow-up
actions on the part of the companies were preempted by the
civil unrest which started in December, 1990. Since December,
1990, a number of oil companies have continued to visit the
consultants' offices near Denver to view available geological
data and discuss legal aspects.   This activity suggests
continuing interest in the country by the international
petroleum community.
14.       The Government was also interested in exploring
geothermal possibilities in the NE part of Somalia. IDA and
the Government failed to agree on what a geothermal component
would entail; however, IDA and MKWR agreed that a geothermal
consultant would be contacted to prepare terms of reference
for a geothermal study which would then have formed the basis
by which the Credit Agreement would be modified to allow for



5
geothermal studies. Due to continued military activities in
the northern portion of Somalia, consultants were unable to go
to the geothermal manifestations located thtere. Consequently,
no follow up action was possible on the possible geothermal
component.
F.   Project Results
15.       The detailed seismic survey suggested that Afgoy No.
1 was drilled on a rather large structure which lay more to
the south and east of the Afgoy No.1 location.  Based upon
this rather optimistic interpretation, it was decided that
Afgoy No. 2 would be drilled approximately three kilometers
southeast of Afgoy No. 1 in order to test, what seemed to be,
a relatively large structure. When this well proved to be non
productive, a second well, Afgoy No. 3 was drilled about 800
m north of Afgoy No. 1. It was considered at the time, that
this well would be close enough to Afgoy No. 1 to encounter
the gas-bearing formation found in Afgoy No. 1. Again, Afgoy
No. 3 proved to be non productive with no indication of the
gas bearing strata encountered in Afgoy No.  1.   Current
opinion is that Afgoy No. 1 and Afgoy 2 and 3 are separated by
a  system  of  faulting  and/or  disconformity.    The  most
optimistic interpretation of the results would suggest a very
small restricted gas reservoir with something less than 4
MMISCF of total reserves which is too small to be of
commercial interest for power generation.
16.       Confronted with these rather dismal results in
drilling tests which were initially thought to be a low-risk
operation, interest in drilling further wells in the area
disappeared. In fact, no consideration was given to the re-
entry of Afgoy No. 1.  A final report by the exploration
consultants recommended that no further drilling be conducted
at Afgoy.   A study of the Afgoy area by the promotion
consultants supported this recommendation.  At this point,
approximately one year into the project and after an
expenditure of over US$10.0 million, the delineation of the
Afgoy Field was abandoned and the orientation of the project
changed to that of promotion.
17.       Given the project's changed focus to promotion, a
new consulting firm was hired to provide specialist advice.
Its terms of reference included, initially, a second opinion
on the results of the drilling at Afgoy and then to continue
with a new geological study and promotion report of the
sedimentary areas of Somalia. This restudy of the geology was
considered necessary as the report made by the consultants
under Cr 1043-SO was considered to be inadequate.   The
Government also contributed by helping to finance a study of
the Source Rock Potential of East Africa undertaken by another
consulting firm. The promotional efforts by the consultants
were successful in that several new companies entered into
production sharing agreements with the Government. Indeed,



6
even with the political situation in disarray, international
oil companies are continuing to examine the exploration data
which are presently being held by the exploration consultants.
One of the unexpected benefits of the project has been the
safe keeping of the exploration data, including maps, tapes
etc., out of the country, which certainly would have been
destroyed had they been in Mogadishu.
18.       At the onset of the political unrest in the country,
and the start of the hiatus in the project implementation, it
was unofficially reported that one of the international oil
companies operating in Somalia had discovered petroleum in
unspecified quantities in one of their first exploration
wells. Most importantly, the recent results of exploration
drilling in the country have substantiated the theory that
Mesozoic rift systems underlie flat-lying Tertiary sediments
in the northern half of the country. This augers well for
continued high levels of oil company exploration in Somalia
once hostilities are terminated.
G.   Project Sustainability
19.       Under the Afgoy gas delineation part of the project,
there appears to be few lasting benefits to be realized aside
from the manpower training as well as the geological and
petroleum exploration data. The Petroleum section of the MMWR
has received a great deal of training which has already proved
to be helpful in dealing with oil companies wishing to
undertake exploration programs in the country. There still
remains the remote possibility that a reinterpretation of the
Afgoy data could lead the way to eventual development of the
gas resource.
20.       The construction of the sample and core storage
building for the MMWR was to house and store cores and
drilling samples from all of the wells drilled in the country
by  all  of  the  operators.    These  samples,  before  the
construction of the storage, were left piled in the yard
without any supervision or cataloguing. Construction of the
storage was completed within the budget and time frame.
Access to carefully stored samples is necessary if companies
are expected to make informed evaluations of the country's
geological data.
21.       Each of the international oil companies who made
agreements with the MMWR for petroleum exploration will spend
several million dollars of which an estimated thirty percent
will be spent in Somalia on goods and services. This inflow
of hard currency demonstrates the positive impact of the
project even without the discovery of petroleum.
22.       As  mentioned  above,  had  the  data  from  past
exploration  efforts  in  the  country,   including  well
information, geological and geophysical reports and original



7
seismic data not been in the hands of the promotional
consultants at the time of the civil unrest, it probably would
have been irretrievably lost. This, of course, would have set
back by several years, future petroleum exploration efforts in
Somalia.
H.  Bank Performance
23.       Throughout the project, the Bank has been supportive
of MMWR's efforts to delineate the gas at Afgoy, attract
international petroleum companies to Somalia to explore for
petroleum and to improve and upgrade the storage of cores and
samples in the country as well as the infrastructure of the
MMWR.   The Bank also played a strong constructive role in
insisting on a re-evaluation of the drilling location after
Afgoy 2 and a total re-evaluation of the project after Afgoy
3.
24.       Cross-effectiveness  clauses  in  the  agreements
between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and IDA caused
significant delays in the startup of the project at a time
when delays were most expensive i.e. during the arrival of
ocean shipments. Although IDA was prepared to go ahead with
the project, the EIB, because Somalia was in arrears in an
EIB-financed dairy project, suspended all disbursements to the
country.   In addition to delays caused by the suspension,
there was an increase in costs amounting to about US$200,000
caused by demurrage and vessel delays.
25.       Because of the civil unrest in Somalia and the
collapse of the government which signed the Credit Agreement,
IDA determined that December 30, 1990 would be the last day
that withdrawal applications would be honored. Consultants
who continued their dialogue with international oil companies
and stored valuable data thus had no recourse to funding.
Students who were in long-term training overseas were left
without any source of funding. Fortunately, after some delay,
the plight of the students has received compassionate
consideration from IDA and their education is being funded
from the World Bank's interest earnings, under the assumption
that the World Bank will be reimbursed by the Government once
the situation returns to normal in Somalia.
26.       Because of the experience  in the project,  the
following lessons, albeit in retrospect, may be learnt from
the project:
i.   The Afgoy gas delineation project was based on the
reported occurrence of natural gas in Afgoy No.1.
The substantiation of the presence of the gas, as
well as the quantities and the composition of it,
were to be accomplished by re-entry of Afgoy No. 1.
Fueled by an optimistic structural interpretation
and a general perception that a large gas



8
accumulation was present, this objective gradually
gave way to delineation drilling. Without re-entry
into Afgoy No. 1, there is no sure way to determine
whether substantial gas exists at Afgoy. If, as is
feared, the reservoir at Afgoy No. 1 is laterally
restricted, a controlled test of the gas flow from
Afgoy No. 1 might have shown rapid depletion, and
thus not a viable reservoir. The original project
concept should have been followed as much as
possible. Any material deviation, such as not re-
entering Afgoy No. 1, should have been decided only
after a great deal of deliberation.
ii. In future projects involving cofinancing by other
institutions, some thought should be given to
mitigating the consequences of a sudden and
unexpected cessation of disbursement by one
financier.  Moreover, projects where drilling is a
part of the implementation should be exempted from
cross-effectiveness responsibilities because of the
great expense (and danger) which could be caused by
a temporary, unexpected shutdown.
iii. Disbursement rules of IDA should be adjusted to
allow for disbursement of sufficient tuition and
subsistence payments so that students in training
may complete their curriculum. This would entail
changing disbursement rules so that training fees,
or tuition, could be disbursed on a yearly rather
than semester basis. Ideally, these disbursements
should be made either to the training institution,
consultants, or NGOs who would effect the payments
to the institutions when required and supervise
student performance.
iv.  A  midterm  implementation  review  should  be  an
integral part of projects where the continuation
and progress of the project is contingent on the
success or failure of early project components.
I.   BorroWer Perormance
27.       Except for some delays in preparation and submittal
of the annual audit, all covenants in the Credit Agreement
were met, as outlined in Table 8. The Project Implementation
Unit, set up under Cr 1043-SO, remained in place for this
project and has continued to be active in negotiations with
oil companies. The MKWR was quick to compensate landowners
for the damages created by the project activity.



9
28.       During the promotional part of the project, the MMWR
was very active in its negotiations with oil companies. Once
companies had set up their offices, the NMWR was prompt to
render assistance when needed by the companies in their
relations with the Government.
J.   Proiect Relationshig
29.       Bank relationship with Government and the MTWR on
the project has been good although Government had difficulty
believing that the gas delineation scheme had failed to find
the gas.
K.   Congulting and Contracting Seryices
30.       Consultina Services:   During the course of the
project,  a number of consultants were hired.   Each was
selected using the IDA guidelines regardless of the source of
funding. The following consulting services were used during
the project:
i.   ExDloration Consultants:   These consultants were
hired by the NMMWR to interpret the seismic data
prior and subsequent to the drilling and to make
geological interpretations of the drilling data as
they became available. Their work was considered
generally satisfactory but sometimes deficient in
substance.
ii.  Promotion Consultants:  These consultants were not
the same as those on Cr 1043-SO. They were hired
by the NMWR after completion of the drilling at
Afgoy. Their task was to reinterpret the geology
of Somalia and prepare a promotion rackage for
presentation to the oil industry. Their work was
considered above average and was much appreciated
by the MMWR.
iii. Legal Consultants: The legal work was considered
to be expensive but good.   Government used the
consultant in all negotiations sessions with oil
companies.
iv.  DriJliDg_Ma-r j.ment Firm: The firm was responsible
for the su' -vision of drilling and the ordering
and storag- of supplies and materials used for
drilling. Generally the firm did a credible job,
but fuiled, in one instance, to recognize the need
for special equipment needed during the program
which materially delayed the drilling and increased
costs.



10
v.   Power Planning Consultants:   These consultants,
selected according to IDA guidelines, undertook the
power planning studies in a satisfactory manner.
vi.  Financial  Consultants:    These  consultants were
responsible for the setting up of the accounting
system for oil companies as well as furnishing
audit reports for the project accounts. Their work
was done in a speedy, workmanlike fashion.
31.       Contractina Services: All contracting services were
obtained under  IDA's  procurement  guidelines.    Selection
combkittees were composed of MMWR and the drilling management
team.   The contracting services which were hired are as
follows:
i.   Seismic Acquisition and Processing Contractor:  The
contractor was the same as that used for Cr 1043-
SO.    Government was  quite  pleased with  their
performance.
ii.  Drilling  Contractor:    The  drilling  contractor
already had equipment and personnel in Somalia for
another oil company and could deliver the equipment
with little or no mobilization costs, hence at a
reduced overall cost, therefore the normal bidding
exercise was eliminated. The contractor did a good
job in all respects.
iii. Drilling Service Contractors: These contracts such
as, logging services, mud logging services, supply
of drilling mud, well cementing etc., were given
on the basis of competitive bidding. Funding, for
the most part, was from the EIB.   All service
contractors did a good job.
iv.  Construction  Contractor:    This  contractor  was
chosen on the basis of competitive bidding and was
responsible for the construction of the core and
sample storage building and the start up of the
rehabilitation of the NMWR's premises
La  Project Documentation and Data
32.       The Credit Agreement was adequate for achieving
project objectives although it could have been more explicit
in requiring periodic reports from the MMWR. The MMWR seemed
to depend rather heavily on the consultants to keep IDA
informed on to the progress of the project.   At best,
communications directly with the MMWR were poor, due
principally to technical problems such as lack of functioning
telephones and telex equipment.
