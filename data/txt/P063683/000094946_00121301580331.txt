|ANNEX 2
I Sample content of an EA Report for a Category A Project
A.2. 1 Bank Operational Policy 4.01, EnvironmentalAssessment, requires a full Environmental Assessment
for Category A projects - this is often an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). An EIA report for a
Category A project identifies and assesses the potential envirommental and social impacts of the project,
evaluates alternatives, and recommends appropriate mitigation, management, and monitoring measures.
The report's scope and level of detail should be commensurate with the project's potential impacts. An EIA
report should include the following items (not necessarily in the order shown):
Executive Summary
A.2.2 A concise summary description of the proposed transaction, the existing environment, significant
environmental impacts, recommended mitigation measures and monitoring proposals where applicable.
Operational context
A.2.3 Presents the purpose and need of the transaction. Presents the policy, legal and institutional
framework within which the EA is carried out, including international agreements. History of the operation
including alternatives is considered
Description of the transaction
A.2.4 Concisely describes the proposed transaction and any relevant geographic, ecological, social, and
temporal context. Indicates any need for pollution abatement measures, risk minimisation measures,

| Sample content of an Environmental Management Planl
A. 3.1 .A project's environmental management plan (EMP) (sometimes called an Action Plan) consists of a
et of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to eliminate adverse environmental and social
impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels. The plan also includes the actions needed to
implement these measures. Management plans are essential an element of EA reports for Category A
projects. For some category B projects, the EA may result in a management plan only. To prepare a
management plan, the "developer" (a) identify the set of responses to potentially adverse impacts; (b)
determine requirements for ensuring that those responses are made effectively and in a timely manner, and
(c) describe the means for meeting those requirements. More specifically, the EMP includes the following
components.
Mitigation
A.3.2. The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may reduce potentially significant
adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. The plan includes compensatory measures if mitigation
measures are not feasible, cost-effective, or sufricient. Specifically, the EMP:
(a) identifies and summarizes all anticipated significant adverse environmental impacts (including those
involving indigenous people or involuntary resettlement); (b) describes-with technical details-each
mitigation measure, including the type of impact to which it- relates and the conditions under which it is
required (e.g., continuously or in the event of contingencies), together with designs, equipment
descriptions, and operating procedures, as appropriate; (c) estimates any potential environmental impacts of
these measures; and (d) provides linkage with any other mitigation plans (e.g., for involuntary resettlement,
indigenous peoples, or cultural property) required for the project.
Monitoring
A.3.3. Environmental monitoring during project implementation provides information about key
environmental aspects of the project, particularly the environmental impacts of the project and the
effectiveness of mitigation measures. Such information enables the "developer" and the assessment
authority to evaluate the success of mitigation as part of project supervision, and allows corrective action to
be taken when needed. Therefore, the EMP identifies monitoring objectives and specifies the type of
monitoring, with linkages to the impacts assessed in the EA report and the mitigation measures described in
the EMP. Specifically, the monitoring section of the EMP provides:
(a) a specific description, and technical details, of monitoring measures, including the parameters to be
measured, methods to be used, sampling locations, frequency of measurements, detection limits (where
appropriate), and definition of thresholds that will signal the need for corrective actions; and (b) monitoring
and reporting procedures to (i) ensure early detection of conditions that necessitate particular mitigation
measures, and (ui) furnish information on the progress and results of mitigation.
Capacity Development and Training
A.3.4. To support timely and effective implementation of environmental project components and mitigation
measures, the EMP draws on the EA's assessment of the existence, role, and capability of environmental
units on site or at the agency and minstry level. If necessary; the EMP recommends the establishment or
expansion of such units, and the training of staff, to allow implementation of EA recommendations.
Specifically, the EMP provides a specific description of institutional arrangements-who is responsible for
carrying out the mitigatory and monitoring measures (e.g., for operation, supervision, enforcement,
monitoring of implementation, remedial action, financing, reporting, and staff training). To strengthen
environmental management capability in the agencies responsible for implementation, most EMP's cover
one or more of the following additional topics: (a) technical assistance programs, (b) procurement of
equipment and supplies, and (c) organizational changes.



Draft2 Environmental Operation Manual - BEA                                                7
Implementation Schedule and Cost Estimates
A.3.5. For all three aspects (mitigation, monitoring, and capacity development), the ENT provides (a) an
implementation schedule for measures that must be carried out as part of the project, showing phasing and
coordination with overall project implementation plans; and (b) the capital and recurrent cost estimates and
sources of funds for implementing the EMP. These figures are also integrated into the total project cost
tables.
Integration of EMP with Project
A.3.6. The "developer's" decision to proceed with a project, and the assessment authority's decision to
support it, are predicated in part on the expectation that the EMP will be executed effectively.
Consequently, assessment authority expects the plan to be specific in its description of the individual
mitigation and monitoring measures and its assignment of institutional responsibilities, and it must be
integrated into the project's overall planning, design, budget, and implementation.

ANNEX 5
I Outline of a Project Specific Major Hazard Assessment2
A.5. 1. A major hazard assessment is required for projects, which involve the transporting, storing,
handling, and processing of dangerous (flammable, explosive, reactive or toxic) materials. The threshold
quantities and further details on completing a major hazard assessment are provided in the World Bank's
manual, Techniques of Assessing Industrial Hazards: A Manual, Technical Paper No. 55, Washington,
D.C.. 1988.                                     t
A.5.2. The purpose of the major hazard assessment is to identify the scope of the use of dangerous
materials at the installation; the kind, relative likelihood and broad consequences of major incidents that
might occur, appropriate mitigating measures, including safety design, operating methods and emergency
procedures to prevent or control major incidents; and the schedule for implementing the mitigating
measures.
A.5.3. A major hazard assessment focuses on three areas: (1) information about the project's site, operations
and surroundings; (2) estimates of the impacts of potential major incidents which may occur at the
installation and the surrounding area; and (3) the means to prevent or mitigate the potential incidents.
A.5.4. The assessment is normally performed by an independent consultant having extensive industrial
experience in the areas of risk assessment and control of major hazards, as well as expertise in assessing the
specific dangerous materials and potentially hazardous operations associated with the project. The major
hazard assessment report should include the following sections:
A. Executive Summary: A concise discussion of the hazard concerns and potential consequences of a
major incident, and the recommended mnitigation measures and implementation schedule.
B. Project Description: A review of the project's site, operations and employment, and the nature of
the land use and distribution of the population in the vicinity of the installation.
C. Dangerous Materials: Details relating to the specific dangerous materials and quantities present at
the installation, and the hazards associated with their transportation, storage and processing.
D. Major Hazard Incidents: A description of the potential conditions and events which could lead to
a major incident, estimates of the expected impacts on the site, community and enviromnent, and
the measures taken to prevent, control or minimize the expected consequences of the incident
This section should include the criteria under which the emergency relief system was designed and
an outline of the emergency response plan dealing with a major incident
E. Management Systems: A sumnnary of the management systems, including staffing and training, to
ensure the safe design, construction and operation of the project, as well as to maintain the
-effectiveness of emergency equipment and the emergency response.

Guidance for Preparation of a Public Consultation and Disclosure
l,an
A.6. 1. Project sponsors are required to meaningfully consult with stakeholders on preparation and results of
the Category A EA and disclose to the public the results of the EA process. Ongoing consultation is also
required during the construction and operation phases of the project. Project sponsors might consult IFC's
Doing Better Business Through Effective Public Consultation and Disclosure: A Good Practice Manual.
The Manual provides guidance on effective public consultation and disclosure techniques for the private
sector, in accordance with international good practice.
A.6.2. A Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) should: (i) describe local requirements for
consultation and disclosure; (ii) identify key stakeholder groups; (iii) provide a strategy and timetable for
sharing information and consulting with each of these groups during various phases of the project; (iv)
describe resources and responsibilities for implementing the PCDP activities; and (v) detail
reporting/documentation of consultation and disclosure activities.
A.6.3. The Plan submitted by the sponsor must define a technically sound and culturally appropriate
approach to consultation and disclosure. The goal is to ensure that adequate and timely information is
provided to project affected people and other stakeholders, and that these groups are given sufficient
opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns. Important considerations include:
* written and oral communications in local languages and readily understandable formats
* easy accessibility to both written information and to the consultation process by relevant
stakeholders
* use of oral or visual methods to explain information to non-literate people
* respect of local traditions of discussion, reflection, and decision making
* care in assuring that groups being consulted are representative (with adequate representation of
women, vulnerable groups, and ethnic or religious minorities, and separate meetings for various
groups, where necessary)
*  clear mechanisms to respond to people's concerns, suggestions and grievances.
A.6.4. The sponsor must submit a Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP). The contents of the
plan should include the following:
A. Introduction. Briefly describe the project, including locational and design elements.
B. Regulations and Requirements. Summarize the in-country, local requirements (i.e., policies, laws,
regulations and review processes) for public consultation and disclosure related to local EIA
legislation or other aspects of the project.
C. Review of Any Previous Public Consultation and Disclosure. Summarize all public consultation
and information disclosure undertaken to date, including:
o the kinds of information disseminated, the forms this took (oral, brochure, report, posters,
radio etc.), and the means of dissemination;
o  the location and dates of meetings;
o  a description of the individuals, groups and organizations consulted;
o  an overview of the issues discussed;
o  description of how the issues raised were responded to by the project sponsor, including
an explanation if issues were not addressed; and
o  explanation of how these responses were commnunicated to those consulted and the wider
public.
D. Stakeholders. Provide an inventory of key stakeholder groups who will be informed and consulted
about the project. Stakeholders are persons who are affected by or can affect the outcome of a
3 Guidance note F, IFC

project. These can be affected communities, local organizations, NGOs and government
authorities. Stakeholders can also include politicians, commercial and industrial enterprises, labour
unions, academics, religious groups, national social and enviromnental public sector agencies and
the media.
E. Public Consultation and Disclosure Program. Disclosure of Information: The draft Category A
EA must be made available in the project country as early as possible and not later than 60 days
prior to the proposed Board date.- The sponsor should proactively disseminate a non-technical
summary of the EA findings, in a form and language meaningful to those being consulted, to local
stakeholders prior to consultation activities. Consultation: The PCDP should set out a program for
public consultation and information disclosure during the following stages: a) during the early
scooping phase, before the terms of reference for the Category A EA are finalized; b) once a draft
of the Category A EA has been prepared; and c) during the construction and operation phases.
This section should:
o summarize the goals of the program; and
o briefly describe the kinds of methods that will be used to communicate information to
each of the stakeholder groups identified in d) above. Methods used may vary according
to target audience, for example:
*  mass media, (newspapers, posters, radio, television);
*  information centres and exhibitions, with brochures, leaflets, posters, and reports
available;
* meetings and workshops; and
* posters and.other visual displays, etc.;
o briefly describe the methods that will be used to consult with each of the stakeholder
groups identified in section d) above. Methods used may vary according to target
audience, for example:
* interviews with key people and groups;
* surveys, polls and questionnaires;
* public meetings;
* public hearings;
* continuous participation processes involving agents or committees in the project
zone; and
* other traditional mechanisms for consultation and decision-making.
F. Timetable. Provide a schedule detailing when consultation and disclosure activities will take place
for each. stage of the process and each stakeholder group identified.
G. Resources and Responsibilities. Indicate what staff and management resources will be devoted to
undertaking the public consultation and disclosure program and who within the company will be
responsible for carrying out these activities? IFC encourages the hiring of a Community Liaison
Officer to arrange and facilitate these activities.
H. Effective consultation and information disclosure may require assistance from  specialized
consultants. The sponsor, however, should be involved in all consultations related to the project.
Appointment of a Community Liaison Officer is a good way to ensure and sustain this
involvement.
1. Grievance Mechanism Describe the process by which people affected by the project can bring
their grievances to the sponsor, in a culturally appropriate manner, for consideration and redress.
J. Reporting. Identify where and when the results of the public consultation and information
disclosure will be reported. This should include:
o the drafl EA repon;
o details of the results of consultation on the draft EA, as necessary; annual monitoring
reports

|Multilateral Environmental Agreements
A.7. 1 More than 200 multilateral environmental agreements (MEA) are known to exist. Some of these are
global treaties, open to any country: These represent an international structure for environmental
management that reflects the extraordinary diversity of issues and interests involved. Not all of these
agreements have entered into force, and not all those that have entered into force are ratified by all of the
member countries under this facility. Few of the MEA's actually regulate trade or contain trade provisions.
Of the 20 or so that do, even fewer are of notable significance to the environment-trade interface. Six of the
most important in the context of the ATI are discussed in greater detail below.

A.7.2 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora bans
commercial international trade in an agreed list of endangered species and their parts, as well as products
made from such species. It establishes trade controls, ranging from a complete ban to a partial licensing
system. It also monitor trade in other species that might become endangered. The Convention has three
appendixes listing species identified by the 146 member countries, Panies to the Convention, as being
endangered to various extents. These lists are continuously updated and may be visited on
http://www.wcmc.org.uk/CITES/index.shtnl. The Convention establishes trade controls, ranging from a
complete ban to a partial licensing system.
A.7.3 The Vienna Convention on Substances that Deplete the Stratospheric Ozone Layer, with the
Montreal Protocol establishes a regime of control for several classes of industrial chemicals that harm the
stratospheric ozone layer. There is a ban on the production and use of several of these chemicals and severe
limitations on others. It has successfiilly implemented the principle of precaution, by acting before the
availability of clear scientific evidence, and that of common and differentiated responsibility, by
establishing a fund to assist developing countries in their transition away from dependency on controlled
substances. Its principal enforcement tool, apart from continuing public pressure, is the control of trade in
ozone-depleting substances and trade in products containing controlled substances. The Vienna Convention
has 173 Parnies, while the Montreal Protocol has 172. The Protocol has been modified five times and so far
had its control provisions strengthened through four adjustments, the latest in Beijing in 1999. The list of
substances may be found on http://www.unep.org/ozone/mont_thtm.
A.7.4 The Basel Convention on Control of Transboundarv Movement of Hazardous Waste and their
Disposal was established as a resulted of the concern of developing countries, especially in Africa, that they
could become the dumping ground for hazardous wastes that could no longer be disposed of in the

industrialised world. It has been difficult to agree on the most appropriate way of controlling movements of
hazardous waste and technical difficulties in distinguishing between wastes and materials for recycling.
Parties to the Convention may only export hazardous waste to another Party that has not banned its import
and that consents to the import in writing. Parties may not export to or import from a non-party country.
They are also obliged to prevent the import or export of hazardous wastes if they have reason to believe
that the wastes will not be treated in an environmentally sound manner at their destination. The 131 Parties
have adopted amendments banning the export of hazardous waste from mainly OECD to non-OECD
countries. Further information might be found on http://www.basel.int
A.7.5 The Convention on Biological Diversitv with its 135 Parties has the objective of conserving
biological diversity, sustainable use of its components and sharing of the benefits of using genetic
resources. It has been difficult to make the Convention operationaL as the very concept of "biodiversity" is
developed to help understand the natural environment The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafetv covers trade in
most forms of living genetically modified organisms (LMO) and the risks it may present to biological
diversity. It creates an advanced informed agreement system for LMO's destined to be introduced to the
environment (such as micro-organisms and seeds), and a less complex system for monitoring those destined
for use as food, animal feed or processing. It sets out a procedure for countries to decide whether to restrict
imports of LMO's, spelling out the type of risk assessment that must be carried out. In allowing such
decisions to be taken even where the risks are unknown, the Protocol urges the use of the precautionary
principle. Living LMO's that will be intentionally released to the environment are subject to an advance
informed agreement procedure, and those destined for use as food, feed or processing must be accompanied
by documents identifying them. The Protocol was opened for signature in May 2000, and will enter into
force when ratified by 50 countries. A Biosafety Clearing-House is established as part of the Convention, in
order to: (a) Facilitate the exchange of scientific, technical, environmental and legal information on, and
experience with, living modified organisms; and (b) Assist Parties to implement the Protocol taking into
account the special needs of developing country Parties. Further information might be found on the internet
on the addresses: http://www.biodiv.org and http://www.biodiv.org/biosafe/protocol/Protocol.html
A.7.6 The Framework Convention on Climate Chane (FCCC) and its Kvoto Protocol seeks to reduce
emission of greenhouse gases and maintain carbon sinks to fight the threat of global warming. The
principal strategy of the FCCC is to change the pattem of future investment in favour of activities that
generate less greenhouse gases. It created two classes of countries-those with commitments to limit their
greenhouse gas emissions, mainly the OECD countries and those without current limitations, the
developing countries. Although neither the FCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol include trade measures today, it
is likely that the Parties will adopt trade-related policies and measures as a part of a set of mechanisms to
meet their Kyoto obligations. The FCCC has no legal obligations and the Protocol has not entered into
force. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Protocol might, when brought into force, take
forn of a transaction that might need the services of ATI. Further information may be found on
http://www.unfccc.de/
A.7.7 The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for Certain Hazardous
Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade seeks to regulate domestically banned or severely limited
goods are traded internationally. The Convention represents an important step towards ensuring the
protection of citizens and the enviromnent from the possible risks of trade in highly dangerous pesticides
and chemicals. UNEP, responsible for managing potentially toxic substances, and the FAO, concemed with
pesticide use, had a strong interest in developing a uniform system of notification. Such a system should
offer adequate assurance that information would be provided quickly, and that it would reach the necessary
authorities when needed. It also needed a system that pemitted developing countries to stop import of
certain substances if they felt a need to do so. The 62 signatories may decide, on the basis of an agreed list
of chemicals and pesticides, which ones they cannot manage safely and will not import. When trade in
these substances occur, labelling and information requirements must be followed. Decisions taken by the
Parties must be trade neutral-if a party decides not to consent to imports of a specific chemical, it must
also stop domestic production of the chemical for domestic use, as well as imports from any non-party
country. Further information might be found on in the form of Decision Guidance Documents. An updated
database PIC Database is also available. See furnher information on http://www.fao.org/pic, see also annex
10.

A.7.8 Other agreements and emerging regimes may establish rules and regulations for control or reduction
of environmentally adverse products and activities. The Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is
under negotiations and will establish an international regime for the control of, and in many cases, the
banning of certain pollutants that can persist in the environment and accumulate in the food chain. It may,
when operational, be of importance to the ATI. The International Forest Regime and regimes for
sustainable fisheries seems not to be realised within the near future. Several activities regarding labelling of
sustainable goods or practices are ongoing and may, if realised, be considered under this insurance facility.
A.7.9 International environmental regimes are based on consent. Only the PIC Convention has an elaborate
dispute settlement structure, reflecting the fact that it is designed primarily to manage trade in certain
hazardous substances rather than protect a specific environmental resource. It is widely recognised that
coercion is not a sound basis for environmental policy. Therefore, just as countries use criminal penalties to
enforce enviromnental laws only in cases of extreme disregard, so too do international enviromnental
regimes use coercive dispute settlement only on rare occasions. Transparency and participation are
arguably the most important implementation tools of international environmental regimes but
implementation may need the help of an arm's-length agency. Since NGOs can go where governments
sometimes fear to tread, they can be critical of countries' internal implementation of MEA's and exert
pressure on their own governments for good faith compliance.
