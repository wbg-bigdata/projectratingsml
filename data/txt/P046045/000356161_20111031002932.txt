1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
The project is the first phase of the rehabilitation of the Syr Darya basin identified under
the Aral Sea Basin Program (ASBP) approved by heads of the five Central Asian States
in 1994. The project was considered of strategic importance in addressing the
environmental issues of the Aral Sea basin.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
The desiccation of the Aral Sea over a period of forty years, caused by major diversions
from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers to serve extensive developments for irrigated
agriculture in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, had resulted in serious economic, social, and
environmental damage in and around the Aral Sea. This has often been described as “the
worst environmental disaster in recent history?.

More recently, over the last two decades, major increases in hydroelectric power
generation along upper river reaches in Kyrgyzstan, notably at the Toktogul dam on the
Syr Darya River, have taken place during winter, releasing water from reservoir storage
that would previously have been retained for release during summer for irrigation
purposes. Water released into the river during winter has had little productive impact
downstream, since most irrigation demands occur in summer. It had also not represented
much environmental benefit to the Aral Sea and adjacent river delta areas. This was
because of flow capacity constraints along key reaches of the Syr Darya River in
Kazakhstan, caused by bottlenecks including under-designed weirs, pontoon bridges, low
flood protection dikes, and other channel and infrastructure maintenance and safety
deficiencies, all made worse in winter due to ice formation. Much of the water arriving
into Kazakhstan has had to be spilled from the Chardara reservoir on the border with
Uzbekistan and diverted into desert sinks including the Arnasai-Aydarkul depression in
Uzbekistan, and into irrigation and drainage canals and channels, where it has caused
flooding problems and has been eventually lost to evaporation1.

Basin-Wide International Context

In order to address the Aral Sea crisis, the five Aral Sea Basin states requested assistance
from the international community. After diagnostic investigations in 1992, an Aral Sea
Basin Program (ASBP) was prepared in 1993 by the World Bank in coordination with
UNEP and UNDP, and was approved by the five Heads of State in January 1994. The
ASBP has four major objectives: (i) to stabilize the environment of the Aral Sea; (ii) to
rehabilitate the ecological disaster zone around the Aral Sea; (iii) to improve and
integrate the management of the international waters of the Aral Sea Basin; and (iv) to

  Even more recently, following filling and development of the Arnasai depression and the construction in
Uzbekistan of two new earth dams on the Arnasai flow channel, the Chardara reservoir spilling capacity
has been severely reduced. As a result, the safety of Chardara dam has been compromised.

build the capacity of the regional institutions to plan and implement the corresponding
projects. Seven priority programs, comprising a total of 19 projects, were identified for
implementation during the first phase of the ASBP. The Syr Darya Control and Northern
Aral Sea phase I (SYNAS-I) project formed part of the ASBP Programme 4, which deals
with environmental issues in and around the Aral Sea.

Starting in 1992, the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) of the five
Central Asian States developed a common strategy for trans-boundary water management
in the Aral Sea Basin, determining water allocations and reservoir operations in the Amu
Darya and Syr Darya river basins. Declarations on water sharing were signed in 1995
(Nukus) and in 1997 (Almaty). In March 1998 a long-term water and energy agreement,
covering the sharing of hydro-power benefits from Kyrgyzstan, was signed between the
three Syr Darya River riparian countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan). In
August 2007, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the heads of
several of the SCO member states proposed a new policy of utilization of hydroelectric
energy resources, and a new agreement on utilization of transboundary water resources
within this framework is being considered. Meanwhile an International Fund for the Aral
Sea (IFAS) was established in 1993, and an Interstate Council was created to coordinate
and manage financial resources and programs in the field of ecological and socio-
economic development in the Aral Sea region. In the Ashgabat declaration of April
1999, the five Heads of State expressed once more their concern about the quality of life
in the Aral Sea region and acknowledged the need for an integrated and joint regional
strategy based on an ecosystem approach and integrated water resources management.
However, in spite of all of these initiatives, key issues such as the mode of operation of
the Toktogul reservoir remained unresolved.

National River Basin and Project Context

Of the newly-formed states Kazakhstan is the Syr Darya River tail-ender. As such it
suffers the most from the effects of inadequate integrated international river basin
management, including those outlined above. The environmental degradation of the Aral
Sea region and the inefficient use of water resources are among the serious threats
affecting the social, environmental and economic development and wellbeing in the
country.

The Government of Kazakhstan (GOK) recognized early that non-sustainable
developments upstream of the Northern Aral Sea (NAS) would continue to limit the
country’s growth potential. In addition to its participation in regional multi-country
agreements concerning the water management and environmental rehabilitation in the
Aral Sea basin, the GOK decided to work with the international donor community to
initiate direct resolution of the situation through the SYNAS-I project, targeting
environmental restoration, infrastructure rehabilitation, intersectoral water use conflict
reduction and institutional capacity strengthening.

For the GOK, the SYNAS project is a priority project in the water resources sector. It is
managed by the Committee for Water Resources (CWR), which coordinates with the Syr
Darya Basin Water Authority (BVO) and with the ICWC. At regional (oblast) level the

supported SYNAS-I project was completed in 2001, and implementation was completed
in 2010; key dates were (i) approval, 05 June 2001, (ii) effectiveness, 08 April 2002, and
(iii) closing, 31 December 2010. The project value was US$86 million, of which US$61
million was provided from a World Bank loan. Parallel development grant financing of
US$1.9 million was provided from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) for the
Kazakhstan Community-Based Aral Sea Fisheries Management and Sustainable
Livelihoods Project (closing in March 2012).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
1 As presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the PDOs were (i) sustaining
and increasing agriculture (including livestock) and fish production in the Syr Darya
basin; and (ii) securing the existence of the NAS and improving the
ecological/environmental conditions in the delta and around the NAS leading to
improved human and animal health and biodiversity. Corresponding key indicators to
be used in assessing achievement of these objectives were as summarized below:


Key Indicators                              Target Outcomes/Impacts

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
There were no formal revision to the PDO, and project activities remained substantially
the same as designed albeit with some additions and some omission of contracts justified
as part of implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries is about 1 million people, mainly in
Kyzylorda oblast, the poorest region of the country. The project directly improves the
well being of 150,000 to 200,000 people in Aralsk and Kazalinsk raions of this oblast (an
internationally recognized area affected by the Aral Sea environmental catastrophe).


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project was the first one of a series of investments that would reduce the risks posed
by the Chardara dam and improve water delivery, distribution, and basin wide water use
efficiency. The project’s components were:

   (a)   Rehabilitation of Northern Aral Sea (Component A), comprising
         construction of a dike across the Berg strait, including spillways, to allow for
         recovery and stabilization of NAS levels and salinity separate from those of the
         southern Larger Aral Sea (LAS);
   (b)   Improving the Hydraulic Control of the Syr Darya (Component B),
         comprising rehabilitation and construction of various hydraulic structures to
         allow for improved regulation and management of river flows and controlling of
         water allocations to various users including increased inflows to the NAS, the
         hydraulic structure interventions being (i) reconstruction of the Aklak weir and
         related works, (ii) reconstruction of the Aitek and Karaozek water control
         structures, (iii) rehabilitation and construction of low height dikes at key
         locations along the river for improved flood protection and increased channel
         flow capacity, and (iv) repairs to the Kazalinsk headworks and Kyzylorda
         barrage;
   (c)   Rehabilitation of Chardara Dam (Component C), covering various first
         phase priority safety and water control improvement works;
   (d)   Aquatic Resources Restoration and Fisheries Development (Component D),
         covering development interventions to maximize benefits from additional
         fisheries resulting from stabilization of the NAS level and salinity and improved
         flows to the delta lakes;
   (e)   Monitoring and Evaluation (Component E), covering monitoring and
         evaluation (M&E) activities aimed at evaluating the success in meeting the
         project's goals and assessing the project's physical, environmental/ecological,
         social, agricultural and economic impacts; and
   (f)   Project Management and Institutional Development (Component F),
         supporting operation of the CWR's Project Management Unit (PMU) and
         financing overall project management and technical assistance during


                                            4
         implementation, as well as providing for institutional capacity building in river
         basin management.

1.6 Revised Components
Overall there were no major changes made to the project components affecting the target
PDOs. However, Component D had to be significantly revised, as summarized in Section
1.7 (and explained in details in Annex 2).

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
While no major changes were made to the project components, a number of reallocations
between activities for additional auxiliary works such as access roads and other necessary
but not initially scheduled works were added while other activities such as works on weir
the Karaozek branch and structures along the Aitek complex were dropped from
financing. Some of these works were later funded through the Ministry of Emergency
Situation of the Republic of Kazakhstan, thus only minimally affecting the impact of the
project. A number of flood protection dikes (Component B) were dropped from project
financing due to cost overruns and budgetary constraints. In addition, under Component
D, cost savings/reductions were agreed as some activities where financed by other
financiers whereas other activities were deferred to SYNAS-2 (see Annex 2 for further



                                             5
details). These cost savings were used to meet the additional cost of project-wide
supervision and management due to extending the project implementation period.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Conformity with country and sector policies and strategies. The project formulation
conformed well to the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), primarily through its
strong provisions for (i) reversing environmental degradation caused by the decline of the
Aral Sea and (ii) improving Syr Darya river basin water management for increased
agricultural (including livestock) and fisheries production, all to the benefit of the
population of the poorest and most adversely affected region of the country. It similarly
addressed well the key GOK policies and priorities relating to environmental restoration,
rehabilitation of deteriorated hydraulic infrastructure, reducing intersectoral water use
conflicts and strengthening institutional capacity for river basin water management.

Relevance and appropriateness of project objectives, components and design. The
project’s two PDOs presented at Section 1.2 reflect well the development policies and
priorities indicated above. The six project components likewise corresponded to the six
essential and minimum interventions needed to secure a substantial integrated and
sustainable improvement in the region's economic and environmental situation. The
overall project design seemingly achieved a well considered and appropriate balance
between cost and benefit effectiveness, given the very much larger potentially suitable
alternative investments for NAS restoration, river flow capacity increases, and dam and
water control structures rehabilitation, some of which at the end of the project have
become high priority items for subsequent intervention. Nevertheless, there was a minor
design shortcoming (probably avoidable at preparation) that led to partial bank erosion
downstream of the Aklak weir, which is discussed below under Section 2.4.

Soundness of institutional and implementation arrangements. The formulated
primary institutional arrangements for project implementation under the CWR, through
the PMU headed by a National Project Coordinator (NPC), were put in place and would
appear to have been both simple and effective. Overall management and interagency
coordination was assigned to and undertaken by the CWR, and although an inter-ministry
transfer of this entity took place during the course of the project (from the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (MNREP) to the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) this seemingly had minimal impact on project implementation. The
PMU, based initially in Almaty but then in Astana, had responsibility for the day-to-day
project management and administration, assisted by a Consultants Group (CG) based in
Kyzylorda for technical design, contracts preparation, construction supervision, M&E
and project management tasks. Strong and often but not always entirely effective support
was provided by international and national consultant firms and individuals in these
areas. Other envisaged institutional arrangements included establishment and operation
of (i) an Inter-ministerial Coordinating Committee (ICC), (ii) a Project Steering


                                                6
Committee (PSC), (iii) a Basin Consultative Group (BCG), and (iv) an Independent Panel
of Experts (IPOE) for dam safety works at Chardara Dam. The first and fourth of these
entities contributed timely and meaningful inputs into the project.

Application of previous lessons learned. Previous lessons learned as identified at the
time of project formulation related to (i) applying economic and environmental criteria,
(ii) accounting for difficulties in interagency coordination, (iii) providing for competent
and efficient national management staff, (iv) ensuring timely provision of adequate
counterpart funding, (v) providing appropriate technical assistance, (vi) emphasizing
procurement, financial management and construction quality control aspects, and (vii)
involving local institutions in project design and preparation. All of these were to greater
or lesser extent addressed by the project preparation analyses and assessments, the
formulated institutional arrangements, the management structure and staff specifications,
the technical assistance arrangements and the institutional strengthening provisions.

Identification and mitigation of risks. Risks relating to marketing constraints,
institutional and funding shortfalls, water balance deficiencies, consultant staff
insufficiencies, and procurement and construction delays, were identified and addressed
as part of project formulation. Concerning the underlying government commitment to
the project, this was indicated to be strong at the time of project preparation, and it
seemingly remained so throughout the course of project implementation.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
In many respects, although not in all, the project was implemented much as envisaged at
appraisal. There were a total of 7 major infrastructure works contracts (compared to the
originally envisaged total of 11), as summarized below:

                             Major Infrastructure Works Contracts
    Contract Number and Name                                 Relevant Project Components
    001 Northern Aral Sea Dike and Aklak Control Structure   A and B1
    002 Aitek Weir                                           B2
    003 Rehabilitation of Chardara Dam                       C
    005 Syr Darya Protection Dikes                           B3 (part)
    006 Straightening of Syr Darya River Bed                 B3 (part)
    009 Rehabilitation of Kazalinsk Headworks                B4 (part)
    011 Rehabilitation of Kyzylorda Headworks                B4 (part)

Works implementation was hampered by a number of constraints, the ultimate effects of
which included (i) non-execution of some of the needed project works due to increased
costs and budget limitations, (ii) conversely, execution of previously unidentified but
needed and beneficial works, and (iii) an eventual total extension of the project
implementation period from 5 years to just under 9 years. With regard to non-execution
of needed project works, some of these were transferred out of the project and were
executed under non-project contracts funded by GOK (e.g. Karaozek weir, part of the
Aitek structures complex), while others remain to be executed under the project’s
prospective second phase or other projects (e.g. further river flood protection works).
Concerning the project period extensions, it is noted that these were needed only for a


                                                7
relatively small portion of the overall project infrastructure items; substantial completion
of most items, and corresponding disbursements, were seemingly achieved in a generally
timely manner.

Some of the specific key factors impacting implementation included (i) differences
between Kazakh and international practices and requirements for detail design studies,
cost estimating, pre-tender approvals, bid evaluations and contract award approvals,
leading to early disputes and delays; (ii) long periods of abnormally high river flows and
water levels over several years, leading to delays and additional needs for site protection
works and water control, with corresponding increased costs; (iii) an underestimated need
for major supporting infrastructure (roads, power lines, camps, etc) that had to be
provided for isolated and remote construction site and community locations; (iv) a
general construction boom over several years, leading to high cost escalation and key
material shortages and delivery delays; (v) some substantial design underestimation of
works volumes, some post-award identification of high priority requirements not
originally considered, and some contractor inadequacy in implementing needed activities,
leading to delays, budget reallocations, and non-execution of important works items due
to financing limitations; and (vi), primarily for one contract, some poor contractor
performance, organization, staffing, financing and legal aspects. It needs to be noted
however, that some of these changes that resulted in increased costs were also in part the
result of the opportunity presented from having large contractors on site to help local
authorities repairing roads and rehabilitate electric lines that followed the path of the
canal, but also to reconnected remote towns and settlements. While the benefits to water
and irrigation management directly may have been minimal from these ancillary works,
they were of crucial importance to local administrators and residents. Some further detail
on these issues and items is provided in the Borrower’s draft ICR report.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Given that some key project target outcomes were not expected to be realized within the
life of the project and its M&E program, the focus in establishing the M&E system was
on enabling the assessment of interim outcomes and the development of likely future
projections of these. In designing it, appropriate indicators were defined, and data bases
and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were set up to record and present historical,
initial (baseline) and developing conditions in the project area. During early
implementation, the systems were populated to some extent with data from hydrological
(quantity and quality), environmental (land and water), ecology/biodiversity and
socioeconomic field surveys and studies, and this led also to analyses, forecasts and
recommendations relating to restoration of ecosystems, notably for biodiversity, bird
habitats and fisheries. For further use of the systems it was reported that efforts to collect
data from and through government agencies, and to transfer M&E systems and train
government agency staff in their continued use and application, were not successful.
Completion of the formal M&E program occurred about half way through the extended
project period, and there was seemingly little if any subsequent routine M&E activity.
However, some notable positive impacts had already become evident by that time, as
evidenced by the findings from the household surveys and structured interviews of the
social and economic assessment (SEA). A more recent end-of-project 2009-2010 M&E
information has been obtained through self efforts from the PMU staff (including the
Borrower version of the ICR Report). It is also worth noting that the M&E should have


                                              8
comprised a full-fledged incremental impact evaluation approach (including baselines
and tools), that enables separating the non project/water related “compounding?
variables/externalities which can influence the target indicators (listed below under
Section 3.2) 2. Due to these shortcomings the M&E activity is deemed only partially
satisfactory, and due deligence has to be taken while preparing SYNAS-II to avoid such
shortcomings. However, an overall incremental improvement of the key SYNAS-I
impact indicators has been recorded as summarized in this table; and the M&E
shortcomings do not detract from evidenting that the project has successfully met its key
target objectives.

Also Annex 7 discusses the employment created (salary increases) and other social
benefits which are indirectly attributed to the SYNAS-I (from the Borrower’s ICR).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
Safeguard Policies. The safeguard policies determined at appraisal to be applicable
were those for (i) environmental assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01), (ii) safety of
dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37), and (iii) projects in international waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP
7.50). Comments for each of these are as follows:

    (a)    Since the project involved construction of some major new hydraulic
           infrastructure and expected substantial land and water management changes, it
           was classified as an Environmental Category "A" project. A full Environmental
           Assessment (EA) complemented by a Social Assessment (SA), including
           formulation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), was undertaken
2
  As regards the sea-water salinity, crop and cattle production, and since the years 2000 and 2001 were
extremely dry years, the Bank ICR team notes that a better approach for the incremental impact evaluation
would warrant comparing the post-project results on these indicators with their pre-construction average
annual results from 1995 to 2005 (rather than comparing with the early 2000s baselines). Similarly, as
regards the fish catch and crop/cattle production, a full-fledged incremental impact evaluation would
warrant separating the non-water-related “compounding? variables/externalities that may have influenced
these indicators (for instance, increasing the number of fishing boats in 2007 may have contributed to the
catch peak in that year). Such a full-fledged impact evaluation needs to be followed under the forthcoming
phase 2 (SYNAS-2).




                                                    9
         before project appraisal. Comments on implementation of the EMP are
         provided in the next sub-section below.
   (b)   Interventions under the project for dam safety were formulated for the Chardara
         dam, which is the key water storage and flow regulation structure for the Syr
         Darya river in Kazakhstan. Some parts of the needed works were undertaken
         under the project, while others remain to be implemented under one or more
         future projects. As mentioned at Section 2.1 above, an IPOE for dam safety
         works at Chardara dam, comprising international and national experts, was
         constituted and provided expert advice, reviewed the designs and oversaw the
         works.
   (c)   The project dealt with developments involving international waters (the Syr
         Darya River and the Aral Sea) and was therefore subject to requirements
         relating to notification, disclosure and dissemination of information to riparian
         states, procedures for which were duly followed. The status of the project as a
         component of the ASBP as indicated at Section 1.1 above meant that all riparian
         states were in accordance with its implementation.

EMP Implementation Results. Implementation of the EMP was effected through
environmental audits comprising systematic independent reviews of works construction
sites and camps. The reviews included inspection of sites, consultations and interviews
with clients, consultants and contractors, and examination of relevant supporting
documentation. The audits ensured that the appropriate environmental impact prevention
and mitigation measures were applied and that the works and outcomes were in
accordance with the environmental and socioeconomic enhancement and improvement
plans and expectations. Some further detail on this topic is included in the Borrower’s
draft ICR report.

Procurement. A procurement Capacity Assessment had been undertaken and was
reflected in the PAD.       Reflecting the pre-project (pre-2000) era, this assessment
highlighted a relatively weak legal and regulatory framework and project cycle
management and provided a high risk rating, thus recommending by-yearly procurement
supervision and regular post–review audits. The 2000 Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) classified the public procurement system as a medium risk system, in
spite of high prevalence of transparency/competitiveness issues that would justify a
medium-high risk rating.        Due to a relatively good experience with project
implementation in the water/agricultural sector, the project was classified as a medium
risk from a procurement perspective. The procurement planning was adequate for the
project. The bidding processes for all contracts have been successfully completed on
time. The procurement processes including the prequalification have been implemented
with an assistance of international consultancy company. However, the project faced
significant contractual issues during implementing contract SYNAS #001 (construction
of the NAS and nearby Aklak Control Structure). Significant delays occurred in
construction due to technical and financial constraints by the Contractor. As a result of
the delays in completing this contract, services for construction supervision by the
Engineer (client) Companies were extended several times with an increased contract
value. Overall, the procurement performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                           10
Financial Management and Disbursement. The PMU had already acquired financial
management experience during the implementation of the preparation PHRD grant that
received clean unqualified audit reports. PMU financial management capability and
practices were reviewed by the Bank at the time of appraisal and regularly throughout
implementation and found acceptable. Overall, it has maintained acceptable financial
management arrangements meeting the Bank requirements in respect to the quality of
accounting, reporting, internal controls, staffing as well as in respect to the audit
arrangements. During project implementation, there were no major issues or problems in
conducting financial management by the PMU. The only issue that resulted in
downgrading of the FM rating to moderately satisfactory in the last year of
implementation is deterioration of the automated accounting software. The problem could
not be fixed due to the fact that funds had not been allocated for the software
maintenance during the last year.

Audit reports for FY 2009 and final quarterly reports for the fourth quarter of 2010 were
received by the Bank and found to be satisfactory. The final audit report for the Project is
expected to be received by the Bank before June 30, 2011.

The latest ISR ratings were still valid by the ICR time and can be summarized as follows:
   • Implementation progress (IP) was provisionally rated as "Moderately
       Satisfactory" for the end of December 2010, due to the need to complete a few
       remaining contract works at the Aklak structure site. The client and Bank teams
       followed up to ensure that there would be minimal works to be completed and
       financed solely by GOK beyond the closing date, and hence to leave no
       significant risks after project closure on December 31, 2010. Financial
       management (FM) was rated as "Moderately Satisfactory". Project management
       (PMU and PIU) was rated as "Moderately Satisfactory", given the "Moderately
       Satisfactory" ratings for both IP and FM.
   • Ratings given for compliance with applicable safeguards (EA (OP 4.01), safety of
       dams (OP 4.37) and projects in international waters (OP 7.50)) are discussed
       below:
       - The EA safeguard compliance rating is "Satisfactory" due to the successful
            preparation and adoption of the EA and EMP.
       - In the case of compliance with the dam safety safeguard, until November
            2010 this had been rated as "Satisfactory" in all Implementation Status and
            Results (ISR) reports. This reflected that a dam safety review had been
            prepared for the Chardara dam, and that a properly constituted IPOE had
            reviewed the design and overseen the implementation of dam safety measures
            (further Chardara dam safety work is to be carried out under the prospective
            SYNAS-2 project, for which an IPOE is also expected to be in place).
            However, in the last ISR report of November 2010 (and provisionally in this
            ICR report), the rating was reduced to "Moderately Satisfactory". This was
            due to the status of pending contract works at the Aklak control structure. The
            Bank team urged CWR to ensure that the recently occurred erosion of river
            banks on both sides of the river bed downstream of the Aklak structure (and to
            a lesser extent downstream of the Aitek weir) is of a localized nature and will
            be adequately addressed by the contractors. In accordance with the Bank’s


                                             11
             dam safety policy (OP/BP 4.37), the Bank ISR mission of November 2010
             suggested that the erosion problem may result from either a stilling basin
             under-design or an implementation shortcoming. The Bank as part of its due
             diligence and assisted by FAO undertook to review the design to determine
             whether the problem arose from a design issue or an implementation issue.
             The preliminary results, obtained by February 2011, suggested that there
             might be a minor design issue3, which can be tackled.
        -    The international waters safeguard compliance rating is "Satisfactory" due to
             the successful notification of project details to the upstream riparian countries
             (Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan).
        -    The overall combined safeguards compliance provisional rating is
             "Moderately Satisfactory" (equivalent to the lowest individual rating, that for
             safety of dams).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
The SYNAS-I project has been successfully implemented and, as discussed further in
Section 3 below, has been instrumental in the achievement of target outcomes and
generation of expected benefits. There are indications that both operation and
maintenance services for system infrastructure are being provided by CWR, although few
shortfalls in this area are identified as a moderate risk to sustainability (see risk matrix on
page 18). Also, during site visits to substantially completed and operating project
infrastructure works, effected a month before project closure, few hydraulic performance
issues were observed that seemed to warrant early attention and subsequent follow up, as
discussed further in Annex 2 below. Furthermore, as indicated previously above,
execution of a few works remain pending, and in particular Chardara dam longer-term
safety, although now partially addressed, remains a concern. These issues can be well
addressed by the follow-on SYNAS-II project, which will build on 10-year lessons from
SYNAS-I to ensure the sustainability of works introduced along the River and at NAS.
Finally, beyond consolidation of achieved benefits, there are identified substantial
additional potential environmental and socioeconomic benefits to be realized through
further cost-effective investments in and around the Syr Darya river and NAS. The
SYNAS-II project has been formulated to carry the regional development forward
accordingly.

3
  The fast-track analysis suggested that the design of the stilling basin was acceptable but that the whole
Aklak structure was probably situated too high in the landscape, giving a steep downstream riverbed slope
and a low tailwater depth, leading to occurrence of the hydraulic jump outside of rather than inside of the
stilling basin. To obtain a revised riverbed slope of say 0.001, a possible remedy would be for CWR to
construct a sill of 2 to 3 m height about 200 m downstream of the weir (for example by dumping boulders
into the river at that location). There would most likely be bank erosion again downstream of this new sill,
but this might not be as worrisome as regards safety of the structure. Nevertheless, awaiting additional
data/drawings, the Bank/FAO team could not provide full evidence that the low tailwater level is causing
the turbulence and consequently the erosion. The Bank/FAO team hence advised CWR that: (1) if erosion
is still ongoing/progressing, then all required data/drawings should be made available immediately for
further detailed analysis; (2) if observed erosion has subsided, then no immediate action is required, but
regular monitoring once a week recommended. In May 2011 CWR implied that the latter applies.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
Both of the PDOs (PDO(i), the production improvement objective, and PDO(ii), the
environmental improvement objective) continued to have a high relevance throughout the
duration of the project. Design and implementation priorities remained unchanged,
although some changes in actual works implemented and/or transferred or postponed to
other or subsequent projects did occur as noted above. It must be said that the
abnormally high flows experienced over an extended portion of the project period led to
some modification of development need perspectives away from low flow mitigation and
towards flood protection and control (including dam safety), and they also had the effect
of shortening the expected time frame for achievement of the target outcomes discussed
in the following section.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
In general, the target outcomes are considered to have been achieved, as conveyed by
several media reports noted in the past few years. The following is a summary of
incremental outcomes achieved, based on comparisons between the pre-project 2001-
2004 baseline data and the post-project 2009-2010 M&E data. Further details are
provided in Annex 2 (outputs) and Annex 7 (employment and other social benefits).

    (a)   For PDOs (i) and (ii). NAS water levels above Baltic Sea Level (BSL)
          increased from a pre-project low of 38 m to the desired design level of 42 m. In
          2006 and 2007 the NAS reached full capacity. Annual inflows into the NAS
          were 7 and 4 billion m3 in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The water surface area
          increased by 37% from 2,400 km2 in 2001 to 3,300 km2 in 2009 (50% greater
          than at the historical lowest water level). The distance from Aralsk harbor to
          the NAS decreased from 75 km in 2001 to 40 km in 2009 and 35 km in August
          2010. Following the closure of the Aklak control structure on 21 November
          2009, the upstream water level reached 53 m above BSL as per design, allowing
          75 million m3 of water to be diverted into the delta lakes.
    (b)   For PDOs (i) and (ii). Construction of the new Aitek structure and
          rehabilitation of other Syr Darya river infrastructure works provided an overall
          carrying capacity of the river of 700 m3/sec and increased the carrying capacity
          in winter from 300 m3/s in 2001 to 425 m3/sec in 2007. As a result of these
          interventions and those at Chardara dam and reservoir, annual losses into desert
          sinks (the Arnasai depression) reduced from 5 billion m3 in 2003 to 0.4, 0.8, 1.0
          and 0.2 billion m3 in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively (the target
          outcome value was 1 billion m3).
    (c)   For PDOs (i) and (ii). The increased freshwater inflow to the NAS more than
          halved the salinity levels in the sea, from more than 20 g/l in 2001 to less than
          10 g/l in 2010.
    (d)   For PDO(i). Areas planted to rice increased from 58,500 ha in 2001 to 73,300
          ha in 2009. More generally, water supply for sustained cropping on all irrigated
          lands (in the order of 150,000 ha) has been secured. However, there was as yet


                                                13
          no solid trend helping to directly attribute4 the increased crop production/yield
          to the SYNAS. Agricultural development is dependent on not only water
          availability but also workable and effective irrigation systems, agricultural
          extension, marketing, etc.; further support will be needed to realize the
          agricultural benefits of secure irrigation water supplies (e.g. through the
          prospective Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project - Phase 2 (IDIP-2)).
    (e)   For PDO(i). Cattle numbers increased from 185,000 heads in 2001 to 260,000
          heads in 2009, and there were similar levels of increase in other livestock
          numbers. Livestock raising expanded due to increased availability of potable
          water for livestock watering and (possibly) of irrigation water for livestock
          fodder production.
    (f)   For PDO(i). Fish catches in the region increased from 52 t in 2004 to 2,834 t in
          2007, 2,320 t in 2008, and 2,650 t in 2009 (of which 2,000 t in 2007 and 1,885 t
          in 2009 were from the NAS itself). The production from fish processing plants
          in the region reached 770 t in 2009 (of which 466 t were exported). Fishermen
          informed the visiting ICR mission that the informal volumes of fish catches far
          exceed the formally-declared catch volumes.
    (g)   For PDO(ii). Flora and fauna, and in particular birdlife, around the NAS have
          much improved. Also, local people have reported better health and wellbeing
          (due to the improved micro-climate and other conditions such as air, soil and
          water quality and biodiversity), and have indicated a return of hope for the
          future. The previous trend of mass migration from the area has been reversed,
          with people returning, building or improving their houses, and reengaging in
          income generating activities, primarily fishing and livestock raising.

The ICR mission of November 2010, during field visits to SYNAS project sites to see the
works and appreciate their actual and potential social and environmental impacts,
qualitatively validated the above noted outcomes. As a form of end-of-project beneficiary
survey (see Section 3.6 below), the mission met with local project officials, fishermen
from the NAS area, and representatives from the local NGO Aral Tenizi based in Aralsk,
to obtain information and perspectives on relevant social and environmental indicators
(e.g. changes in health of the local population, fish catches and production, and birdlife
and biodiversity in the region). The NAS fishermen acknowledged the benefits that they
have received from the SYNAS project in terms of greater fish catches, much more
variety of fresh-water fish species, improved environmental and health conditions, etc.
The mission also met with the PMU’s ecologist to discuss these impacts and review the
types of indicators to be used for the GOK’s own ICR report (see Annex 7).

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
The project demonstrated good economic viability, as it resulted in several multi-sectoral
types of benefits. The viability of the capital investments has been demonstrated by a

  The economic analysis in Annex 3 attributed only a portion of the value of increased crop and livestock
production, to the improved water quantity and quality resulting from SYNAS.



                                                   14
simplified, indicative and likely conservative estimation of the annualized monetary gains
attributable to the project’s water sector investments and achieved to date in the five key
areas of (i) fisheries, (ii) crop production, (iii) livestock, (iv) flood protection and reduced
water losses, and (v) ecology, public health and the environment. Details are provided in
Annex 3. The ratio of the capital costs to the annualized benefits is used as an indicator
of economic viability. A ratio value of less than 10 is deemed to demonstrate economic
viability, and the actual value obtained of 6.4 is therefore considered to be a good result.

As previously reflected cost overruns were significant primarily due to auxiliary works
that had not be properly identified at design, but also due to inevitable delays and
difficulties in applying international standards for management of procurement and
management of contracts for works and installations and the related learning curve as
well as a relatively weak US$ relative to local currency. In spite of these elements overall
unit costs remained within acceptable ranges for such works in the region.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The project outcome is considered to be clearly satisfactory from the perspectives of
relevance of objectives, achievement of objectives, and economic efficiency, with only
minor shortcomings noted.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
From the indications at Section 3.2 above it must be concluded that the remarkable
advances achieved in the securing and enhancing of the land and water resources of the
Syr Darya river basin and the NAS for production from fisheries, livestock and
agriculture should lead to equally significant income improvements for the local
population. This assumes that proper attention is given to the removal as necessary of
other constraints to production, processing and marketing, for example as is intended for
fisheries with the ongoing parallel JSDF initiative and for agriculture with the prospective
IDIP-2. Beyond this, the improvements in biodiversity, environmental and human health,
and transportation and power infrastructure and services, should prove highly conducive
to further social and economic development and quality-of-life enhancement in the
region.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Strong technical and project management assistance was provided under the project to the
PMU and implementing agencies, through a mix of international and national consultant
firms and individuals. The institutional strengthening benefit that accrued as a result has
been acknowledged in the Borrower’s draft ICR report.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Construction of the NAS dike and Aklak control structure, the sites of which were at very
isolated locations, required a substantive investment to be made for the provision of


                                               15
supporting infrastructure (e.g. roads). During implementation this was increased to an
even higher level, at the request of local authorities and communities, to provide extra
road and power line connections to isolated communities in the area. It is understood that
these have had a substantial positive impact on the development of these communities.
Somewhat similarly, at the Chardara dam and reservoir, where revised safety concerns
led to unplanned interventions to secure the Arnasai side dam and spillway (and
contributed to postponement of some main dam site works), an unintended outcome was
the securing of local district power supply through stabilization of a high voltage
transmission line.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
As mentioned at Section 3.2 above, ICR mission meetings with local project officials,
fishermen from the NAS area and representatives of a local NGO were held as a form of
end-of-project beneficiary survey. Details of the findings from these meetings, together
with a relevant media report extract, are provided in Annex 5. There was also a public-
hearing stakeholders workshop carried out in Kyzylorda with the participation of local
government authorities and community water-user group members. Findings from this
workshop are presented in Annex 6. In summary it can be said that there has been
widespread public satisfaction with the project results and impacts. Particular emphasis
was given to the remarkable improvements in NAS fisheries, birdlife and other wildlife in
the adjacent areas, the health of the population, and the potential for social and economic
advancement and standards of living. Also expressed was strong positive support for
proposed SYNAS-II project interventions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

To assist with the assessment of risk to development outcomes, a risk matrix as shown on
the following page was developed. This summarizes the perceived risks in the envisaged
progression from achieved outputs through intermediate results to final results, together
with risk mitigation requirements. It is judged that the risks arose more from externalities
than from project design or implementation shortcomings. While the perceived levels of
the output to intermediate result risks are low to medium, the importance of some of them
leads to an overall rating of the risk to moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
There has been no indication from either the Borrower’s draft ICR report or from the ICR
mission reviews that Bank performance and support during project preparation was
anything less than satisfactory. High quality inputs from both the Bank and project
preparation consultants seemingly ensured that project concepts and formulations,
emerging as they did from the broader regional context of the ASBP, were sound,
relevant, effective and practical. Also noteworthy were the early (pre-effectiveness)
arrangements and inputs for timely preparation of detail designs and tender documents
for the project’s main infrastructure works. It is deduced that perhaps one area of possible
shortcoming was in the prioritization and definition of first phase Chardara dam and
reservoir safety interventions, given the changes to these that had to be made during
project implementation, and given the perception also that some important items were
postponed for later attention more for cost than for technical reasons. However, it needs
to be noted that this project covers structures over a stretch of thousands of kilometers in
fairly difficult terrain. Working to a large part on blue prints that were several decades
old, oversight of some, and reprioritization of other works that only became noticeable
during implementation would have to be expected. This is particularly the case since this
project is part of an overall program of sequenced investments.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

From the Borrower’s perspective, the Borrower's ICR report has indicated nothing but
satisfaction with the Bank's efforts, inputs and support in the supervision of project
implementation. Also of note however is the indication and acknowledgement of
persistent differences between GOK and Bank perspectives, rules and requirements in the
formulating, securing and administering contracts and in other project (including
financial) management aspects. These differences seem to have been important (though
certainly not exclusive) factors in the long delay in project completion and possibly
indirectly in the non-execution of some project works due to cost increases and budget
limitations. GOK policies, priorities and practices in these procurement, financial and
contract management areas are not perceived to be on par with international standards,
guidelines and proscriptions relating to competitiveness, transparency and a focus on
outputs, development goals and sustainable benefits. In this situation it is felt that greater
Bank advocacy and a more proactive approach to influence change, not only at
CWR/PMU level but also and probably more importantly at higher
government/ministerial levels, could have been applied.

In support of its supervision, the Bank team was in constant contact with the client/PMU
and its design/supervision consultants to expedite the design/implementation progress



                                                   18
and to address emerging design/technical issues. The Bank team responded proactively
with timely approval of justified contract variation orders and with guidance to the PMU
on the needed M&E and supervision activities to reach the PDO objectives. Finally, the
Bank follow-up undertook an in-depth Mid-Term Review in 2005 that was used to
reorient some of the priorities to improve performance. In addition, the Bank’s
procurement team kept a close watch to ensure that the client maintains transparent and
efficient tendering and contract-management procedures, built capacity by organizing
seminars on procurement and FM including sending PMU staff for training in Italy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The above overall rating results from the combining of the two previous separate ratings
in accordance with the ICR report guidelines.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As mentioned above, GOK policies, priorities and practices in procurement and project,
financial and contracts management areas are not perceived to be on a par with
international standards, guidelines and proscriptions relating to competitiveness,
transparency and a focus on outputs, development goals and sustainable benefits. This is
a common situation in Central Asian and other ex-Soviet countries that often constrains
and impedes international assistance efforts to help provide meaningful and effective
developments with equitable and maximal long-term benefits and positive impacts for a
target disadvantaged population. In the present case, also as mentioned above, it seems
that it could have contributed to the long delay in project completion and the non-
execution of some project works due to cost increases and budget limitations. One
example would be contracting system disincentives for contractors to bid on project
works contracts, as evidenced by often very poor responses to tender calls; further
examples would be the major constraints on contract management options for resolving
issues relating to needed work variations and to poor contractor performance.
Government performance is therefore deemed to have had moderate shortcomings.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Judging by outputs/outcomes that are within the mandate/control of CWR, the acceptable
quality of construction/operation of SYNAS subprojects suggests that CWR’s
performance is satisfactory. The works introduced/rehabilitated are functional and
improved the operation and safety of the structures, thus benefiting many water users
along the Syr Darya river and around the NAS, and mitigating the flooding risks.

Judging by activities/procedures and implementation progress, there were many delays
and problems, such as the small design issues causing tail-water erosion at Aklak and
Aitek weirs, few pending works under the Aklak-Structure contract that slipped beyond
the closing date,5 and dropping few flood protection works. But much of these issues can
be attributed to externalities or to deeply rooted nation-wide procedures.

5
 The causes of the contract management problems and delays in Contract#001 (NAS Dike and Aklak
Control Structure) are twofold:


                                             19
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The above overall rating for Borrower performance results from combining the two
previous separate ratings in accordance with the ICR report guidelines.

From the above considerations, overall Borrower performance could be reasonably
assessed as having had moderate shortcomings, as indeed is indicated by the rating
presented above. However, as may be deduced from earlier comments above, it is
thought that most of these shortcomings arose substantially from policy, priority and
practice restrictions and demands imposed on the implementing agencies from higher
levels of government. The CWR/PMU/PIU is thought to have normally demonstrated
willingness and desire to subsume and apply sound procurement, supervision and
management standards and practices during project implementation (with the support of
generally strong consultancy services), but to have been restrained in this by external
GOK constraints. From this perspective the implementing agencies could be considered
as having performed with only minor shortcomings.



6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)




•   Force Majeure causes (that were difficult to foresee during SYNAS preparation): (1) Severe weather
    conditions (e.g. floods to NAS in 2003-2005 were double of their annual norms); and (2) the country’s
    construction boom in 2004-2006 which led to a sharp escalation in project costs and shortage of
    construction materials (contractor encountered difficulty in providing timely supply of
    materials/equipment). These events often affected work at its mobilization and during its progress, and
    caused an accumulated delay of at least 2 years.

•   Man-caused issues (partially avoidable during preparation/implementation): (1) The supporting
    infrastructure in project area was lacking at project onset. Upon the suggestion from the regional
    governors, the contract was amended to build village roads to improve transportation between remote
    settlements and to supply the site with materials/equipment from relatively remote railway stations; (2)
    Delayed production of the hydromechanical equipment by the local manufacturer; and (3) Poor
    contactor/subcontractor staffing and headquarter-to-site financing policy throughout the construction
    period particularly its initial stage, and again during 2007-2010. This included the selling of the main
    contractor’s construction machines, vehicles and dump trucks following the law suit filed by its local
    subcontractor during working on sealing the river bed, which deterred completing the work on the
    main structure and the dam in 2008. Until the closing date, the CWR and Bank teams undertook
    arrangements to resolve the issues between the main contractor and its national subcontractor, in order
    to leave only minimal works to be completed and financed solely by GOK beyond the closing date.
    These arrangements aimed to hedge any significant risks after the project closes.

The project provided a number of lessons that should prove relevant in the preparation
and implementation of subsequent similar development projects in Kazakhstan and the
Central Asia region. These are summarized below.

Lesson 1. While dam safety was not a PDO of SYNAS-I, in water management
developments where dam and reservoir safety is identified as an item in need of attention,
due prioritization should be given to execution and completion of the needed
amelioration measures. It is recognized that this is most likely to require substantial
financial resources and that, if these are directed towards comprehensively resolving dam
safety issues in the first instance, the overall project objectives and desired outcomes may
not be fully attained in a limited budget situation. Under SYNAS-I , Chardara dam and
reservoir safety was addressed through urgent but relatively low cost interventions, while
important but relatively high cost interventions (e.g. to enable passage of an appropriate
design flood) were left for a subsequent project. The successful process of improvements
to the NAS and river delta lake water levels and quality, to the Syr Darya river flood
control and conveyance capacity, and to overall basin water management, as well as to
Chardara dam and reservoir safety, would be continued under the proposed SYNAS-II
project. It is suggested that consideration be given in SYNAS-II to affording priority to
dam safety in terms of both funding and scheduling, and if this purpose detracts from the
main PDOs of SYNAS-II, a separate project may be formulated with the aim of
addressing dam safety/operation issues.

Lesson 2. For development effectiveness reasons, both technical and economic/financial,
there is a strong need for international river basin water management developments to be
formulated and implemented in a joint and integrated manner within and between all of
the riparian countries. In the case of the Central Asian and Aral Sea countries it is known
that great efforts were made previously to seek agreements and cooperation for much
needed joint regional/international water management improvement projects, to no avail.
As a consequence, basin water resources development to date has proceeded on an
individual country basis, and there is now a history of relatively successful completed and
ongoing individual country projects (e.g. the Ferghana valley and other projects). Within
this history there are various instances where unilateral development decisions and
actions have led to counter investments that were (from a basin-wide perspective) costly,
avoidable, or at best sub-optimal. Examples in the case of the Syr Darya river basin in
Kazakhstan would include the SYNAS-I repair works on the Chardara reservoir Arnasai
side dam and the GOK’s separate Koksarai flood diversion and retention complex. These
efforts could be further optimized if a win-win transboundary approach is jointly taken
with Uzbekistan. There is every prospect for further such ?useful-but-only-sub-optimal?
water developments to take place in the Central Asian countries until such time as
international joint water resources planning and management can be agreed to and
implemented. A renewal of efforts to achieve this as part of individual country follow-on
projects is suggested. Some potential initiatives that have been proposed for
consideration include (i) holding trust-building regional workshops involving the five
Central Asia countries, (ii) development of national development databases and
management information systems (MISs) with standardized designs and tools, covering
all water balance variables, from which countries could selectively extract and share key
data with other countries with a view to identifying and sharing/trading development



                                            21
benefits, and (iii) formulating and undertaking coordinated and/or joint development
projects with similar and/or mutually beneficial outcomes in two or more countries.6

Lesson 3. Based on comments at Section 5 above relating to procurement and other
project management aspects, further efforts and attention are needed to bring about some
modernization of the development approach in the Bank-supported operations, aiming at
establishing international standards and practices relating to competitiveness,
transparency and management flexibility with a focus on outputs, goals and
sustainability.

Lesson 4. Specific attention is needed to improve the management/administration of the
procurement contracts. For any similar follow-on projects the borrower should acquire
adequate knowledge and improve capacity in contract management/administration.

Lesson 5. For the follow-on operations such as SYNAS-2, it is recommended that the
Bank and client teams fully utilize Bank instruments such as the “Additional Financing?
and “Restructuring?, in order to revisit project design, scale up the project, or make major
changes to its key/sizable procurement contracts. Use of such instruments is envisaged to
avoid the delays and cost overruns and tackle the procedural/contractual problems
encountered during SYNAS-I.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The comments received from the borrower/implementing agency on this ICR have been
positive overall, reiterating the important project impacts despite encountering minor
deficiencies. The implementing agency has however expressed some reservation against
the ICR sections which judged the project-preparation and contract-management
approaches, while the comments have also recognized that in the past years there were
discrepancies between government and international practices in project preparation (i.e.
feasibility studies). The comments also implied that SYNAS-II can work on addressing
these discrepancies in order to continue developing the region, through an integrated river
basin management approach.

(b) Cofinanciers

(c) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)




6
 Examples could include modernization of irrigation and drainage systems, and rationalization of
conjunctive water use, in the Ferghana valley for overall basin water savings and Aral Sea replenishment,
and downstream to upstream energy transfers/substitutions (fossil fuel for hydroelectric) to allow winter
flows to be retained for summer use.

Report on Assessment of Completed Hydraulic Structures (Field Visit of November
2010)7

Summary

Six major hydraulic structures were visited during the Bank’s first ICR mission (field visit
in November 2010), over a distance of some 2,000 km by road. Most structures were
found to be of good quality ensuring in principle their designed function. However, as
with any such large hydraulic structures, the Bank team emphasized that CWR should
ensure the typical post-project follow up actions, particularly for the structures
rehabilitated “as designed?. An additional assessment through comparing the design
drawings with the “as-built-drawings? including a verification of the handover documents
is typically required. The most notable follow-up actions are the function of the stilling
basins of Aklak and Aitek regulation weirs, both of which encounter a minor energy
dissipation shortcoming (attributed to a minor design issue) which eventually causes
erosion of the banks of the tailwater channel. This needs to be addressed by the CWR
(per the recommendations from the WB/FAO team) to avoid any further erosion damages
and additional costs. The Bank suggested that the CWR recruits a specialist who would
assist the CWR to identify, and then carry out, the recommended actions, particularly if
the bank erosion continues or even escalates (see details below).

The action matrix below presents a summary of the recommended CWR follow-up
actions post SYNAS, following visit assessments of each of the five structures completed
under the SYNAS-I project.

capacity, the occurrence of sink holes in the dam body at the Kyzylkum Canal outlet, and
increased seepage along the toe of the dam. Because of these reasons, the Chardara Dam
was considered to be unsafe.

Objective of rehabilitation works. To improve safety conditions of the dam, ensure
design discharge capacity of the ground releases, restore the drainage system including
renewal of piezometers, and operate and maintain the dam in a satisfactory manner.

Outcome of rehabilitation works. Following hydraulic modeling, the ground releases
have been amended; however, maximum safe discharge capacity of each bottom outlet is
about 250 m3/s instead of 300 m3/s. The Kyzylkum Canal outlet structure was renewed,

  Chardara Dam (Contract SYNAS #003). The contract was signed with China Geo-Engineering (CGE) on
September 1, 2004 with an originally scheduled completion date of September 21, 2007, but substantial
completion was expected by the end of November, 2007. The main rehabilitation works are:
    (i)    Construction of toe drainage system, including 183 pressure relief wells and 3.73 km drainage
           channel, lined with concrete slabs;
    (ii) Concrete protection of the downstream face of Arnasai Dam;
    (iii) Installation of 30 new piezometers and cleaning of 23 existing ones;
    (iv) Rehabilitation of Chardara Dam’s upstream face concrete protection, including repair of joints;
    (v)    Rehabilitation of Kyzylkum Outlet (200 m3/sec capacity), mainly focusing on cavity grouting
           and compaction grouting;
    (vi) Reconstruction of Chardara’s spillway’s two bottom outlets to avoid excess vibration of the
           gates and allow the design flood to pass. Main works comprise reshaping of spillway floors,
           with the right outlet tunnel completed in 2006 and the works on the left outlet tunnel ongoing;
    (vii) Renewal of all hydro-mechanical works (gates, hoisting mechanisms, and stoplogs) at Chardara
           Spillway and Kyzylkum Outlet;
    (viii) Electrical works for Chardara and Kyzylkum gates and gantries; and
    (ix) Investigations for Chardara Dam, including CCTV survey of buried drainage pipes, liquefaction
           investigations (trial pits, boreholes and CPT), bathymetric survey of the reservoir, and
           underwater surveys by divers.

all piezometers replaced, and the drainage system improved. Total drainage along the
dam toe was reported to be 5 m3/s which is a significant and unusually great discharge.

Present operation & maintenance. Though the safety of the dam has been significantly
improved, the full discharge capacity of the ground releases cannot be achieved without
considerable vibrations. This reduces usage of the Syr Darya flow capacity below
Chardara Dam by 100 m3/s or about 8%. Though drainage was said to be recorded, no
information was available about drainage fluctuations and/or method of recording.

Recommended follow-up actions by CWR. Drainage data should be analyzed and
interpreted monthly, the hydraulic modeling results should be verified, and the cause for
continuous vibration of the bottom outlet gates identified and possibly mitigated.

2. KOK-ARAL Dam

Situation before SYNAS-I implementation. In 2001, further desiccation of the Large
Aral Sea (LAS, the Southern part of the Aral Sea) led to a separation of the LAS and the
NAS, increasing the mineralization level of the latter to up to 100 g/l and thus making it
impossible for fish to survive.

Objective of rehabilitation works. To prevent further desiccation of the NAS and
enhance its partial restoration including decreasing the high mineralization level.

Outcome of rehabilitation works. Contrary to an expected NAS filling time of some 10
years, the NAS was brought to the designed maximum water level at 42 m above Baltic
Sea Level (a BSL) already two years after the completion of the Kok-Aral Dam. Since
then, NAS operation level remained steady at around 42 m a BSL (or slightly higher)
which was due to favorable climatic conditions as well as the increased discharge
capacity of the lower Syr Darya following interventions under SYNAS-I, such as the
construction of new regulation weirs, river training works, increase of Chardara dam
discharge capacity, etc. Additionally, mineralization decreased in a large part of NAS
from some 70 g/l to as little as 10 g/l.

Present operation & maintenance. The spillway is fully functioning but the crane for
lifting the stoplogs is not yet installed. The dam body is maintained well; minor seepage
of different intensity is visible along the dam. The “new? Syr Darya delta is developing
only a few kilometers upstream of the dam.

Recommended follow-up actions by CWR. NAS outflow data (2005-2010) should be
analyzed to better understand the reason for the rapid filling of the NAS during 2005 to
2007. A recent study about the variability of mineralization in the NAS should be
evaluated, and means to ensure a better mixing of fresh Syr Darya water with impounded
NAS water should be identified. Additionally, it might be worthwhile to anticipate the
future development of the “new? Syr Darya delta since this may cause increased siltation
upstream of the dam’s spillway and a possible reduction of the spillway capacity in the
long-term.

3. AKLAK Regulation Weir Including Fish Ladder

Situation before SYNAS-I implementation. Following the recession of the Aral Sea,
erosion of the Syr Darya riverbed brought the existing regulation weir close to collapse
and interrupted adequate water supply to the Syr Darya delta lakes.

Objective of rehabilitation works. To prevent further erosion of the Syr Darya riverbed,
regulate NAS inflow, and ensure fish migration and water supply for the Syr Darya delta
lakes.

Outcome of rehabilitation works. The Aklak Regulation Weir including a fish ladder is
completed and fulfills its purposes. Some minor works are left to be implemented by a
new sub-contractor.

Present operation & maintenance. The weir has been tested at the maximum discharge
capacity of 500 m3/s and found to be functional as designed. At the time of the visit,
some 400 m3/s were discharging and turbulence in the stilling basin was significant,
causing supercritical tailwater flow (estimated Froude number greater than 9) and some
erosion damages in the weir’s tailwater channel. The latter is such that common
maintenance works might not mitigate the problem; a comprehensive solution is needed.
As the erosion was significant, the Bank team questioned if this might sooner or later
endanger the stability of the structure including the outlet of the fish ladder.
Additionally, there is a need to eliminate any future erosion that could jeopardize the
stability of the hydropower plant planned to be build on the right abutment (possibly in
SYNAS-II).

Recommended follow-up actions by CWR. Following the actions agreed per the Bank
supervision Aide Memoires of April and August 2010, the General Contractor finalized a
deal with a Subcontractor to complete the remaining works under the Aklak contract, and
as much as possible/realistic, before the SYNAS-1 closing date (December 2010). These
remaining works were mainly for (i) backfilling of the old river bed; (ii) installing a
35/10 kW transformer to secure permanent electricity supply for the structure, and (iii),
most importantly, to fix the bank scouring (erosion) downstream of the structure on both
sides of the river bed (particularly at the end of the fish ladder), which occurred after the
successful testing/receipt of the structure by the CWR engineers. Other than these 3
subcontracted works (which are not major, compared to the main works achieved), the
Bank and CWR teams urged the General Contractor to complete (as fast as possible) any
other pending/site-clearing works as per the contact.

During the November 2010 mission, the Bank team advised CWR to ensure that the
Aklak recent bank erosion on both sides of the river bed (and to a lesser extent,
downstream of the Aitek weir), are of a localized nature hence do not affect the structures
stability. The Bank mission suggested that this erosion may correspond either to an
under-design of the stilling basin or to an implementation shortcoming. The Bank team
advised CWR to, for example, advertise for a “turnkey? (design and build) contract in
order to secure a permanent solution. The CWR's local designer formulated a temporary
technical solution, and a corresponding Variation Order (VO) has been submitted by the
CWR to the Bank for no-objection. This would allow the Subcontractor to (at least


                                             27
temporarily) fix this scouring as well as complete the key remaining works under the
Aklak contract. The Bank mission helped in reaching this subcontracting deal (including
explaining to all three parties how the VO can be consistent with the Bank’s Procurement
Guidelines). The VO includes authorizing the Subcontractor to receive its related (IBRD
& GOK) payments directly in its bank account (while the separate subcontract between
the General Contractor and its Subcontractor will fairly share the liability periods relating
to the works undertaken by each). The CWR team implied that the erosion would be
adequately/temporarily tackled by the contractor.

Meanwhile (from December 2010 to March 2011, although SYNAS closed in December
2010), as part of the Bank’s due diligence in observing the Dam Safety OP/BP4.37, the
Bank team (assisted by FAO) undertook to review the design to figure out whether the
scouring problem is a design issue or an implementation issue. Part of the “as-built-
drawings? related to the ogee crest of the weir, the stilling basin and the tailwater channel
protection were verified, and preliminary hydraulic calculations and the design of the
stilling basin were checked, to help CWR propose corrective measures. The preliminary
analysis suggested that the structure is generally safe but there may have been a minor
design issue with the stilling basin due to selecting the weir location at a relatively high
altitude, hence the Bank/FAO team advised the CWR to monitor the erosion status. If
erosion escalates/continues, CWR should immediately engage a Hydraulic Structures
specialist to review the detailed design drawings/calculations, hence help CWR analyze
further the erosion cause/status and propose a feasible mitigation/protection, and also to
advise CWR on any follow-up activities at other SYNAS-I structures, including Aitek
Weir where milder erosion occurred. In late May 2011, CWR/PMU has implied that the
Aklak erosion has stabilized.


4. KAZALINSK Headworks

Situation before SYNAS-I implementation. The old mechanical and electrical
equipment installed in 1970 was worn out and did not fulfill any longer its required
functions.

Objective of rehabilitation works. To replace/modernize all mechanical and electrical
equipment and to repair the stilling basins and downstream aprons of the diversion
structures.

Outcome of rehabilitation works. According to information provided by headworks
operation staff, all replaced mechanical and electrical parts are functioning well.
However, no structural rehabilitation works were executed.

Present operation & maintenance. Headworks operation is said to be smooth, and
there are no maintenance issues. However, an unstable vortex, whose cause is not well
understood, was observed in the headwater of the left gate. It may be occurring in the
context of (possibly damaged) submerged guiding walls for keeping the left bank intake
free from bedload material.




                                             28
Recommended follow-up actions by CWR. As in the case of all rehabilitation activities
of big hydraulic structures , due diligence would require preparation of a list of executed
rehabilitation works, their detailed specifications, and test results including final
handover comments, and to compare these with those specified in the respective
rehabilitation/construction contracts. In this particular case, the cause of the vortex
activity should be investigated and mitigation measures should be implemented if found
necessary. However, the vortex size/location does not seem to pose any worrisome
safety risks.

5. AITEK Regulation Weir

Situation before SYNAS-I implementation. The Aitek weir, characterized by a limited
flow capacity of 400 m3/s in summer and a reduced flow capacity of 200 m3/s due to ice
formation in winter, was in danger of collapse. The destruction of the regulation weir
would have led to crop failure on an irrigated area of 16,700 ha.

Objective of rehabilitation works. To construct a new weir with a maximum design
flow capacity of 700 m3/s in summer and 425 m3/s in winter.

Outcome of rehabilitation works. The new Aitek regulation weir fulfills its purpose.
The Syr Darya discharge capacity below the weir is significantly increased and water
availability for irrigation purposes is ensured.

Present operation & maintenance. There are specific operation rules for the weir gates
due to the particular flow conditions in winter which lead to higher tailwater levels than
for the same discharges in summer. When the weir was visited some 430 m3/s were
being discharged. Turbulence in the stilling basin as well as in the tailwater channel was
stronger than expected, and was causing some erosion along the left and right tailwater
channel banks. The latter is such that common maintenance works may most probably
not mitigate the problem, leading to a need for a comprehensive solution (similar to the
Aklak weir situation, albeit with a lesser extent ).

Recommended follow-up actions by CWR. As is the case of the Aklak weir, the “as-
built-drawings? related to the ogee crest, the stilling basin and the tailwater protection
should be verified, the hydraulic calculations and designs for the stilling basin should be
checked, and erosion protection/mitigation measures should be designed and
implemented as soon as feasible. For these purposes, the same Hydraulic Structure
Specialist who would be recruited to address the erosion at the Aklak weir, and help
CWR to follow up the other structures built under the SYNAS-I(e.g. appraise the
completed works and design any required follow up or O&M measures).

Component D: Aquatic Resources and Fisheries Development

The project aimed to improve conditions of lakes in the Syr Darya delta and the NAS by
reducing salinity through more supply of freshwater. This was to help in increasing
production of fish in these water bodies, and in improving ecology and biodiversity. The
project initially included US$2.0 million for improving aquatic life in the rehabilitated
water bodies, including US$1.5 million for technical assistance and consulting services


                                            29
and US$0.5 for works. However, since the start of the project, the GOK has been
emphasizing the need to use grant funds as much as possible for implementation of this
component.

Among the many ideas/activities for inclusion into this component, rehabilitation of two
existing hatcheries in the delta area next to the NAS, at Koszher/Kamyshlybash (for
Cyprinid and other forms of freshwater aquaculture) and Tastak (for sturgeon), were
considered to be the most essential. At the start of the project, USAID assisted with
rehabilitation of these hatcheries, providing equipment such as incubators, technical
assistance and training.

With this work done by USAID, by the time of the SYNAS-I project mid-term review
(MTR) in 2005, the PMU presumed that the project funds for rehabilitation of hatcheries
would not be required and decided to reallocate the civil works funds (US$0.5 million)
for rehabilitation of hydraulic structures and canals supplying water to Kamyshlybash
lake. However, despite repeated efforts/reminders during World Bank missions, no
progress was made in preparing designs for these works. During preparation of the
SYNAS-II project, a superior solution for restoring fresh water flows to the system of
lakes in the delta, including Kamyshlybash lake, was identified and adopted. The PMU
thus felt (and the Bank’s MTR mission agreed) that the utility of the works for restoring
flows to the lake as conceptualized, using limited SYNAS-I project funds, was very low,
and that the works should therefore not be undertaken in this way. It was deemed that a
better resolution of the issue would be obtained under the SYNAS-II project (and by
2010 the CWR had decided to undertake the Kamyshlybash lake works, together with
other proposed works on the Akshatau and Aksai-Kuandarya lake systems, under the
SYNAS-II project).

Meanwhile, more resources to complete rehabilitation of ponds for fish stock, pumps and
power lines were needed at the two above mentioned hatcheries. It was therefore agreed
that the funds for civil works would be used to carry out some rehabilitation of the ponds
and associated works at the two hatcheries. In parallel, the Bank mobilized the JSDF
grant (see below) to provide technical assistance to develop fisheries in the project area
through a community-based development approach. There have been savings out of the
remaining US$1.5 million allocated to this component (and provided from the GOK
budget) for technical assistance/consulting services; only a small part of these funds was
required for designing and supervising rehabilitation works for ponds at the two
hatcheries. The savings have been used to meet the additional cost of project supervision
and management due to extension of the project implementation period.

Community-Based Aral Sea Fisheries Management and Sustainable Livelihoods
Project (JSDF Grant of US$1.9 million, approved on March 27, 2008)

The JSDF-supported Kazakhstan Community-Based Aral Sea Fisheries Management and
Sustainable Livelihoods Project, which supports the fishing communities around the NAS as a
supplement to the SYNAS-1 project, is ongoing. The objectives of this capacity-building
project are to improve living conditions for vulnerable, marginalized fishing communities
in the NAS region by developing local capacity for improved and sustainable
management of the resource base, enhancing income generating opportunities, and


                                            30
supporting access to basic social infrastructure and services. The SYNAS PMU is
managing the implementation of the grant, for which certain funds are available under the
grant.

Aral Tenizi is the implementing NGO that was identified during grant preparation since it
had been working with fishing communities around the NAS for over ten years and was
well-qualified for the work under the grant. It was foreseen that the PMU would have
procurement expertise but would need to hire technical expertise to assist with the
development of detailed technical proposals ready for procurement. The NGO was hired
to carry out many of the implementation tasks. The above arrangement has already been
tested through completion of two procurements, namely (i) procurement of furniture and
toys for kindergartens/baby nurseries in Aralsk and (ii) procurement of vehicle and
ambulance for the remote fishing villages. Also, by the end of December 2010, a water
truck was to be procured for the communities.

The SYNAS PIU in Kyzylorda facilitates the implementation of the grant, and the Bank
team therefore recommended extension of the contracts of the PIU core staff until the
start of the SYNAS-II project. It needed to be strengthened with a few short-term
technical consultants, to be hired for the NGO Aral Tenizi. Grant implementation has
been slow (disbursements were only at US$407,000 or 22% of the target by June 2011).
The Bank mission met with PMU staff in Astana and the representative of the NGO
“Aral Tenizi? in Karateren who administrates the JSDF grant, to discuss the status of
implementation and pending issues. According to the procurement plan activities are
significantly behind schedule. The NGO representatives reported that a Grant
Coordinator had been hired in November 2010 and that she would start in December
2010 to conduct training on project design (proposal writing) for fishermen in 15 villages.
The mission informed the PMU staff that most construction works should be started no
later than March 2011, failing which the Grant funds would be returned. The mission
also emphasized the need for a Building Engineer/Architect to be in place this year, so
that key civil works could be prepared and implemented from the spring of 2011
onwards. At least one year will be needed for implementing the works and supplying the
goods (before the grant closes on 27 March 2012), and therefore, if by mid of 2011 the
contract documents for these works/goods are not prepared, the Bank and the CWR will
consider canceling the related portion/categories of the JSDF grant.

The Bank mission encouraged the CWR to mobilize the eligible consultants category of
the JSDF grant for extending the contracts of the core staff of the PIU of SYNAS (who
have accumulated good experience over the 8.5 years of the SYNAS-I project) at least
until the start of the SYNAS-II project. The extension of the contracts has been important
for several reasons, namely (i) to keep the PIU operational to properly complete the
SYNAS-I project, including completion of the Aklak structure works by GOK beyond
the project closing date, (ii) to manage the 4-month grace period of the project as well as
the defect liability period for its key works contracts, (iii) to support the ICR missions to
be undertaken by the Bank; (iv) to continue managing the JSDF grant project, and (v) to
help CWR finalize the preparation and processing of the proposed SYNAS-II project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

At project evaluation (2010) the realized benefits, particularly those related to
incremental agricultural production, are at best only at partial or interim levels, and are
not readily definable. However, viability of the capital investments has been
demonstrated by a simplified, indicative and likely conservative estimation of the
annualized monetary gains attributable to the project’s water sector investments and
achieved to date in the five key areas of (i) fisheries, (ii) crop production, (iii) livestock,
(iv) flood protection and reduced water losses, and (v) ecology and the environment. The
ratio of the capital costs to the annualized benefits is used as an indicator of economic
viability. A ratio value of less than 10 is deemed to demonstrate economic viability, and
the actual value obtained of 6.4 is therefore considered to be a good result.

  This is a modest estimate of the number of direct beneficiaries. The total direct and indirect beneficiaries
are about 1 million people, mainly in Kyzylorda oblast, the poorest region of the country. The project has
directly improved the wellbeing of 150,000 to 200,000 people in Aralsk and Kazalinsk raions of this oblast
(an internationally recognized area affected by the Aral Sea environmental catastrophe).

   These types of benefits are mainly attributed to the increase in NAS surface area, leading to less
eutrophication, less dusty wind storms, and better recreation.

Regional outlook: Kyzylorda oblast is a desert region with highly unfavorable climate,
but with vast mineral resources. The region is also characterized by deteriorated and
rudimentary infrastructure. Rural settlements are predominant, and economy is heavily
dependent on agriculture production. Another salient feature of the local economy is its
reliance on the national budget; over 90% of the regional expenditures are subsidized by
Astana.

Positive outcome for the social environment: Interviews and statistical data show
social environment has benefited significantly from improvement in performance of
various agricultural sectors. Increase in amount and quality of water, crop and livestock
has not only produced a direct poverty-reduction effect, but also created a long-term
investment into health and nutrition of the Aral Sea community. For instance,
introduction of fish into the ration of the population resulted in a rapid decline in
maternal mortality rates, as well as iron and iodine deficiency disorders. Prevalence of
water- and airborne diseases was also reduced due to the drop in salinity and occurrence
of dust winds. Moreover, economic growth has facilitated population return flow,
especially into the seashore areas and the Syr Darya basin. Considerable increase in
fishery production, as well as urban wages, has positively influenced migration balance in
the region.

Threats to sustainability: Several challenges to the economic and social well-being of
the region’s population remain and need to be addressed: malnutrition, drug and alcohol
consumption and inadequate public health infrastructure. It is also advisable to promote
better engagement of business and community in the fish production.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)
Meetings with Beneficiaries in Karateren during ICR mission November 2010

During its field trip to the Aral Sea region, the ICR mission met in Karateren village with
a number of fishermen and representatives from the NGO Aral Tenizi. Findings are
presented below

Fisheries. In responding to the questions posed by the mission team, the fishermen ran
through the history of the Aral Sea’s decline, from its near death in the 1980s to its more
recent return with construction of the Aralsk dam in 1996 and the Kokaral dike in 2002.
They said that fishing in the NAS had been reduced to basically one species (flounder) at
its lowest point, but they said they now catch a variety of species (including roach,
bream, perch, carp, catfish, and pike) in greater numbers than ever before. The fishermen
indicated that the fish catch had increased from around 500 tons in the mid-1990s to
about 3,000 tons in 2009 (this figure more or less confirmed by the PMU data, but may
not reflect unreported catches). The fishermen believe that the informal/unreported
catches definitely far exceed the formally-declared catches. They indicated that the
quality of fish has improved and their size has increased. The NAS fishermen also
explained that they work in two seasons, spring and autumn, and work one of the ten
designated fishing sites on the NAS that are owned by local fishermen who pay for a
license to fish the site. A small percentage of the catch (roughly 30 percent) goes to the
local market, with the bulk of the catch (roughly 70 percent) going either to the big cities
in Kazakhstan or to export markets in Russia or Europe. They said the pike perch is the
best fish to catch because it is best suited for export. In order to improve their situation,
the fishermen indicated that they need improved infrastructure in order to reach the
fishing camps (this is what limits them to only two seasons) and coolers and refrigeration
for summer fishing. They also said that they want to organize into a cooperative in order
to improve their economic situation. Nevertheless, as the catch has peaked in 2007, the
Bank task team would advise the local authorities to analyze the tradeoffs of extending
the fishing season, as this may compromise the renewal of stocks.

Biodiversity and Environment. When asked about the wildlife (biodiversity) in the
NAS region, the fishermen said that the numbers of birds and other animals in the area
are definitely increasing. They specifically mentioned migratory species (ducks, swans)
that pass through the NAS during their annual migration south. They also mentioned
increasing numbers of wild pigs, jackals, antelopes, etc, many of which they hunt. When
asked about the health of the local population, the fishermen indicated that there were no
major problems with health in the community now. They said that the number of sand
and dust storms originating from the Aral Sea bed had decreased in recent years, so the
traditional health problems associated with those events (respiratory problems) were
declining. The fishermen also indicated that there were no water-related health problems
in the community to speak of. The fishermen were not in a position to answer questions
about crop or livestock production.




                                             38
Future Projects. Unprompted, the fishermen did not hesitate to say that they were in
favor of the GOK’s proposed 50-meter NAS dike SYNAS-II project option. They also
would like to stop the loss of fish and fingerlings that now pass through the NAS spillway
to the LAS. They say that these fish have no chance of survival there and hence should be
kept in the NAS. They proposed a fish ladder to allow the fish to return to the NAS, but
they admitted that a fish net or electric shock mechanism might be more effective.

Media report from Karateren Village (adjacent to NAS): 06 April 2006

Previously Mr. Zhaisanbayev, a compact, athletic man, worked at a fish-processing plant.
But that plant closed in 2001, and to support his three young children he took a job
working at a social club in a larger town.

"When the sea came back I knew I must fish," he said.

On a good day now, fishing for carp and flounder, he can earn US$85, an astronomical
sum in a region where many people survive on a few dollars a day. Mr. Zhaisanbayev
unfurled long hand-woven carpets across his large living room to make his visitors
welcome while his wife prepared piles of dried apricots, horse sausages and brick-red
pistachios in a kitchen sparkling with new appliances imported from Korea. With the
disappearance of the sea, fish and the ecologically interconnected freshwater lakes that
supported livestock, many people in the region migrated to larger cities.

Mr. Zhaisanbayev said many are now returning. His village’s population has more than
doubled, to more than 1,700, in the past two years.

For many in the Aral region, the new water is confirmation that the Aral's past is
prologue. Kudaibergen Sarzhanov, a spry former Soviet minister of fisheries for
Kazakhstan in the Gorbachev years, plans a 2009 release of 30,000 fish native to the
Aral, that he has been incubating at home, financing his project from a small United
Nations grant and money from his local government.

At the Komushbosh Fishing Hatchery, a modern fish incubator paid for with a
US$143,000 grant from Israel, the plan is to release as many as 30 million young
sturgeon, carp, and flounder into the Aral and its many nearby lakes when water levels
are at full level. This translates into a potential catch of 10,000 to 12,000 tons a year,
compared with 20,000 in the Aral’s heyday and the current 1,000.

Some in the Kazakhstan government warn of a long road ahead.

"It's going to take decades to solve this problem," said Murat Abenov, the akim, or
deputy mayor, of the large Kizbilordinsk region abutting much of the Aral. He said the
fishing should be encouraged "even if it's really only going to be in five years that they
see results, even if it no longer matters to the government's budget." Kazakhstan has huge
oil reserves, and oil revenues now provide 90 percent of local government budgets, he
said.




                                           39
Many still predict that the big Aral will disappear. "We tried but failed to work with the
Uzbeks," said Ikram Adirbekov, the akim for the Kyzylorda region. "The rescue of the
Aral Sea is now our problem alone."

News of the Aral’s return has ignited the hope of many, even in villages not yet affected.
"The fishermen are getting rich," said Guljanat Karashalan, a 19-year-old English-
speaker who studies at a university by correspondence from her village. She says half her
friends have left the region but will come back. "They say the jobs will return."

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
(if any)

A public hearing workshop was conducted in Kyzylorda City with participation from the
local government entities as well as community water-user groups. The public hearing
praised the results of the SYNAS-I project and recommended going for the second phase
(SYNAS-II) project, with the preferred option of raising the water level in
"Saryshiganak" bay to 46m (by building a new 10-km long cutoff dike in addition to a
45-km long adduction canal with sufficient gradient to take flows from the Syr Darya
river), as opposed to the less-feasible option of trying to restore further the entire NAS by
raising the existing “Kokaral? dike built under the SYNAS-I project. The GOK is
currently comparing these two options with support from the World Bank team.

Extract from Borrower’s Draft ICR Report - Conclusion

As a result of SYNAS project implementation, the following key interim project
objectives were achieved:
1. Carrying capacity of the Syr Darya river bed increased from 350 to 700 m3 / sec at
Kyzylorda-Kazalinsk control structure, which removed threat of flooding Kyzylorda city,
Zhalagash, Karmakshi and Kazalinsk raions of Kyzylorda oblast with population over
400,000 people, as well as prevented significant damage to irrigation systems and
existing infrastructure.
2. Preservation of the NAS as a geographical and climate-forming site reduced salt and
dust pollution from the dry sea bed, which led to improvement of health, restoration of
biodiversity of the sea and flora and fauna of Sub-Aral area, and mitigation of impact of
the Aral Sea drying on environment.
3. Improvement of water supply of irrigation systems on area of over 70,000 hectares
and coastal lake system, nature complexes and hayfields on area of over 65,000 hectares
in the Syr Darya river delta, which is expected to result in sustainable improvement of
crop yields and development of livestock breeding and fisheries.
4. Safe operation of Chardara dam and stabilization of operation mode of Chardara
hydropower plant will lead to higher generation of power in winter time.
5. Improvement of environmental, social and economic situation in the region and Sub-
Aral area:
• Development of local fish species and creation of favorable conditions for breeding of
    sturgeon;
• Fish catch increased from 400 to 2,000 tons in is expected to increase in future to
    11,000 tons.
6. Reliability of existing hydraulic structures on the river, increase of their operating life,
and improvement of operational features of Kazalinsk and Kyzylorda headworks.

Project Social Impacts in the Region

During execution of works in the first phase, around 2,000 local people were directly
engaged in construction works for 3-4 years. Dozens of companies in Kyzylorda and
South-Kazakhstan oblasts had business with the construction companies; quarries of
various construction materials supplied rock mass, quarry stone, aggregate and sand.
Local plants in difficult economic times of their operation were engaged in
manufacturing of hydraulic and other equipment for hydraulic structures.
Local power companies designed and built power transmission lines for Aitek weir and
Aklak control structure.

Over 70 km of roads built during implementation of the NAS Dam and Aklak Control
Structure contract allowed organizing regular passenger and cargo transportation to
formerly hard-to-access villages at both sides of the Smaller Aral Sea. Life is reviving in
formerly abandoned fishing auls Karateren, Karashalan, and Bugun. Dozens of new
houses are being built, those who left come back to their home land. During the reporting
period, significant increase of salaries of employed population was observed; this
situation in Aral and Kazalinsk rayons is indirectly associated with project
implementation. Project implementation resulted in creation of new jobs, new fish
processing plants and workshops were built, and new service and other enterprises were
opened.

Completion of Aklak control structure will enable the local population to develop fishing,
and to significantly increase livestock, because the new control structure will allow
increasing areas of hayfields and pastures. Population in the region believed in project
results – many fishermen, who had left earlier, started coming back and engage in their
traditional occupations, fishing at the NAS and delta lakes. Well-being of population is
improving, and as a result new houses are built every year, people buy vehicles and every
family has domestic appliances.

                                    Conclusion
 to the Report     1ICR0000874 for completion and implementation and results for
      the loan in amount US$64.5 mln in Republic of Kazakhstan of the project
  “Syrdarya river bed control and preservation of north part of Aral sea? phase-1
                                from May 12, 2011

       Implementation completion report for the project “Syrdarya river bed regulation
and preservation of north part of Aral sea?-phase-1 (further SYNAS-1) performed by
Department of Sustainable Development, Europe and Central Asia region includes
following main sections and issues:

   (i) Project context, development aims and design;
   (ii) Key factors, affecting on implementation and results;
   (iii) Assesment of results, risks affecting on results and also works of Borrower and
         Bank;
   (iv) Lessons learned.

      SYNAS-1 project is first phase of rehabilitation of Syrdarya river basin in terms of
program of Aral sea basin (PASB), confirmed by heads of Central Asia goverments in
1994.

       The report provides a summary of the assumptions leading to the shrinkage of the
Aral Sea as a consequence of the extensive development of agriculture in Central Asia
during the four-decade period. This has led to serious economic, social and
environmental damage in the Aral Sea and around the so-called "the most serious
environmental disaster in modern history." The report rightly pointed out that the project
SYNAS-1 is a priority in the water sector in Kazakhstan.

        Preparation of the SYNAS-1 was completed in 2001 with support of World Bank,
and its implementation was completed in 2010. The project cost was US$86 million, of
which 61 million U.S. dollars of World Bank loans.

        In the report the main objectives of the project identified on the basis of the
Project Appraisal Document: (i) support and increase in agricultural (including livestock)
and fishery production in the Syr Darya River basin; (ii) improving public and animal
health, as well as restoration of biological diversity by ensuring that preserve the
Northern Aral Sea (NAS) and improve environmental conditions and environment in the
delta and around the NAS. Also, for the appropriate key performance indicators that were
used to measure the achievement of these goals.

        The total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries is about 1 million people,
mainly in the Kyzyl-Orda region. The project directly improves the welfare of 150 000 to
200 000 people in the Aral and Kazaly areas of this region (recognized by the
international community, the region of ecological disaster of the Aral Sea).



                                           47
        The Project was the first in a series of investment operations that will reduce the
risks caused in Shardara dam, and will improve the efficiency of water supply, water
distribution and use around the basin. The report shows the description of all components
of the project according to their main goals and objectives, as well as a breakdown of
project costs and components, work categories and funding sources.

         There were no significant changes in the components of the project affecting the
results of the project, in general. Although there was a reallocation of funds between
activities to finance additional works such as roads and other necessary activities, which
were not planned initially.

        Management and interagency coordination of the project was carried out by the
Committee of water resources, and although during project implementation there was a
transfer of the Committee from one agency to another (from the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment to the Ministry of Agriculture), it had a minimal impact on
the project. Project Management Unit, initially based at Almaty, and then in Astana, was
responsible for the daily management and administration of the project, and a group of
consultants, located in Kyzylorda assisted in the technical design, preparation of
contracts, supervision of construction work, monitoring and evaluation and tasks in
project management. Also, there was not always a completely effective support provided
by international and local consulting firms and individual consultants in these areas.

        Other institutional measures envisaged include the creation and operation of (i)
inter-agency Coordinating Committee (ICC), (ii) the Supervisory Committee of the
project (NPC), (iii) Basin Advisory Group (BCG), and (iv) an independent panel of
experts (IPPs) to work on dam safety for Shardara dam.

       The first and fourth of these institutions have carried out the work and made a
timely and significant contribution to the successful implementation of the project.

        In general, the project SYNAS-1 has been implemented as it was envisaged
during appraisal. In the framework of the project it was implemented seven major
contracts for construction of new or reconstruction of existing water facilities on the
SyrDarya river and the Aral Sea: (1) construction of a dam on the northern part of the
Aral Sea (through the Strait of Berg) with the spillway structure in order to restore and
stabilize the water level and salinity of the NAS; (2) construction of Aklak weir hydraulic
structures; (3) the construction of Aitek weir and reconstruction of head structures in the
channel Karaozek, (4) rehabilitation of existing and construction of new protection dams
at key points along the river for flood protection and improve the channel capacity Syr
Darya; (5) and (6) repair and Kazaly Kyzylorda headworks; (7) Shardara rehabilitation of
the dam in order to improve dam safety and increase carrying capacity.

        The report stated that to perform the work in whole scope prevented a number of
problems, which include (i) the failure to perform the necessary design work because of
increasing costs and limited budget, (ii) and vice versa, the implementation has not
previously provided, but necessary and beneficial work, and (iii) the general extension of
the project from 5 to 9 years.


                                            48
       According to the Bank’s opinion the following factors influenced to the
implementation: (i) the differences between Kazakhstan and international standards and
requirements for detailed design, cost estimating, pre-bid approval, evaluation of tenders
and approve the award of contracts; (ii) coming n of high-water period for a few years,
which led to delays and additional needs for protective works and control of water with a
corresponding increase in costs; (iii) the need to build infrastructure facilities (roads,
power lines, camps, etc.), etc.

       Implementation of the project SYNAS-1 as a whole, comply with the applicable
measures of security policy of the Bank, which were identified during the assessment
phase of the project: (i) Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01), (ii)
Dam Safety (OP 4.37, BP 4.37) and (iii) Projects on International Waters (OP 7.50, BP
7.50, GP 7.50). The report noted the estimated risks in procurement and financial
management of the project of PMU consultants, and in general, the course of project
implementation and financial management of the project to assess the Bank corresponds
to "moderately satisfactory".

        SYNAS-I project has been successfully implemented as a tool for achieving
targeted results and the expected benefits. During a visit to virtually completed and
exploited sites were marked by minor deficiencies associated with the erosion of the
downstream slopes and facilities Aklak and Aitek (in a less degree), which must be
eliminated.

        Finally, in addition to the benefits achieved, revealed significant additional
potential environmental and socio-economic benefits to be realized through further cost-
effective investments. SYNAS-2 project is formulated in such a way as to further
promote regional development.

        The report provides a brief assessment of the achievement of project objectives,
the economic viability of the key areas of economic development in the Syrdarya basin,
and, according to the Bank’s opinion in terms of the relevance of the objectives, goals
and economic efficiency, the project results are satisfactory, with only one minor
deficiencies noted.

          In general, the Committee on Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture of
Kazakhstan agrees submitted Report on the completion and implementation and results of
the loan in the amount of 64.5 million dollars the Republic of Kazakhstan as of 1st phase
of the project on Regulation of the Syrdarya river bed and the preservation of the
northern Aral Sea from May 12, 2011 with the following comments:

   1.    Procurement of consulting services, works and goods were carried out in
         accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
         Credits" as stated in Annex 4 to the Loan Agreement between Kazakhstan and
         IBRD (loan number 4609 KZ), therefore, must be excluded from the evaluation
         report for state procurements in Kazakhstan.
   2.    Committee cannot agree with the conclusion of the Bank that the regulatory
         requirements in Kazakhstan to the depth development of a Feasibility study and



                                           49
        detailed design have led to delays and disputes, although they are much
        different from international.
   3.   This comment includes only the main part of the Report, due to the absence in
        submitted document applications 1-9 in accordance with the contents of the
        Report.
