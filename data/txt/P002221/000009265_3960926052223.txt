MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIOr: OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO RWANDA
FOR THE SECOND INTEGRATED FORESTRY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Rwanda for
SDR 11.0 million (US$14.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA tenms and would help finance the
development of forestry and its integration into the agriculture and livestock
farming systems in Rwanda. Up to 20Z of the proceeda of the Credit would be
onlent at the IBRD rate for 20 years including 5 years grace to livestock revenue-
earning entities and pasture owners in the Gishwati livest'ock component to
consolidate investments begun in the first project and to farmers in Gishwati for
development of the degraded parts of the Gishwati forest. The beneficiaries would
bear the foreign exchange risk.
Background
2.       Rwanda's population of 6.0 million or 250 persons per km2 makes it the
most densely settled country in continental Africa. The high populaticn growth
rate of 3.7Z per annum means increasing densities leading to fragmentation of
holdings, overgrazing by livestock, soil erosion and severe deforestation to
satisfy energy nee-s and open up more land for cultivation. Deforestation
threatens watersheds, land and soil resources and degrades the natural resource
base upon which development will ultimately depend.  The Government of Rwanda
(GOR) recognizes the seriousness of the situation and has introduced a number of
measures to improve forestry and natural resource management. These measures
include (a) the adoption of a policy and action plan to protect the natural
forests of the Zaire-Nile Crest; (b) the introduction of a Forestry Law, soon to
be promulgated, that sets out the legal framework for future forestry development,
strengthens the policing powers of the Forestry Department and establishes a
forestry development fund; (c) the initiation of a natio.swide drive to introduce
soil protection measures and encourage tree planting. The Government is presently
preparing, as part of its 1987-1991 fourth national development plan, a forestry
sub-sector plan and investment program that will proviae the basis for coordinated
donor support to the forestry sector.
3.       The first IDA-assisted forestry project was d-signed to develop the
institutional capacity for forest policy formulation in Rwanda, to initiate a
reforestation program to provide fuelvood and industrial wood for the country and
to develop livestock and agriculture in the Gishwati forest area in western Rwanda
in such a way as to limit livestock and human encroachment and conserve forest
resources. With other donors, principally Switzerland, the project has assisted
GOR to lay the groundwork for forestry policy formulation, and has achieved
physical targets for plantation and pasture establishment. It has, however, been
less successful in limiting livestock and human encroachment in the Gishwati
forest and, due to the poor sites of the urban fuelvood plantations, up to 30% may
not be commercially productive. The project has had limited impact on farm-level
integration of forestry, agriculture and livestock activities because of
inadequate attention to extension. Poor managerial and technical decisions by the
project unit on the operations of livestock revenue earning entities have
adversely affected their financial viability. An important aspect of this
management has been the centralization ef decision-making in the project



- 2 -
coordination unit in Kigali (GBK project unit) somewhat removed from the daily
management of activities in Gishwati. In addition, the involvement of influential
people as pasture owners in the Gishwati livestock component has politicized its
management. The proposed second project would assist GOR to correct these
environmental and management problems by supporting the Implementation of
Government's Natural Forest Conservation and Management Action Plan, a major
objective of which is to strengthen the protection of the natural forests. Forest
protection activities would complement those of other donors - CCCE France,
European Development Fund, and Swiss Aid who are also assisting GOR to implement
the Action Plan. With regard to management, the project would support the
decentralization of decision-making on the Gishwati pasture and dairy activities.
It would institute higher levels of cost recovery for pasture investments and
promote private sector management of pasture and dairy activities. Intensified
delivery of extension services would also be supported.
4.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project would build on lessons learned
and experience gained in the first project and on policy developments in the
forestry sector to (a) support the Implementation of new measures to protect and
conserve Rwanda's remaining natural forests of the Zaire-Nile Divide; (b) promote
farm forestry as a cost effective means of increasing fuelvood supplies; (c)
consolidate investments in plantations and pastures made in the first project; and
(d) continue to reinforce the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture to plan,
supervise and monitor forestry sector programs. The project would assist the
Ministry to better integrate project activities into the normal ministry structure
and, where suitable, transfer management of these activities to the private
sector.
5.       Prolect Description.  The proposed project ould be Implemented over a
six-year period including a one-year build-up phase. Project activities would
compriset (a) protection and conservation of the Nyungwe sad Gishwati natural
forests through the development of buffer plantations, an ecological inventory and
a natural resources monitoring and evaluation program; (b) support to agroforestry
and rural afforestation through the strengthening of seedling production and
distribution, establishment of a rural afforestation monitoring and evaluation
program and training of higher level foresters and other forestry workers; (c)
integrated forestry, agriculture and livestock development in Gislwati including
consolidation of investments in pastures and industrial plantations made in the
first project; development of an additional 2,000 ha of protection plantations on
denuded slopes; a land use study and support for new approaches to land
management; and intensification of extension services around the forestg (d)
maintenance of fuelwood and pole short rotation plantations developed in the first
project; (e) applied forestry and livestock nutrition research; and (f) pilot
pasture rehabilitation in the Mutara region. Total project cost is estimated at
US$20.1 with a foreign exchange component of US$8.5 million or 42S. Proposed IDA
financing amounts to US$14.1 million (70Z of project costs). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement and a disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing eveL%s and the status of Bank Group
operations in Rwanda are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6586 RW dated May 6, 1987 and including a map of Rwanda is
also attached. A Project Preparation Facility of US$1.5 million (to be refinanced
under the Credit) has been arranged to facilitate start-up of project activities.



-3-
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the
Rwandese economy and its development has received strong IDA support. A primary
objective of IDA's agricultural strategy for Rwanda is the development of a
national approach to sectoral problems, by improving the policy framework and
investment strategy, including investment planning and management. To this end,
IDA has recently financed two operations in extension and research which address
key national issues of agricultural services. The proposed project would support
the implementation of new national policy measures for forest protection and
promotion of agroforestry.  This would be fully consistent with Bank group
strategy on zorest conservation and wildlands management. Furthermore, the
project would provide a major impetus to efforts to promote private sector
participation in economic activities in Rwanda.
7.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements were reached with GOR on:
(a) the composition and terms of reference of the project management committee;
(b) completion of the wood pricing and marketing study by February 1, 1988 and
preparation and prompt implementation of an acceptable action plan on wood
pricing; (c) completion of the livestock subsector study by December 31, 1987 and
development and prompt implementation of a milk pricing policy with the objective
of promoting efficient milk production and marketing; (d) phasing out of the GBK
project unit by December 31, 1992; (e) a five-fold increase in the level of cost
recovery from beneficiaries of pastures developed in the first project and
recovery from the liveatock revenue earning entities of all proposed investments
in the entities in the second project and an average 40 percent of funds invested
in them in the first project; (c) completion of the Gishwati land use study by
February 29, 1988 and preparation and prompt implementation of an acceptable
action plan on the future use of the degraded parts of the Gishwati forest. Prior
to credit effectiveness GOR would: (a) reduce the personnel of the GBK project
unit, and that of tie Gishwati livestock revenue-earning entities by about 252;
(b) revise former pasture rental contracts and assure that all beneficiaries of
pastures developed in the first project have signed the new contracts providing
for a four-fold increase in rentals; (c) develop an acceptable pricing mechanism
for milk; (d) create the Nyungwe project unit and employ a unit director, an
ecologist and a forester. As a condition of disbursement for expansion of the
Gishwati dairy beyond 5,000 liters per day processing capacity, GOR would present
an acceptable action plan to improve dairy processing and marketing countrywide.
8.       Justification.  The project is justified by the economy-wide ecological
and hydrological benefits from the protection and conservation of two of Rwanda's
remaining tropical high-altitude natural forests; institutional development
benefits from improved ministry level planning, monitoring and evaluation of
forestry sector programs; the production of an incremental 2.4 million m3 of
fuelwood and industrial wood valued at US$45.3 million and the incremental
production of meat and dairy products valued at $0.7 million per annum at full
development; the generation of about 9,000 mant years of rural employment over the
project investment period and wide distributicn of benefits, covering over 75,000
farm families most of them in absolute poverty. An overall economic rate of
return has not been calculated for the project because the bulk of investments
(67%) are in activities where benefits are difficult to quantify such as natural
forest protection. Rates of return have, however, been calculated for four
activities (33% of project cost4 for which benefits are more readily quantifiable.
They range from 16% for the Gishwati new plantation development to 452 for pasture
maintenance. The financial rate of return for farmers engaged in posture
activities is 652. Farmers participating in and adopting extension



-4-
recommendations, would experience an average yearly income increase of about $132
or 22Z of family income by project year 7. The project would be sustainable after
the investment period because revenues from wood sales in the forest plantations
and cost recovery from pasture beneficiaries and revenue-earning entities would,
on average, more than cover post project recurrent costs.
9.       Risks.  The major project risk is related to Government's commitment to
implement the management reforms proposed for the Gishwati component in the face
of probable political pressure. The Government has shown its com itment by having
already begun measures to carry out these reforms. Another area of risk relates to
the capacity of the Forestry Department to provide adequate technical supervision
of the natural forest protection and conservation component. To minimize this
risk a full time ecologist would be engaged to assist In supervision cf these
activities, and to train Rwandese foresters to carry on after the project veriod.
The project would require substantial supervision from the Government and IDA to
monitor the effectiveness of implementation. Monitoring and evaluatior. have been
built into project design to generate the information necessary for s
supervision.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit wou~ co eply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that t. e Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
