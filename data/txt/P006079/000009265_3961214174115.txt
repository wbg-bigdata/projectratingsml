BARBADOS
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2782-BAR)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural
Development Project in Barbados, for which Loan 2782-BAR in the amount of
US$4.0 million equivalent was approved on February 24, 1987 and made effective on
November 17, 1987.
The loan was closed on September 30, 1995, compared with the original closing
date of December 31, 1993. Final disbursement took place on October 3, 1995, at which
time a balance of US$117,325.73 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. D. Wholey (Task Manager) LA3NR assisted by
Ms. S. Joss LA3NR and reviewed by Mr. J. Parker (Acting Chief) LA3NR and
Mr. R. Crown (Project Adviser), LA3DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission in
June-July 1995 which was carried out by Ms. S. Joss. The ICR is mostly based on
material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by
preparing its own evaluation of the project's implementation and results. A summary of
the Borrower's ICR is attached as Appendix II. The full text of the Borrower's ICR is
available in the LAC Documentation Center.

Evaluation Summary
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Ln. 2782-BAR)
BARBADOS
Introduction.
The Agricultural Development Project was consistent with the Bank's
development strategy for Barbados which encouraged2 Bank support for institutional
strengthening in key sectors, one of which is agriculture (Para. 1). The project built upon
the experience of two previous Bank-financed projects, the Technical Assistance Project
(Ln 2115) which supported institutional development in agriculture, and the Industrial
Credit Project (Ln. 2260) which provided support for agro-industry.
Project Objectives
The objectives of the Agricultural Development Project were: (i) to assist the
Government to define and implement an agricultural development strategy that is
technically feasible and financially and economically sound, and which has an appropriate
balance between the sugar and non-sugar sectors; and (ii) to increase production of, and
incomes from, non-sugar crops. The project consisted of three parts: an agricultural
sector study; technical assistance for agricultural diversification; and agro-industrial credit.
The objectives of the project (Para. 2) were both realistic and timely (Para. 3)
given the unprofitable state of the sugar industry at the time and its uncertain future with
impending changes in its traditional export markets. However, in drawing up the
objectives of the project, risks associated with resistance from the entrenched
sugar-interests against allocating land for crop diversification and their influence on
government policies would appear in retrospect to have been underestimated (Para. 4).
Implementation Experience and Results
The project was partially successful in achieving its objectives. The sector study
assisted government to define a feasible development strategy (Para. 5) for the agricultural
sector at a time when the sugar industry was in serious decline. Although overall output
from the non-sugar sub-sector did not change significantly during the project, the
disaggregated trade statistics reveal that there was a change from low value, low
technology crops to high value, high technology crops which is consistent with the
project's expected impact (Para. 6). In terms of its institutional capacity building
objectives, the project provided technical assistance and training to MAFF and through
MAFF to the agricultural community at a time when demand for information on
alternative crops was increasing (Para. 7). The project's objective to stimulate investment
in non-sugar agro-industry was achieved despite low demand for credit during much of the
2  Barbados graduated from IBRD in 1993.



-111-
project due to reduced investor confidence and excess liquidity in the banking system.
The credit funds were fully utilized and invested in a portfolio of generally successful
projects (Para. 8).
The totalproject cost was estimated at about US$5.8 million equivalent at
appraisal. The loan of US$4.0 million was made to finance 100 percent of foreign
exchange costs, and it was estimated that the balance of project costs, including taxes and
duties, would be financed as follows: US$1.0 million equivalent (17 percent) by
borrowers of the agro-industrial credit fund, US$0.3 million equivalent (5 percent) by
financial intermediaries and US$0.5 million equivalent (9 percent) by the Government. At
closure, US$3,882,674.27 had been disbursed from the loan and local costs incurred of
approx. US$1,736,000 equivalent, of which approx. US$1,660,000 represents investments
by borrowers and financial intermediaries with respect to the agro-industrial credit. The
loan was signed on March 12, 1987 and became effective on November 17, 1987. The
original disbursement period was estimated to be seven years. The original closing date of
December 31, 1993 was extended twice - to December 31, 1994 and then to September
30, 1995 at the request of the Borrower in order to complete the program of technical
assistance and fully disburse the credit fund.
The objectives of the project were achieved in spite of periods of apparently
limnited commitment to the project by the Borrower. In terms of sustainability, the project
is likely to maintain the achievements generated as a result of policies arising from the
sector study and adopted by Government (Para. 9). One major policy initiative that has
been implemented is the reform of the sugar industry around the newly-created Barbados
Agricultural Management Company (BAMC). Another indication is Government's
continuing policy support for agricultural diversification -- motivated by increasing fears
that preferential markets for sugar may soon disappear as a result of changes in global
trading arrangements. The project has left behind a critical mass of committed
professional and technical staff with training and experience in producing and marketing
altemative crops to sugar. The Industrial Credit Fund (ICF) is being continued without
Bank support and as a revolving fund, continues to generate funds for further lending.
Factors affecting the rate of implementation included: (i) those not generally
subject to Govemment control -- an economic depression throughout much of the
implementation period and the negative influence of entrenched sugar interests towards
crop-diversification (Para. 11); (ii) those subject to Govemment control -- appreciation of
local currency which slowed down economic activity and shortage of counterpart funding
which constrained MAFF, cumbersome Government procurement procedures, other
Government activities provided subsidized credit for the sugar industry and some specific
non-sugar activities (Para. 12) and; those which were subject to the control of the
implementing agencies -- weak project direction by the Ministry of Finance at the start of
the project, and slow performance by MAFF in procuring consultants initially, and weak
coordination with CBB subsequently (Para. 13).
The Bank's performance is considered to be satisfactory overall. However, its
role in the preparation and appraisal of the credit component was somewhat deficient.
The Bank identified the credit component during appraisal. The appraisal mission failed to



-iv-
fully investigate the demand for, and availability of, credit for agro-industrial investments
and, as a result, the inclusion of the credit component in the project is questionable (Para.
14). The Bank also failed at appraisal to identify a weakness in the arrangements for the
management of the project (Para. 15). The Bank's performance during implementation
was satisfactory. The Bank worked with the CBB to improve the outcome of the agro-
industrial credit component (Para. 16). Twice the Bank agreed to changes in the formula
for calculating the discount rate on ICF loans to improve the competitiveness3 of the
credit line. The Bank also encouraged the hiring of management consultants to assist
potential clients prepare investment projects, and to investigate the lack of demand for
agro-industrial credit. (Para. 16). The Bank was supportive of MAFF's initiative to switch
the focus of the TA component from cotton to cut-flowers.
The Borrower's performance was satisfactory (Para. 17), in spite of limited
ownership of the project during early implementation which contributed to problems in
project coordination, and in recruiting consultants and procufing equipment. This lack of
project ownership is likely attributable to lack of Borrower involvement during project
preparation which was largely delegated to FAO, which was apparently unable to develop
much local ownership or stakeholder participation.
Overall implementation of the project is rated as satisfactory (Para. 18). The loan
disbursed 97 percent of the funds and in spite of a difficult macro-economic climate during
most of the implementation period, the objectives of the project were largely achieved.
Summary of Findings, Key Lessons Learned and Future Operations.
The key findings from the project were that policy advice in the form of a sector
study and institutional strengthening to the ministry responsible for agriculture can show
tangible results in terms of the production and export of new crops in a relatively short
time. Key lessons learned from the implementation experience include: (i) the importance
of Borrower ownership and commitment to the project -- lacking in this case as a result of
insufficient involvement of the Borrower's institutions during project preparation (Para.
19); (ii) that the use of a credit line to stimulate private investment will have limited results
if structural and macroeconomic issues are not properly addressed (Para. 20); and (iii) the
importance of flexibility during project implementation such that work plans can be
modified to cater for changing circumstances (Para. 21). With regard to future
operations, Barbados graduated from IBRD in 1993, therefore there are no plans for a
follow on project. The Borrower, however, will continue with the main thrust of the
project and will monitor and evaluate progress and report to the Bank (Para. 22).
3   ICF discount rate was set between 2 and 4 percentage points below weighted average of commercial
banks prime rate, provided that the ICF discount rate was not lower than estimated marginal cost of
commercial banks' borrowing.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION ASSESSMENT
BARBADOS
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2782-BAR)
Introduction.
1.    The Agricultural Development Project was consistent with the Bank's
development strategy for Barbados which encouraged4 Bank support for institutional
strengthening in key sectors, one of which was agriculture. Bank's support for
institutional development in agriculture began in FY82 as part of the Technical Assistance
Project (Ln 2115-BAR) which was completed in 1985. As a result of the project the
Ministry of Agriculture Food and Fisheries (MAFF) was reorganized and strengthened
through fellowships and the provision of consultant services in extension methodology,
vegetable production, irrigation and marketing. In parallel to this project the Bank
provided support for agro-industry under the Industrial Credit Project (Ln. 2260-BAR)
signed in April 1983. US$10.5 million equivalent was provided to the Central Bank of
Barbados (CBB) for on-lending for industrial projects, including agro-industrial projects.
All funds provided by the Industrial Credit Project were committed by the end of 1986,
one year before the closing date.
Project Objectives
2.    The objectives of the project were to improve the long-term viability of Barbados'
agricultural sector and help diversify from sugar by: (i) assisting the Government to define
and implement an agricultural development strategy that is both technically feasible and
financially and economically sound, and which has an appropriate balance between the
sugar and non-sugar sectors; and (ii) to increase production of, and incomes from, non-
sugar crops. The project consisted of three parts: an agricultural sector study; technical
assistance for agricultural diversification; and agro-industrial credit. The first two parts
were managed as one component.
3.    Project objectives were clear and consistent with the strategy of the government,
which was to rationalize the sugar subsector while exploring and implementing options for
agricultural diversification. The Government expected the sugar industry to continue as a
major foreign exchange earner despite its recent poor performance. Diversification was
viewed as a complementary activity, to increase overall income from the agriculture
sector, improve Barbados' food self sufficiency and generate export earnings. The project
objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, and realistic

-2-
inasmuch as no time frame or targets were put on diversification from sugar. The project
was basically to strengthen MAFF's capabilities to cope with diversification when the need
came. In order to promote the achievement of project objectives the Borrower was
required as a condition for the loan to appoint four additional technical officers within
MAFF, and to assign the officers to carry out research on, and provide extension and
marketing services for, the production and commercialization of commodities identified as
good prospects for diversification.
4.    Project-associated risks identified at appraisal had an impact on the project. The
inherent difficulties of diversifying out of sugar in the face of strong influence from
pro-sugar interests fighting to preserve land for sugar production were certainly
experienced during implementation. (This is reported to be partly to blame for the
collapse of the sea-island cotton industry in 1989-90). Similarly "obstacles associated
with attracting private investment into non-sugar crops and agro-industries" (quoted from
the SAR) were apparent. Many sugar growers who were interested in diversifying were
unable to access credit because of their indebtedness to BSIL and BNB for sugar-related
borrowings. The risk associated with the adequacy of local and regional markets for new
products supported by the project was real for much of the implementation period when
an appreciating currency made exporting difficult and domestic economic austerity
softened demand at home. The perceived risk associated with increased prevalence of
cotton pests did not materialize due to the collapse of the cotton industry, but if the
industry recovers the risk still remains.
Achievement of Project Objectives
5.    The project was partially successful in achieving its major objectives. As a result
of the Agricultural Sector Study, which was carried out by a mixed team comprising
specialists from an international firm of consultants and MAFF staff, the Government was
able to define a development strategy for the sector, as expounded in the 1990
Agricultural Policy Paper. The paper generated lively debate in parliament. A further
sector study, financed by IDB and carried in 1992, confirmed the recommendations of the
EBRD-financed study. Both studies emphasized the need for the government to
concentrate on export oriented activities based on both sugar and non-sugar agriculture,
under reduced tariff and subsidy protection. The new policy was published in the
1994/95 Medium Term Agricultural Strategy.
6.    The second major objective, to increase production of, and incomes from,
non-sugar crops was only partially achieved during the implementation period. During
the period 1987 to 1994, national agricultural output fell in value from over B$170 million
to less than B$150 million (Figure 1), and the sector's contribution to GDP fell from 6.9
percent to 5.1. During the same period, the non-sugar sector maintained its output -- the
only sector of the economy that did not decline in output (figure 2). Although, little farm
income data were collected on which to measure the projects performance, encouraging
trends are evident in data from other sources. Trade statistics reveal that during 1988,
cotton, sweet potato and yams made up 80 percent of the value of non-sugar crop

exports. However, by 1993 the joint contribution of these three crops had fallen to below
40 percent, with exports of much higher-value crops such as sweet peppers, okra, hot
peppers and cut flowers having taken their place. (Hot peppers did not warrant a place on
the export crop list until 1991, but by 1993 the value of hot peppers exported had reached
BBD$0.65 million). This move away from low value, low technology crops towards high-
value, high-technology crops demonstrates that MAFF's efforts to transfer marketing
intelligence and production technology to growers and packaging technology to exporters
was having an impact.
7.    In financial terms the objectives of the project were met. The loan was 97 percent
disbursed at closing, albeit with a 21 month delay. In terms of the project's institutional
development objectives, technical assistance to MAFF, and through MAFF to the farming
commnunity, has been very successful. by providing training and technical assistance,
equipment and materials in support of research and extension activities carried out by
MAFF. In terms of training, the project provided 15 MAFF staff with a total of 34
person-years of long-term training in a wide range of subjects including general topics
such as tropical agriculture (15 person years) to specialist topics such as plant pathology
and meat technology. The project trained eight people to the diploma level, one person
to the degree level, four people to the masters level and one to doctorate level. In terms
of short-term training, 32 MAFF staff participated in 21 short courses totaling over 142
person weeks in CARICOM countries Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Togo, UK,
and USA. The project also provided five seminar-workshops involving a total of 144
participants on topics such as: cut-flower production and post-harvest handling, farm
management, use of tissue culture for plant multiplication and the processing of data from
the agricultural census. The project financed 17 consultancy contracts, the largest being
the sector study (15 person months). Other studies and technical assistance covered such
topics as cotton research, cut-flower production, irrigation development and credit
promotion. Fifty five farmers benefited directly from the project by receiving imported
planting stock of orchids and Anthurium lilies at concessionary prices in return for cuttings
for distribution to other farmers and use of their facilities for demonstration purposes by
MAFF officers. Large growers of cut-flower and MAFF staff participated in visits to
major markets outlets in the US and UK's Chelsea Flower Show. These promotional
events are expected to yield additional export orders for this group in the near future.
8.    The agro-industrial credit component disbursed US$2.41 million to finance 12
agri-business projects. Although implementation of this component of the project was
difficult at times, due to the generally unfavorable investment climate, all the funds
allocated for credit were disbursed at project closure. All lending was provided at market
determined, commercial rates without subsidy. Investment projects supported included
the growing of cut-flowers and herbs, the processing of chicken, fish, vegetables and
abattoir waste, and the production of syrups and potato chips. All but two of the sub-
projects were making good progress when last reviewed.

Project Sustainability
9.    The project is likely to maintain the achievements generated in relation to its major
objective of helping to improve the long-term viability of Barbados' agricultural sector and
support diversification away from sugar. The twin objectives of agricultural
diversification and increased farm incomes continue to be of major importance to MAFF,
as evidenced in their (1994/95) medium-term strategy program for the sector. The
technical assistance and training programs financed by the project have strengthened the
capacity of MAFF and direct support to many farmers involved in non-sugar agricultural
activities. This, coupled with the provision of planting material to growers has set up a
sound base for growth of the cut-flower industry in Barbados. The project has trained
MAFF staff who will be available to sustain this growth, procured vital equipment to
complete MAFF's Tissue Culture Laboratory which will provide improved cultivars of
flowering plants to growers, and provided support to the cut-flower growers organization
(FLORAPEX) in the form of a business plan for its first year of operations. The project's
initial focus on cotton provided MAFF staff with training on cotton production and
equipment for a lint quality-control laboratory. The hiatus in the cotton industry was
caused by factors outside of and beyond the control of the project The industry is being
reorganized and with marketing prospects for sea island cotton in Japan (for kimonos) the
support provided by the project should stand the cotton industry in good stead for the
future. The sustainability of the ICF credit line as a mechanism for funding agro-industrial
projects is assured in the foreseeable future as the fund is a revolving one and participating
banks take all the credit risk. For the most part, the investments financed are presently
evaluated as (all but two) a success. The Borrower intends to continue to monitor the
project using indicators included as Table 6 in the Statistical Annex of this report (Page
16).
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
10.    This section analyzes factors affecting project implementation. The CBB was
responsible for managing the line of credit for agro-industry through its ongoing ICF, and
MAFF was responsible for implementing the agricultural sector study and the institutional
strengthening component. The project was declared effective on November 17, 1987,
four months after the original effectiveness date of July 14, 1987. The project started
behind schedule. The date of loan effectiveness was extended three times, from the
original date of July 14, 1987 to October 14, 1987, then to November 14, 1987, and
finally to November 17, 1987. The extensions were requested by the Borrower and were
required because of delays by the Borrower's legal advisers in preparing the legal
certificates required to comply with Section 12.02 of the General Conditions. The loan
was closed September 30, 1995, after two extension, twenty-one months after the original
closing date of December 31, 1993.
11.   There were two factors affecting implementation which were not generally
subject to Government control: (i) a difficult external economic environment with
competing tourism and garment manufacturing industries in neighboring Caribbean



-6-
countries caused macro economic problems for Barbados during the implementation
period; (ii) entrenched sugar interests which still exert considerable influence in the
country were another factor slowing down the pace of diversification out of sugar and
influencing attitudes towards the project.
12.   There were a number of factors affecting implementation which were subject
to Government control including: (i) the unfavorable macro-economic climate which in
turn created a depressed investment climate and a lack of demand for credit in general and
specifically the project's agro-industrial line of credit. Excess liquidity in the financial
system led commnercial banks to use their own funds rather than the project's credit line.
The government's refusal to devalue the Barbados dollar, might have slowed the country's
plunge into deep recession, but it also reduced the competitiveness of locally-produced
exports for most of the project implementation period, and discouraged investment into
export oriented projects; (ii) cuts in, and strict control of, the public sector investment
program by the MFP hindered implementation during 1991-94 affecting both counterpart
funding and MAFF's access to Bank funds; (iii) Government procurement regulations
contributed to slow implementation; (iv) the high level of support in the form of grants
and subsidized credit which the Government provided to the sugar industry deterred sugar
growers from diversifying; (v) subsidized credit to parts of the non-sugar sub sector (e.g.
fruit trees and livestock) distorted farmer's incentives for planting some of the crops that
the project was promoting. (The positive impact of the cheap credit for tree crops is
apparent in the export statistics, which show a recent surge in fruit exports).
13.   Factors affecting implementation which were subject to the control of the
implementing agencies included: (i) weak coordination between the implementing
agencies, MAFF and CBB, and within MAFF, especially during the early years of the
project. At appraisal, it was assumed that MFP would coordinate the activities of the two
implementing agencies. However, in the first year of implementation, MFP requested
MAFF to take over overall management of the project. In turn, MAFF was slow in
appointing a Coordinator which caused delays in the implementation of the institutional
strengthening component (the first disbursement was not made until June 1989).
However, once appointed, MAFF's project coordinator moved to successfully implement
this component, but felt uncomfortable in the role of overall project coordinator,
considering (probably justifiably) that MAFF, and he in particular, had no authority over
the Central Bank. As a result, the operational linkages between the CBB-managed credit
line and the MAFF-managed institutional strengthening component were weak; (ii) Delays
by MAFF in appointing consultants slowed down project implementation in the early
stages. Furthermore, reluctance to allocate counterpart staff to work with technical
experts reduced the effectiveness of the support which these consultants were able to
provide. For example, there was an 18 month delay, from November 1987 to mid 1989,
before MAFF allocated counterparts to consultants recruited to promote production and
export of various crops. In addition, there was a 12 month delay (from June 1990 -May
1991) between the Borrower agreeing to appoint an agro-industry investment adviser to
promote the moribund credit line and signing a contract with a consultant; (iii) Finally,
MAFF's internal administrative systems, especially those relating to financial control,

proved deficient throughout the implementation period. A consultant was recruited to
upgrade the systems and train the users but the performance of the consultant was
unsatisfactory and the expected improvements did not materialize.
Bank Performance
14.   The Bank's overall performance is considered to have been satisfactory. The
project was prepared by the Borrower with the assistance of FAO as a technical assistance
project, to follow up an earlier Bank project. The Bank endorsed the need for TA based
on the precarious state of the sugar industry and the urgent need for agricultural
diversification. The Bank's appraisal mission identified the credit component based on a
perceived need for agro-industrial credit resulting from the early disbursement of credit
provided to the ICF by the Industrial Credit Loan (2260-BAR). However, appraisal of the
credit component appears to have been deficient due to time constraints and the late
identification of the component. The Bank failed to investigate the demand for agro-
industrial credit, assess the availability of such credit from existing sources, or review the
availability and likely impact of subsidized credit for the sugar industry and specific non-
sugar activities. Similarly, the attitude of the banks in the light of the macro-economic
situation and their liquidity were not assessed. Had appraisal of this component been done
in more depth, the need for this component would likely have been called into doubt.
Preparation and appraisal of this component which made up 61 percent of the loan is
therefore rated deficient. Concern was also raised within the Bank following appraisal,
that the agro-industrial proposals which were included in the SAR lacked adequate
preparation, but no changes were made.
15.   By agreeing to finance a project which combined two disparate components into
the one project, the Bank accepted a difficult situation, which subsequently proved hard to
manage. At negotiations it was agreed that MFP, a ministry not normally responsible for
implementing projects, would direct and coordinate the activities of the two independent
implementing agencies, CBB and MAFF. However, arrangements for coordination and
management of the project were changed during the first year of implementation when,
after an ineffectual start, MFP relinquished overall coordination of the project to MAFF,
with Bank acquiescence. On its part, MAFF was slow to appoint a project coordinator,
and it was uncomfortable working with the CBB throughout the project. It is felt that the
Bank might have anticipated this situation during appraisal and worked with the Borrower
to develop a more satisfactory outcome than the one which resulted.
16.   Although the appraisal of the credit component left much to be desired, the Bank
worked with the Government and CBB during implementation to turn this component into
the success that it deemed to have been. In May 1992, the Bank agreed to change the
formula for calculating the discount rate on ICF loans to improve the credit line's



-8 -
competitiveness.5 On July 21, 1994, the Bank agreed to further change the discount rate
formula from one linked to the commercial lending rate to one linked to the commercial
cost of funds6. The Bank also encouraged the hiring of a management consultant to help
likely clients prepare sub-project applications for review by participating banks, and later
at the Bank's suggestion, a consulting firm was hired to investigate the lack of demand for
agro-industrial credit. The Bank also demonstrated flexibility by encouraging MAFF to
switch the focus of the technical assistance component from cotton to cut-flowers.
Borrower Performance
17.   The overall performance of the borrower and implementing agencies is considered
satisfactory. However, Borrower's preparation was rated deficient due to its limited
involvement during project preparation. This may have contributed to limited
commitment to the project during the early phases of implementation. Responsibility for
this situation should be shared with FAO which could have done more to obtain the
Borrower's ownership by involving local staff to a greater degree during preparation.
Delays by MAFF in appointing consultants slowed down progress in the early stages, but
overall project implementation was rated satisfactory
Assessment of Outcome
18.   Based on an assessment on how well the project has achieved its objectives and
how sustainable it is likely to be, the project outcome is considered to be satisfactory. The
agricultural sector study defined the alternative strategies which have been incorporated in
the Government's 1994/95 medium-term sector strategy. The technical assistance
provided by the project to farmers and MAFF, exceeded appraisal forecasts in most cases.
It had a favorable impact on diversification to higher value-added crops as evidenced by
export statistics. The sustainability of these exports may be compromised if the BBDS$
continues to appreciate further than productivity gains in these product areas. Although
appraisal of the agro-industrial credit component and its justification were considered
deficient, the final result, measured by sub-project investment financed, is considered
successful.
Key Lessons Learned
19.   The first lesson learned is that external assistance for project preparation should
strive to involve as many stakeholders as possible, and that the Bank's appraisal process
5   ICF discount rate was set between 2 and 4 percentage points below weighted average of commercial
banks prime rate, provided that the ICF discount rate was not lower than estimated marginal cost of
commercial banks' borrowing.
6   ICF discount rate was to be fixed at the weighted average rate payable by commercial banks in
Barbados on interest bearing deposits in B$, plus an adjustment of not more than 2 percentage points
of such weighted average rate, in order to take into account expected changes in the average interest
rate in Barbados due to market trends.

should also be a collaborative effort with the same objective. Borrower ownership of,
and commitment to, the project is required for effective implementation. It was
noted earlier that there was a lack of local ownership of the project, especially during its
early phase. This is likely due to a lack of local participation during the project
preparation process -- often the case where a small group of outside specialists make a
brief visit to carry out a task against a tight deadline. Given such time constraints, there is
both insufficient opportunity for in-depth dialogue with stakeholders and insufficient
incentive to involve local specialists, resulting in an inadequate understanding and weak
local sponsorship of the project and its objectives.
20.   The justification for including the agro-industrial credit component has already
been questioned (Para. 14). The key lesson learnt is that project preparation and
appraisal of credit projects should include analysis of the demand for and
availability of credit and careful assessment of the attitude of the banks towards
lending project funds during unfavorable macro-economic conditions and/or
periods of excess liquidity. The Performance Audit Report of the Industrial Credit
Project (Loan 2260-BAR), dated June 30, 1994, concluded that: (i) the establishment of
the ICF was not the best means of stimulating private investment, since the prevailing
economic and structural issues were far greater constraints than the availability of credit;
and that (ii) in order for an apex credit facility to play a more meaningful development
role, it should be carefully designed and monitored to ensure that it is not merely used as a
substitute for easily available financial resources from alternative sources.
21.   Finally, flexibility during project implementation by both the Borrower and
the Bank is a prerequisite for successful implementation. Much of the success of the
project can be attributed to the flexible attitude adopted by the implementing agencies and
the Bank. An example of this is MAFF's initiative in switching the focus of the technical
assistance component from cotton to cut-flowers, a move fully endorsed by the Bank.
Similarly, the rate of disbursement from the line of credit was linked to the CBB's
initiatives to persuade the Bank (on two occasions) to adjust the formula for the discount
rate, so that the funds were competitive with commercially available credit.
Future Operations
22.   Barbados graduated from IBRD in 1993, therefore there are no plans for a follow
on project. However, the Borrower intends to continue the mainstream activities of the
project using its own resources and financing from other sources. The CBB and MAFF
intend to make annual assessments of project impact and to inform the Bank of the
outcome.

BARBADOS - Agricultural Development Project
(Loan 2782-BAR)
AIDE MEMOIRE
1.   A World Bank Mission. comprising Mrs. Sandra Joss. visited  Barbados
during June 30 - July 4. 1994 to review implementation of the above project.
This aide memoire represents the main findings and observations of the mission
which are subject to review and comment by World Bank management.
2.   The mission met with Mr. Martin Cox. and Ms. June Simpson-Clarke of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs. Mr. Ian  Collymore of the Central Bank  of
Barbados/Industrial Credit Fund (CBB/ICF). and Mr. Emerson Beckles. ADP
Coordinator. Mr. Ethelbert Haynes. and Mr. Lucas. Planning Unit. Ministry of
Agriculture. Food and Fisheries (MAFF . The mission did a field-tr-i-p-to meet with
farmers who were involved in cut-flower production (anthuriums) and to see the
newly established tissue-culture laboratory.
3.   The mission would like to thank the Government for the assistance provided
to the mission bv staff.
Technical Assistance and Associated Inputs Component
4.    The mission reviewed progress of this component with Mr. Emerson Beckles.
Mr. Ethelbert Havnes, and Mr. Lucas. of MAFF.
(i) Technical Assistance. This subcomponent provides for research on. and
provision of extension and marketing services for, the production and
commercialization of commodities identified as good prospects for diversification
of the agricultural sector. Progress on the activities follows:
Development of production systems for cut flowers is continuing. The MAFF
is holdin2 a workshop on growing anthuriums and orchids on July 7-9.
1994. A good deal of interest (over 40 farmers) has been expressed in the
workshop. which is designed to facilitate the sharing of experiences and
provide hands-on training. Irrigation Studies are ongoing. A committee
is to develop terms of reference for consultants for the Three Houses
Spring project shortly.  No work has started  yet on the Water Rates
Study, but this study is expected to be undertaken before the project
closes December 31. 1994. Export promotion is continuing. There has been
financial support (BS10.000) to the Barbados Horticultural Societv to have
two persons participate in the Chelsea Flower Show. A promotional visit
was undertaken by Florapex. with participants from the MAFF and Fintrac.
The group visited flower markets in the eastern United States and the
Philadelphia Flower Show March 6-11. 1994. A promotional visit (orchids)
is planned for Italy before the loan closes. On-farm demonstrations are
continuing. To date. over 30.000 anthurium plants have been distributed
among 18 farmers in amounts varying from 1.000 to 4.500. The first batch
of plants arrived from Holland in November 1993. Another 4.300 plants are
due on week of Julv 4. 1994. In all. 10 varieties were imported. Most of
the farmers are doing very well and are presently selling flowers on the
local market - supermarkets. florists. and hotels. During the field trip.
farmers indicated that it was difficult to meet the increasing local demand
for anthuriums. It is expected that additional plantlets for anthuriums and
orchids will be imported before the loan closes.

(ii) Training and Procurement.  This subcomponent provides for training for
MAFF personnel and acquisition and utilization of vehicles. equipment and
materials to enhance MAFF's capabilities for purposes of Part B.1 of the project.
Progress on the activities follows:
For training, three persons Cone from the private sector. two from
Government) have benefitted from a Farm Management Course at the
University of Missouri. U.S.A. In addition. one person attended a tissue-
culture workshop in Jamaica.
All the  equipment has arrived  for  the  tissue  culture  laboratory.
Installation and start-up of operations should take place in early July 1994.
5.   It has been agreed with MAFF to forward to the Bank by July 31. 1994
a revised implementation plan and budget (showing breakdown for sources of
funding) for the remainins period of the project. i.e. to December 31. 1994. This
information is also required for the Implementation Completion Report.
Agro-Industrial Credit Component
6.    The mission reviewed with Mr. Ian Collymore of the Central Bank of
Barbados/Industrial Credit Fund (CBB/ICF):  (a) progress under Phase I of the
consultancy to identify and prepare agro-industrial subprojects for commitment
by financial institutions under the project:  (b) progress of previous sub-loans
(in implementation):  (c) the CBB's proposal of June 27. 1994 to modify the
formula for determining the ICF discount rate. i.e. the ICF discount rate shall be
fixed at the weighted averaze rate payable bv commercial banks in Barbados on
interest bearing deposits: and (d) issues related to achieving full disbursement
of the credit line before project closing date of December 31. 1994.
7.    The mission noted that Phase I of the consultancy is virtually completed.
Six teams. under the consultancy. are preparing the subprojects for submission
to funding agencies.  Some delays have been experienced because of other
obligations of subproject applicants or issues arising from external factors which
have to be resolved before proceeding further. Nevertheless. it appears that the
major hurdles have been passed on the majority of the projects. The CBB/ICF
considers the performance of the consultancy to date has been satisfactory. A
solid list of nine subprojects has been identified and requests for funding are
expected in the comina week.  Loan funds for the identified subprojects are
expected to be disbursed during the period end July/end August. 1994.
8.    A status report. prepared by the consultancy. of June 23. 1994 (attached).
indicates that at this time approximately 83% of remaining loan funds under Part
C of the project would be utilized (USS1.000.000). CBB/ICF intends to work to
fully utilize the loan funds within the remaining time. i.e. commitment before
September 30. 1994.
9.    The attached status report also indicates progress of previous sub-loans
(in implementation) in terms of loan payments.  Subloans under implementation
amount to approximately USS1.36 million.  It has been agreed with CBB/ICF to
include an impact assessment of those completed sub-loans for inclusion in the
Implementation Completion Report to be prepared by the Government and CBB/ICF.
Such assessment would include changes in foreign exchange earnings. employment
levels. and production levels.

10.   The Bank has no objection to the proposal (outlined in phra. f) (c) above)
submitted by the CBB/ICF. contingent on a solid pipeline of subprojects to be
processed before the commitment closing date of September 30. 1994. Based on
the consul:ancy status report of June 23. 1994 and  discussions with  Mr.
Collymore. the mission's view is that the pipeline of subprojects appears to be
solid.  An initial review  by the legal department in the Bank indicates that a
formal amendment would be required. It has been agreed that formal notification
of the Bank's no objection to the CBB/ICF proposal. subject to an amendment if
required. would be forwarded to the CBB/ICF at the earliest.
Project Coordination
11.   Project coordination is critical for the remaining months of the project
because of project acTivities still to be accomplished prior to projmect closing on
December 31. 1994.  The MAFF  has undertaken to ensure adequate  project
coordination will take place until loan closing. i.e. December 31. 1994. It has been
agreed that the Project Coordinator will continue to keep Mr. Ethelbert Haynes
briefed on the project to ensure continuity. The Project Coordinator would have
the responsibility for preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.
Disbursements
12.   Of the  loan  amount of USS4.0  million. USS2.633.113  (66%') has  been
disbursed. as of June 22. 1994.  The remaining loan funds (USS1.366.8S8) are
expected to be fully utilized by loan closing (December 31. i994) as follows:
Goods for Part A of project                USS   89.913
Consultants' services for Parts A.B.
overseas fellowships. export
promotion under Part B                     USS  100.000
Subloans under Part C of project           USS1.17b.974
Audit Report
13.   The audit report for the fiscal year ending December 31. 1993 is expected
by mid July. 1994 ICBB/ICF) and the audit report for fiscal year ending March
31. 1994 is expected by September 30. 1994 (MAFF).
Implementation Completion Report (previously Project Completion Report)
14.   The mission  discussed  vith  the Government the new  guidelines  and
procedures for preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (1CR). The
proposed timeframe for preparing the report was discussed. It was agreed that
the Borrower would forward to the Bank their report by approximately
March/April 1995. Such report would include assessments (as detailed in the
guidelines. left by the mission with MAFF) of Parts A. B. and C of the project.
An Evaluation Summary would be included in the report. ln advance of the
Bank's implementation completion mission an Issues Paper would be forwarded by
the Bank to the Borrower and implementing agencies seeking their reactions and
confirming   timing   of  the   ICR   mission   (tentatively   scheduled   for
November/December 1994)

Borrower's Evaluation Summary
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Ln. 2782-BAR)
BARBADOS
Introduction.
The total cost of the project was US$5.84 million and the loan component
being US$4.0 million (69 percent). The loan included a credit component of
US$2.4 million and a TA component of US$1.6 million which included an
agricultural sector study, consultant services, training, purchase of vehicles,
laboratory equipment, and inputs for demonstrations. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (now the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development) was responsible for the TA component and the Central Bank of
Barbados for the credit component.
Project Objectives
The Agricultural Development Project sought to improve the long term
viability of Barbados' agriculture sector and diversify it away from sugar by:
(i) assisting the Government to define and implement an agricultural
development strategy which would be technically feasible and financially and
economically sound, and have an appropriate balance between the sugar and
non-sugar sectors, and; (ii) increasing the production of and income from
non-sugar crops. The objectives were to be achieved through the conduct of an
agricultural sector study; the strengthening of research, extension and marketing
services and the provision of credit for agro-industries to develop non-sugar
crops.
The project objectives were clear, realistic and of major importance to the
agricultural sector and the economy (Para. 2.1). At the time of project
formulation, there was a major need the need to formulate new policy and for a
programme to tackle the crisis which existed in the sugar industry. Risks
identified in the SAR were borne out during implementation, however the risk
associated with the deterioration of the Barbados economy project was
unforeseen at the time of formulation. This impacted negatively both on the
investment climate and project implementation.
Achievement of Project Objectives.
Although the project activities were successfully implemented the project
objectives were only partially achieved (Para. 2.2). While the project assisted in
defining a strategy for the agricultural sector it made little contribution towards



-35-
B2
implementing the strategy, which focussed on revitalizing the sugar industry.
Successful impact of the project can be seen in cotton, onions and cut-flower
production.
Implementation
Project implementation was satisfactory -95 percent of the TA funds and
100 percent of the credit funds were dispersed. However, it was necessary to
extend the closing date of the loan because of slow disbursement Para. 2.3).
Local contributions towards project costs are underestimated because of
inadequate accounting. Activities implemented include:
Seventeen consultancies providing 82 person months of expertise.
Twenty-one short training courses, 15 long-term training programmes,
and five seminar/workshops
Purchase of equipment and materials.
Disbursement of credit for agro-industry.
Several factors affected project implementation: Factors not Subject to
Government Control included: (i) a general lack of confidence in the prevailing
economic situation; (ii) high indebtedness of cane farmers which restricted their
ability to borrow for diversification; (iii) unfavorable external market environment:
(iv) high liquidity in banking system; (v) weak support for project by private
groups, e.g. BSIL. Factors Subject to Government Control included: (i) high
liquidity of commercial banks; (ii) high interest rate of ICF funds; (iii) weak
national project coordination; (iv) deficiencies in government budgeting,
financing and procurement systems. Factors Subject to the Control of the
Implementing Agencies included: (i) absence of on-going credit promotion by
CBB; (ii) inadequate project review/evaluation systems; (iii) inadequate
accounting system; (iv) lack of full-time project coordinator; (v) inefficient project
information storage/retrieval systems; (vi) weak mechanisms to implement TA
recommendations: (vii) absence of operational linkage between TA and credit
components of project.
Project Sustainability.
Benefits generated by the TA component are likely to be sustainable.
The project trained a large number of MAFF technical and administrative staff,
and the cut-flower industry was supported to take-off point through training and
the provision of planting material (Para. 2.4). The sustainability of the credit line
is likely due to its revolving nature, however, on-going promotion, monitoring and
evaluation would be required to assure this.



-36-
B3
Bank Performance
The performance of the Bank is rated as highly satisfactory (Para. 2.5).
Bank staff were very involved from identification through implementation, and
were very understanding of the local situation.
Borrower Performance
The implementing agencies of the Borrower performed satisfactory
despite the need to extend the closing date of the project twice to fully
implement. The unfavorable economic climate, the inadequacy of government's
administrative systems, and the lack of a full-time project coordinator are cited
as factors affecting the Borrower's performance (Para. 2.6).
Assessment of Outcome
The outcome of the project is considered satisfactory. Technical staff of
MAFF and other organizations, farmers and investors gained from the project
(Para. 2.7).
Future Monitoring
A series of indicators have been identified for the future monitoring and
evaluation of future project activities (Para. 2.8). An annual assessment by
MAFF and CBB is proposed and a report will be submitted to the Bank.
Key Lessons Learned
Lessons learned from the formulation and implementation of the project
(Para. 2.9) include:
*    Successful project implementation is dependent on the amount of human
resources invested in management/coordination.
*    MAFF underestimates the planning, organizing and administrative
requirements for successful project implementation.
*    Mechanisms are required to enable implementation of TA
recommendations.
*    Effective project management requires up to date administrative systems.
*    The project lacked a manager with authority and accountability.



-37-
B4
*    Flexibility during implementation resulted in a successful project, and
should be built into all projects
*    Future loans should permit CBB to make on the spot adjustments to
lending rates and project documentation requirements.
*    Projects which involve more than one implementing agency require formal
linkages to facilitate coordination.
*    Ongoing promotion and monitoring of the credit line should be provided.
